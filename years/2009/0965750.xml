<AbstractNarration>This project is providing need-based scholarships over a five-year span to 20 students who enter engineering degree programs in the area of sustainable energy at the University of Connecticut.  Students are recruited from vocational high schools based on student scholastic aptitude, financial need, status as a member of an underrepresented population or the first family member to attend college, and interest in sustainable energy.  Student activities include pre-college immersive review of math and science subjects; dedicated enrichment and community-building activities such as workshops, mentoring, industry site visits, and internships; and advising, tutoring and job placement assistance.  The project offers a novel pipeline for enriching the engineering workforce with a nontraditional, technically adept, diverse population.  An independent evaluator is involved in project evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Connecticut (UConn) Scholarship in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) project, "First-in-Family" Energy Scholarships for Tech School Graduates (FIFE), supports graduates from Connecticut technical high school who matriculate into the School of Engineering (SoE), and identifies others at UConn who intend to matriculate.  FIFE emphasizes recruitment of minority students and women who are the first in their family to attend college. Scholars are recruited through direct contact during high school in through a GK-12 fellow or teacher that participated in the RET program, by invitation once they are admitted to UConn, and through identification as participants in summer BRIDGE programs at UConn. Students are offered scholarships of up to $6,500 per year and receive additional in-kind support from the SoE in the form of tuition and room and board for the summer Bridge program. FIFE scholars take advantage of UConn and SoE support offerings and individualized mentoring and advising provided by the FIFE project through graduate student mentors (from either the National Science Foundation?s (NSF) Graduate STEM Fellows in K-12 Education (GK-12) project or Bridge to the Doctorate LSAMP and FIFE project leaders.The program provides an opportunity to understand the challenges and merits of admitting these technical high school students into the engineering curricula, while also allowing the opportunity to test the parameters for what types of guidance and activities are critical for improving student retention and success in STEM fields.  Participants: FIFE S-STEM Scholars  The program supported 36 students which 26 were males and 10 females all first in their families attending college. The ethnicity of the scholars were 20 whites, 10 Hispanics, 5 African Americans, and one mixed race. 15 have  graduated with engineering degrees, and 7 are expected to graduate in 2018-2019.  Mentoring   A key component of the FIFE S-STEM program is the mentoring.The topic most important to discuss, both with their Mentors and program manager, is information on how to get an internship /research position.  With Mentors, after internships, the next most important topics Scholars discussed tended to be academic related &ndash; including getting help with homework/classes, ways to improve study skills, and how to manage time.  With Program Manager, topics to discuss are more prospective and activity based, such as which extra-curricular activities to participate in, scholarship/grant/fellowship opportunities, and how to succeed as an engineering student and prepare for a career in engineering.   Financial Aid,  Work/Internship Opportunities  Over the years, 81% of Scholars held a job, internship, or research position related to their major. When asked why they chose to work while also studying, most stated they work to cover daily expenses such as eating.  The next most prevalent reason includes getting work/research experience for about 55% of the Scholars.  Finally, about 40% of Scholars state they work to help support their family, as well as to cover room and board.  The FIFE S-STEM financial aid does mitigate some of this income need.  When asked specifically if the financial assistance from the FIFE S-STEM scholarship helps reduce your need to hold a job while studying, reduce the number of jobs you need to hold, or reduce the hours you need to work while studying, 55% of Scholars said yes, while another 15% said perhaps.  In fact, 37% of Scholars said they would not have been able to pursue engineering without the FIFE S-STEM financial aid, and another 54% said perhaps.   Impacts  Mentors in aggregate felt that a majority of the Scholars were from the start very motivated to attend classes and complete assignments, and as such the drive to succeed was there.  This is significant given a purpose of the FIFE S-STEM program is to test the feasibility of creating a pipeline from technical high schools into engineering programs.  However, the Scholars were not as forthcoming in seeking out help from others, including TAs, professors, and even other engineering students.  As far as academic preparation goes, Mentors felt Scholars were decently prepared in communication skills.  Other than that, the majority of Mentors felt that the Scholars they were assigned were between somewhat and poorly prepared for the challenges of the UConn engineering program.  Scholars fared the worst in mathematical preparation and writing skills.  And Scholars were found to be lacking in study skills, time-management skills, and exam-taking skills. Mentors reported increased confidence and academic wherewithal in Scholars as they progressed in the program.  In fact, by the end of the program, Mentors stated the majority of Scholars no longer needed further improvement in mathematical and writing skills.   Conclusion  This program found that technical high school students do not lack in their drive and motivation to pursue engineering.  we have shown these students succeed at rigorous engineering programs with continuous mentoring and academic guidance, in combination with financial aid and work opportunities, these students have succeeded spectacularly.
