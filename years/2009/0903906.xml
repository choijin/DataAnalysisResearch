<AbstractNarration>This award is made in response to a proposal submitted to and reviewed under the NSF/DoE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering joint solicitation NSF 08-589. The award provides funds to support student travel to conferences and  undergraduate participation in the overall research effort, which is being funded separately by the DoE under contract to MIT (Grant DE-FG02-06ER54891)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research supports deployment and development of SCEPTIC and related codes to address fundamental plasma problems. The SCEPTIC code, a particle-in-cell code, three-dimensional in ion-velocity distribution and space, was designed to compute solutions to one of the most fundamental problems in plasma physics: the interaction of a flowing plasma with an absorbing object. Specifically, (1) further exploration of the effects of flow in 3-D plasmas of arbitrary degree of magnetization, which promises to offer a first-principles understanding of probes and dust interaction in typical plasmas where turbulence dominates cross-field transport; (2) inclusion of additional particle species, such as refluxing neutrals; (3) calculations of interactions with cylindrical objects, since cylindrical geometry is widely used for probes; (4) comparison of the specialized coordinate code results with more general coordinate codes to establish the level of accuracy of the latter and to explore problems that they are well suited to, such as the vexed question of the plasma wake, and the problems of multiple dust-grain interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activity will include the education of a graduate student, the distribution of the improved SCEPTIC code for free use by other researchers, and for educational purposes, and the publication of important fundamental results from it. Note that dusty plasma research is frequently undertaken in institutions that have only modest financial resources, including many developing countries, and this work will help connect those institutions and researchers to the wider plasma field.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support of undergraduate participation adds a broader educational impact through the early-year training of students by introducing them to scientific research as a possible career path.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Subsonic and supersonic wakes in plasmas  The wake behind an object such as a spacecraft, meteorite, or dust particle moving through a plasma has been simulated using a new high-performance code developed by Professor Ian Hutchinson of MIT. By computing the motion of hundreds of millions of individual ions, he calculates with high-fidelity the non-linear waves trailing the object. The result looks remarkably like water waves, but in three dimensions instead of two.  Wake effects determine the imprint of satelites on the plasma in low earth orbit, and the interaction of the moon with the solar wind, as well as the interactions between dust particles in plasma surface processing environments like chip manufacturing machines.  Plasma wakes are complex potential structures involving cone-shaped wave-fronts. They are related to the sonic ``boom" of a supersonic aircraft in air, but in the plasma case the hot ionized medium supports waves that travel at a much higher speed. The physical mechanism of the plasma waves is the electric field generated by electron density variations. The object need not be supersonic to emit the cone-shaped wave-front. The nonlinear saturation of the magnitude of the waves in the wake has been quantitively calculated for the first time.  A two-dimensional slice through the three-dimensional plasma potential structure (color contours and height) shows the deep well at the object, a peak, and then the conical (v-shaped) wave structures trailing it.  These calculations help us to understand how dust particles float in semiconductor processing plasmas (for example) and how they interact with one another to form regular crystal-like structures.
