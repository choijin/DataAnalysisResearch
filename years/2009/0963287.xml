<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel expenses for U.S. participants in the international workshop "Analysis on Graphs and its Applications Follow-up Meeting," to be held at the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge, UK, on 26-30 July 2010.  This workshop is the planned follow-up meeting for the semester-long international program "Analysis on Graphs and its Applications" held in the same venue in 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Substantial recent progress in spectral theory of combinatorial graphs, quantum graphs, and analysis on fractals makes a follow-on conference highly desirable.  This meeting will assemble a diverse group of experts, young researchers, and students working in the quickly-developing interdisciplinary field of applications of analysis on graphs to mathematical physics, nanotechnology, microelectronics, chemistry, materials science, photonics, number theory, discrete groups, and fractals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://www.newton.ac.uk/programmes/AGA/agaw06.html</AbstractNarration>

The meeting gathered researchers from 18 countries:  Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and USA. Along with leading experts (including Fellows of Royal Society and members of National Academy of Sciences),  quite a few junior researchers and students have taken part.  The USA was presented by seven PhD students, one postdoc, three junor researchers, and eleven senior faculty members.  They represented fourteen universities from eleven states of the USA.  Two PhD students, one postdoc, two junior faculty and six senior faculty presented talks (including one of the four keynote lectures). All USA participants, except Prof. G.
