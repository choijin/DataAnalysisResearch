<AbstractNarration>Cave-adapted organisms are characterized by their specialized biology and limited geographical distributions. Their uniqueness has made them conservation priorities, especially in the Southwestern United States, where rapid development threatens cave habitat. Arachnids are among the most diverse organisms in caves and are a primary conservation concern in Texas where eleven species are listed under the Endangered Species Act. Unfortunately, the taxonomy for these groups is outdated and prevents an accurate assessment of conservation priority. Recent advances in systematic biology provide new tools that can be used by taxonomists to help resolve these difficulties and provide insight into the evolution of cave organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on Neoleptoneta, a diverse group of spiders restricted to caves and soil habitats in Southwestern North America where two species, Neoleptoneta microps and N. myopica, are federally recognized as endangered. Preliminary data show that several species, including the endangered Neoleptoneta myopica, are more broadly distributed than believed and suggest that caves are linked into larger subterranean networks. A combination of morphological, molecular, and geological evidence will be used to refine the species limits within Neoleptoneta and ascertain the degree of connectivity between caves. The study will contribute to a better understanding of the biogeography and conservation of cave invertebrates in Texas and test fundamental assumptions about the evolution of cave life. In addition to the graduate student trained as part of this work, the project will train two undergraduate students and contribute to exhibits at the California Academy of Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
