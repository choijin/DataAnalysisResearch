<AbstractNarration>In this investigation, an innovative and corrosion free decked bulb-T beam bridge system will be studied. The new side-by-side decked bulb-T beam bridge system consists of (a) decked bulb-T beams prestressed and reinforced with non-corrosive strands (carbon fiber reinforced polymer, CFRP), (b) integral transverse diaphragms post-tensioned with unbonded CFRP, and (c) an integral wearing surface. This investigation consists of a number of phases that will be carried out on four full-scale decked bulb-T beams and on one bridge model. Service load, cracking load and ultimate load carrying capacity of the new beams will be determined. Finally, the developed decked bulb-T beam bridge system will be tested and evaluated. A comprehensive finite element analysis will be conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of newly developed CFRP with high strength concrete in the decked bulb-T beam bridge system will enhance its capacity, durability, and life-span as well as reduce the cost of maintenance. Introduction of this innovative bridge system will deliver a cost-effective infrastructure system to meet America?s present and future needs. Interaction with composite and construction industries as well as with state engineers and concrete precasters will be a significant benefit to the highway bridge industry and to LTU students. This project requires multidisciplinary research, in new materials, structural engineering, instrumentation, load analysis, computer simulation and construction and bridge economics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research team at Lawrence Tech University conducted significant level of theoretical and experimental research investigation addressing the development of unique and corrosion-free highway bridge system that requires minimum maintenance. This new highway bridge system only uses Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) without the traditional conventional corrosive steel components.  The Lawrence Tech research team has published three journal papers and three international conference papers addressing the findings of the research investigation. In one of these conference papers that was held in Australia, Lawrence Tech research team paper  received the Best Paper Award.  This research findings were deployed in two highway bridges (M-102) in MI,. Furthermore, the results were deployed in Kittery Highway Bridge in Maine. In addition, the findings were integrated in Aaron Creek Bridge in VA. Furthermore, the findings were shared with other DOTs for potential deployments in future bridges in their states.  The shown images address the completed testing of one-half scale bridge model using CFRP strands, rebars, and stirrups. Also, the other images show, the construction of prestressed concrete beams that were used in the construction of the two bridges constructed over M-102 highway in Michigan.  Deployment of the results of this investigation in our infrastructure will save the taxpayers money and will improve the life cycle cost of the US infrastructure. Furthermore, the implementation of these research findings with this new materials such as the CFRP coupled with the Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) will significantly reduce the traffic delay on highway due to the continuous repair needed for typical and conventional bridges.  Several DOTs such as MNDOT, IDOT, MEDOT, VDOT, ODOT, ORDOT, etc. have visited the Center of Innovative Materials Research (CIMR) at Lawrence Tech to examine the new bridge system and witnessed the tests of the developed bridge system. Furthermore, high schools students have visited and witnessed the conducted tests during the duration of this investigation. These visits attracted them to be more interested in engineering and science.       Last Modified: 08/19/2015       Submitted by: Nabil F Grace]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
