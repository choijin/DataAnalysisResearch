<AbstractNarration>The U.S. mathematical and physical sciences communities are represented by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in seven international scientific unions: the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the International Radio Science Union (URSI), the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), the International Commission for Optics (ICO), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr), and the International Mathematical Union (IMU). U.S. National Committees (USNCs), staffed by the NAS, coordinate U.S. preparations for meetings of the corresponding international unions and for scientific conferences, symposia, and workshops organized by these unions to identify research topics, issues, and programs of interest to their specific disciplines; identify and support U.S. scientists to participate in union activities; and arrange for payment of U.S. dues to the seven unions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is demonstrated through activities related to the utilization of knowledge for the achievement of social goals, establishing nomenclature and standards, participating in the governance of the seven international unions, and advancing knowledge and understanding across the research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similarly, the broader impacts of this project manifest themselves through activities that promote teaching, training, and learning, that promote the growth of and diversity in the national and international workforce, and that help shape the international dialogue in the respective disciplinary areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ U.S. representation in international scientific organizations has been a responsibility of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) for many years, and the organizations regard it as a service to the global scientific community. Through involvement with the international unions, the U.S. scientific community is able to participate in standard-setting, nomenclature decisions, research, education, and other activities that advance national interests and global priorities.  This grant furthered the U.S. participation in six international scientific organizations:     International Astronomical Union (IAU),   International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), International Union of Crystallography (IUCr),  International Mathematical Union (IMU),  International Commission for Optics (ICO), and  International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP).        The NAS is the official U.S. member of each of these, and carries out its membership role through U.S. national committees (USNCs).  Member responsibilities include paying dues, helping plan union programs, and providing leadership.  The NAS and its USNCs for these six unions have done that.  Additional activities undertaken by the USNCs include:     USNC/Astronomy  Working closely together, the USNC/Astronomy and the American Astronomical Society won the bid to host the 2015 IAU General Assembly in Hawaii.  As a result, thousands of international astronomers will come to this country.  The meeting also will facilitate the attendance of U.S. astronomers.  Preparations for this meeting are underway.  The USNC/Astronomy sponsored the popular Young Astronomers and Women in Astronomy lunches at the 2012 IAU General Assembly in China.  Both provided an opportunity for astronomers to explore issues across national boundaries and have led to ongoing dialogues.  Each event drew approximately 250 participants.         USNC/Chemistry  The USNC/Chemistry works closely with IUPAC to provide professional development opportunities for early- to mid-career chemists interested in participating in the global research enterprise. The USNC supported U.S. Young Observers at the 2013 IUPAC General Assembly, and they were invited by the IUPAC leadership to participate in the unionÆs strategic planning process. IUPAC is responsible for setting the Periodic Table of the Elements.  At the 2013 IUPAC General Assembly, U.S. delegates helped approve recommended changes to the standard atomic weights of 19 chemical elements.  The changes were the result of cooperative research supported by the U.S. Geological Survey, IUPAC, IUPAP, and others.      USNC/Crystallography  The USNC/Crystallography places a strong emphasis on education. In July 2012, the USNC organized a workshop for high school teachers titled "Crystallography: World of Wonder." The goal was to equip high school teachers with materials and knowledge that would allow them to introduce basic topics and experiments related to crystallography to their students.  Each summer, the USNC also sponsors an intensive ten-day course open to graduate and top undergraduate students. The USNC/Crystallography committee regularly monitors various databases used by U.S. crystallographers, and takes action when problems arise.    USNC/Mathematics  The USNC/Mathematics strongly supports the workforce      development and capacity building efforts of the IMU.  The committee has a very dynamic Volunteer      Lecturer Program (VLP) that provides U.S. volunteer mathematicians with      the opportunity to give intensive month-long courses at universities in      the developing world, thus fostering      collaboration between the mathematical communities of the developed and      developing world.  While the program initially focused on Cambodia, the      VLP has now expanded to include Central America and Africa.         USNC/Optics  The USNC/Optics played a key role in the NRC report Optics and Photonics: Essential Tech...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
