    <AbstractNarration>This award is for partial funding US participation in an International Conference on Several Complex Variables, Complex Geometry and Partial Differential Equations to take place in Wuhan University, China, during the period of July 6-10, 2009. The main topics of the conference will be on the algebraic, analytic and geometric methods in Several Complex Variables which are among the most vital areas in pure mathematics. These areas also have profound connections with many other branches of mathematics such as classical analysis and dynamics, algebraic geometry, partial differential equations, differential geometry, modern theoretical physics, symplectic geometry, etc. The conference intends to provide opportunities for easy exchange of ideas and recent developments among experts. More importantly, it will give PhD students and junior scholars the opportunity to meet leading mathematicians in their areas of interest. This will help them to be familiar with unsolved problems and new research directions, and thus promote their future career development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will be used to partially support 10 plenary speakers from the US and 11 students and young investigators.</AbstractNarration>
