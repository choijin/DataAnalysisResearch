<AbstractNarration>The Partnership consisting of nine Silicon Valley school districts and San Jose State University's (SJSU) Colleges of Engineering and Education is taking a regional approach to improving science education by building institutional capacity, instructional quality, and student achievement in a major urban region.  &lt;br/&gt;Sustainable institutional changes are created to support high quality science education.  Science teaching and learning, grades K-8, is improved through a continuum of university preservice preparation, new teacher induction, on-going inservice and leadership development for over 1300 preservice students and inservice teachers.  Establishing a career spanning professional development model, which includes rich content and methodology workshops, provided by regional leaders for professional development, retains a pool of well-prepared K-8 science teachers. &lt;br/&gt;Elementary and middle school students experience exemplary inquiry and laboratory-based lessons linked appropriately to math, literacy, and technology resulting in higher achievement. &lt;br/&gt;Engineering faculty devote time as consultants in middle schools.  While they contribute scholarship and content background they also learn by viewing the variety of teaching strategies that serve diverse student needs.   Undergraduate engineering education is improved through close collaboration between engineers and teachers. &lt;br/&gt;Preservice instruction at San Jose State University is improved with the development of a new MA degree in Elementary Education with a focus on science, which should be readily transportable. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Final Report for the Partnership for Student Success in Science Project &ndash; Including the Noyce Master Teacher Supplement     Kurt McMullin, Principal Investigator, San Jose  State University  Jan Hustler, Project Director, and Nancy Thomas, Project Co-Principal Investigator        The Partnership:  The Partnership consisting of nine Silicon Valley school districts, San Jose State  University's (SJSU) Colleges of Engineering and Education, and two local industry sponsors is taking a regional approach to improving science education by building institutional capacity, instructional quality, and student achievement.     Project success is monitored by independent review of professional development quality; in-class observation of teacher skills; surveys of teachers and administrators for feedback on success of professional development, site-based collaboration, and teacher-perceived challenges and accomplishments; testing of teachers for content expertise; and performance of students on both state-wide and project-developed standardized tests.     The Professional Development Model     Sustainable institutional changes are created to provide support for high quality science education.  Active involvement of district administrators is developed by having a working Advisory Council of district administrators from each participating partner.  Working with the Project Management team, they coordinate project and district goals,  ensure district level support for materials refurbishment, and maintain high visibility of how the project goals align with overall district plans.   Involvement with school principals is seen to be a key alliance for success.  Principal involvement is developed by including principals at annual workshops and updates on work through site-based lead teachers.     Student achievement, particularly with the goal of decreasing the achievement gap, is monitored by discussion with teachers, classroom observation and review of performance on standardized tests.  A focus on the use of inquiry as a means to support differentiated instruction is key to adapting science standards to usable instruction.        Teacher Feedback about Professional Development     The comments for the different sessions paralleled the survey responses.       You used every minute!! No wasted time, no fluffy stuff. Appreciated! PS3 was the most useful. Great mixture of background, detail, classroom application, field trips, notebook activities. Scientist is a great presenter.     PS3 exposed me to new classroom methods and applications. It energizes my outlook on how to reach certain groups of students.     I had a good experience overall. It was difficult at the beginning but as the time wore on my understanding increased. I thought of the labs the kids can do, and now I understand the concepts behind them. The use of whiteboards really opened my eyes. They will be used a lot in class this year. As always the chance to talk to other teachers confirms is always a way to improve teaching. I had a good time this week thanks to excellent instruction.            Key Elements     Based upon the projects past work, review of published research and personal experience, the following are designated as key elements for a project of this type to succeed:  Highly      motivated, visionary Project Director with commitment to project success.  It is critical that this person have      sufficient time and resources to build alliances, communicate project      work, coordinate meetings, and review project success.  The authors believe that one of the      prime reasons for the success of the project was the abilities of the      Project Director combined with the resources to have her full-time      employment assigned to this project. Content      Resource Teachers to design and deliver professional development through      formal workshops, one-on-one mentoring, and collaborative team support.
