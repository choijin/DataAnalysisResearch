<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Geoffrey Strouse and Albert Stiegman of Florida State University will develop oxygen atom transfer agents that absorb microwave radiation.  With the help of computational methods the PIs will estimate the microwave absorption cross section for a range of compounds, and then prepare and examine them in test chemical reactions.  Promising reagents will then be used in the synthesis of metal oxide nanophase materials, and for this project the PIs will target zirconium oxide, zinc oxide and gallium oxide.  This method could potentially enable unprecedented control over nanocrystal growth that would have transformative impacts on nanomaterials related applications.  The PIs will also continue to promote research experiences for undergraduate students and will bring high school students to his laboratory to gain research experience as interns.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of the proposal was the development of microwave chemistry for applications in nanoscience, catalysis, and energy.  The funding allowed the development of new synthetic routes for sustainable production of phosphors and magnetic materials for energy focused applications.  In addition the development of catalysts and catalytic reaction routes that are enhanced by coupling to the microwave field was demonstrated.  The proposal had three specific aims: 1) understanding the Microwave (MW) effect, 2) design of molecular agents that exhibit selective microwave (MW) absorption to enhance the reproducible synthesis of nanomaterials, and 3) selective microwave heating for enhancing catalytic reactions on heterogeneous catalysts. During the funding cycle the goals were met.  Intellectual Merit. In microwave chemistry, the rate of heating is dependent on the magnitude of the ground state dipole moment of the reactants, products, and solvent. The MW energy will be absorbed by the reaction component with the largest MW cross section.  The fundamentals of MW absorption have led to breakthrough science in catalysis, phosphors, and magnetic materials for energy applications.  Notably, the catalytic studies have shown magnetic spinels and carbon can be selectively heated to enhance catalytic reaction rates by several orders of magnitude. In coal gasification studies, the carbon is a particularly strong microwave absorber, which heats primarily through permittivity loss processes associated with space-charge (Maxwell-Wagner) interfacial processes.  Our hypothesis was that microwave-driven gasification might yield a significant savings in energy.  In a similar approach MW reaction in non absorbing solvents can be carried out using MW absorbing reactants to provide exquisite control over formation of magnetic, metallic semiconducting, and insulating nanoparticles.  By controlling the competition between dielectric heating, ionic heating, and coupling to the magnetic field of growing nanomagents the reaction growth behavior can be controlled. In fact, the control of the reaction allowed the first experimental demonstration of OstwaldÆs rule of stages. The technology was demonstrated to be highly scalable, use green reactants, and produce a sustainable material for specific energy (lighting, motor) technologies.  Broader Impact.  Outreach to local science teachersghas been a mainstay In the program since the start of the project. Professor Strouse has actively engaged middle school students and supported laboratory development at the school. In addition he has developed a Summer School in Magnetism through the NSF supported work, which had its inaugural run last year with 20 students from across the US.  From an educational perspective the NSF funding supported  graduate (6 students), undergraduate (3 students), post doctoral associate (1), and visiting faculty member (1) research and training in materials science. The undergraduate matriculated to Chemistry Department for a PhD, Pharmacy School, and to internships. The post doctoral associate is employed at Univ. of Wisconsin.  The former graduate students hold post doctoral position in academia, industry and at national laboratories.  Adrian One former student holds a faculty position at Florida A&amp;M University. Most notably the NSF supported future leaders in that earned the FSU Chemistry Dept. thesis Award.  The PIs and students presented their work at regional ACS meeting (SWRMACS, SERMACS, FAME, National ACS, the Gordon research Conference invited presenter, and as an invited presenter at a DOE workshop on Mesoscale Materials.  In addition Prof. Strouse and Stiegman presented work at both Graduate and Undergraduate Institutions.  The project has broadened the participation of underrepresented scientists.  Products.  The research generated 20 publications in reviewed journals and 2 published patents and 2 submitted patents.       Last Modified: 11/12/2013       Submitted b...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
