<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A data analysis and modeling project seeks to quantify the changes acting on Antarctic climate over the coming century attributable to the recovery of stratospheric ozone.  Anticipated as a consequence of the Montreal Protocol to reduce ozone depleting halocarbon emissions, the seasonal polar ozone holes are now showing signs of recovery. The current lack of a discernable global warming effect on much of the East Antarctic (EA) is thought to stem from stratospheric cooling in part brought about by successive annual ozone depletion events. A steepening of the polar vortex due to stratospheric cooling is accompanied by a strengthening of the westerly winds that circle the continent, which in turn lessens the meridional heat transfer from a warming Southern Hemisphere. As this stratospheric cooling is removed, a stronger warming of the EA is possible.  &lt;br/&gt;A range of current global climate model outputs will be examined as to their ability to reproduce recent Antarctic climate conditions. Whether these can be reliably attributed to a single factor such as ozone or other (well mixed) greenhouse gases may enable future Antarctic climate responses to be better estimated. Antarctic climate variability, especially with respect to surficial melt at the coastal margins has important potential impacts on ice sheet mass balance and global sea-level rise in the coming century.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plugging the leaks  Published in realclimate.org 17 May 2012  by Beate Liepert, NWRA  Clouds and water vapor accounts for only a tiny fraction of all water on Earth, but in spite of it, this moisture in the atmosphere is crucially important to replenishing drinking water reservoirs, crop yields, distribution of vegetation zones, and so on. This is the case because in the atmosphere, clouds and water vapor, transports a vast amount of water from oceans to land, where it falls out as precipitation. Scientists generally agree that rising temperatures in the coming decades will affect this cycling of water. And most climate models successfully simulate a global intensification of rainfall. However, physical models often disagree with observations and amongst themselves on the amount of the intensification, and global distribution of moisture that defines dry and wet regions.  In a paper published in Environmental Research Letters, my co-author and I investigated these model discrepancies (Liepert and Previdi, 2012) (see also here). We developed a "quality control test" for climate models that is solely based on physical principles. We retroactively sum up all possible source, sink and storage terms of atmospheric moisture in models and postulate that a perfectly balanced physical model is a model without artificial leaks or floods in the system (note that small terms like methane oxidation fluxes into the atmosphere, or changes in total cloud water were not included). This approach of "self-consistency" is in contrast to previous studies where scientists performed model "reality checks" of comparisons with uncertainty prone precipitation observations. Eighteen state-of-the-art climate models as described in the United Nations 4th Assessment Report (IPCC-AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were included.  We found that most models predict an increase in moisture coming towards land in the course of the 21st century due to larger warming of land versus ocean surfaces with moderately increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Some models, however predict radically opposite results, But these few models have large biases, which strongly affects the multi-model mean. The multi-model mean is often used in climate science and climate impact studies as "best predictor" since it smooths over model inconsistencies. These biases appear to be associated with æleaksÆ in the model whereby water does not appear to be conserved. Some model leaks are even bigger than the anticipated global precipitation changes in the 21st century. The multi-model average is therefore biased by these few and has an average "leak" of the size of the discharge of the Mississippi river!  With our self-consistency test we were able to identify the outliers and narrow the prediction uncertainty. Only using the consistent models, we expect that in this century, the atmosphere will increasingly transport moisture towards land by the size of the river Nile, and with a model uncertainty of up to 13 percent of increase.  It is difficult for models to keep track of the small amount of water contained in the atmosphere (a thousandth of a percent of the total water on Earth). On the other hand, it is crucially important to plug leaks in physical climate models because water in the atmosphere plays an important role in the energy balance of the Earth. A bit fewer clouds, due to the leaks, can let extra solar energy reach the earth surface and heat up the planet &ndash; lost water vapor would have the opposite effect. This spurious energy flux in leaky models constitutes a "ghost" forcing of climate. We calculate that the ghost forcing in the IPCC models ranges from -1 to +6 watts per square meter, a forcing comparable to the size of non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases &ndash; though since it is roughly constant in time it doesnÆt impact the transient runs directly.  These results show that independent quality controls on climate model simulations are crucial f...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
