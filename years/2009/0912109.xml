<AbstractNarration>The University of Washington's Center for Information Assurance and Cybersecurity, a National Security Agency/Department of Homeland Security Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education and Research (CAEIAE/CAE-R), is creating learning materials in the area of secure coding to be used in a faculty development effort.   The learning materials consist of eight modules that teach secure coding concepts using a software reengineering approach in combination with a case study based pedagogy.   The modules are being used in two faculty development workshops involving eighteen faculty over two years.  The workshops are designed to increase the capacity of the participants' home institutions to provide information assurance educational opportunities to their students.   The project is working with six community colleges in the Puget Sound area to increase their capacity for teaching secure coding and to ensure that the modules are useful to community colleges and address the learning needs of nontraditional and transfer students.    The project includes detailed formative and summative evaluation plans and an independent evaluator.  The course materials are being freely disseminated via a website hosted by the University of Washington.</AbstractNarration>
