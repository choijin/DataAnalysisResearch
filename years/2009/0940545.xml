<AbstractNarration>Pacific University proposes to engage girls in computing with a multifaceted, modular pedagogical strategy that focuses on women computer scientists as leaders. The approach will feature a four-week long computer science summer camp for 7th and 8th grade girls - G2CS (Girls Gather for Computer Science) - with original curriculum that utilizes active learning and focuses on computational thinking, a mentoring program, a multi-media approach and interactive web site, as well as a ten-year commitment to the students involved. Using female computer science leaders as instructors and removing students from their usual surroundings and preoccupations free young women to concentrate on the science, and imagine themselves as scientists. The camp will run for three years and systematic follow-on activities within electronic environments will create an ongoing community of students, their families, mentors and teachers as well as partners. The focus in this particular project is on overcoming the lack of young women in computer science, though its approach would be suitable for use in a variety of scientific fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a partnership between Pacific University and Oregon's nationally recognized public broadcasting station, Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB). Other partners include the Berglund Center for Internet Studies at Pacific, the Intel Corporation, the educational media company Flying Rhinoceros, Vernier Software &amp; Technology, leaders from tribal groups, local Latino community representatives, and local school district heads. The outcomes of the project include video coverage of the camp, featuring young scientists and their mentors at work, game-like "interactives" for the camp web site, and a broad collection of media tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Girls Gather for Computer Science (G2CS) was a four-week long day camp for 7th and 8th grade girls. The camp ran in the summers of 2011-2013 and was held on the campus of Pacific University, Forest Grove, Oregon.  The main goal of the project was to change the way that girls from all ethnic and class backgrounds experience the field of computer science.  A total of ninety girls attended the camp. Twelve middle school teachers attended the camp as both educators and learners. They were educators because they helped to supervise the girls, and they were learners because they learned the Computer Science material along with the girls. Teachers were also required to share the knowledge and skills they gained with staff and students in their schools.  Undergraduate students participated in the camp as camp councelors and assistants to the instructors. The instructors were experts in computer science.   All of the camp staff, teachers, and instructors were female.   The camp included field trips to several local companies including: Intel, WebMD, Galois, Laika, Flying Rhino and Vernier Software &amp; Technology. The camp also included an overnight trip to Seattle with visits to Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and the University of Washington.  Oregon Public Broadcasting was a partner in the G2CS project and played a major role in the dissemination of information about the grant and about women in computer science during the first year. OPB produced an excellent informational video about the camp which is now posted on the G2CS website:  http://www.g2cs.org/diy/video/  The website also contains OPB-developed profiles of females who use computers extensively in their professional careers and interactive games that illustrate computer science concepts.  The camp was examined by an external reviewer, and results are outlined below. 1. In the post-camp surveys, students reported that the camp opened their eyes to all the new roles and possibilities there are for women in positions of leadership in science. They commented that women really do have a role in computer science and that they can contribute as much as men do. They appreciated the leadership role of the camp instructors who were all women. Parents commented that the field trips were a terrific aspect of the camp; seeing women at work in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields had a positive impact on their daughters. Some of the campers are already becoming leaders in computer science in their schools and community. 2. The camp activities and curriculum have increased the studentsÆ confidence and skills in using the computer but beyond that as well. On the post-camp surveys, students demonstrated an increased interest in math and computer science as career opportunities. Essentially all of them indicated an interest in STEM fields and/or Computer Science along with the recognition that no matter what career they choose, effective use of computers will be an essential part of their career. Campers displayed a nearly unanimous increase in content knowledge based on the national technology standards for students; the camp clearly served its purpose well in preparing students in the knowledge of and appropriate use of technology. Six months following the end of camp the students unanimously reported an increase in their confidence in using technology and in their understanding of computer science. 3. The girls responded very favorably to the camp curriculum, to the instructorsÆ methods, and to the instructors themselves. They appreciated having all-female leaders/organizers and demonstrated an increased interest in math and computer science as career opportunities. They reported an increased awareness of the value of collaborating within a team in order to problem-solve effectively, and an increase in persistence in order to complete a difficult task. These collaborative efforts should be viewed as components of the broader learning community.  While the majority of ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
