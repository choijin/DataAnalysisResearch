<AbstractNarration>Abstract: US ? Japan Workshop on Future Directions for Earthquake Engineering Research &lt;br/&gt;A US - Japan Workshop to explore future directions for earthquake engineering research is proposed for March 6-7, 2010 in Tokyo, Japan. Co-Chairs on the Japanese side are Professors Khoji Tokimatsu of the Tokyo Institute of Technology and Mitsumasa Midorikawa of the Hokkaido University. US co-Chairs are Professors James Wight of the University of Michigan and Mete Sozen of Purdue University.  The primary purpose of the workshop will be to identify major challenges in earthquake engineering and to define research initiatives that will mitigate the social and financial impact of future earthquakes in the Asian-Pacific region. Workshop participants will be broadly based, and thus, will be intellectually free to define research thrust areas that have the highest potential to mitigate the earthquake threat without regard for where the research will be conducted and what agencies will finance the research.  Workshop participants will be encouraged to pursue joint research projects that address major initiatives defined during the workshop and will facilitate a broader international exchange of students and young researchers between the US and Japan. The Workshop report will provide guidance for future research studies throughout the Asian-Pacific region, as well as for countries around the world facing an earthquake threat. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Expected Results &ndash; Reduction in loss of life; Reduced cost of construction and maintenance; Reduced cost of post-EQ damage; Resilient geotechnical, structural, and lifeline systems.   Reliable Simulation  What &ndash; Reliable Simulation and Assessment of Seismic Response of Structural and Geotechnical Systems  Why &ndash; To achieve regional resilience we need numerical simulation and assessment tools that are universally applicable and reliable.  How &ndash; Acquisition of regional field and laboratory data for universal calibration of simulation and assessment tools; Make use of recent developments in computational tools.
