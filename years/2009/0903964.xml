<AbstractNarration>Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process underlying important phenomena in nature, including solar flares, magnetospheric substorms and disruptions in laboratory fusion experiments. Classical resistivity is not adequate to explain the observed energization of particles during reconnection events. An important recent discovery is that for a given set of plasma parameters, reconnection can proceed in two distinct modes: a slow mode known as Sweet-Parker reconnection, and a fast mode that involves electric and magnetic fields produced by the Hall effect. The catastrophic transition between these two modes can explain the sudden onset of fast reconnection in resistive systems such as the solar corona and laboratory reconnection experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the structure of the reconnection region near the magnetic x-line and determine how the structure is related to the rate of magnetic reconnection. It will focus on  the development of a new model of particle heating in which electrons circulating in contracting magnetic islands undergo Fermi-like acceleration. The model will link the energy gain by electrons to the magnetic energy released during reconnection. Ions, whose thermal speeds are typically comparable to or much smaller than the Alfven speed, are too slow to undergo Fermi reflection and some other process must be invoked to explain their energization. This project will explore a seed mechanism in which super-Alfvenic ions entering in reconnection exhausts act like pickup particles and gain a thermal energy equal to the exhaust velocity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kinetic particle, Hall magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and test particle simulations will be used to address the key issues related to electron and ion acceleration during reconnection. Collaborations will be continued with scientists working on laboratory reconnection experiments and with satellite data to benchmark the theoretical predictions with observations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exploration of the dynamics of reconnection and particularly the development of a predictive capability for energetic particle spectra has broad importance for assessing both the safety of astronauts and our country's space-based technological assets. The active involvement of undergraduate students in research under this program and support for female graduate students will further the educational goals of NSF.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Magnetic fields are present throughout the universe. They are produced in space and astrophysical systems as flows of plasma (a charge particle conducting gas) twist, fold and amplify the magnetic field in a process called the dynamo. The magnetic field is a form of energy. When magnetic field pointing in opposite direction come into contact, they can annihilate and thereby release the magnetic energy. In a highly conducting plasma the release of magnetic energy takes place through the process of magnetic reconnection. In the narrow boundary layers oppositely pointed magnetic fields can break and cross connect to form magnetic slingshots that accelerate plasma to high velocity. In the process magnetic energy is converted into high speed flows. Observations have revealed that a large fraction of the released energy accelerates particles to very high energy, approaching the velocity of light. In this research grant we have developed a new understanding about how these high energy particles are produced. The oppositely pointed magnetic fields actually break up into a sea of magnetic bubbles. It is the contraction of these bubbles that causes the particles to be accelerated. Computer simulations of the acceleration process were carried out and described in a number of papers that were published in journals. Understanding how these energetic particles are produced is both scientifically important and important because particles created in solar flares can damage Earth-orbiting communication satellites and can threaten the lives of astronauts in space. We have suggested that the magnetic field that forms the heliosphere of the sun breaks of into a sea of giant magnetic bubbles that have scale sizes of around 1 AU, the distance from the sun to the Earth. This occurs beyond around 90 AU where the solar wind has slowed but inside of the heliopause, which marks the outer boundary of the sun's domain of influence.
