<AbstractNarration>Support funds were awarded to purchase a flow cytometer for research and education.  Flow cytometry is a powerful technique that allows high throughput analysis of complex biological samples. Cells can be analyzed for changes in protein expression or localization, and even ion fluxes that signify changes in cell activation or changes in cell physiology that are a prelude to cell death can be measured. The Biology Department at California State University Northridge will benefit from the acquisition of a flow cytometer in several key ways.  As a Hispanic Serving Institution, CSUN plays an important role in serving the needs of students traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. Students have opportunities to engage in a variety of research programs, ranging from understanding development in model organisms such as nematodes (worms) or sea urchins to understanding the mechanisms of cell suicide (apoptosis).  All faculty research enables students, both at the undergraduate and graduate level, to learn and apply their knowledge to novel and significantly important scientific questions. In addition, the incorporation of a flow cytometer in a variety of laboratory courses, including cellular physiology, neurophysiology and serology, will increase the number of students with hands-on research experience, potentially attracting and engaging students in biological inquiry that may not have otherwise been interested in careers in biology.  It is anticipated that these activities will advance student learning while preparing students for their future endeavors.  The outcomes from this project will include the enrollment of undergraduate and graduate students in M.S. and Ph.D. programs, the employment of students in the workforce and the publication of research articles that advance basic scientific discovery.</AbstractNarration>
