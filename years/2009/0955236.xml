<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  Recently, advanced high strength steels have been developed with significant amounts of retained austenite in the microstructure. Stress and strain induced transformation of retained austenite to martensite results in excellent combinations of strength and ductility in these alloys. The stability of retained austenite during fatigue cycling and its effect on cyclic stress-strain behavior has not been comprehensively investigated and is the focus of this investigation. Two steel alloy systems that contain retained austenite will be used for the investigation, transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) alloys and superbainite. TRIP alloys have superior strength and formability, while superbainite has vast potential for structural purposes because of excellent combinations of strength and toughness. Four key variables will be assessed: retained austenite stacking fault energy, dislocation density, morphology, and the surrounding microstructure. Experimental and computational tools will be used to quantify the impact of retained austenite on fatigue behavior. The tools include servohydraulic load frames for fatigue testing, advanced electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction for characterization, the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center for simultaneous mechanical testing and characterization, and object-oriented finite element analysis. Fundamental and quantitative understanding will be obtained for the relationship between the above variables, retained austenite stability, and fatigue properties. It is anticipated that this understanding can be applied to other steel alloys and material systems such as nitinol that exhibit similar phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  The objective of the proposed work is to determine the effect of deformation-induced changes on fatigue properties of advanced steel alloys, and also use this understanding to promote engineering and advanced materials applications to high school students and teachers, undergraduates, and graduate students. Smart metal alloys that take advantage of changes in the material during deformation are being implemented more widely in medical, infrastructure, and transportation industries. Enhanced properties can be obtained in steel alloys through deformation-induced changes. Two alloy systems that take advantage of this phenomenon will be studied in this investigation. TRIP (transformation induced plasticity) steels exhibit promise for increased strength, ductility, and crashworthiness over alloys traditionally used in the automotive industry. Superbainite, recently developed at Cambridge University, is processed to provide outstanding combinations of strength and toughness. Since both of these alloys are intended for structural purposes, they may be subject to fatigue loads, but their fatigue behavior is not well understood. Using the proposed research as a basis, programs will also be developed to educate high school teachers and urban high school students in the Colorado Uplift program about materials engineering and more broadly, about the impact of materials development on their everyday lives. The objective is to inspire students to pursue science and engineering degrees and become educated future voters and policymakers. The research will also be incorporated into the undergraduate laboratory curriculum in the mechanical behavior of materials course at the Colorado School of Mines as an example of smart material systems. Undergraduate and graduate researchers will be educated through the research process and will participate in the high school outreach activities and thus gain an understanding of how science and community service can be intertwined. Finally, the project will facilitate future domestic and international collaborations with partners such as Los Alamos National Laboratory and Cambridge University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF CAREER Award, entitled "The Stability and Influence of Metastable Retained Austenite During Fatigue of Advanced Steel Alloys," accomplished the major research and educational objectives and positively impacted students, teachers, and faculty in multiple environments.  The major research objectives of the project were to determine the effect of retained austenite and its stability on the mechanical performance of advanced steel alloys.  The influence of retained austenite composition and stacking fault energy, size, surrounding microstructure, hydrogen, and response to pre-strain were assessed. The primary educational objectives were to increase interest in advanced physical metallurgy technology through undergraduate and graduate research and inform K-12 students, through outreach activities and teacher research/education programs, about materials science and engineering and modern technology related to the steel industry.  The grant fully or partially supported three Ph.D. students, one M.S. student, two middle school science teachers, three undergraduate researchers, and one post-doctoral researcher, which not only enhanced the professional development of all of these personnel but also produced several impactful products.  The project produced publications, reports, and presentations that enhanced understanding of the influence of retained austenite on steel mechanical behavior.  These include peer-reviewed publications, presentations and papers in high quality conferences, and reports and presentations to the industrial sponsors of the Advanced Steel Processing and Products Research Center (ASPPRC).  These latter reports and presentations were vital to the success of the projects as it allowed the students and post-doctoral researcher to interact with ferrous metallurgy experts from industry and take advantage of their technical expertise and perspective on industrial relevance of their projects; this was also excellent exposure for the projects as the industrial sponsors are one of the primary intended audiences of the work. Furthermore, several laboratory modules were developed for middle school classrooms at two different local middle schools.  These laboratory modules will be shared with the Colorado School of Mines Material Advantage Chapter, which is a student group that performs outreach as part of their activities.  Other outreach activities were performed both on and off the Colorado School of Mines campus with support from the CAREER project.  These activities involved both undergraduate and graduate students in running the activities, which was beneficial in providing them perspective about the value of community outreach through a technical discipline.  Finally, the grant has facilitated collaboration amongst multiple academic, national laboratory, and industrial partners, including the previously mentioned ASPPRC.  The NSF-ERC Research Opportunities in Europe for CAREER Awardees allowed the PI to have an extended research visit at TU-Delft in the Netherlands, which resulted in a strong collaboration with the university in addition to the opportunity to engage with other European industries and universities about the project.  Another valuable opportunity produced through the grant is a collaboration with Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) that commenced after their staff read one of our publications and found that our alloys are designed ideally to test some of their hypotheses about hydrogen embrittlement.  SNL charged specimens from our material with hydrogen, and then we performed fatigue testing and analysis on the specimens. The project has resulted in two invited presentations and an upcoming publication.  Overall, the research made contributions to multiple areas including automotive structural sheet steel, stainless and pressure vessel steels, and surface hardened gear steels.  These investigations have laid the foundation for future research and strong partnerships in complementary areas.  Furthermore, the outreach activities have established connections between local schools, Colorado School of Mines faculty, and students that will continue to be used to promote science and engineering to the local community.
