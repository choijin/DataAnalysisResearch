<AbstractNarration>Many emerging quantum information technologies require access to some form of quantum entanglement in order to operate.  Understanding what is needed and what is possible to achieve with these technologies is frustrated by the large number of types of multiparticle entanglement that could be produced.  The role of multiparticle quantum entanglement as a resource and the proliferation of entanglement types with increasing particle numbers motivate a program of classification.  A good classification scheme provides a framework for understanding properties of and relationships among quantum states, puts interesting states in a context, and introduces concepts that allow explanation and interpretation of new findings.  The goal of this research is to produce such a classification scheme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a framework and a language in which to articulate the needs and resources of quantum information processing tasks, and will therefore be of use to researchers trying to make these tasks a reality.  A second broader impact of this project is direct influence on the scientific careers of promising young students.  Undergraduates will participate as research assistants who will carry out computational experiments, write computer code to generate examples and test hypotheses, and prove special cases of broad conjectures.  Engagement in research teaches the process of intellectual inquiry and discovery in a way that classroom work alone cannot achieve.  This project will strengthen the research environment at Lebanon Valley College by supporting students in research activities including presentations at scientific meetings and publications in scientific journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Motivated by the promise of applications in computing and communication technologies, the focus of our project has been the phenomenon of quantum entanglement. Entanglement is a property of composite physical systems that cannot be completely described by the states of subsystems, and leads to intuition-defying paradoxes that Einstein dubbed "spooky action at a distance" and led him to declare that quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory. Complete or not, quantum theory has become a vehicle for revolutionary ways to view information processing. Entanglement---easily defined but poorly understood---plays the role of a key resource that gives quantum information algorithms advantages over today's most sophisticated state of the art methods that do not exploit quantum theory.  Closely related to entanglement is local equivalence. Two states of a composite system are locally equivalent if they are interconvertible by operations that act only on subsystems. The framework of our research is to study entanglement by using the powerful algebraic structures attached to local equivalence.  In the course of this project, we have advanced our program of analyzing entanglement via local equivalence with a series of papers on the structure and entanglement types of so-called symmetric states (these are quantum states that are invariant under exchanges of subsystems). Part of this study focuses on the class of Werner states. Werner states do not change when the same local operation is applied to every subsystem, and are therefore useful resources for computational tasks that are subject to certain types of noise.  Taking a deeper look at the Werner states, we have given a general construction that we conjecture will provide unique representation for arbitrary Werner states as superpositions of a basis collection, and give heuristics for how this basis connects to the algebraic structures of local equivalence.  One of the broader impacts of this project has been direct influence on the scientific careers of promising young students.  Undergraduates participated as research assistants who carried out computational experiments, wrote computer code to generate examples and test hypotheses, and proved special cases of broad conjectures.  Engagement in research teaches the process of intellectual inquiry and discovery in a way that classroom work alone cannot achieve.  All students presented their work at scientific meetings and three students became co-authors on publications in scientific journals.
