<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;For over 40 years, it has been known that the low temperature properties, such as thermal conductivity and specific heat, of glasses and amorphous materials differ dramatically from their crystalline counterparts and show a surprising universality for a wide range of materials. The Tunneling Level Systems (TLS) model can successfully describe this behavior below 1K but the physical mechanism that gives rise to the TLS has yet to be identified. Amorphous silicon is a unique system in that silicon?s tetrahedral bonding is predicted to preclude the presence of TLS yet the density of these states is found to vary by orders of magnitude; from the densities typically found in glasses to almost undetectable levels. Light soaking can increase the density of TLS and the presence of TLS has been linked to the decrease in efficiency of amorphous silicon solar cells over time. In this project, we will use the unique ability to tune the density of TLS in amorphous silicon, both by preparation conditions and light soaking, to systematically probe the origin of the thermodynamic universality. In particular, we will measure the low temperature specific heat and thermal conductivity and look for correlations to changes in the local bonding in the amorphous matrix. Identifying the mechanism that gives rise to the TLS has a direct impact on quantum information processing where the TLS give rise to decoherence in qubits and also to the use of amorphous silicon as a low cost photovoltaic material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the thermodynamic properties of amorphous vapor deposited films. Amorphous materials exhibit a characteristic set of thermodynamic behaviors that differ substantially from their crystalline counterparts. This universal behavior includes: low temperature properties (below ~1K) that are explained by the model of tunneling level states (TLS); higher temperature properties which include excess heat capacity C (well above what is calculated from sound velocity), a ?boson peak?, and a plateau in thermal conductivity k. The focus will be on a-Si and a-Si:H films where changes in growth conditions and H content are known to reduce the density of TLS that give rise to these universal properties at low temperature. Dangling bond passivation with H will be probed via FTIR and these results will be coupled with EXAFS and XANES measurements to see how the local structural order of the amorphous matrix correlates to any changes in the specific heat. Specific heat measurements will be made with a MEMS based nanocalorimeter that is specifically designed for thin films. Comparisons between as deposited, light soaked, and annealed films will be made to further our understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to the light induced degradation of the efficiency of a-Si photovoltaic devices known as the Staebler-Wronski Effect. The project will provide research training and education for two graduate students and an estimated 5-6 undergraduates, including exposure to the national laboratories through the PI's collaborations with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[For over 40 years, physicists have believed that low-temperature properties (e.g. thermal conductivity and specific heat) of non-crystalline materials (also called "amorphous" or "glass") universally showed marked differences from their crystalline counterparts. A widely-accepted theoretical model (the Tunneling Two-Level Systems (TTLS) model) successfully describes some of this low-temperature behavior, but as of yet lacks an identified physical mechanism.  Amorphous silicon (a-Si) is a unique system in which to test the universality of TTLS because siliconÆs tetrahedral bonding is predicted to preclude the presence of TTLS.    In this project, we used various high sensitivity experimental techniques to measure the density of TTLS and other defects in a-Si prepared under a wide range of conditions and showed that the density of TTLS in a-Si varies by orders of magnitude -- from that typically found in glasses to none.  We found we could create TTLS by exposure of a-Si to light and remove TTLS by heat treatment.  This data supports the idea that the traditionally "universal" low-temperature properties of glasses are, in all likelihood, not universal.  Amorphous Si is a key element in many technologies, including quantum information devices and low-cost photovoltaic cells.  In both of these, defects are known to limit their efficiency, and exposure to light is known to degrade efficiency of a-Si photovoltaic cells, suggesting a connection to the TTLS; however, it is a theoretical and experimental challenge to describe the structures associated with TTLS or any other defect since all amorphous structures are completely disordered at the atomic scale. Through our studies, we found a strong correlation between the TTLS and the atomic density of a-Si, and found growth conditions that reduce TTLS to measurably zero.  This has enabled improved a-Si for both information and photovoltaic technologies, and provided insight into the nature of defects in a completely disordered structure.     Specifically, we found that TTLS scale inversely with the atomic density; this suggests that TTLS occur in nanovoids or other low density regions and not in the tetrahedrally-bonded amorphous network.  We found that two components of the specific heat are proportional to each other, a result not predicted by the TTLS theory, which suggests that the physical mechanisms underlying these theoretically disparate anomalies are at least associated, if not one and the same, and that two extremely different measurement techniques yield the same TTLS density despite very different measurement time scales.    The grant supported the PhD thesis work of Daniel Queen, who subsequently became a post-doc at NRL and now has a staff position working at Northrop Grumman researching decoherence in superconducting qubits, a project directly related to the work he did in this project.  It supported the start of the PhD thesis work of Hilary Jacks, who has learned the theory of amorphous materials as well as how to grow and characterize them.  It indirectly supported two other graduate students who were working on other PhD thesis projects but participated in aspects of this project, broadening their exposure to condensed matter physics by teaching them about amorphous materials. It directly supported 10 undergraduate research students, some from Berkeley, some from non-PhD granting institutions who came to Berkeley for summers, as well as two others indirectly who were supported by other sources but participated in parts of this project.  All of these students learned about condensed matter physics broadly through group meetings and department seminars, and their specific research project through their own reading, participation in presentations at weekly group meetings and individual weekly meetings with the PI.  All students were trained in safe and effective laboratory techniques and were provided with opportunities to present their research at local and national conf...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
