<AbstractNarration>Experimental studies of proton collisions at the LHC are likely to reveal the answers to some of the most fundamental questions in physics. Already, experiments like Fermi GST and PAMELA are producing very exciting - though puzzling - results that may be major hints to an unexpectedly rich dark matter sector. There are many possibilities for dramatic discoveries, which will usher in a new era for dark matter and fundamental particle physics. How one combines the complementary information from these disparate measurements into a cohesive picture is not readily apparent. Initially, it is unlikely that an obvious picture will emerge that is more compelling than conventional explanations, such as poorly understood modeling or experimental systematics. Thus, one must be prepared to pose serious questions about the data, the theoretical interpretation, the experimental systematics, and additional modeling assumptions that are not limited by avoidable technical limitations. This award supports a program of physics research built around a unifying approach to large-scale scientific data analysis, initially dealing with data from LHC experiments, in a way that is scalable with respect to complexity of data, experimental apparatuses, and theoretical models. The approach could have profound impact on early standard model physics measurements and the extension to Higgs physics and beyond as well as facilitate communication and cooperation between ATLAS and CMS, between theorists and experimentalists, and among researchers from different disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impact the key development in this award that enables the scalable approach to large-scale data analysis is applicable beyond the field of particle physics. Experiments as diverse as Fermi GST, HESS, and the IceCube neutrino telescope are already exploring the use of this technology, which is a concrete indication of the broader impacts of the proposed research. Additional impacts follow from a well-integrated educational and outreach component. A portable and professionally-designed exhibit will be constructed for use at the popular New York City World Science Festival street fair, area science fairs, career fairs, and the like. The booth will utilize existing material from the ATLAS outreach group. Additionally, the exhibit will be the basis for a project integrated into a teaching methods course in the Department of Teaching and Learning at NYU. The project will be to design activities for the exhibit itself and to develop and assess physics teaching methods. Thus, the exhibit, the activities, and the assessment of the exhibit will be the culmination of a semester-long project, and those teachers can bring the developed activities to their own schools. Finally, the PI will mentor high-school students from the Harlem Children's Society so that they can understand and operate the demonstrations, thus serving as peer-group liaisons, and role models for under-represented groups in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

These studies will continue for years as the LHC collects more data and becomes sensitive to more of the Higgs properties.</p> <p>While the Standard Model is elegant, it is incomplete. Several theories Beyond the Standard Model address its shortcomings, and predict new particles and forces.&nbsp;Thus, we have searched directly for evidence of new particles and interactions, though thus far we have found no significant evidence for them. There are many such theories and as physicist's creativity uncovers more exotic possibilities it has become increasingly important that we develop powerful tools to reinterpret the searches that we have performed.
