    <AbstractNarration>IIP 0934418&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University&lt;br/&gt;Spanias&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sensor Signal and Information Processing (SenSIP) consortium at the Arizona State University (ASU) is planning to join the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "Net-Centric Software and Systems" which currently is a multi- university Center comprised of the University of North Texas (lead institution), and the University of Texas at Dallas. The mission of SenSIP at ASU is to develop signal and information processing foundations for next-generation integrated multidisciplinary sensing applications in biomedicine, defense, energy, and other systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASU will bring to the existing Center much needed complementary capabilities in the areas of digital signal and image processing, multimedia systems, sensor networks, information theory and wireless communications. The proposed site will enable the creation of new capabilities in sensor signal processing and will bridge the gap between sensor development and large scale sensor deployment; and, is uniquely positioned to promote industry research, education, scholarship that will integrate well with the existing Net-Centric I/UCRC umbrella. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research at ASU SenSIP will lead to inexpensive, compact, and reusable sensors for industry applications of relevance to medicine, sustainability, and defense. Publications in scientific journals and conferences will be complemented with a strong dissemination effort. The ASU SenSIP site has several established programs for recruitment from underrepresented groups, involvement of undergraduate students in research, and mechanisms to create and package online modules with interdisciplinary research and education content. ASU site also plans to create a workforce in signal processing related areas that support national initiatives in medicine, energy, and defense industries.</AbstractNarration>
