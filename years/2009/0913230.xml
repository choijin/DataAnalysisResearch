<AbstractNarration>This Workshop, led by Meghan Miller of UNAVCO, will be convened at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, for US, African, and European participants designed to develop and enhance plans for investigations of processes leading to volcanic eruptions and large earthquakes in continental rift zones, with emphasis on the evaluation, monitoring and communication of volcanic and seismic hazards in East Africa. The two-day workshop is planned to precede a two-week professional development course for African geoscientists supported by ICTP, the International Council for Science (ICSU), the African Union, the Royal Society/Natural Environment Resource Council of the UK, and UNAVCO; to provide strategic guidance to the international community based on lessons learned from natural hazards in Africa and elsewhere. The goals of the NSF-funded pre-meeting workshop are to establish a new initiative for cooperation in East Africa, to design programs to comprehensively evaluate and monitor the time and length scales of plate boundary and volcanic deformation, and to develop networks for exchange of ideas and expertise. In so doing, participants will augment and strengthen research plans, ensuring the broadest impact with future volcanic and seismic hazard-related projects. The results of this two-day meeting will feed directly into the international workshop. ICTP, whose mission is to foster advanced studies and research in developing countries, has provided core support for a two-week workshop and to defray the cost of attendance for African scientists. UNAVCO will receive support for 12 U.S. volcanologists, seismologists, geodesists, and remote sensing experts and 3 graduate students for the two-day, multi-disciplinary NSF workshop and associated two-day business meeting.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit The East African Rift is a classic example of the early stages of continental rifting above a fertile mantle, providing scientists with fundamental insights into early rift evolution and mantle composition. Taken with associated seismic and volcanic hazards, this feature promises to advance our understanding of divergent plate boundary evolution and its relevance. Scientists from three continents will share important recent advances in characterizing the rift and develop an international plan to advance scientific studies using modern tools of geodesy and seismology. This plan and the new collaborations established during the workshop will further also refine the focus on societal impact of volcanic and seismic hazards.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact This workshop will provide support for the professional development of an international mix of scientists and students, and address issues of enhancing sustainable science infrastructure for developing countries. Further, it will provide a forum for inter-continental collaboration that will seed future projects. It is expected that the workshop will nurture exchange among scientific organizations and student programs.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
