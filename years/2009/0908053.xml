<AbstractNarration>Activities of the U. S. National Committee for Psychology&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. National Committee for Psychology (USNC/IUPsyS) represents the U.S. psychological science community to the International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS) on behalf of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The USNC/IUPsyS provides a valuable network through which the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the NAS enhance their capacity to contribute to global research in psychological science. It is also a vehicle through which the NAS reaches out to the U.S. scientific community through international union activities that are designed to further develop the fields of psychology both nationally and internationally, thus helping to create a diverse and globally-oriented U.S. scientific workforce.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S participation in IUPsyS fulfills a unique role in the national science infrastructure. The national committee:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - provides a forum for dialogue between U.S. scientists and foreign colleagues; &lt;br/&gt; - develops programs for building human and research capacity in developing countries; &lt;br/&gt; - fosters research cooperation by sponsoring conferences and workshops on topics of interest and by initiating pilot/demonstration projects for bilateral or regional research collaborations; and&lt;br/&gt; - organizes travel grant programs for young scientists and scientists from underrepresented backgrounds to participate in international scientific congresses.&lt;br/&gt; - interacts with union officers to ensure strong governance and sound financial management; &lt;br/&gt; - identifies and supports the best candidates for election to union offices; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, this proposed program encourages cooperative research and education efforts across disciplinary and international boundaries, and positions the United States to benefit from global investment in science and technology.  The proposed activities of the USNC/IUPsyS are 1) a workshop and report addressing institutional impediments to cross-national psychological research, 2) a website with resources to foster international collaborations, and 3) two Advanced Research Training Seminars (ARTS) held in conjunction with the IUPsyS General Assemblies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The national committee's impact is the result of the work of the members of the committee, who represent a variety of psychological science disciplines and have strong international interests. Several current and past members of the committee exercise leadership at the international union level.  The work of the committee -- whether as an organizer of scientific initiatives with impact in both domestic and international arenas or as a leader at the union level -- ultimately contributes to U.S. scientific diplomacy activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Founded in 1951, the International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS) serves as a unifying voice to promote the development, representation and advancement of psychology as a basic and applied science nationally, regionally, and internationally.  Nearly 70 countries currently serve as National Members.   The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is the adhering member to the IUPsyS on behalf of the United States.  One of its committees, the U.S. National Committee for Psychological Science (USNC/IUPsyS), is tasked with representing the interests of the U.S. psychological science community in the International union. The committee thus acts as a liaison between U.S. scientists and the international psychological community.  The committee includes representatives from a number of relevant U.S. professional societies.  Their input and participation is vital.  Member countries have several responsibilities, including paying dues, helping plan union programs, and providing leadership.  The USNC/IUPsyS does all of these.  For example, in 2012, the U.S. successfully nominated Dr. Oscar Barbarin from Tulane University as member of the IUPsyS Executive Committee.  Other specific examples of the USNC activities during this period include:  The USNC/IUPsyS, in collaboration with the American Psychological Association (APA), sponsored an International Travel Grant and Mentoring Program for U.S. psychological scientists to participate at the International Congress of Psychology 2012 (ICP2012).  The program provided partial support for 21 selected participants out of a pool of 68 applicants. A mentoring component paired 7 experienced international researchers with 14 graduate student and early career scientists in order to foster interaction and exchange in the context of a premier international congress of psychology.  Both mentors and mentees remarked that they had increased their breadth of understanding of international scientific research as a result of attending ICP2012. Attending this congress provided exposure to a broad range of research that they would not normally encounter. By the end of the congress, some of the participants had already laid plans for international collaborations, and all had plans to do so.   The USNC/IUPsyS organized an Advanced Research Training Seminar at the ICP2012 that delivered advanced methodological and conceptual training on "how to conduct research that contributes to an understanding of how populations are coping with the strains of globalization and its effects on health and psychological wellbeing." Participants in the training included early career scholars from Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.  The USNC/IUPsyS organized and held a workshop on International Collaborative Research in the Social and Behavioral Sciences on September 23-24, 2013.  The purpose was to identify best practices for solving some of the most persistent problems that impede international collaborative research. These include tenure and training policies that militate against the involvement of graduate students and junior faculty, funding that is insufficient for appropriate dissemination, IRB policies, identifying potential collaborators, challenges in new web-based environments, and using international collaborative research to inform educational improvement.   A report is currently being prepared by the NRC.       Last Modified: 10/30/2013       Submitted by: Katherine E Bailey Mathae]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
