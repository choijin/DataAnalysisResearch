<AbstractNarration>Collective intelligence has been harnessed recently to create new collaborative forms that were not previously achievable. This socially-emergent intelligence appears in collaborative management and indexing of information, authoring encyclopedia articles, participating in blogs, tagging or commenting photographs or videos. This socially-emergent movement also exposes an unprecedented amount of social information. Particularly, two classes of Internet applications reveal voluminous social information: popular online social networks (e.g., Facebook or LinkedIn); and the widely-adopted collaborative tools (e.g., CiteULike or Delicious) that provide rich information fabric through tags, annotations, and text organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the potential of including social knowledge in the design of community-enabled peer-to-peer distributed infrastructures. It will design, prototype, and evaluate a community-oriented peer-to-peer infrastructure that exploits social knowledge for services such as data and computing management, while protecting social data privacy seen as contextual integrity. Using social knowledge in the design of services will likely improve performance, based on the assumptions that social incentives reduce churn; socially-inferred trust reduce security breaches and expand the set of available resources; and shared interest improves data placement decisions or co-location of data and computations. This will create the potential to enable new classes of applications and infrastructures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops innovative teaching strategies that facilitate non CS-major students use of computational tools in their professional lives. This will be done through multidisciplinary co-teaching of an undergraduate introductory course, and coordinated teaching of independent graduate courses in computer science and social sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The most significant outcomes of the research enabled by this project are in two areas: distributed systems and computational sociology.   Distributed Systems results include:  1. Socially-aware management of data in decentralized architectures  We designed and evaluated Prometheus, a socially aware peer-to-peer service that collects data from multiple sources and enables a range of socially-aware applications via an API that implements social inferences. This service collects information from actual interactions between users within multiple environments and under multiple identities (e.g., OSNs, email, mobile phones). Prometheus represents social information as a directed, weighted and labeled multi-graph distributed on a P2P platform. Access to such aggregated information is controlled by user-defined policies.  We tested Prometheus using real traces. We discovered that storing data of socially-related users on the same node reduces significantly query response time (by 20-25%) and message overhead (by 40&ndash;65%) compared to random mapping. In addition, social mapping reduces the average opportunity of peers to (maliciously) temper with requests. However, the power-law nature of social graphs allows the formation of "hot-spot" peers who serve many requests, thus becoming attractive targets to attacks.  2. Quantification of the strength of indirect ties in social networks and benefits for distributed systems  While direct social ties have been studied in the context of computer-mediated social networks, indirect ties (e.g., friends of friends) have seen little attention. Yet in real life, we often rely on friends of our friends for many other occasional needs. We introduced a metric to quantify the strength of indirect social ties, we validated this metric, and we empirically demonstrated its usefulness in two applications: predicting information diffusion in a social graph and friend-to-friend storage sharing systems. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that using the social strength metric is beneficial in both cases.   3. Privacy as contextual integrity  The primary aspect of social ecosystems--aggregating data from various sources to provide social knowledge to a diversity of applications--significantly amplifies privacy concerns. The privacy challenge is fundamentally due to the lack of a universal framework that establishes what is right and wrong. One framework proposed in the context of public policy is privacy as contextual integrity, which requires explicit definitions of social contexts, norms of appropriateness, and norms of distribution.  We designed, implemented and evaluated a system called Aegis that adopts this framework to generate default privacy policies for users in social ecosystems. Previous studies shows that the majority of the user population never changes the default privacy settings, thus automatically personalizing the default privacy settings has the highest impact. Experimental evaluations on real-world large networks demonstrate the practicality of our solution.     Computational Sociology results: in order to better understand user behavior that can influence the design of decentralized solutions for distributed systems, we focused part of our research efforts on collecting and analyzing large datasets. These efforts led to the following discoveries:   4. The epidemics of cheating in online games  The popularity of online gaming supports a billion-dollar industry, but also a vigorous cheat code development community that facilitates unethical in-game behavior. Cheating is both a monetary and a public relations problem and, consequently, significant resources are invested to contain it. Using data analytics on a large collection of user profiles connected in an online social network, we discovered that cheaters tend to cluster together, they are not homogeneously distributed over the globe, and are inspired by their cheating gaming partners to cheat themselves. In addition, we confirmed via empirical analysis of real settings that a players? temptation to cheat significantly increases with exposure to neighbors who cheat and have not been punished; teammates have larger influence in inspiring cheating than do opponents; and the penalty for cheating limits the spread of this unethical behavior.     5. Rule violations and cultural issues in Yahoo Answers  Community-based Question-Answering (CQA) sites, such as Yahoo Answers (YA) are rich and mature repositories of user-contributed questions and answers. To enforce community rules, such platforms provide tools to flag inappropriate content. We discovered that, although used correctly, flags do not tell accurately which users should be suspended. We learned that network-based information, combined with user activity, leads to accurate detection of the "bad guys".  We measured Hofstede?s cultural dimensions and Levine?s Pace of Life on about 200,000 sampled YA users from 67 countries, active in 2012 and 2013. We learned that users from higher Pace of Life and lower uncertainty-avoidance countries have more temporarily predictable activities; users from individualistic countries provide more answers, show more altruistic behavior, are more concerned about their privacy and are also less probable to provide an answer that violates community norms. We also find that higher power distance countries show more indegree imbalance in following relationships compared to lower power distance countries.     This project contributed to four PhD dissertations and resulted in 24 peer-reviewed publications.        Last Modified: 08/16/2016       Submitted by: Adriana Iamnitchi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
