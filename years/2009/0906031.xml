<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009. The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Uncovering the genetic and molecular mechanistic basis for natural variation in gene expression in the nematode worm C. elegans" for Daniel Pollard. The host institution for this research is the New York University, and the sponsoring scientist is Matthew Rockman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morphological, physiological and behavioral differences within and between species are known to arise from heritable variation in gene expression, yet much remains unclear regarding the genetic and molecular mechanisms by which expression variation arises. This research utilizes the genetically well-characterized nematode worm, C. elegans, to address fundamental questions regarding observed differences in how genes are expressed.  The specific goals of the research are to 1) measure gene expression in hybrids of wild C. elegans, 2) use computational tools to build a model of how genes are regulated through a molecular network in C. elegans, and 3) experimentally characterize examples of regulatory relationships predicted by the model. The results of this project offer an unprecedented breadth of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying gene expression variation in an animal model system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals include statistical genetics and causative network modeling skills. Data, results and publications are being disseminated through open access websites and journals. Outreach goals are to participate in national and international research conferences, offer guest lectures, and oversee the training of students at the sponsoring institution.</AbstractNarration>
