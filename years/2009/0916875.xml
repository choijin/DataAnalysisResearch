<AbstractNarration>Today we have organizational and software procedures that facilitate the exchange of interpersonal information in social networking sites, instant messaging, bulletin boards, online role?playing games, computer?supported collaborative work, and online education. All of these applications fit into the larger category of social media that support virtual communities. As we increasingly rely on this cyberspace, the issue of privacy protection in social media is critically important. The objective of this project is to develop an advanced framework called U-Control for Digital Persona and Privacy Management to manage and release personal information considering a notion of digital persona based user privacy preferences and associated risks in disclosing such private information over virtual communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will result in the development of a protection framework and architecture to address the privacy challenges in social media-based virtual communities. This research effort is also expected to set an important direction to the future research in the area of virtual communities and online privacy solutions. This research has the potential for broad societal impact by providing</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant funded research on user controllable security and privacy in virtual community. Online social networks (OSNs) have become very popular, and there has been a rapid growth in use of OSN systems to access, store, and exchange private information. Efficient, secure, and user-controllable techniques are important for the successful deployment of such systems. Our research was aimed at developing a selective attribute sharing scheme based on an offline credential system for protecting user privacy and security in OSN systems. This was accomplished by designing a novel offline credential scheme by leveraging the concept of authenticated dictionary. In addition, we developed a privacy classification system to refine the diverse requirements for online user privacy and investigated how to satisfy those requirements with privacy solutions we proposed. Usable security and privacy are an important requirement for any security and privacy system, and we developed several usable security and privacy solutions that are conducive to the wide adoption of the offline credential system. The result of this research will help set an important direction to the future research in the area of usable privacy and security in virtual community and will be useful in many commercial and government applications. Broader impacts include the participation and training of under/graduate minority and underrepresented students, international collaborations, establishment of public awareness of the importance of protecting private information in OSNs through tutorials, and collaboration with Sandia Labs. The PI engaged in six outreach seminars to present the results of this result at two domestic universities and three universities in South Korea.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/06/2014<br>      Modified by: Dongwan&nbsp;Shin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
