<AbstractNarration>This proposal expands the online resources developed by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, Arctic Sea Ice News &amp; Analysis [http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews]. The public yearns for reliable science information to understand the decline in Arctic sea ice and its relationship to climate change. Readership of the current website includes media, decision makers, internet-savvy readers, educators, and scientists of the future. To date NSIDC has developed web content primarily for a science audience with near-real time data and analysis. The current website received 501,680 views during the second half of 2008 (Google Analytics). This award supports the development of a new ?Icelights: Questions of the Moment? section to augment the Frequently Asked Questions page. Through "Icelights," the website will offer easily understandable science pieces that are relevant and timely. The project will support personnel who can respond to questions of the moment posed by the readers and make the questions and answers available to others in a searchable web format. These new features to the NSIDC website offered by Icelights are a cost-effective way to reach a large, diverse audience with up-to-date science and answers to their questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Icelights is a public Web site (http://nsidc.org/icelights/) which supplements our highly popular online content, NSIDC Arctic Sea Ice News &amp; Analysis (http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/). Icelights offers accessible, yet scientifically accurate pieces that help us interact more directly with our readers, responding to their queries as topics become timely. Arctic sea ice is an indicator, as well as a driver, of climate variability and change. Arctic sea ice is highly reflective and insulates the cold atmosphere from the relatively warmer Arctic Ocean. As the sea ice cover shrinks, so do the characteristics of the Arctic "refrigerator." While the observed loss of sea ice is already leading to warming in the Arctic outpacing that seen elsewhere on the planet, continued loss of sea ice is expected to have influences on temperature and atmospheric circulation extending well beyond the Arctic. NSIDC Arctic Sea Ice News &amp; Analysis has provided ongoing near-real-time sea ice updates and scientific analysis of Arctic sea ice conditions for five years. Our primary audience for the site is the general public; other audiences include mass media, decision makers, and both cryospheric and non-cryospheric scientists. We explain evolving Arctic sea ice conditions and their importance with plain and accurate language and helpful high-resolution graphics that readers can download.  Our readersÆ enthusiastic feedback, including skeptic questions, led to the need to explain many related background topics, and to respond to related topics. For example, Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis is primarily based on satellite data extending back to 1979. So readers sometimes write and ask, "What do scientists know about sea ice conditions before there were satellites?"  While clearly related to, and important for understanding the sea ice changes, developing new content to meet readersÆ expectations is out of scope for Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis. Icelights has filled an important gap, allowing us to present well-researched, scientist-reviewed pieces on important reader questions like this one. Over the years, we have learned much about our readers, their varying levels of science familiarity, and the questions on their minds about ice and climate. We get many emails from people who are honestly struggling to understand a world of climate data and science. They are grateful to get a straightforward, clear, jargon-free explanation.  As the sea ice cover continues to dwindle and the impacts of this loss emerge, so does the need to provide the public with accurate scientific information. Visitors to Icelights will find   A blog-like format, offering regular, fresh posts that respond to current topics and questions, as well as access to prior posts Clear, straightforward explanations based on research and scientist interviews References to published papers and research Web sites on which the posts are based, anchoring the posts firmly in science Information that has been subjected to thorough science review, either by scientists on staff at NSIDC and/or the scientists whose research we are citing "Crash Course" section with background science on "Arctic sea ice 101," "Data 101," and a "Reading List," giving quick answers to the basic questions readers often ask, such as, "What satellites does NSIDC use to study sea ice?" Graphics or photographs accompanying each post Ability to search all Icelights content, which is tagged by keywords An invitation to "Ask Icelights" a question Social media tools for "liking," sharing posts on Facebook, or sharing via email.
