<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to design a mobile ad hoc network for small satellites that seamlessly integrates these new devices into the existing space communications infrastructure and, also, advances the transformative capabilities of small satellites, such as spatially distributed sensing and monitoring.  The approach is to design low power, low mass small satellites with high data rate (greater than 1 gigabit per second) communications capabilities; design a network architecture, based on ad hoc and sensor networking concepts, that maximizes the capabilities of the limited power, mass and volume small satellites; and conduct simulations and experimental analysis of an actual space network to verify and validate the network design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, the project has the potential to advance the capabilities of small satellites, which are a transformative technology that can lead to a responsive and cost-effective space industry.  The new models, architectures, and protocols have the potential to provide researchers with more accurate techniques for space network simulation and planning, which will expand the utility of space vehicles and foster new research on space and terrestrial applications.  The project leverages a unique set of resources, including a multidisciplinary team of investigators, industry partnerships, and state support, to design, build and deploy a space network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impact, this project has the potential to advance important applications, such as earth observation, disaster monitoring, and multi-point remote sensing.  Potential economic benefits include lowering design cost, shortening deployment time, and extending functionality for space vehicles. The research is integrated with the investigators' ongoing educational efforts as faculty advisors of various student organizations that will encourage U.S. and students from underrepresented groups to seek advanced degrees in science and engineering through their participation in this multidisciplinary project.</AbstractNarration>
