<AbstractNarration>The Concord Consortium, the Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance, the Jackson Laboratory and several other partners are determining the feasibility of engaging students in experimentally-oriented bioinformatics and DNA science cyberlearning modules by developing and studying 17 computer-based instructional modules that can be used in high school biology courses. Students are working in virtual laboratories to conduct genetics research on populations of mythical dragons by manipulating models and simulations based on well-known genetic disorders. The modules require students to work collaboratively and publish their findings for peer review by the NextBio user community. The NextBio Project is also providing teachers with professional development in cutting-edge science content and cyberlearning environments. The project is answering important research questions pertaining to the impact of cyber-based learning materials on student learning with comparisons to traditional materials. The project will further educators' understanding of how biology teachers integrate cyberlearning into their classrooms and measure the effectiveness of virtual laboratories in teaching science to high school biology students.</AbstractNarration>

Comparison group teachers were matched to treatment teachers based on school and student demographics, such as number of students receiving free or reduced price lunch.  Our results show that Geniverse students significantly improved their genetics content knowledge and abilities to engage in scientific explanation and argumentation around genetics. Further, when implemented as intended, student achievement was significantly higher than in the comparison group us...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
