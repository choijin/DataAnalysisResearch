<AbstractNarration>This collaborative Pathways II proposal provides continued funding for the Chemical Education DL.  The Chemical Education DL is unique among the Pathways as it is a collection of digital assets, not a collection of links.  Consequently, they are not subject to URL decay as many portions of NSDL content are.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the Chemical Education DL are: 1)Support students, teachers, the public, and members of the ACS by making available content, pedagogy, communication tools, and professional development resources; 2) Leverage resources of the world?s largest scientific society and foremost chemical education journal to develop and support communities of users, teachers, and developers; 3) Enhance awareness, usage, and development of digital resources through outreach to the K-graduate educational community; 4) Collaborate with the NSDL and its constituent projects to expand NSDL services and promote usage of NSDL resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to furthering the original goals, during the continuation phase the underlying technical/architecture will be strengthened and fully integrated.  Other major enhancements include 1) movement of additional content to the DL from the Journal of Chemical Education, the ACS Education Division and the ACS Division of Chemical Education, 2) development of "more effective means of evaluating the efficacy of the Chemical Education DL resources."&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
