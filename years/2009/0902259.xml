<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support to defray expenses of US based researchers participating in a special semester at the Centre de Recerca Matem√†tica (CRM) in Barcelona, Spain, on ``Harmonic Analysis, Geometric Measure Theory and Quasiconformal Mappings" during the period February-July, 2009. Support will be provided to participants who do not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions made for some senior researchers. The subject is diverse, and has been the subject of  work of significance across several disciplines, with recent work having interactions between a range of mathematical disciplines. This will provide US based researchers with the opportunity to interact with mathematicians from Europe who are leaders in the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will increase the participation by US based researchers in this program of activities. There is a solid core of more senior US based researchers who are already invited and confirmed participants. It is understood that much of the funding will be directed to participants from under-represented groups, and younger researchers, as this proposal lays out guidelines to increase the number of these groups in the semester. This proposal is co-funded by Analysis program and OISE Program each providing half of the requested amount.</AbstractNarration>
