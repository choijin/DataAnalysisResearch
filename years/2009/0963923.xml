<AbstractNarration>In August 2010, the twenty-second international conference Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) will be held at San Francisco State University. The unique and continuing success of the annual FPSAC conferences stems in part from their considerable interdisciplinary breadth - linking leading researchers in combinatorial mathematics with strong researchers in allied fields drawn from pure and applied mathematics, theoretical computer science, physics, and biology. The principal mathematical topics featured in FPSAC 2010 will be: algebraic, geometric, and enumerative combinatorics, and their relations to other areas such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory, K-theory, geometric group theory, and symplectic geometry. There will be nine plenary lectures, and approximately 30 contributed talks and 40 poster presentations selected through a strict refereeing procedure. After a second round of refereeing, a special issue devoted to the conference proceedings will be published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC conferences is the concerted effort to recognize and encourage outstanding young scientists. At least one plenary speaker is an "emerging star," and talented young researchers are well represented among the speakers selected for contributed talks. Another special feature of the FPSAC conferences is a continued tradition of inclusiveness. The conference seeks to draw substantial participation from underrepresented groups. Furthermore, English, French, and Spanish have been designated as offcial languages for FPSAC 2010 to promote a diverse pool of participants. About 200 participants from all over the world are expected. Attendance at this conference will be exceptionally valuable for graduate students and junior researchers. The Bay Area has a long history of research in discrete mathematics, and San Francisco State University has a strong, internationally recognized combinatorics group. FPSAC 2010 promises to be an excellent opportunity for young researchers to make both domestic and international contacts that are likely to be of great value in developing their careers.</AbstractNarration>
