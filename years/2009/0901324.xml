<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to understand and develop novel graded-grating plasmonic nanostructures, capable of simultaneously slowing or stopping of light at multiple wavelengths, the so-called trapped "rainbow" effect. The approach exploits recent breakthroughs in simulation of metallic nanostructures, and introduces novel designs for this unique nanoplasmonic platform that will enable broadband trapping of light in photonic chips at arbitrary temperatures. Applications include optical buffers for ultra-high capacity optical communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vision of this research is to trap and release broadband light at telecom wavelengths through coupling to surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes in novel graded-grating nanoplasmonic structures. Innovative design and fabrication schemes are advanced to overcome current fundamental performance limitations. Physical mechanisms and performance metrics are investigated by FDTD numerical simulation, including mechanisms for multi-wavelength trapping and release, light coupling enhancement, propagation loss, and pathways for increasing the photon lifetime of SPP modes. Selected experiments will be performed to validate simulations, fabricate nanoplasmonic test structures, and perform near-field imaging of the SPP modes. If successful, it would create a new paradigm for optical buffers in photonic integrated circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide exciting multidisciplinary educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, directly impact Lehigh's photonics curriculum track, and promote K-12 outreach. The research promises fundamental breakthroughs in optical science, could have a transformative impact in the critical field of photonic integrated circuits. If successful it could open the door to commercial enterprises, and have a huge impact on high-capacity optical fiber communications by enabling long sought after optical buffers.</AbstractNarration>
