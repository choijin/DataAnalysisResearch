<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to enhance mathematical proficiency of engineering students in an effort to increase retention of incoming engineering students, especially those who have had limited prior math opportunities. To accomplish the goal the project creates a four-week preparatory distance course for incoming students and develops a set of modules with engineering problems for the Calculus I and Calculus II courses. In addition, the project creates a mentoring system such that upper-level engineering students meet weekly with the calculus students to cover the engineering content of the modules. The mentors provide real time instructive feedback, offer guidance on efficient studying habits and time management, and connect students to campus resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project was to increase student persistence through the creation of two programs that served as curriculum supplements to mathematics education for engineering students. We were specifically interested in creating: 1) a summer bridge to calculus program that minimized mathematical deficiencies of students entering calculus and 2) a series of study sessions to augment calculus instruction that used engineering-themed module problems and engineering peer mentors to illustrate the importance of calculus as an engineering tool.  Summer Bridge to Calculus Program  In the summer bridge to calculus program, our main objective was to review the standard topics of pre-calculus, emphasizing algebra skills, in order to better prepare students for the study of engineering and engineering-related calculus. Our team designed and delivered the course in an online format in summer 2011 and summer 2012. This bridge program was novel because it allowed students to complete the online course at their own pace, thus eliminating the need for students to come to campus prior to the beginning of their first years of undergraduate study.  Desired outcomes of student enrollment and participation in the online calculus preparatory course were to increase student levels of proficiency in pre-calculus concepts and to encourage students to persist in the study of engineering by using a variety of instructional tools. Due to low participation rates (eight students in summer 2011; 11 students in summer 2012), it was difficult to determine a benchmark of student confidence and comfort levels with mathematical concepts. For example, student self-reported levels of preparedness to take calculus after the summer bridge course ranged from "not at all prepared" to "very prepared". However, the majority of students felt at least somewhat confident in their ability to succeed in engineering.  Three instructional tools were used in the summer bridge to calculus course: video lectures, practice problems, and homework assignments. Students indicated that the homework assignments were most helpful because they provided a chance to practice what they learned in the problem sets/worksheets and by watching the video lectures. Some students felt that that they did not feel connected to the material in the homework assignments.   Study Sessions  The objective of the study sessions was to create a constructive learning environment for Calculus I/II students that promoted and supported studentsÆ understanding of how calculus is used in real-world engineering settings. First, real-world engineering problems (16 problems for Calculus I and 15 problems for Calculus II) were created where the solutions required application of calculus concepts. The modules were the result of a collaborative effort between engineering and mathematics faculty.  Students received the modules electronically and were given about one week to attempt to solve them.  They then met in small groups (approximately 4-6 students per group) to discuss their solutions.  Junior- and senior-level engineering students served as peer mentors and guided the small group discussions. There were 12 study groups in fall 2011, 13 study groups in spring 2012, 19 study groups in fall 2012, and nine study groups in spring 2013. On average, the study groups met with their designated peer mentors eight times per semester. Participating students received extra credit in their calculus classes for attending the study sessions and attempting the module problems.  The study sessions provided students with risk-free opportunities to receive real-time feedback on their approach to solving the problems.  This strategy is a significant departure from traditional homework assignments where students receive credit solely based on the quality of their solutions.  Desired outcomes of student participation in the study sessions included increased levels of confidence and comfort in mathematical abilities as well as ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
