<AbstractNarration>This project builds upon a successful NSF-funded Math and Science Partnership that developed a collaborative master's degree program for K-5 Mathematics Specialists (math coaches) in the State of Virginia. The prior work demonstrated that the model enhanced the ability of K-5 teachers who are supported by Mathematics Specialists to provide high quality mathematics instruction, and resulted in improved student achievement on the Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL) tests. The State of Virginia has adopted new licensure standards for Mathematics Specialists. In this project, the original team of collaborating colleges and universities expands the Mathematics Specialist model to rural school systems in Virginia, using a combination of distance and face-to-face learning.  In addition, mechanisms are being provided to support Specialists as they work in remote environments. The research is designed to learn how a new group of rural Mathematics Specialists work in rural school districts, focusing on the impact of mathematics coaches and elementary school teachers as they work together to improve mathematics instruction.  The project examines changes in beliefs about mathematics teaching and learning for mathematics coaches and for elementary math teachers.  It will also measure the impact of the Mathematics Specialist model on K-5 student mathematics achievement. In addition, an extensive case study documents the State of Virginia's policy, legislative and regulatory decisions as the new Mathematics Specialists program is implemented.  The case illuminates how this model for improving elementary mathematics education scales-up and is institutionalized.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study stands to make a substantial contribution to STEM education for several reasons.  First, there is national interest in the use of mathematics coaches as a vehicle to improve elementary mathematics instruction and student outcomes.  This project is providing research on the effectiveness of this well-defined mathematics coach model. Second, research on the effectiveness of distance education for STEM teacher professional development is sorely needed, and this study can provide insights. Third, this is a promising model for studying the scale-up of the use of mathematics coaches in Virginia, and includes how the State's policy environment was affected (or not) by the research results.  Substantial background research has shown that policy decisions often are made without consideration of research results, but this project builds the research results (and researchers) into the policy environment.  Fourth, the master's program for Mathematics Specialists is delivered collaboratively by four different public institutions of higher education in Virginia, and involves public school superintendents and state-level policy makers. This collaboration can illuminate how scale-up occurs, and may influence national policy and practice in elementary mathematics education.</AbstractNarration>
