<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Materials Research provides support to Indiana University to design and conduct research and development on four different types of neutron spin manipulation devices that are required for advanced polarized neutron instrumentation. Most of the design is based on computer simulation of magnetic fields which interact with the neutrons. The principal investigators will construct partial prototypes and test them using polarized neutrons at the Low Energy Neutron Source (LENS) at Indiana University to reduce technical risk for follow-on construction activities. The equipment will result in qualitative and quantitative increases in scientific productivity, on at least six existing or planned spectrometers at the country?s major neutron sources. The broader impact of this proposal consists of providing neutron scattering capabilities that will be available to all users of U.S. national neutron facilities allowing them to obtain scientific information that is currently inaccessible. The project provides opportunity for training of several students who will contribute to the design, construction, and utilization of next generation instruments for neutrons.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcomes report: IMR-MIP#0956741 "Advanced Neutron Spin Manipulation Technology"  The primary goal of this project was to develop new instrumentation that will significantly enhance the sensitivity and flexibility with which materials may be studied for a number of neutron scattering techniques. Neutron scattering provides a wide variety of techniques for investigating the atomic-scale structure and dynamics of materials, and it has provided vital information on a wide variety of materials that are of fundamental importance to todayÆs industrial society. Thanks to the interaction of the neutronÆs intrinsic magnetic moment  with magnetic fields, neutron techniques have provided much of what we know today about the atomic-scale magnetic structure of materials used in digital data storage, magnetic sensing, and the permanent magnets in the innumerable electric motors that permeate our lives.  Similarly, the strong interaction of neutrons with hydrogen has allowed neutron scattering techniques to tell us much about how to control the behavior of the polymer blends that dominate so many of the synthetic fabrics and plastics in todayÆs economy, as well as providing crucial insight into the management of water in the fuel cells that may one day power our vehicles and buildings.  Over the past two decades, a number of neutron techniques have been developed to exploit the neutronÆs magnetic moment in order to increase the precision and/or sensitivity with which specific neutron instruments can probe materials. The devices we have developed can be installed on many general purpose instruments to enable researchers to manipulate the magnetic moment of the neutron (for example, by changing its direction), and thereby realize these enhancements in sensitivity at relatively low cost. This is done by using the high-temperature superconducting material discovered in the late 1980Æs (YBCO) both to produce magnetic fields and to control the geometric shape of those fields very precisely.  Two of the devices we have developed (a "flipper" for reversing the neutron magnetic moment  and "cryo-cup" for rotating that moment through fixed angles about a given axis) will be particularly useful for investigating magnetic materials.  As a part of the project, one of these devices has already been used to investigate the atomic-scale magnetic structure of some magnetic shielding materials being considered for use in a fundamental physics experiment, and the other is being considered for use on a number of instruments at National neutron scattering facilities.  The third device, one that will allow the position and or momentum of a neutron to be "encoded" in the neutronÆs magnetic moment is expected to have a wide variety of applications.  We expect that this device will allow new types of contrast mechanisms to be introduced to neutron imaging instruments to allow unprecedented sensitivity to material and magnetic grain structure. This could be particularly important for understanding the mechanical properties of metallic structures made through Additive Manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing techniques).  The same device can also be used to probe the structure of hierarchical materials on length scales from nanometers up to several microns. Finally, we are starting to explore ways in which this device may be used to provide qualitatively new probes of the strong quantum correlations that are at the heart of many of the materials that most fascinate condensed matter physicist today (so-called strongly correlated electron systems and topological phases).
