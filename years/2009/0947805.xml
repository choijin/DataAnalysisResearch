<AbstractNarration>This travel award supports participation in the 3rd IEEE Workshop on Enabling the Future Service-Oriented Internet (EFSOI): Towards Socially-Aware Networks take place in conjunction with IEEE Globecom 2009, in Honolulu, HI. December 4, 2009. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technical workshop is a relative new venue for presenting new research results in the fast emerging area in networking, namely that of service-oriented and socially-aware networks. The workshop recognizes the convergence of various communications technologies and the emergence of a number of socio-technical applications leading to a crucial national need to engage and educate the next generation of researchers and educators in the modeling and understanding of service oriented infrastructures, networks and virtual collaboration systems. Thus attendance at EFSOI provides a valuable a research and career development experience for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers from United States academic institutions. Participants will have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, and interact with peers engaged in state-of-the-art research in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 10-15 US-based graduate students and post-doctoral researchers are provided the opportunity to attend EFSOI. The travel awards will target graduate students, in particular female and under-represented minority students, since they often have limited travel funds to attend workshops; attendance at such events is an important part of their educational experience.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
