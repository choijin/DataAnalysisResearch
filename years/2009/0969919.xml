<AbstractNarration>String theory is a very rich subject, with a history full of surprises. Born as a model of the strong nuclear force, it was recognized in the mid-1970s as a theory of quantum gravity, and in the mid-1980s as a candidate unified theory of all particle interactions. In the last decade, it has partly gone back to its original roots, giving insights into the the strong interactions. This project has a dual research goal: (i) to investigate conceptual and fundamental aspects of string theory, and its relations to mathematics;  and (ii) to use string theory as a language and a tool, especially to obtain insights into the dynamics of ordinary quantum  field theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  The PI intends to develop and teach graduate classes, deliver special lectures, and organize weekly graduate seminars.  The research to be performed as part of this project is also envisioned to be instrumental in the training of thesis students and Stony Brook postdocs, who will be directly involved as collaborators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research carried out in this project lies at the intersection of quantum field theory and string theory.   Answering certain questions of principle and sharpening our tools may be necessary before string theory can live upto the promise of being a calculable, fundamental theory of Nature. Fortunately, however, independently of its more ambitious goals as a unified theory, string theory has become almost a universal language  for theoretical physics, while continuing to inspire new mathematics.  Some of the most interesting recent  theoretical developments have been in quantum field theory, but with ideas and methods often inspired by string theory. In fact  is increasingly difficult to draw a sharp distinction between string theory and modern quantum field theory.   One of  main goals of this project is to explore and chart the space of conformal field theories (CFTs)  in various spacetime dimensions, relying as much as possible on general symmetry principles and internal consistency requirements. Conformal field theories are theories with no intrinsic length scale, and as such are the signposts in the larger space of all quantum field theories.Indeed low-energy and high-energy behaviors of a general quantum field theory aredescribed by conformal field theories. Conformal field theories play a central role in theoretical physics, both because of their diverse physical applications and because of their manifold connections with contemporary mathematics. Understanding the CFT landscape has a conceptual kinship with the harder problem of making sense of the string theory landscape,and in fact should  be viewed a special case of the latter.   Our main working hypothesis, validated by actual results, is that ``not anything goes''. On the contrary, internal consistency requirements appear to be very stringent. Theory space is not uniformly filled! Armed with modern computational techniques, we have found that  general consistency requirements impose surprisingly powerful constraints on conformal field theories. Our results are helping to helping, on the one hand, to get a picture of the whole space of possible CFTs; on the other hand, they allow to investigate  in detail  a few theories of special physical or mathematical interest.
