<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational and theoretical research, and education aimed at investigation of a range of fast non-equilibrium processes responsible for material modification and surface nanostructuring by pico- and femtosecond scale laser pulses. The research involves large-scale simulation and has potential for making a transformative impact on the fundamental understanding of material response and microstructure evolution under extreme conditions of ultrafast heating and cooling, as well as for opening new directions for controlled laser material modification with nanoscale resolution. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research program is to reveal, through large-scale atomistic simulations, the fundamental processes responsible for the modification of surface microstructure of metal targets irradiated by short laser pulses. A computational model combining the molecular dynamics method with a continuum description of the electron heat conduction and electron-phonon coupling will be used to perform a detailed analysis of the mechanisms of laser-induced generation of crystal defects and their role in the evolution of surface microstructure and atomic mixing. The conditions leading to the formation of a nanocrystalline surface structure and the atomic-level processes controlling the nucleation and growth of crystallites within a strongly undercooled liquid region of the target will be investigated with a particular focus on the effect of the free surface on the nucleation kinetics and crystallographic orientation of the new grains. The relative contribution of different diffusive and non-diffusive mechanisms of atomic mixing occurring under conditions of rapid melting/solidification, plastic deformation and laser-induced supersaturation with point defects will be investigated in combined molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations performed for binary alloys and multi-layered targets. The physical processes responsible for the formation/stabilization of metastable crystalline and amorphous phases will be investigated and related to the irradiation conditions in short pulse laser processing. &lt;br/&gt;This award supports educational initiatives in the areas of scientific computing and laser-materials interactions include the active involvement of graduate and undergraduate students into various aspects of high-performance computing, development of a new graduate course on Laser-Materials Interactions, as well as incorporation of the research results into an existing course, Introduction to Atomistic Simulations. The PI will continue to maintain close contacts with the Office of Minority Programs in recruiting undergraduate students from traditionally under-represented groups. International collaborations with groups from Germany, France, Russia, and Iraq will involve short and long-term mutual visits and will enrich the educational and cultural experience of the participating graduate and undergraduate students. The educational component of this project also includes a design of an interactive web-site ?Materials under Extreme Conditions.? A non-technical description of general concepts of ultrafast materials phenomena induced by short pulse laser irradiation will be illustrated by the research results obtained in this program and presented in the form of images, computer animations, and simple interactive simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Surface modification by laser irradiation is in the core of many modern processing and fabrication techniques, including laser surface alloying, annealing, hardening, and amorphization.  The ability of short pulse laser irradiation to produce unique surface morphologies, metastable phases and microstructure (arrangement of crystal defects) has been demonstrated in numerous studies and is generally attributed to the conditions of strong electronic, thermal, phase, and mechanical non-equilibrium created in irradiated targets by the fast laser excitation.  Detailed understanding of the relations between the basic mechanisms of laser interaction with materials, non-equilibrium processes caused by the fast deposition of laser energy, and the resulting microstructure and properties of laser-treated regions of the targets, however, is still lacking, thus limiting the expansion of laser technologies into the new domain of nanoscale material processing and fabrication.  In the NSF-sponsored research, Professor Zhigilei and his team at the University of Virginia are developing advanced computational tools for simulation of laser interactions with materials and apply these tools for detailed analysis of the mechanisms of mass transport, phase transformations, and microstructure development under highly non-equilibrium conditions created by the fast laser energy deposition.  Several examples of research finding in this project are illustrated in the images included with this report and are listed below.  (1) prediction of nanocrystalline structure of nanoscale surface features generated by highly localized excitation of a thin metal film [J. Appl. Phys. 107, 013519, 2010];  (2) explanation of a surprising observation of laser melting of nanocrystalline metals at temperatures below the equilibrium melting temperature [J. Phys. Chem. C 114, 5686, 2010];  (3) analysis of the complex three-dimensional corrugated structure of lattice-mismatched interface generated in laser processing of Cu-Ag layered target [Appl. Phys. A 104, 781, 2011];  (4) explanation of the origins of experimentally observed bimodal nanoparticle size distribution in laser ablation of thin films [Appl. Phys. Lett. 104, 193106, 2014];  (5) establishment of links between the microscopic mechanisms of laser ablation of metal targets and the parameters of the ejected plume [Appl. Phys. A 114, 11, 2014];  (6) elucidation of distinct characteristics of laser interactions with a metal target under conditions of spatial confinement by a solid transparent overlayer [J. Appl. Phys. 115, 183501, 2014];  (7) establishment of a "processing map" exposing the range of parameters suitable for the ejection of intact biomolecules in matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) with smallest possible amount of "matrix" [J. Phys. Chem. B 118, 13290, 2014];  (8) prediction of the generation of sub-surface voids and nanocrystalline surface layer with random crystallographic orientation of nanograins and a high density of stacking faults, twins, and nanoscale twinned structural elements with five-fold symmetry [Phys. Rev. B 91, 035413, 2015].  The results obtained within this program are reported in 17 invited and 26 contributed presentations, 16 publications, 1 Ph.D. thesis, and one undergraduate thesis.  The broader impact of this program is in the implications of the physical insights revealed in this project for the advancement of laser applications based on controlled surface modification at the nanoscale and the development of new experimental techniques for generation of surface structures with unusual non-equilibrium structures and compositions.  At the educational front, the project has provided training and multidisciplinary research experience to three graduate students, three undergraduate students, and a high-school teacher participating in this project with support of the NSF Summer Research Experience for Teachers program.
