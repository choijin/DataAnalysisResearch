<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ I.  Project Activities and Findings:  a)  Research   Operational funding for R/V Atlantic Explorer Oceanographic Technical Services has supported scientific research, marine education and technology development that improve scientific knowledge of societal relevant environmental issues.   Technical services provided include:  Communication and Coordination: Pre-cruise Planning Maintenance, Repair, Storage and Calibration of shared use instrumentation and equipment Hardware and Software Development: Ongoing improvements of vessel capabilities and recurrent training for technicians Data Archiving:  Back up of all data and submission of data through Rolling Deck to Depository (R2R) Program which makes all data available to scientists worldwide Cruise Mobilization and De-mobilization Logistics At Sea: Science Equipment Deployments, Instrumentation Support, Computer and Network Maintenance, Navigation and Communications Equipment Support   Many of the major research projects that use the R/V Atlantic Explorer are oceanographic time-series efforts (http://www.bios.edu/research/time_series.html). For example, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) is an oceanographic time-series project funded by NSF. The BATS program, begun in 1988, is now in its 24th year and focuses on low frequency variability of the ocean (http://www.bios.edu/research/bats.html) over annual to decadal timescales. This is a truly unique program and our understanding of the Sargasso Sea ecosystem is continually improving due to this research.  Time-series measurements are a major focus of U.S. and international ocean science research plans and ocean-observing networks supported by NSF.  The Hydrostation "S" sampling program has been conducted at roughly biweekly intervals for the past 55 years (http://www.bios.edu/research/hydrostation.html). This is the longest continuously running ocean time-series program in the world. This long-term record has proved to be immensely valuable, showing a clear increase in sub-surface temperatures of nearly 1&deg;C over the past half century. Vertical profiles of temperature, salinity and oxygen are available for the entire period; the data from the first 30 years are available at the BIOS website (http://www.bios.edu).   Another important time series program in the waters near Bermuda is the Ocean Flux Program, which measures the sinking flux of particles at several depths below 500 m, has been ongoing for three decades (http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/conte/ofp/).   In 2010, several moorings as part of the Dr. Ruth Curry (WHOI) program to study Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) were deployed from the R/V Atlantic Explorer and recovered during 2012. The ship is an ideal platform for conducting mooring operations and is strategically located for supporting mooring work throughout the central Atlantic region.  These major time-series programs have spawned numerous ancillary research projects and process-oriented studies in the past and this number looks to grow substantially in the future.   This  has increased the increased the importance of excellent Marine Technical Services Support.   b) Education   The R/V Atlantic Explorer operations are important contributors to education, training and public outreach.  Given the proximity of Hydrostation "S" and BATS to Bermuda, these cruises serve an important educational role in training future generations of potential oceanographers. At a time when fewer and fewer new scientists are going to sea, the importance of recruiting these new scientists and providing sea-going training experience is critical.   The R/V Atlantic Explorer also contains the only classroom in the UNOLS fleet that has been designed primarily for undergraduate education.  II.  Justification and Cost   NSF Award OCE-0936341 in the amount of $1,068,054 (cumulative amount) has supported the day to day Oceanographic Technical Services Program of the R/V Atlantic Explorer.   The R/V Atlantic Explorer is...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
