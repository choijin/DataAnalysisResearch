<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this projects is to provide a new set of laboratory data &lt;br/&gt;to understand the deep mantle water cycling. Possible melting near the &lt;br/&gt;410-km and its consequence on geochemical cycling have been speculated. &lt;br/&gt;However, there have been no definitive studies on the conditions for &lt;br/&gt;partial melting under the deep upper mantle conditions. Consequently &lt;br/&gt;there have been large uncertainties on the critical water content. In &lt;br/&gt;this proposal, our efforts are focused on determining the critical &lt;br/&gt;water content for partial melting near 410-km depth. The critical water &lt;br/&gt;content for partial melting is a critical parameter to understand the &lt;br/&gt;deep water cycling including the origin and evolution of the ocean mass &lt;br/&gt;and the processes to control the water content in the upper mantle. In &lt;br/&gt;this project, we will use electrical conductivity to determine the &lt;br/&gt;onset of partial melting and consequently, the results of this work &lt;br/&gt;will also provide a critical new data set to interpret the distribution &lt;br/&gt;of electrical conductivity in terms of temperature and water content in &lt;br/&gt;the mantle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conditions for partial melting involving water are difficult to &lt;br/&gt;determine experimentally. We will investigate the phase diagram of &lt;br/&gt;water + peridotite system by measuring electrical conductivity. we &lt;br/&gt;anticipate that the onset of partial melting will dramatically change &lt;br/&gt;the conductivity and consequently, by measuring the electrical &lt;br/&gt;conductivity, we should be able to detect a small degree of partial &lt;br/&gt;melting. Experiments will be conducted using an impedance spectroscopy &lt;br/&gt;with a multianvil apparatus under the conditions of P (pressure) =4-16 &lt;br/&gt;GPa, and T (temperature) = 1000-1900 K. The partial melting will be &lt;br/&gt;detected by a jump in conductivity as well as the change in the trace &lt;br/&gt;element concentrations. The results have an important implication for &lt;br/&gt;the deep mantle water cycling as well as the interpretation of &lt;br/&gt;electrical conductivity.</AbstractNarration>
