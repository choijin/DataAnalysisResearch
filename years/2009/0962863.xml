<AbstractNarration>The Poincaré Institute for Mathematics Education, led by Tufts University, in collaboration with TERC, with Dover, NH, School District as core partner, and partner districts in Massachusetts (Fitchburg, Leominster, Medford, Medway, and Somerville), New Hampshire (Dover, Sanborn, and Timberlane), and Maine (Portland), seeks to transform and improve the teaching and learning of mathematics in middle school and the connections between the elementary, middle, and high school curricula. The project's work will directly benefit 180 in-service and 24 new teachers and, each year, more than 2200 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on successful NSF-funded collaborations between Tufts and TERC - the Fulcrum Institute, the Early Algebra, Early Arithmetic Project, and the Inquiry Project, the Partnership leverages expertise from mathematicians, physicists, educational researchers, and school districts to: (a) create graduate-level online courses on mathematical content, research in mathematics education, and mathematical knowledge for teaching, offered to three cohorts of in-service teachers (grades 5 to 9) from three states; (b) use algebra and the mathematics of functions and modeling for promoting coherence among topics in the mathematics curriculum; (c) implement permanent discussion forums where teachers plan, review (using video technology), and improve their lessons, drawing upon the critical mathematical topics and issues of learning and teaching; (d) strengthen and expand partnerships with schools by preparing teachers and researchers in Tufts' graduate programs in Mathematics and Education, through internships with teacher leaders and participation in educational research; (e) conduct research on teacher development and student learning; (f) support school districts' efforts to improve their mathematics curriculum; and (g) disseminate a teacher development model for adoption by other university-school partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project rests on the premise that to improve students' learning one needs to broaden and deepen teachers' understanding of mathematics, of how children think and learn, and of mathematics knowledge for teaching. The Poincaré Institute offers an interdisciplinary, research-based model for introducing a deeper, integrated approach to mathematics in districts where minority and under-privileged students typically underperform. The courses, materials, and examples of effective teaching are free, open-source, cross-platform modules that universities and schools can use and modify under Creative Commons licensing. The partnership also contributes to the preparation of teachers, research students, and post-doctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>

Between 2010 and 2018, 238 teachers, special educators, coaches, and coordinators completed the Institute&rsquo;s program.&nbsp;</p> <p>Courses in the program, designed jointly by mathematicians, mathematics educators, and physicists, deepen teachers' understanding of mathematics by interweaving algebra and functions throughout the K-12 curriculum, promoting multiple representations, and addressing how mathematics learning emerges from discussing and solving contextualized problems.&nbsp;Program participants discuss mathematics and pedagogical content, solve mathematical problems, analyze videotaped lessons, interview their students, design, implement, and evaluate learning activities, and jointly analyze students&rsquo; ways of thinking and learning. Materials for the three program courses include (a) over 600&nbsp;pages of weekly readings, with challenge questions and exemplary responses, (b) readings from mathematics education research, (c) in-house software apps for exploring mathematical concepts, (d) video lectures, and (e) videoclips of selected classroom episodes highlighting topics related to the teaching and learning of middle-school mathematics.</p> <p>External evaluators&rsquo; systematic observations of classroom lessons by teachers in the program showed statistically significant gains in student engagement, mathematical questioning, reasoning, and problem solving. In addition, students increasingly explained their thinking, engaged in dialogue and questioning, and collaborated with their peers.&nbsp;The teachers were more inclined to use drawings, bar diagrams, number lines, data tables, algebra notation, and graphs and increasingly made connections among different math concepts and between algebraic and geometrical representations. Furthermore, they more often used tools and technology, worked with contextualized problems, encouraged students to use variables and to think algebraically, listened to students, and displayed longer wait times. These findings were manifested in improvements in classroom ratings.&nbsp;The sample of 48 teachers significantly improved their ratings by 6 points (ES = 0.30) over the course of the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;A follow-up of a sub-sample of 23 teachers shows that their teaching improved by 14 points (ES=0.69) from the start to the end of the year following the courses (Figures 1 and 2).&nbsp;</p> <p>Students in the five Massachusetts&nbsp;districts whose teachers enrolled in the Poincar&eacute; Institute showed significant gains on the state-mandated mathematics assessment (MCAS) over the years. Figure 3 shows changes in the percentage of Advanced and Proficient students in target districts (middle graph). &nbsp;These were correlated with the percentage of participating teachers in districts. It also shows MCAS gains/losses in districts matched with the target district according to prior MCAS results (2010-2011), racial/ethnic composition, family income, and percentage of students in free-lunch programs. In the 2013-2014 school year, the mathematics achievement of target district students surpassed that of students from matched districts. &nbsp;Furthermore, the initial 2010-2011&nbsp;gap between students in the state and those in the target district was roughly halved by 2013-2014.</p> <p>In 2015-2016 the majority of middle school teachers of mathematics in a multi-ethnic district enrolled in the program. This enabled an evaluation of the relative contribution of the Institute to African-American, Hispanic/Latino, and white students&rsquo; performance on the then mandated state assessment (PARCC). Figure 4 shows significant PARCC gains in all three ethnic groups in the target district.&nbsp; No such gains were found in matched school districts or in the state, where only white students showed significant gains.</p> <p>Over the years, the Poincar&eacute; Institute has offered training and employment in Mathematics Education to 12 graduate students in Mathematics, 6 graduate students in Education, 6 post-doctoral fellows, 7 public school teachers and two undergraduate students. &nbsp;All presently occupy academic and industry positions in the US and abroad or are completing their education.</p> <p>Few previous studies show that teacher development programs contribute to&nbsp;student&nbsp;achievement (see analyses by Bautista and Ortega-Ruiz, 2015, Hill, 2007, and Sztajn et al., 2017).
