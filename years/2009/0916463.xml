<AbstractNarration>The field of bioinformatics and computational biology is experiencing a data revolution unlike any other scientific computing field. Experimental techniques to procure data have increased in throughput, improved in accuracy, and reduced in costs. The preponderance of data has limited the scalability of existing software tools. In a pursuit to understand the complexities and challenges that stem from designing algorithms for data-intensive biocomputing, this project is developing new approaches for two major problems in protein bioinformatics: i) identification of protein families and homology clusters; and ii) peptide identification from large-scale mass spectrometry data. The former requires large-scale graph analysis and the latter requires large-scale database search. The project is investigating a multi-faceted approach which involves designing space-efficient algorithms for massively parallel machines, developing algorithmic heuristics for reducing the time to solution, evaluating the MapReduce paradigm as an alternate computing model, and deploying multicore architectures for fine-grain parallelism. Project outcomes will include new algorithms and open-source software libraries for large-scale protein bioinformatics, including a more generic library for data-intensive biocomputing. The project is addressing a critical need for scalable methods in protein bioinformatics and in doing so will usher in state-of-the-art computing models and concepts from both software and hardware into mainstream biocomputing. Broader impacts include creating interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and new interdisciplinary curricula at high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. Education materials will be disseminated through a partnership program with Shodor Education Foundation, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project homepage: http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~ananth/DataIntensive-Biocomputing/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

To the best of our knowledge our efforts represent the first exploration of the emerging NoC architectural platform for biological computing;  iv)                 Cloud-enabled solutions for peptide identification from mass spectral data (proteomics); and  v)                   New metrics and empirical models for comparing different schemes of data distribution on parallel machines with the goal of reducing communication.  At a more high level, the project allowed us to answer the following questions:  What are the challenges involved in designing large-scale graph analytics and what are the kind of algorithmic techniques and heuristic that are best suited from both a qualitative and performance scaling perspective? What are the advantages and limitations imposed by the various architectural choices that exist today in modern day supercomputers (viz. distributed memory, shared memory multicore) on the design of such graph analytic applications?  What similar challenges and solutions are suited for database search-oriented applications in biocomputing? Can more loosely coupled parallel models such as cloud computing be also used for such applications? Can emerging hardware architectures which contain on-chip networks be used for performing the calculations involved in various data-intensive biological applications? What are the performance gains that can be estimated from such platforms, and what are the performance vs. energy cost tradeoffs involved in such custom designs?  With data becoming too big to fit in any one compute nodeÆs memory, what are some of the more effective ways to partition/distribute input data on parallel machines so as to reduce the overheads introduced during computation due to data movement?   As with any research project, several open questions remain and the project has allowed us to identify new lines of inquiry in the future. Yet, it is expected that the contributions made in this project has firmly laid the foundation that is necessary to answer some of the most challenging and timely questions that outline modern day data-intensive biocomputing.  Broader impact: The project has led to the support, training and advising of numerous students who represent the next generation scientific workforce in the interdisciplinary research area of computational life sciences. More specifically, over the course of the projectÆs 4 years since 2009, the project has supported (in full or in part) the training and advising of 6 PhD students (incl. 1 female), 3 MS students (incl. 1 female), and 8 undergraduate researchers (incl. 1 female).
