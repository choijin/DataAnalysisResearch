<AbstractNarration>This instrument development project will design and build a tandem, double-focusing, high-resolution, high-sensitivity, electron impact, gas source, mass spectrometer. The purpose of the instrument is to analyze rare, doubly-substituted isotopologues of gases occurring in volcanic plumes, geothermal hot springs, hydrocarbon reservoirs, deep crustal microbial communities, gas hydrates, soils, and Earth's atmosphere.  The list of gases to be investigated with the proposed instrument includes N2 (15N15N), O2 (17O18O, 18O18O), CH4, N2O, SO2, and OCS but is not limited to them exclusively.  The investigation of clumped isotope isotopologue distributions in naturally occurring samples confers the advantage of deriving information on temperature of synthesis of gas species from the measurement of a single phase.  It is possible that kinetic isotope fractionation effects accompanying synthesis reactions may provide data on the prevalence of specific reaction mechanisms. An extensive program of experimental calibration will be required to assess both the geothermometric potential and kinetic isotope effects of clumped isotopologues with the new instrument. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcome of use of the proposed instrument is to acquire a deeper understanding of present-day atmosphere-hydrosphere-lithosphere interactions.  The improved knowledge of the modern world will then be used to develop calibrated interpretations of ancient atmospheric proxies in the geologic record.  The ultimate goal is to understand the chemical evolution of Earth's atmosphere with as great a time resolution as permitted by available samples such as polar ice cores or rock strata.  The use of a new mass spectrometer of unprecedented capability is likely to give rise to applications that cannot be predicted.  In the context of broader impact on human society, the study of trace greenhouse gases such as CH4 and N2O will contribute to evaluating global warming and climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to construct a gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometer with sufficient mass resolving power to measure the relative abundances of rare isotopic species of methane gas.  The science goal was to provide a new isotopic tool for sourcing methane. In particular, the new instrument was designed to measure the relative abundances of both 13CH3D and 12CH2D2, two very stable but very rare doubly-substituted isotopologues with the same cardinal mass of 18 atomic mass units, allowing us to move beyond temperature of formation as the sole information to be obtained from 13C-D bond ordering. Studies made possible with this novel instrument should provide new information about the mode of formation, presence of mixing, and importance of migration of natural CH4 gas.  Results will facilitate sourcing fugitive methane as well as helping to specify the origin of gas where provenance is uncertain.  The new mass spectrometer, called the Panorama, was delivered to UCLA in early March of 2015 (Figure 1).  It is currently functioning beyond expectations in the purpose-built laboratory at UCLA.  This instrument, the largest of its kind in the world, was developed for our laboratory at UCLA and is unique.  The basic components are shown schematically in Figure 2.  The magnetic sector has a radius of 800 mm that, when combined with typical slit widths and aberrations yields an operational mass resolving power of ~ 45,000, more than 40 times that of conventional gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometers and three times the operational value for the next highest resolution instrument of its kind.  Sensitivity is provided by an ion counter on the central channel (Figure 2).  With this instrument we measure &Delta;13CH3D and &Delta;CH2D2, where &Delta; here refers to per mil  departures from the stochastic relative abundances of these rare species, with virtually no mass spectrometric interferences and no corrections.
