<AbstractNarration>The cognitive radio technology is a promising technology to overcome the imbalance between the increase in the spectrum access demand and the inefficiency in the spectrum usage by allowing dynamic spectrum access. Seamless mobility is considered as a critical component to ensure the success of cognitive radio network (CRN) deployment, but unfortunately, is under-explored in the literature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this project is to develop new policies and algorithms for providing seamless mobility support in cognitive radio wireless networks (CRNs). The approach involves identifying the new issues in the mobility support caused by the changing spectrum environment in CRNs, exploiting the varying spectrum opportunities in time and space domains, proactively utilizing the spectrum opportunities for mobility preparations, and optimizing the performance via spectrum-adaptive mobility management schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide innovative mobility support techniques to numerous applications of the CRN technology. It will also have significant impacts on research in emerging technologies with high mobility scenarios, such as vehicular networks, and opportunistic interconnections of heterogeneous wireless networks. This project provides an excellent opportunity for graduate and undergraduate research students to gain valuable educational training and research experiences. The research results will be presented at IEEE journals and international conferences. In addition, the PI plans to organize a workshop and a journal special issue to enhance the understanding and promote research discussions on seamless mobility in wireless networks.</AbstractNarration>
