<AbstractNarration>0949303&lt;br/&gt;Andrus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable the purchase of an isotope ratio mass spectrometer, an in-line continuous flow carbonate/CO2 extraction device, and ancillary equipment to couple the new instrumentation to existing devices. The major analytical requirements are carbon and oxygen isotope analysis in accretionary carbonates, like mollusks, brachiopods, corals, fish and speleothems. Deuterium and oxygen isotope ratios are also routinely analyzed in water samples. Other research focuses on nitrogen isotope variability in biominerals and organic sediments. Research foci are biomineralization, terrestrial and marine paleoclimate reconstructions, paleoecology, geoarchaeology, and collaborative efforts with anthropologists marine biologists. This grant will allow the facility to have two parallel IRMS set-ups - decreasing maintenance and repair and allowing higher data throughput. The PIs will also be able to analyze deuterium isotopes in continuous flow obviating off-line preparation for later dual-inlet measurement. The Alabama Stable Isotope Lab is currently directed by the co-PI. A full-time research technician is supported by the institution. Day-to-day maintenance is supported by PIs' research grants and user fees. Currently, income exceeds maintenance and expendables costs. The stable isotope lab is routinely used for graduate and undergraduate courses. Research courses for undergraduates also utilize stable isotope measurements (hands on). Undergraduates are routinely hired for hourly lab work and thus receive training. A second IRMS will allow enhanced student use. Several K-12 outreach programs currently use the facility. A McNair Scholar program exists for stimulating underrepresented student participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
