<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incorporation of audio and tactile tools for making simulated experiments in virtual biology laboratories accessible to blind and low vision students are being explored. Students and consultants with visual impairments are participating in the development and testing of different techniques for presenting screen information and for allowing interactions with simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The immediate goal is the development of a set of techniques that will allow participation of a more diverse set of students in inquiry-based biology labs, including visually impaired students for whom most traditional biology labs are inaccessible. Ultimately, this focused project should help improve simulated laboratories for all students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The techniques being developed are breaking down some of the challenges facing those with visual impairments in the pursuit of scientific careers. In addition to directly benefiting the students who use the Simbiotic labs, the results of this project will be published in both technical and non-technical forms to inform and inspire other educational software developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is partially supported by funds from the Research in Disabilities Education program and the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Emerging Frontiers Division.</AbstractNarration>

Audible Graph Survey  The second track in this study was to create an audible survey to look for where Audible Graphs are likely to be most useful. The survey was divided into five parts.  1. Interpreting single simple data sets on a graph through audio alone.  2. Distinguishing two independent curves on one graph.  3. Distinguishing the temporal relationship between two simple curves on one graph.  4. Distinguishing a relationship between two more complex data sets on one graph.  5. Collecting feedback on sound preferences, and any general comments on the approach.  In all parts, we asked whether certain types of sounds made the interpretation easier than others  Close to 500 participants took the survey, of which approximately 1/4 were blind or low-vision.

Intellectual Merit  There has until now been a paucity of formal research into specific practical ways of making complex science education software more accessible. Although general psychology studies can provide some guidance, the particular needs of science software need to be investigated in their own right. This project has shown some techniques that can be used to make one important aspect of most science software, the graph, more accessible to blind and low vision students. In doing so, we have highlighted places where accessibility is limited in the appro...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
