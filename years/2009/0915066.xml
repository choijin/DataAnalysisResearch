<AbstractNarration>As computer simulations are playing an ever increasing role in many branches of science and engineering and are rapidly replacing much of the expensive prototyping and testing phases in manufacturing and in science explorations, fast and robust numerical methods are becoming an indispensable tool for many scientists and engineers.  The focus of this project is to design auurate, fast and robust spectral methods for solving a large class of partial differential equations, and apply them to investigate several important problems of current interest. The proposed research will result in fast and accurate numerical algorithms for a class of partial differential equations with applications in acoustic and electromagnetic scattering, complex fluids and materials science.  In particular, the proposed numerical algorithms will make it possible to directly solve some important high-dimensional equations which are currently not treatable with existing numerical algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the proposed numerical simulations will enable us to handle challenging problems having stringent accuracy and/or memory requirements with a reasonable cost in CPU and turn-around time, contribute towards better understandings of the complex physical and mathematical problems, and provide valuable information for the design of advanced materials and on the rheological and hydrodynamic properties of complex fluids.  Another important goal of this project is to engage graduate and undergraduate students in learning necessary skills of computational and applied mathematics so that they can pursue a successful career in sciences and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Some of the significant intellectual contrinutions include:   1. The  numerical algorithms that we developed for high-dimensional problems make it possible to directly solve some important high-dimensional equations which are currently not treatable with existing numerical algorithms, and provide capabilities to numerically solving challenging problems arising from emerging engineering and scientific applications.   2. We constructed a class of efficient and accurate schemes for solving Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations which play important roles in materials science.   3. We developed phase-field models for two-phase incompressible flows with different densities, and constructed efficient, energy stable schemes for them. These schemes are particularly effective for dealing with two-phase flows with large denstiy ratios.   4. We implemented efficient  numerical schemes for two-phase complex fluids, and carried out numerical simulations  for nematic lyquid crystal droplets in a  viscoelastic fluid. We simulated the deformation and rupture of nematic droplets, identified the formation of surface topological defects, and explored the shear and normal stress distributions that accompany the evolution.     The efficient and accurate numerical algorithms that we developed will allow us to carry out numerical simulations for a variety of challenging problems, and contribute towards better understandings of the complex physical and mathematical problems, and provide valuable information for the design of advanced materials and on the rheological and hydrodynamic properties of complex fluids.
