<AbstractNarration>The mass of an atom is one of its most basic properties. Precise measurements of atomic masses have applications to many fields of physical science including nuclear physics, high-energy (particle) physics, astrophysics, physical chemistry, and the determination of the fundamental constants of nature. Currently the world?s most precise measurements of atomic mass are made with the Florida State University cryogenic "Penning Trap Mass Spectrometer". Making use of unique system features, e.g. the trapping and manipulation of one or two individual ions by a combination of electric and magnetic fields in an ultra-high vacuum, and the detection of their tiny motions using superconducting electronics, atomic mass measurements will be made with a fractional precision approaching 10 parts-per-trillion. These measurements, when combined with the results of other research, will impact fundamental scientific questions such as: what is the mass of the neutrino, the lightest known fundamental particle, and does Quantum Electrodynamics, currently the most accurately tested theory in physics, accurately predict the magnetic moment of the electron?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precision Penning trap techniques also have applications to analytical mass spectrometry, which is crucial to chemical analysis and trace chemical detection for National Security. The award also provides a unique research experience for post-doctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students in precision mass spectrometry, encompassing a broad range of precision measurement and experimental techniques. This prepares them for scientific and technological careers in industry, the national laboratories and academe, consequently benefiting the nation's economy and the solution of pressing national problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Precise values for atomic masses have many applications in chemistry and physics. For instance, because of the equivalence of energy and mass through "E = mc2", atomic mass differences determine the energy released in nuclear reactions. Although a large body of data already exists for the masses of the stable (or long-lived) isotopes, there are several scientifically important applications where measurements at still higher precision are required. By developing and operating a unique, cryogenic, Penning trap atomic mass spectrometer, that was previously (up to 2003) developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and which makes measurements using single atomic ions, various atomic mass measurements motivated by these applications have been carried out. The fractional precision of the results varies from 0.2 to 0.05 parts per billion. In most cases, they are more precise than previous results by a factor of 10 or more.     With application to other precision measurements, which use laser-cooled atoms to determine the fundamental physical constant known as the "fine-structure constant", results were obtained for the atomic masses of the alkali-metal isotopes 6Li, 23Na, 39,41K, 85,87Rb and 133Cs; for the alkaline-earth-metal isotopes 86,87,88Sr; and for 170,171,172,173,174,176Yb. These atoms can be cooled and manipulated using lasers because of their special electronic structure. These other precision experiments use interference between atomic de Broglie waves to obtain precise values for the quantity h/Matom, where h is PlanckÆs constant, and Matom is the mass of the atom. A precise value for the fine-structure constant is obtained by combining h/Matom, and other precision measurement results, with the atomic mass of the particular atom &ndash; as measured with the Penning trap. So far, this has been carried out with the highest precision for 87Rb and 133Cs, but experiments with other isotopes are being developed. (The fine-structure constant quantifies the interaction between charged particles at the quantum level. A comparison of precise values obtained from different physical systems provides a precise test of the self-consistency of physics.)     Atoms whose masses have been very accurately measured are used as reference masses for calibrating less precise mass spectrometers used in nuclear physics research. Since ions of rare-gas isotopes are particularly convenient for calibrating these spectrometers, measurements were made of the rare-gas isotopes 82,83Kr and 131,134Xe. Together with previous measurements, these results complete a set of precision measurements of the atomic masses of all the isotopes of Kr and Xe with relative abundances more than 3%.     After these measurements the Penning trap mass spectrometer was modified to enable measurements of the atomic masses of the lightest atoms, the isotopes of hydrogen and helium. The outcomes of this were precise measurements of the atomic masses of 3T (tritium) and 3He (helium-3), and their difference.  The difference between the atomic masses of 3T and 3He gives the total energy released when tritium undergoes radioactive beta-decay to 3He. This energy release, known as the "Q-value", will also be measured by a large international experiment known as KATRIN, whose principal aim is to set a 10-fold-reduced upper-limit on the mass of the electron neutrino.  (Neutrinos are extremely light and weakly interacting fundamental particle that pervades the universe, whose absolute masses are unknown. Knowledge of their mass impacts both particle physics and cosmology.) The Penning trap result will not directly affect KATRINÆs results for neutrino mass. However, comparison of the Penning trap measurement with the KATRIN measurement of the Q-value will provide verification that systematic errors in the KATRIN experiment are understood, hence helping validate KATRINÆs results for neutrino mass.
