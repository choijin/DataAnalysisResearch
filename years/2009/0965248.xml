<AbstractNarration>0965248&lt;br/&gt;Jaworski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Justin Jaworski to work with Drs. Nigel Peake and Timothy J. Pedley at the University of Cambridge in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Owls employ multiple noise suppression features to reduce their acoustic signature within the hearing sensitivity of their prey, much of which is shared by human audition.  Two of these noise suppression features, a soft, fibrous velvet material located at certain areas of a wing and an elastic, serrated trailing edge, are thought to work in concert to reduce the effect of background turbulence on noise scattering and to dissipate sound within a large frequency bandwidth.  Despite recent efforts to quantify the aeroacoustic effect of a soft coating experimentally, a viable theoretical model does not currently exist.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present research systematically addresses the aeroacoustic impact of these noise suppression mechanisms and isolates the impact of porous media acoustics from the aerodynamic influence of the velvet coating on the flow field.  In this manner, the results from the proposed research can be compared directly against experiment and state-of-the-art aeroacoustic computations.  Each of the owl noise suppression mechanisms is reduced to physically consistent models that extend analytical aeroacoustics results in the research literature, culminating in a generalized and unified aerodynamic and aeroacoustic framework for a novel computational design tool.  The design tool and principles developed from this work will enable quieter future designs for fixed and flapping wing micro air vehicles (MAVs) that operate in flow regimes similar to owls.  Lessons learned from this research may also inform sound reduction techniques for lifting surfaces at higher Reynolds and Mach numbers including functionally-silent air vehicles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Complain Owl Feathers May Lead to Quieter Wings and Wind Turbines  Justin W. Jaworski  Owls are remarkable predators that are able to hunt their prey in almost complete silence. Despite this longstanding observation, the understanding of the mechanisms used by the owl to attenuate its aerodynamic noise remains incomplete. In contrast to a growing number of experimental studies seeking the secrets of the owl, we take a fresh look at this problem with a theoretical approach to model the generation of the aerodynamic sound produced by unique wing features with the aim to guide the search for the elusive silent owl technology, which may be translated to quieter wings and wind turbine blades.   The silent flight of owls is believed to be effected by three distinctive wing features: a soft velvety down on the upper wing surface; a comb of stiff feathers at the wing leading-edge; and a fringe of flexible filaments at the trailing edge of the wing. At present, it is not certain whether it is a single attribute or a combination of these attributes that is the root cause of the noise reduction. However, all wings or blades cutting through the air create a certain level of æself-noiseÆ due to air pressure fluctuations in the form of turbulent eddies. These eddies produce sound when they encounter the trailing edge, which is what you hear from aircraft flyovers when the engines are throttled back and the flaps and landing gear retracted. Since self-noise is an unavoidable consequence of an aerodynamic structure passing through the air, trailing-edge noise often represents the minimum attainable noise level. Thus, the modelling effort to examine the owl noise suppression mechanisms begins with an examination of the noise generated by the trailing edge, which the owl must address in a novel way to have a chance at silent flight.  The tattered trailing edge of the owl is strikingly different from what you would see out the window of a commercial airliner. To the simplest of approximations, the owl edge is noticeably more compliant than the hard edge of an ordinary airplane wing. Closer inspection reveals that the owl trailing edge is porous as well, allowing the air streams that flow over the top and bottom of the wing to mingle gradually before reaching the back end of the wing. These poroelastic qualities of the owl trailing edge are central ingredients to our mathematical model developed with Professor Nigel Peake (Cambridge) to furnish a direct comparison with classical aeroacoustic theory for noise from a conventional trailing edge. An impermeable rigid edge will scatter sound with an intensity that increases with the fifth power of flight speed, U5, a theoretical prediction that is in agreement with flight test data. New results predict that the edge porosity may be designed to yield a sixth-power dependence on flight speed, which for low-speed fliers means an acoustic intensity reduction by an order-of-magnitude or more. The sixth-power velocity scaling for the aerodynamic noise from a porous edge has a couple of important implications. Firstly, this U6 scaling is the same as one would predict for sound scattered from an infinite porous wing, which implies that edge porosity can eliminate the amplifying effect of the edge such that the sound scales as if there were no edge at all. Secondly, the aerodynamic noise from a porous trailing edge now has a similar strength to other minor noise sources, such as the noise associated with the roughness of the wing surface. The elasticity of the edge may enable even greater noise reductions, where the predicted sound from an elastic or poroelastic edge can have an even weaker seventh-power velocity dependence, U7. However, the practical goal for the design of trailing-edge treatments is to achieve a U6 or weaker scaling over the frequency range of interest where unavoidable secondary sources such as roughness noise become dominant or have comparable strength.
