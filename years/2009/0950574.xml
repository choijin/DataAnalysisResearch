<AbstractNarration>Isoprene is emitted from many plants, especially trees such as oaks and aspens. The amount emitted is very large and has significant effects on atmospheric chemistry. On the other hand, isoprene can serve as a chemical feedstock and is already being exploited commercially. To understand the function and regulation of isoprene emission from plants, experiments will be undertaken to test and determine how plants that emit isoprene are affected by this emission.  Novel optical methods will be used to measure leakiness of photosynthetic membranes and determine how isoprene affects this leakiness. The effect of isoprene on other membrane functions, such as formation of lipid drops and possible cell death signals will also be measured. Experiments to test the regulation will focus on measuring enzyme activity with and without possible inhibitors and measuring changes in enzyme activities in relation to changes in isoprene emission rate. The results of the work will be useful for understanding isoprene emission, one of the most important chemical interactions between the biosphere and atmosphere. This information may aid decisions such as whether to alter what trees are planted and will aid in predicting when air pollution episodes are likely to be exacerbated by isoprene. The work may also be useful in engineering other organisms to make isoprene so that it can be used as a replacement for petroleum. This research will involve many students including undergraduates recruited to a summer program designed to increase participation in science by members of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
