<AbstractNarration>IIP 0934373&lt;br/&gt;e-Design: IT-Enabled Design and Realization of Engineered Products and Systems&lt;br/&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;br/&gt;Geiger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to renew the University of Central Florida's participation in the e-Design Center, an I/UCRC center that was created in 2003.  The multi-university center is currently comprised of Virginia Tech (lead institute), University of Central Florida and University of Massachusetts-Amherst.  Carnegie Mellon University is slated to join as a full partner in 2009. The mission and vision of the NSF Center for e-Design is to serve as a national Center of Excellence in IT-enabled design and realization of manufactured products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Central Florida's (UCF) participation is vital to the overall success of the Center.  Continued research efforts at UCF will contribute to the development of a set of coordinated tools and practices that can support conceptual and detailed design requirements specification, as well as the development of a conceptual modeler that can be used to support iterative conceptual design.  The research efforts at UCF fully align with the Center?s long-term goal of serving as a Center for Excellence in IT-enabled conceptualization, design and realization of engineered products and systems.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center's renewal will enable UCF to continue its key research and leadership role in the Center, as well as contribute significantly to the successful development and preparation of graduate and undergraduate students.  Benefits to students will include integration of resulting work into coursework and engineering curricula, as well as internship opportunities.  The center will provide a unique experience to students who can interact and collaborate with industrial researchers and engineers.  Research and educational findings will continue to be disseminated nationally and will have a significant impact on US industry as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The NSF I/UCRC for e-Design UCF Research Site had faculty and student research teams working in areas that are synergistic with the mission and vision of the NSF I/UCRC for e-Design.  These areas include: 1) user-centered design - cognitive tools, ergonomic tools, user experience tools, industrial design tools; 2) enabling information infrastructure for architecture development of modeling and simulation environments; 3) applying computer-science formalismsrooted in interoperability of programming languages to the problem of ensuring interoperability of semantically rich knowledge structures; and 4) product and system design requirements real-time optimization and tracking.  These research efforts support the CenterÆs long-term goal of developing a new design paradigm to support functionality-based design and reasoning in the conceptualization, design and realization of engineered products and systems.The research efforts of the faculty researchers at UCF focus on the following objectives: 1) realization of conceptual modeling tools aimed at reducing design cycle time and ensuring maximum achievement of design goals for human use; 2) exploration of information infrastructure and interoperability to support collaboration for conceptual design; and 3) establishment of a critical mass of expertise focused on the development of e-design modeling and simulation software tools.
