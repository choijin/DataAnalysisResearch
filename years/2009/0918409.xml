<AbstractNarration>The project builds on existing research and extends it to include a computational model of participation in a community of practice.  The products include an automated mentoring system that uses natural language conversations to help students learn about science and technology and an assessment/analysis protocol to quantify students' STEM behavior.  It extends automated tutoring with an automated mentoring technology, AutoMentor, and combines it with Epistemic Network Analysis.  AutoMentor is implemented in Land Science, a multi-player urban planning game, and tested by the Massachusetts Audubon Society with approximately 700 middle school aged students either in after-school or in-school programs.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pioneering work drawn from three partner institutions inform the design of the system.  These include intelligent tutoring (Graesser, University of Memphis), assessment (Mislevy, University of Maryland), and game-based learning (Shaffer, University of Wisconsin-Madison).  The core technologies are supported by expertise in computer science, science content, measurement, and STEM educational programming.  The project has the potential to transform all three core areas by providing a fully implementable system that supports student learning substantive content through immersion in a STEM processes.   The PIs anticipate that this will be integral to learning systems of the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ STEM Virtual Internships with Automated Professional Mentoring  A key educational goal in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is to help students learn to think like STEM professionals in the real world do. Real-world educational experiences, such as internships and cooperative research, help students learn both the content and the practices of a particular field, but few K-12 students can access such experiences.
