<AbstractNarration>Volcanism at convergent margins is one of the most visible and important manifestations of the circulation of the solid Earth, with importance both for our understanding of Earth processes, and for hazards to human beings from eruptions and seismicity.   Understanding these processes requires comprehensive data sets that make use of the most important geochemical tools, collected in the context of a "natural experiment" provided by the Earth.  New developments in analytical geochemistry and collaboration with Chilean volcanologists provide a unique opportunity for such a study.  The Chilean "southern volcanic zone" provides an experiment to see how the continental crust influences volcanic behavior and products.  The thickness and age of the crust change progressively from south to north, permitting two competing hypotheses to be rigorously evaluated.  The first hypothesis proposes that changes in volcanism result from the influence of the crust on melting processes in the mantle below, and that erupted melts can be interpreted in terms of the processes that take place at depth to create convergent margin volcanoes.  The second argues that the crust modifies magmas beyond recognition, so that their compositions reflect shallow crustal processes rather than deeper mantle processes.  A comprehensive study of volcanoes along the gradient provided by southern Chile will permit a detailed test of these hypotheses, and a new understanding of what controls convergent magma compositions.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;The tools that will be used to solve this problem include the necessary field work and geological understanding provided by Chilean colleagues, standard tools of major elements, trace elements, and long-lived radiogenic isotopes.  The new perspectives come from the combination of this classical approach with oxygen isotopes, U-series studies, and the cosmogenic nuclide 10Be.  Oxygen isotopes are particularly sensitive to crustal contamination; U-series and 10Be reflect mantle processes.  Seeing how these tracers co-vary will constrain the crust and mantle contributions. &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;This work will answer fundamental questions about solid Earth circulation that relate to our overall understanding to the plate tectonic cycle.  It also integrates efforts of US, Swiss, French and Chilean investigators.  Some of the volcanoes have had important historical eruptive activity, and this work will be useful to future hazard evaluation. Undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs are all receiving training in volcanology, the logistics of managing field expeditions, and advanced tools of chemical analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       The question of sediment recycling during plate subduction processes and arc volcano activity has been at the forefront of modern volcanology over the last decade. However, it has remained difficult to trace the path of the sediments from the plate, through the subduction to the magma chamber and finally through arc volcano activity.  The central goal of this project was to establish a comprehensive geochemical data set from volcanic rocks to better understand the mantle processes underlying arc volcanoes in general, and the question of sediment recycling in particular.  10Be in arc volcano rock is often dubbed 'the smoking gun of sediment recycling', because subducting sediments are rich in meteoritic 10Be, an isotope otherwise very rare on earth, and 10Be in arc-volcanic rocks can only be explained by the recycling of the sediment 10Be through the magma chamber to the eruption.  The limitation for the 10Be tool to trace sediment-subduction has been geochemical and analytical. After the pioneering efforts in the 1990s of the University of Pennsylvania group, it took until the last few years to raise the sensitivity of 10Be geochemistry and analysis again to a level that allows to detect the minute amounts of 10Be included in arc-volcanic rocks.  This part of the overall project reanimated the 10Be technique, using samples from the Chilean Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ), a classic location to address fundamental question of arc petrogenesis.  Over the last three years, we developed a new geochemical protocol for the analysis of 10Be in whole rock samples from arc volcanoes and have analyzed over 30 samples from various SVZ volcanoes. The geochemical and analytical recipe is now robustly in place, and the related methodological manuscript is close to submission. This technique is now available for the wider research community and should spark a new surge of similar analysis around the world.  For the question of sediment recycling at the SVZ: we detected 10Be in all of the measured arc volcano samples, indicating that sediment recycling is a general feature of SVZ arc volcanism. The further quantification of the sediment recycling via the comparison of the 10Be data to the large geochemical data base,  established by the other PIs and the European collaborators, has proven to be complex. No simple correlation between any of the other tracers could be established so far, and the preliminary conclusion is that the amount of 10Be in the arc volcanic rocks is primarily a function of the thickness of the subducting sediment layer, rather than the result of a particular step within the petrogenesis.  In summary, the powerful tool of 10Be as smoking gun of sediment-recycling in arc-volcanism has been re-established and proven to be robust. Sediment recycling at the SVZ volcanoes is a common feature. Additional 10Be studies are needed to resolve the quantitative details of the sediment recycling at the SVZ and beyond.
