<AbstractNarration>A major challenge in evolutionary biology is to understand the molecular basis of diversification. This project applies recent advances in comparative genomics, including genome-wide sequence scanning, linkage mapping, and candidate genes, to address the evolution of diverse color patterns in the exuberantly patterned Hawaiian happy face spider. The happy face spider has a balanced genetic color polymorphism for which the mode of inheritance differs between islands in the Hawaiian chain. Accordingly, despite similar sets and frequencies of color forms across islands, the color diversity has arisen independently on different islands. This research will identify the genomic basis for the differences between islands, and hence the mechanism through which color diversity has been recreated.  &lt;br/&gt; The research will provide insights into the molecular origins of diversity during evolutionary history and also will produce the first genome sequence and expressed gene data for any spider. The visible and genetically controlled color polymorphism of spiders provides a compelling context for teaching complex concepts in genetics and molecular evolution. Parallel systems to that of the Hawaiian happy face spider occur elsewhere (including California) and will be used to support the development of teaching tools using local spiders in collaboration with an on-going science education project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="m"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>The Hawaiian happy-face spider, <em>Theridion grallator</em>, is unique to wet and mesic forests of all of the high Hawaiian Islands except Kauai and Lanai.

In Maui populations of happy-face spiders, the inheritance of these color alleles is very straightforward, with plain yellow forms recessive to all the diverse patterned morphs.
