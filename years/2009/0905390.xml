<AbstractNarration>In the US alone, over 30,000 fall sick with lethal kidney disease each year, and over 77,000 await for a kidney transplant, many more than any other transplant. That demand far exceeds the supply of cadaver kidneys. It is possible for a living person to donate a kidney, e.g., to a relative or a friend, and both can live well. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a given donor can donate to a given patient due to blood type and tissue type incompatibilities. This opens the door for kidney exchange. Consider two donor-patient pairs, A and B. Say that each of the pairs is incompatible. Yet Donor A may be able to donate to Patient B, and Donor B to Patient A. This constitutes a cycle of length two. Somewhat longer cycles are also practical. The principal investigator's prior research has proved that the exchange clearing problem is NP-complete, and developed an exchange algorithm that scales to the nationwide level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research under this award is scaling up and expanding the functionality of the exchange algorithms to develop (a) faster exhange algorithms (e.g., through search-tree reorganization), (b) online algorithms for deciding which cycles to select in light of changing donors and recipients, (c) algorithms that are robust to last-minute failures, and (d) using machine learning to predict the survival duration of kidney transplants and failure probabilities of last-minute tests. Some of the techniques and theory developed to address these issues also apply to other combinatorial search problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
