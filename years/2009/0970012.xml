<AbstractNarration>This project will undertake a thorough theoretical study of the essential properties of coherent transport dynamics of trapped ultra-cold atoms, using a novel approach based on localized states. Besides being an effective way to numerically simulate transport of atoms through arbitrary potentials ('devices' in an atomic circuit), this approach can be directly implemented in atom transport experiments. Realistic designs for such experiments will also be developed as part of this study. The focus will be on mechanisms that involve time-dependent potential, coherent evolution, and features that distinguish atoms from electrons. The goal is to establish transport research with ultracold atoms as a flourishing field of study with significant applications. New quantum dynamical phenomena will be investigated for cold atoms, which are expected to have cross-disciplinary impact by providing a broader perspective on several transport phenomena. A new application of atom chips is implied in examining the flow of atoms, aligned with the functions of semiconductor microchips, with potential for integration into an atomic circuit. An alternate system that can probe coherent quantum transport in a controlled setting at the micron scale of atom chips, instead of the nanoscale of electronic circuits, will be valuable for testing and applying quantum transport dynamics imminent in future technology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the work is its capacity to strengthen both teaching and research activity at a predominantly undergraduate institution. This project will enhance the educational experience of the students working on the project and will help to create an environment that encourages research for both students and faculty. Undergraduate research involvement will be an integral component of this project, with an emphasis on recruiting students underrepresented in science in an effort to encourage them towards careers in science and technology.  Because of the location of the University, both inner city students and those from very rural areas will be recruited.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Transport of electrons and holes through circuits is the basis of much of our modern technology, constituting what we call electronics.  This project examines how that technology could be extended by using transport of ultracold atoms instead,  in what has been called atomtronics in analogy with electronics. Relentless miniaturization in electronics and the advances in creating macroscopic coherent quantum states  of atoms such as Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC),  have led to a convergence of the two fields at the realm of ultra-small and ultracold where they share similar dynamics governed by quantum physics. As a result, transport studies that were previously done almost entirely in electronic systems, can now be examined and utilized in systems of cold atoms trapped in waveguides, that emulate electrons in nanoscale wires.

While practical applications may not be competitive with electronic counterparts for quite a while, atomic version of transport studies offer significant advantage towards understanding the dynamics involved in such processes in ways that cannot be accessed in electronic systems. One such innovation in this work is to use counter-propagating wavepackets of atoms to emulate the dynamical scenario of electrons flowing through a wire between two terminals.  This allows a great degree of control and flexibility not possible in electronic circuits. Within this general framework, some of the specific objectives accomplished in this project are now described.   Quantum pumps generate current without any bias, simply by using time-varying potentials. They have been studied in theory extensively in mesoscopic electronics but with little success in experiments. Using atomic wavepackets this is currently being developed for implementation motivated by this research.  It was shown in this work that the scattering profile of the wavepackets explicitly display the dynamics involved in quantum pumps in extraordinary detail not seen in typical electronic circuits.  Phase coherence is a key feature of quantum states whereby the wave nature of matter is manifest in creating interference patterns just like light.  Atoms also interact with each other leading to an effective nonlinear behavior. This research brought those two features together in the context of the counter-propagating wavepackets of coherent atoms. The result was a surprising sensitivity to the location of any intervening scattering potential barrier. Contrary to anything that could happen in classical physics, all of the particles could move in the same direction after mutual collision and scattering.  Nonlinearity was found to significantly heighten the sensitivity, which was used to propose new possibilities for force sensors (when used in linear geometry) and  rotation sensors (when used in circular geometry).  When the transport is confined by a triple-well potential, a clever manipulation of the wells leads to an extraordinary behavior whereby atoms in one extreme well can be relocated to the other extreme well without ever being significantly present in the intervening well.   This phenomenon was given an important applications-potential in this project by demonstrating that it can be used to transport a particle through the position of a blocking particle as if the latter was invisible. Furthermore, implementation in periodic lattices was shown to be feasible so that multiple particles can be manipulated so simultaneously to scale up the operation.  A different use was made of the triple-well setup to create an atomtronics version of a transistor where one atom species could be used to control to movement and f...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
