<AbstractNarration>I/UCRC for Surveillance Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0968910 Ohio State University; Lee Potter &lt;br/&gt;0968922 Wright State University; Brian Rigling &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Surveillance Research (CSR) will develop a mature theory and advanced body-of-knowledge for modern surveillance systems. Ohio State University (OSU) and Wright State University (WSU) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with OSU as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surveillance and situational awareness are critical technologies needed to address societal needs of safety and security. Surveillance is used to provide our nation with both international and homeland security, and situational awareness for disaster mitigation and management (e.g. Hurricane Katrina). The main motivation behind the proposed center is to address the theory behind the complex surveillance systems mostly based on sensors and sensor systems. The proposed Center is expected to generate research that significantly advances current surveillance theory and technology and to become a focal point within the surveillance community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research advances in surveillance technology developed by CSR will be transitioned to applications of significant societal and national interest. The Center plans to develop and promote a collaborative, focused scientific community in surveillance theory, including short courses, cross departmental and cross-university graduate course offerings, and internships with member organizations. CSR will recruit underrepresented groups, and plans to leverage existing programs such as the Ohio STEM Ability Alliance, the ADVANCE program at OSU, and through collaborations with the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Directorate's Minority Leaders Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Remote sensing using optical, terahertz, millimeter wave, L-band, and  UHF wavelengths is used to provide for our NationÃ†s security,  situational awareness for disaster mitigation, disaster response  management, and environmental monitoring. While individual sensor  technology is advancing, there is a compelling need to understand  composite sensing systems. The challenge is to design quantitative tools  that aid in designing sensing systems to achieve particular inference  goals and to develop a theory for predicting sensing performance.  The  Center for Surveillance Research (CSR) is a National Science Foundation  Industry/ University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) whose mission  is to develop a principled theory and advanced practice for modern  remote sensing systems. CSR is a collaborative effort by academia,  government and industry to conduct pre-competitive research projects and  perform student training to prepare the next generation of technology  leaders.  Annually, the Center has supported eight to twelve students on  projects collaboratively formulated and selected with the Center's  Industry Advisory Board.  NSF support has provided a catalytic nucleus  of collaborative teaming arrangements and operational resources; the  Center has provided approximately 10:1 leverage of NSF resources to  support the research and educational mission.  Annually, the Center has  teamed with the Air Force Research Laboratory to host a summer  institute, where 60 student interns &ndash; from high-school to university  post-doctoral programs&mdash;are engaged in mentored research experiences.  Significant theoretical and practical advances have been obtained in  high-dimensional inference, with application to hyperspectral imaging,  laser vibrometry, terahertz spectroscopy, and radar change detection.  The Center's researchers have led the field of compressive radar, with  multiple survey and review articles appearing, in additional to research  papers.  The Center has developed and disseminated sensor data  libraries to support the work of researchers nationwide. The Center has  promoted a diverse workforce, with a cohort of students having double  the female representation of their university degree programs as a  whole.  The Center supported undergraduate summer research experiences  contributing to a freely available textbook and mobile phone apps for  digital communication courses. The remote sensing technologies developed  in CSR have had spin-off impact in medical imaging, where magnetic  resonance imaging scans have been accelerated by a factor over 10.   Faster scan times enable real-time and 3D noninvasive cardiac imaging;  the innovation provides improved diagnosis of atrial valve stenosis, a  condition afflicting 1.5 million Americans.
