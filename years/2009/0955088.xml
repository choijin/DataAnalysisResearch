<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to derive models of human motor control and learning that improve the performance of brain-machine interfaces. Through direct measurement of brain activity, these interfaces enable people with impaired sensory-motor function to control artificial limbs and other prosthetic devices by thought alone. Inspired by evidence that human motor control is based on a discrete internal representation of motor commands and that behavioral motor recovery is similar to the acquisition of functional language, the method of approach will focus on the construction of statistical language models that allow incremental specification of motor programs. Grounded within the framework of feedback information theory and decentralized control, this approach will result in the design of feedback control systems for prosthetic devices that better reflect user intent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will provide new opportunities to restore sensory-motor function, potentially improving the quality of life for people with disability due to conditions like amputation, spinal cord injury, and stroke. This research may also result in a better understanding of how the central nervous system interacts with peripheral biomechanics to control action and perception, which in turn is essential for understanding higher cognitive function and ultimately for reverse-engineering the brain.  As part of a complementary educational program, the PI will facilitate interactive demonstrations for elementary school students, co-direct a week-long summer institute for high school students, and develop and assess courses preparing undergraduate and graduate students for research that integrates systems engineering and neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>
