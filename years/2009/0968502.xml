<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Nancey Leigh of Georgia Institute of Technology and Professor Yuan Qifeng, Sun Yat-Sen University will host a workshop on ?Designing e-waste material flow systems for sustainable regional economic development: exploring U.S. and Chinese Approaches? at Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China, on July 31-August 2, 2010.  Dr. Leigh and her colleague will carry out a pre-meeting fact-finding visit to the key e-waste site in Guangdong Province, Guiyu Township, on February 3-5, 2010. The proposed workshop can foster interaction across disciplines and continue the research on electronic waste material flows as well as optimum waste diversion and management strategies.  It can also impact society by aiming to increase the economic development potential of legitimate recycling activities, while reducing harmful environmental impacts of managing U.S. waste in the global economy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will be supported jointly by Guangdong Province, China, and the U.S. National Science Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
