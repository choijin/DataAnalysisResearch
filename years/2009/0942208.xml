<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)  Central to this collaborative project, two Anasazi FT-NMRs are being integrated simultaneously across the chemistry curriculum at Western Kentucky University (WKU) and Elizabethtown Community and Technical College (ECTC).  Modern NMR theory and practice are being incorporated throughout the chemistry curriculum at WKU and ECTC. Existing experiments and lecture topics are being enhanced by enabling direct student access to the new instrumentation. Additionally, new laboratory exercises that emphasize the full range of NMR techniques are being added to the curriculum. The project incorporates the following three key objectives: (i) enhance student's understanding of chemistry; (ii) increase student's competency with modern technology by providing a carefully designed course sequence of hands-on experience and real-life applications; and (iii) establish and evaluate a sustainable partnership between the Departments of Chemistry at WKU and ECTC. The integration of modern instrumentation into WKU and ECTC's chemistry laboratory programs is essential for improving the undergraduate educational experience and preparing the student for post-graduate opportunities. The project also enhances WKU and ECTC's efforts in education by providing modern scientific instrumentation to stimulate research and educational collaborations. The success and viability of the partnership between ECTC and WKU will be critically assessed throughout the project which will serve as a model for the development of equitable partnerships between universities and community colleges.</AbstractNarration>

To ensure the sustainability of their partnership, insights into the ongoing project have been gained through several strategic planning meetings.  The team hopes their work will be able to provide a blueprint of interaction between 4- and 2-year colleges, moving their transformative and dynamic relationship into other disciplines and furthering the opportunities that undergraduates can be offered as part of their studies.
