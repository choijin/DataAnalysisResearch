<AbstractNarration>(Biological Sciences 61)&lt;br/&gt;James Madison University (JMU) is establishing a regional microarray teaching and learning center to support curricular innovations at a consortium of regional colleges in the Shenandoah Valley. The equipment at the center includes a recently purchased  microarray reader and an inkjet oligoarray synthesizer and microarrayer which is being built and maintained by students in JMU's engineering program. Over 150 students per year in biology and bioinformatics courses at 3 four year colleges (Bridgewater College, Eastern Mennonite University, and JMU) and 2 community colleges (Blue Ridge and Virginia Western Community Colleges) are using the equipment in inquiry-based, research-oriented classes. These students include science and education majors and students in general education classes. In addition the consortium is beginning to include local high schools (Roanoke and Shenandoah Valley Governor's Schools, Stuart Hall School and Huguenot High School) and teachers in its efforts through: summer workshops designed to familiarize the teachers with the equipment; utilization of the teacher's expertise in design of high school courses to assist in developing teaching, learning, and assessment materials for future workshops and to be disseminated via a website; and involving the high school students and teachers in hands on research experiences. An annual symposium brings a genomics or proteomics expert to the Shenandoah Valley to provide a forum for consortium members to meet, share experiences, and celebrate accomplishments. The project is making use of facilities and resources made available through a Howard Hughes Medical Institute supported genomics course, the presence of SRI International in Harrisonburg and coordination with the Genomic Center for Active Teaching on the Davidson College campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The microarray teaching and learning center is creating a number of research-based and inquiry-based laboratory experiences for undergraduates. The knowledge base in several sub-fields of biology, including host/parasite interactions, immunological responses to stimulae, toxic effects on gene expression in bacteria, comparative genomics of bacteriophage, and others, is being enriched through these activities. Approximately twenty undergraduate science faculty are participating in intensive technological and educational training experiences. A better understanding of how sophisticated technology impacts teaching and learning in science is emerging through the project's assessment and evaluation efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Teaching and learning materials are being made available through a freely accessible consortium website. The center is increasing the technical expertise, equipment, and networking available for undergraduate research and education efforts and is providing modern facilities and infrastructure for several regional institutions. The project brings together students in biology, computer science, and engineering courses to promote understanding of multidisciplinary approaches to research and education in the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being co-funded by the Discovery Research K-12 program of the Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings</AbstractNarration>
