<AbstractNarration>This projects investigates the external and internal factors (e.g., demographic, personal, and psychological aspects) that impact senior citizens' online privacy behavior.  The multi-perspective approach to address this question consists of surveys (standardized), intensive in-person interviews, focus groups, key stroke logging and log analysis and scenario based questionnaires to understand online privacy behavior and attitude.  A computational framework for online privacy protection using Bayesian Networks will be developed that includes a privacy architecture incorporating security policies, enforceable measures and a set of recommendations for proper design of privacy-enhancing technologies. This research will also explore senior citizens' perceived value of their personal information and the impact of cyber security education on online privacy behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since there is limited empirical data and research about senior citizens and online privacy, this project has the potential to significantly contribute to the design of more usable and unbiased online privacy protection technology for elderly users of the Internet. Ultimately, the wider societal importance of the proposed research is that a deeper understanding of the interaction between personal, social and institutional factors in determining senior citizens' experience with online privacy is needed to facilitate the continuing effort in enhancing online privacy assurance on the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

CJE Senior life manages several senior centers.The surveys conducted with the Chicago senior center patrons along with focus group findings gave helpful insight about the awareness of cybersecurity measures among older adults on the basis of their self-efficacy, experience with computers and risk aversion. We also tested models among older adults and younger adults and found significant differences. For example, fear of post-breach online shopping decisions are more significant for older adults than younger adults. On the other hand, trust and attitude towards e-commerce are more significant for the younger generation that the older counterparts. Also, peer influence is significant regarding privacy and security among older adults than among younger adults. The implication is that older adults who are new to social media platofors may have a safer and better experience if guided to network with peers and friends who observe privacy - preserving best practices.
