<AbstractNarration>This project will advance a novel, biologically inspired method for the manipulation of solid particles suspended in fluids on a microscopic scale through complementary theoretical, computational, and experimental research. A comprehensive mathematical framework will be developed for describing the control of fluid flows at low Reynolds number through localized cyclic boundary deformations using concepts from differential geometry and dynamical systems theory. A high-fidelity numerical approach will be developed for simulating such problems using a viscous vortex particle method. A pair of experimental platforms on contrasting physical scales will be constructed, each comprising a system of reconfigurable resonant probes mimicking cilia observed in nature, and extensive data will be collected to calibrate both theoretical and computational models. Algorithmic methods for separating and sorting particles, and for tailoring the spatial trajectories of individual particles, will be devised and demonstrated experimentally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on developing and demonstrating a novel technique for separating and manipulating fragile microscopic objects immersed in fluids, which has a growing list of applications ranging from the mechanical testing of macromolecules like DNA to the assisted fertilization of human ova with immotile sperm to the sustained excitation of fluid-borne abrasive particles for the precision machining of brittle surfaces. Models will be developed to predict the trajectories of particles in fluids containing multiple vortex fields. These vortex fields will be produced experimentally using oscillating fibers. A pair of experimental platforms with millimeter and micrometer (1/1000 of a millimeter) physical scales will be constructed. For each platform, a system of reconfigurable resonant probes will be used to generate steady vortex fields in particle-bearing fluids. The smallest probes will mimic the microscopic oscillating cilia observed in nature. Data will be collected to validate the theoretical and computational predictive models. This project will not only engender integrated advancements in applied mathematics, computational science, and engineering, but will also shed light on the physics underlying a physiological design present in protozoa and humans alike. The micromanipulation method to be developed represents an improvement over alternative technologies in simplicity, portability, and cost. The PIs' plan for developing this method incorporates a multi-institutional collaboration involving the directed mentoring of at least one postdoctoral researcher, at least two PhD students, and a number of undergraduates (with a deliberate eye toward promoting diversity), the curricular expansion of two cross-disciplinary graduate courses and two undergraduate courses at the PIs' universities, and outreach to biology students at a third university and to high school students in an ethnically diverse area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Techniques for separating, focusing and transporting small-sized particles in an aqueous environment have matured in recent years, motivated primarily by technology needs such as drug delivery, cell processing and microfluidic devices. One appealing approach to particle manipulation is based on the notion of steady streaming. A streaming flow is a relatively weak but large-scale steady response of a fluid to a primary oscillatory flow. Such flows have been shown to trap inertial particles &mdash; that is, particles with finite size and mass --- in certain conditions. Though it is known that particles can be trapped by the streaming, relatively little is known about the nature or conditions under which this trapping is possible.  In this project, we obtained a deeper understanding of the behavior of small inertial particles in a streaming flow. Through computational and theoretical approaches, we revealed the specific mechanisms by which a particle can be trapped by an oscillating fiber. By parametric study, we discovered the dependence of particle trapping on the viscosity of the working fluid, the size of the particle, the frequency of oscillation and the relative density of the particle to that of the fluid.  Based on this deeper understanding, we were able to explore novel techniques for transporting particles in a controlled fashion through an array of oscillating fibers oriented with parallel axes. By sequentially starting and stopping the oscillations of fibers in an array, we used high-fidelity computations to show that an inertial particle can be manipulated in a predictable manner from one trapping location to the next. Furthermore, this transport is surprisingly robust &mdash; particles that are shielded from an oscillating fiber by another (stationary) fiber can be drawn around the obstacle toward the oscillator, even from relatively large distances.  This work has provided the foundations on which we can develop novel and sophisticated particle manipulation strategies. With the detailed mathematical model for the fluid motion as well as the particle transport that we developed in this study, we can now bring many dynamical systems tools to bear on the structure of these models. This will enable us to systematically simplify the models and to develop trajectory planning strategies, particularly ones that make use of multiple oscillators in simultaneous motion.  This work has significant broader impact on the portfolio of particle manipulation tools that are available for applications such as drug delivery and medical diagnostics. For example, biopsy cells can be maneuvered without direct contact into specific configurations for further testing. Gene sequencing processes might make use of the particle transport in order to manipulate single DNA strands. We are only beginning to explore such possibilities.
