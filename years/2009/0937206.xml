<AbstractNarration>The International START Secretariat will target its coordination of activities, targeted primarily to enable regional-scale global change research, observation, assessment, and capacity building, and their integration into international science and policy efforts. The objectives will be to: (1) advance knowledge and observational information that is directly relevant to strategic research questions of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) about global environmental change causes, consequences, and response strategies at regional and sub-regional scales, with an emphasis on developing country regions; (2) enhance scientific input to policy responses through regional and sub-regional assessments that are recognized by national, regional and international stakeholders as having salience, credibility, and legitimacy; (3) improve integration of developing country research, observation and assessment with international research, observation, and assessment programs; (4) promote international collaboration for all the above, including increasing the participation of U.S. scientists and institutions; and (5) sustain and increase human and institutional capacity for all the above, the latter objective being integral to all the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordination activities to be performed by this Secretariat in support of these objectives include initiation and provision of scientific management support for: (a) existing collaborative research and observation programs and projects that engage multiple institutions and countries and address regional science priorities; (b) regional assessments that engage stakeholders from science, policy, civil society and private sector communities to address regional policy priorities; and (c) science-driven capacity building programs.  The latter will encompass small grants for early career scientists, postdoctoral fellowship programs, conferences, training workshops, graduate and undergraduate curriculum development, participation in research, observation, and assessment programs, and enhancement and maintenance of a network of regional research centers;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;START will also act as a liaison between START?s partners and participants in developing country regions and the agencies that participate in the U.S. Global Change Research Program, well as with international programs and organizations such as the Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP); the World Climate Research Program (WCRP); the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program; the International Program on the Human Dimensions of Global Change Research (IHDP); Diversitas, the global change program dedicated to biodiversity science; and the Intergovernmental Program on Climate Change (IPCC).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Reporting for 0937206  Type of Report: POR  STARTÆs system of regionally based affiliates and centers in Africa and Asia-Pacific, together with the International START Secretariat based in Washington, DC, promote research-driven capacity building that enhances regional capabilities to respond effectively to global environmental change. To accomplish this, START engages scientists from developing countries and national and regional institutions in integrated, multi-disciplinary research and assessments on issues of sustainable development related to global environmental change, and START connects these scientists and institutions with the broader international community engaged in global environmental change research. In addition to engaging scientific communities directly, START promotes communication for action at the interface of science, policy and practice.  Efforts supported by this grant award from the USGCRP agencies, through NSF, strategically advanced integrated regional research on the coupled human and natural environmental systems, informed decision-making on issues such as adaptation to climate change and catalyzed collaborations between US and non-US scientists.  The International START Secretariat targeted its coordination of activities, primarily to enable regional-scale global change research, observation, assessment, and capacity building, and their integration into international science and policy efforts. The coordination through this grant aimed to: (1) advance knowledge and observational information that is directly relevant to strategic research questions of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) about global environmental change causes, consequences, and response strategies at regional and sub-regional scales, with an emphasis on developing country regions; (2) enhance scientific input to policy responses through regional and sub-regional assessments that are recognized by national, regional and international stakeholders as having salience, credibility, and legitimacy; (3) improve integration of developing country research, observation and assessment with international research, observation, and assessment programs; (4) promote international collaboration for all the above, including increasing the participation of U.S. scientists and institutions; and (5) sustain and increase human and institutional capacity for all the above, the latter being integral to all the others.

The latter encompassed grants for early career scientists, fellowship programs, conferences, training workshops, graduate and undergraduate curriculum development, participation in research, observation, and assessment programs, and enhancement and fostering of regional networks of early career scientists.  Broader Impact: Long-standing and continued support to START from the USGCRP agencies enables development and implementation of innovative programs and activities that integrate knowledge generation with knowledge sharing in ways that can effectively inform, and be informed by, action. Robust knowledge systems are foundational to achieving development outcomes that are resilient in the face of challenges arising from global change. Such efforts require strong and well-integrated scientific networks that are able to provide important sources of new knowledge to inform planning processes, particularly those related to adaptation and risk management.
