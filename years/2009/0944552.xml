<AbstractNarration>0944552/Brook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to develop and use a new analytical tool for ice core gas and isotope analyses based on an innovative laser spectroscopic technique. The measurements will be integrated with sample processing techniques that continuously melt vertical sections of ice core, and the ancient air that is normally wasted in such sample processing will be released and analyzed.  The proposed work focuses on three climatically relevant measurements for which laser technology has sufficiently advanced that ice core applications are possible. These include the atmospheric concentration and stable isotopic composition of methane (delta 13C and delta D), the carbon monoxide mixing ratio, and the isotopic composition of the ice itself (delta D and delta 18O). The biogeochemical rationale for these choices is that methane mixing ratios are highly correlated with temperature change in the northern hemisphere and used as global stratigraphic markers in ice core studies. The methane isotopic composition is important for understanding sources and sinks of methane and addressing controversies over the stability of the large marine hydrate reservoir. Carbon monoxide, which can be measured simultaneously with methane and its isotopes, is involved in biogeochemical cycles that also control methane mixing ratios. The stable isotopes of water are basic tracers of past temperature in ice core research. The proposed work will bring new cutting-edge technology to polar research, and develop it further. The proposed isotopic methods are particularly important in this regard given that these measurements are difficult with traditional methods, the proposed work has the potential to transform isotopic studies of methane in ice.  Measuring gases in air released from ice cores during continuous melting of vertical sections for other chemical measurements will save valuable time and precious ice and will ultimately generate trace atmospheric gas data in real time.  The project will support both a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student and will involve a new faculty member who is bringing significant industry experience to academia.  The PIs will participate in recruitment efforts that target minority graduate students and post-docs will participate in a variety of outreach efforts, including news interviews, television documentaries, lab tours, mini-classes for gifted middle school students and a new effort with Oregon Museum of Science and Industry to build a climate exhibit.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this project was to develop new laser spectroscopic tools to measure greenhouse gases in ice cores.  The research focused specifically on methane, carbon monoxide, and the isotopic composition of methane.  It also included building an ice core melter for testing instrumentation and analyzing ice samples, and a sample handling interface for separating air from meltwater and calibrating the laser instruments.  We expanded our goals to measuring nitrous oxide.    The project was very successful.  A complete system was constructed to allow us to continuously melt sections of ice cores and measure the concentration of gases in the trapped air.  This greatly increased the speed of acquiring data and the level of detail available in the data.  Two instruments were used in the system, one measuring methane and nitrous oxide, and another methane and carbon monoxide.  The system was used in several analytical campaigns and is quite robust.     A next generation isotope analyzer for methane was acquired.  After extensive testing we have found that it is not precise enough for routine continuous melter measurements of methane but should be useful for discrete analyses.     The project contributed to training a post doc, a graduate student, and several undergraduate helpers.  It contributed to several journal publications which describe the work in more detail:  Rhodes, R.H., Brook, E.J., McConnell, J.R., Blunier, T., Sime, L.C., Fa&iuml;n, X. and Mulvaney, R., 2017.
