<AbstractNarration>Technical: Semiconductor nanowires are one of the primary nanostructured materials under investigation in the field of nanoscience. Because of their compatibility with existing semiconductor device processing methods and the possibility to control their electronic properties via such mechanisms as diameter selection, doping and heterostructure creation, they hold great promise as active elements in future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Significant industrial efforts focus on aspects of nanowire electronics such as integration and device performance. Critical to the success of these efforts is a fundamental understanding of the crystal growth processes involved in nanowire creation. In this Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project, real-time transmission electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the mechanisms of semiconductor nanowire growth. The research aims to quantify growth kinetics relevant to the creation of advance device geometries, with a focus on heterostructures creation, interface abruptness and dopant effects. It seeks to provide fundamental insight into the semiconductor nanowire growth process via the technologically important vapor-liquid-solid and vapor-solid-solid growth processes. These insights are expected to lead to improved understanding of the self-assembly process and will provide a much needed scientific underpinning to the development of nanowire integration methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. Nanoscale electronic devices offer the potential of allowing advances beyond the limits imposed by traditional lithographic fabrication methods. Graduate and postgraduate training forms a core activity of the project, with a program encompassing extensive lab experience at the world's leading industrial lab for basic research in semiconductor electronics. Additionally, in-situ transmission electron microscopy is one of the primary "eyes" into nanoscale behavior, allowing exciting, dynamic videos of real physical processes to be obtained. The PI will continue work with a scientific visualization company to develop realistic and scientifically accurate animations of nanowire growth. These animations will be used to describe the science of nanotechnology to a broad audience through multiple dissemination routes, and will be utilized along with real dynamic observations in a web-based class on Thin Film Deposition coordinated through Purdue's NSF sponsored NanoHUB.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Semiconductor materials find broad use in multiple categories of science and technology. These include being the key elements in electronic devices and in energy uses such as solar cells.  In the past decade, there has been tremendous interest in creating semiconductor materials of very small sizes, to both take advantage of interesting effects that occur due to quantum mechanics in these systems, as well as to further scale electronic devices to smaller sizes.  This NSF project explored fundamentals of the creation of a specific type of semiconductor material called a nanowire.  These materials are grown by using small, catalytic metal particle (nanoparticle) which breaks down a source gas containing the semiconductor, and then deposits this semiconductor onto a growth substrate.  This process is call the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth process, or the vapor-solid-solid (VSS) growth process, depending on whether a solid or liquid catalyst is used.  We have explored the fundamentals of how this process works, by using several truly unique high-resolution microscopes.  We can watch as the new semiconductor crystals nucleate and grow, and then quantify these observations to gain deeper theoretical insight.  We have generated several fundamentally new insights.  Firstly, we have shown that the nucleation can be very reproducible, which is helpful to understand when trying to make real devices in technology.  Secondly, by describing both the VLS and VSS processes in a quantitative way, we have learned how to make incredibly well controlled materials, embedding a single atomic layer of one material in between another - again this is crucial to technological applications where mulitple materials are used to manipulate the behavior of electrons.  These studies were completed by graduate students and post-doctoral researchers working at Purdue, as well as at IBM Watson Research Center and Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Their experiences at multiple research institutions - academic, industrial and governmental - has broaden their understanding of research, and exposed them to leading scientists in the field.  Of the post-doctoral researchers supported on the project, each has gone on to academic positions.             Last Modified: 10/05/2012       Submitted by: Eric A Stach]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
