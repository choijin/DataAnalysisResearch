<AbstractNarration>A comprehensive effort to improve the mathematics abilities of science and engineering students is being undertaken.  Included in the effort is the reform of precalculus and calculus courses, incorporation of active learning into mathematics courses, implementation of a uniform mathematics placement policy, and cooperation with school districts sending large numbers of students to the institution to modify high school mathematics courses to meet the expectations of the university.  All the planned activities are grounded in a detailed investigation of the current reasons for the lower rate of retention of majors STEM.&lt;br/&gt;The project is the result of a synergistic approach amongst faculty from the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Education, and the College of Engineering that utilizes best practices in STEM education to increase the number of STEM graduates.  The project is both advancing knowledge in mathematics and the associated comfort level of STEM majors by removing barriers linked to poor performance in STEM math classes and the associated lower retention to graduation in a STEM major.  Addressing the issue at the pre-college level through articulation with regional feeder high-schools, at the math placement level, and inside and outside the initial mathematics classroom is a holistic and potentially transformative approach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the NSF-funded Math Success for STEM Majors (MSSM) project at Tennessee Tech University (TTU) was to improve student retention in STEM disciplines by increasing their chances of success in introductory mathematics classes.  To meet this objective the project pursued six strategies:     1. Redesign      introductory mathematics courses (Precalculus and Calculus I);  2. Implement      just-in-time academic support for students enrolled in all introductory      STEM mathematics courses;  3. Integrate the      STEM disciplines through context-driven math applications within a new      First-year Connections course for entering STEM freshmen;  4. Implement a      uniform TTU mathematics course placement policy that includes a placement      test;  5. Develop a data      system that tracks individual student performance across the STEM      disciplines;  6. Articulate      mathematics skill-level expectations with selected high schools sending      large numbers of STEM freshmen to TTU.    The progress made on each of the strategies contributed (along with significant increases in University enrollment) to an increase in STEM graduates at TTU (from a pre-project average of about 360 per year to over 520 in 2017).   Math 1730-Precalculus was redesigned to reduce the amount of lecturing and incorporate active-learning activities.  Advanced undergraduate students with a strong background in the course material were hired to attend class meetings and assist students inside and outside of class.  Supplemental Instruction (SI) was implemented in Math 1910-Calculus I.  SI sessions are regularly-scheduled review sessions facilitated by a student who has previously done well in the course and who attends all class lectures, takes notes, and acts as a model student. The efforts to redesign Math 1730 and Calculus I led to an increase in the number and percentage of STEM majors making it through those initial mathematics courses to Calculus II.  The pass rate in Math 1730 increased from 45% prior to the grant to approximately 60% after the course was redesigned.  The mathematics tutoring supported by the grant was very popular with students.  The University administration responded to the student demand for tutoring by centralizing tutoring services in the library. Mathematics tutors assist students in all lower-division courses (ranging from basic algebra through differential equations).  The training, supervision, and scheduling of tutors is now handled by library staff.  The grant team incorporated applied mathematics active-learning activities into the STEM-flavored First-year Connections courses (MSCI 1020) it offered for incoming STEM majors.  A group of faculty from across the STEM disciplines developed appropriate activities. Over a period of four years versions of these activities were implemented in twelve sections of the course.  The effect of participating in these activities was assessed using an attitudinal survey. The survey results show that the overall shift for MSCI 1020 students was significantly less negative than that for students in the generic ENGR 1020 First-year Connections course that many incoming STEM freshmen take.  The grant team tried a few different math placement tests but discontinued their use when no improvement in placement decisions was detected.  A placement system based on ACT or ACCUPLACER scores was implemented.  As part of its placement efforts the grant team provided incoming freshmen in STEM majors with a recommended schedule of math and science courses for their first semester.  The University expanded that effort so that all incoming freshmen are now provided with their initial course schedule when they attend orientation in the summer before enrolling.  The MSSM grant team sought to delve deeper than the usual student success metrics of average grade, grade distributions, and DFW rates for courses by tracking individual student trajectories in required math courses to degree.  The MSSM project created a database of cohorts of First Time Freshmen with semester completion updates.  The investigators analyzed the trajectories of 1000+ individual students through the calculus sequence to investigate questions such as: Do ACT scores and HS GPA predict student success? How persistent are students? Would characterization of "laminar" or "turbulence" features in a trajectory offer insight into keys for student success?  An Articulation Team of 21 high school teachers from local school districts was created.  TTU faculty involved with the grant and teachers on the Articulation Team met regularly during the first two years of the grant to discuss the changes in the high school math standards in the state of Tennessee and the redesign of TTU?s Math 1730-Precalculus class. In the last year of the grant the PI team held four meetings with the teachers on the Articulation Team to share data about the success of their students in mathematics courses at TTU and the use of active-learning by TTU faculty in Math 1730-Precalculus and MSCI 1020.  At one meeting the teachers were able to experience an abbreviated version of a learning activity used in MSCI 1020.  Supply kits for the learning activities utilized by faculty in MSCI 1020 were created and distributed to the high school teachers on the Articulation Team.
