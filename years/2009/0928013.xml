<AbstractNarration>Truman State University's NSF-PRISM program, "Scientists Prepared, Engaged, Enriched, and Challenged Through Research Activities" (SPECTRA), seeks to increase the number of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) majors. Faculty members from mathematics, biology, and chemistry will be involved. The goal is to enhance the interdisciplinary, research-based experiences for undergraduates and to create a cross-disciplinary learning community. Students' experiences will include (1) a summer bridge course before their first semester (2) a new freshman seminar which will orient students to the University and to STEM degrees in an integrative fashion, (3) a second-semester Inquiry Seminar which will prepare students for independent research and (4) support for conducting research with faculty.  SPECTRA will providing focused support for early-career students and will enhance their opportunities to participate in integrative STEM learning experiences both through new courses and through academic-year research experiences. Scholarships will attract students to STEM degrees and support them as they work through their major degree programs. A special pathway course for potential majors will be offered to first-time freshman in the summer before their first regular semester of courses. Tutoring support and academic&lt;br/&gt;interventions will be used to assist students in their pathway courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SPECTRA program will create a community that will attract STEM majors and increase the number of STEM graduates. The SPECTRA program will also work with our community college partners to develop pre-STEM and 2+2 programs to help decrease the time-to-STEM-degree for community college students who transfer to&lt;br/&gt;Truman, and it will provide pre-STEM students with scholarships to encourage them to transfer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From 2010 through 2015, the SPECTRA program, (Scientists Prepared, Enriched, and Challenged through Research-based Activities), served students at Truman State University and various community colleges with the goal of increasing the number of students who pursue and earn a STEM degree. The program provided students with innovative interdisciplinary courses, academic support, and research and scholarship opportunities. The program consisted of three components.    The first component of the SPECTRA program was the Summer Scholars program, in which students were brought to campus in the summer prior to their first semester at Truman.  In this program, students took an introductory science course, precalculus mathematics courses, and a study skills course. The target audience for the summer program was students who had high enthusiam for STEM, as determined by high school transcripts and application essays, but were underprepared in their math and science backgrounds. The goal was to make these students ready for the challenges of the STEM curriculum, nurture their excitement about STEM areas, and make them ready for Calculus and General Chemistry (two courses that are often barriers for the underprepared student).   The second component of the SPECTRA program, the Academic Year Scholars program, targeted students who were well-prepared for STEM, but undecided about a STEM major. These students recieved a scholarship to take majors-level STEM courses for the first two years of their college career, and received an interdisciplinary introduction to STEM fields through two specially designed interdisciplinary seminar courses. The goal of the Academic Year Scholars program was to expose these students to the STEM disciplines and encourage them to pursue a major or minor in a STEM field.  In the third aspect of the program, the Pre-STEM Scholars program, students at our partnering community colleges received scholarships to encourage them to pursue STEM courses at the community college and to then transfer into a 4-year degree at another institution.  Our community college partners were Saint Charles Community College, Moberly Area Community College, and Metropolitan Community College of Kansas City.   These programs have had an impact on increasing the number of students earning a STEM degree and on increasing the STEM knowledge of students that do not earn a STEM degree.  The Summer Scholars program has helped STEM enthusiastic students find success and stay committed to STEM degrees.  Student participants in the Summer Scholars program have demonstrated a strong likelihood to be retained to STEM majors and increased success in academic performance compared to non-participant peers.  The summer experience builds confidence, increases study skills for college-level courses, develops a learning community, and improves college preparedness.  The SPECTRA academic year scholarships have increased the number of STEM majors and minors among students who were uncertain about these degree paths when they entered college.  Our interdisciplinary courses were designed to give students a strong foundation in integrated sciences.  This has allowed them to pursue future interdisciplinary work and make a significant impact on disciplines other than their own.  One third of the Academic Year Scholars program students have gone on to participate in undergraduate research.  Data collected through the RISC assessment (administered by David Lopatto at Grinnell College) show that our participants think more interdisciplinarily than other first-year students at Truman and more than the national norm for assessment.  Student participants in our program who were not retained to STEM majors and minors will have been exposed to broader and deeper aspects of science and mathematics and the interdisciplinary links between them.  These participants are better informed on scientific issues than the general public.       Last Modified: 12/18/2015       Submitte...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
