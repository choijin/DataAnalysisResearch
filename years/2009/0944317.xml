<AbstractNarration>This workshop will be held June 27-July 1, 2010 Bratislava, Slovak Republic, and will be attended by 20 US scientists funded from this grant. This meeting will bring together scientists from the Americas, Asia and Europe to discuss investigations of earthquake dynamics using numerical simulations and earthquake observation. Participants will work together to optimize strategies for improved modeling and testable predictions. There will be three days of talks focusing on simulations of past earthquakes, fault zone structure and rheology, laboratory data on friction, energy budget for seismic activity, scaling laws and other earthquake parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the only workshop in the past three years to concentrate on the combination of numerical modeling and observational data related to earthquake physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Workshop &mdash; Earthquake Source Dynamics:  Data and Data-Constrained Numerical Modeling  Smolenice Castle, Slovak Republic, June 27 &ndash; July 1, 2010    The three-day workshop focused on the development of numerical methods used to simulate the dynamics of an earthquake as a spontaneously propagating stress relaxation subject to various stress conditions and constitutive laws for describing the friction between two interfaces. The workshop was held at Smolenice Castle, Slovak Republic, June 27 &ndash; July 1, 2010. The castle, the conference center for the Slovak Academy of Sciences, provided a rural setting for the 27 oral presentations and 29 poster presentations.     The meeting started with an overview of observations that might constrain the parameters that are necessary to describe an earthquake. For example, there are observations of small earthquakes with different magnitudes that occur in nearly the same location year after year. If different magnitude earthquakes can be thought of as scaled versions of one another, then detailed modeling of the friction for any of these earthquakes should lead to the friction for larger events. In a similar vein, researchers looked at how one would scale earthquakes from one magnitude to another under different assumptions about the stress that drives the earthquake.  Thus the first day looked at the two essential elements &mdash;friction and stress&mdash; that must be understood for physically realistic earthquake simulations.     To reexamine what constitutes a realistic earthquake several presentations examined the methods by which one can infer basic parameters of the faulting by inverting the observed seismic and geodetic data that result from an earthquake such as the 2008 Wenchuan, China, or the 2009 LÃ†Aquila, Italy events. It is critical to know at what spatial and temporal resolution one can infer the basic descriptive parameters of the earthquake faulting. This description of an earthquake, which may last for 10Ã†s to 100Ã†s of seconds, is related over time to the build up of stress that is 10Ã†s to 100Ã†s of years. How these stresses are built up over time was the subject of several presentations.     Given some constraints from actual earthquakes, researchers can try to incorporate more physics into the earthquake simulations that naturally predict the observations. However, there are a plethora of explanations that encompass phenomena from rough faults to thermal pressurization. Different investigators presented talks and posters that covered these phenomena with the hope of making predictions that could be validated by observations.
