<AbstractNarration>This award supports U.S. participants in a Madrid-based semester-long sequence of technical research workshops, courses, collaborative visits, and an international conference in a subject area at the boundary of traditional control theory and combinatorial algebra.  The three-month sequence of events is motivated by recent innovations in combinatorial algebra, particularly combinatorial Hopf algebras, and their powerful application in numerical integration and control.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program consists of:&lt;br/&gt;*  A week-long technical workshop in early April in Madrid. The goal is to bring together experts and young innovators from different areas, survey the state of the art in each, and forge consensus on research topics in which swift progress is feasible.&lt;br/&gt;*  A mid-April week-long school in Zaragoza, Spain aimed at graduate students and postdocs in mathematics, physics, and related areas who are planning to do research in the field of control and modern combinatorics.  Four established researchers in these fields will lead the school, which is to include lectures and problem sets.  &lt;br/&gt;*  A month-long advanced course on combinatorics relevant to control, offered in Madrid in May.  &lt;br/&gt;*  Focused research collaborations.  Small teams of two to four researchers will collaborate in Madrid for periods from two to four weeks during mid-April to mid-June on the research themes identified in the workshop.  It is intended that these collaborations will connect creative young talents with experienced leaders in the fields.  &lt;br/&gt;*  A week-long International Conference  held in Madrid in June. Participants of the preceding events will present their results, redefine objectives for future research, and lay the foundation for future collaborations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activity promises to build new long-term international research collaborations and to catalyze research in this promising interdisciplinary area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://dftuz.unizar.es/coco2010/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This travel grant enabled both young and established researchers from the United States to develop new international research collaborations (with a network of researchers in Spain, France, Italy, Norway, the UK, and New Zealand) in a newly emerging field that transcends traditional areas of specialization. The grant supported travel to COCO 2010, a trimester in Combinatorics and Control, which consisted of a workshop, a school, a research-in-teams phase, and a final conference, held at several locations in Spain, as well as travel to a follow-up workshop organized the next year  in San Diego.  Under the unifying umbrella of combinatorial Hopf algebras, researchers presented problems and solution techniques from control theory, numerical integration, and geometric mechanics.  Recent parallel developments in the different areas were shown to share a common foundation of underlying algebraic structures which have been studied, in particular, by a predominantly French community of researchers in algebraic combinatorics. Major achievements include identifying these structures, translating between the languages that had been established in the different areas, and taking advantage of results obtained in the other areas.  In addition to the deep theoretical insights gained into the algebraic foundations, and the awareness of related work by researchers in other areas, the findings have immediate impact on practical applications. These include more accurate and faster simulations of systems that are governed by nonlinear differential equations, as well as improved design and analysis of controlled dynamical systems. The original focus expanded to also include the emerging research area of rough paths which deals with stochastic systems. Understanding that these are again governed by the same underlying algebraic structures opens the door to novel schemes for highly efficient data compression for structures that are inherently nonlinear.  In addition to numerous scientific articles that were spawned by the trimester, and doctoral and post-doctoral students being inducted into a worldwide network of collaborations, several follow-on meetings have been held and are being organized.
