<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Surface adsorption will be used to create bent-core layers on water via Langmuir techniques, as well as in free-standing films under water, with orientational order over centimeter ranges. These nanometer-thick ordered layers will be studied in situ, transferred to solid substrates (Langmuir/Blodgett and Langmuir/Schaeffer layers), and then used to align bulk bent-core mesophases. These systems will be analyzed with a multiscale approach, in which macroscopic and mesoscopic experiments are correlated with realistic molecular and mesoscopic simulations, where no one approach can cover the whole range of length scales. BLM-like films formed underwater will be stabilized by polymerization and tested as sensors for biological systems. The project will aim to understand the physics underlying these processes, and their sensitivity to small molecular changes and/or external stimuli. The knowledge gained will be used to optimize the self-organization of these molecules for diverse applications. The broader impacts of this project will include the enhanced ability to control surface properties which may lead to improved devices such as sensors, the training of students in a unique multidisciplinary environment, and the development of interdisciplinary teaching materials. &lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Throughout both nature and technology, the sensitivity of materials to external stimuli plays critical roles. For example, biological systems make extensive use of this sensitivity in endo- and exocytosis, the processes by which cells take in or expel materials. This sensitivity also lies behind the success of liquid crystals in electro-optical devices and other applications. &lt;br/&gt;This transformative project will use a combined experimental/computational approach to investigate how the properties of bent-core, banana-shaped molecules, are changed by interaction with a surface, and how these changes can be exploited to produce ordered bent-core liquid crystal materials for device applications, such as biosensors and smart biomaterials. More complex, but synthetically controllable molecular structures allow a much broader range of surface properties. Collaborations with international leaders in bent-core synthesis, to implement necessary modifications of the molecular structure of these complex molecules, plays an essential role in this project. Students ranging from high school to graduate level will receive interdisciplinary education in physics, chemistry, and engineering and be exposed to industrial contacts through the unique environment of the Liquid Crystal Institute at Kent State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Liquid crystals (LC) combine long-range orientational order and fluidity, which makes them the first choice in the multibillion-dollar information display technology. These same properties lead to applications in active organic devices and biosensors. The orientational order for most of these applications begins at the surface.  A number of different means have been developed to orient liquid crystals with the simple rod-like shapes that dominate the display industry.  The lack of molecular understanding meant that alignment layers for more complex shapes proved elusive. At the same time, the organization of molecules of complex shapes at interfaces is an important biological problem; bent-shaped proteins can shape biological membranes, for example.  This project combined experiments with atomistic simulations to understand and control the organization of bent-core liquid crystals in a film at an interface (Figure 1), and to demonstrate that, properly organized, these layers could effectively align bent-core nematic LC both parallel and, for the first time, perpendicular to the surface.  In parallel, we exploited surface interactions of mixtures of rod-like and bent-core nematic LCs with biological molecules in an aqueous solution (Figure 1b) to improve a biosensor design first proposed by N.

By varying the LC properties, we were able to both extend the sensing range and develop new sensing modalities.  We demonstrated the potential of these sensors to specifically target disease markers.  We found that with one type of LC, even the shape of the film could change: in water they spontaneously formed lens shapes, reminiscent of the multiple lenses in an insect eye.  Indeed, these acted as lenses (Figure 3).  Over the course of this project, we produced 12 papers, two patent applications, four invited and two selected talk at international conferences and 14 other conference presentations.  Broader impacts:  Our project paved the way for the optimization of LC-based biosensors, and reveals the importance of both the LC material and the alignment layer in determining sensor properties. We discovered that chiral nematic liquid crystals form lenses spontaneously. Two patents were filed.  Students at all levels have been trained in interdisciplinary science.
