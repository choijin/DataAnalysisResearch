<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professors John F. Hershberger, Gregory R. Cook, Sivaguru Jayaraman, Seth C. Rasmussen and Wenfang Sun from North Dakota State University Fargo will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) photochemical reactivity of photoactive chromophores; 2) study of conjugated organic materials for applications in photovoltaics; 3) characterization of synthetic chiral amines and chiral building blocks; 4) study of the role of transition metal ions in protein and enzyme function; 5) study of square planar platinum compounds for energy conversion and chemical sensing; and, 6) development of homogeneous catalysis for decarboxylative transformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The award from NSF-CRIF enabled NDSU and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry to house a state of the art single crystal XRD facility in the Fargo Campus. To house the new Bruker-AXS instrument the department renovated two 535 ft<sup>2</sup> rooms in Chemistry and Biochemistry department. The facility has enabled researchers to solve 202 crystal structures until April 2013 which were vital for ongoing research. The results obtained from the instrument were utilized for publications and presentations (57 in total). The facility is not only used by the department, but also by other colleges/departments across campus. In addition, the facility is also accessible to other university/colleges in Fargo-Moorhead region. For example, researches from University of North Dakota, Chemistry Department routinely use our instrument. The instrument has made big impact on student training. 24 Students (14 students from the class of 2011, 10 students from the class of 2013) from different departments across the NDSU campus took the CHEM729 - Crystal Structure Determinations course and were given hands on training on the new instrument. All students were taught how to use the machine (hands on), crystal centering, indexing, data collection and processing.
