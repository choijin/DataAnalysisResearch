<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to research: (1) accurate and efficient approximations that facilitate the modeling of probabilistic dependence, (2) the degree of dependence that must be captured in order to make high quality decisions, and (3) the implications of ignoring dependence in important decision problems. These new methods will be tested via collaborations with decision scientists in pharmaceutical companies and geoscientists focused on climate change. This research will be integrated with education through the following activities: (1) teaching decision skills directly to middle and high school students, while training middle and high school teachers in the fundamentals of decision making, (2) development of a new undergraduate certificate at The University of Texas (UT) focused on decision making under uncertainty, and (3) inclusion of select undergraduate students in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will transform our ability to effectively incorporate probabilistic dependence in important decision models. This new capability should improve decision making. For example, improving our ability to model dependencies in the climate system will result in improved climate and energy policies, which have broad impacts. In the area of drug discovery and development, the ability to effectively incorporate probabilistic dependence will help pharmaceutical companies properly sequence their development processes. The project's educational plan is designed to fundamentally alter education by organizing curricula around a decision-making framework. If successful, these educational innovations will transform engineering education, with important implications for society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As part of this research effort, we developed methods to improve the quantification of uncertainty for use in important decision problems. These methods fall into three research streams: (1) approximation methods to specify probability distributions given partial probabilistic information, (2) discretization methods that accurately transform continuous probability distributions into continuous distributions, and (3) an entirely new class probability distributions that are parametrized by percentiles, rather than by moments, for example.   Each of the three developments represents an important advance in the practical illumination of decision problems. For each method, we give examples of this below.   1. Many decision problems require the specification of complex probabilistic interdependences. For example, when developing a new drug therapy, researchers need to decide which indication (e.g., breast cancer or ovarian cancer) should be pursued first. This is a complex decision because a drug that works for ovarian cancer may also work for breast cancer. Modeling this dependence is quite important, but difficult. Our methods provide very good approximations that allow the specification of a probability distribution with only partial information about such dependencies. Pharmaceutical companies have used our work. It has also been used successfully to model uncertainties associated with climate change.   2. The modeling of decisions is often difficult because there are so many future possibilities. To overcome this "curse of dimensionality" practitioners often represent continuous probability distributions with only a few points (three is common). Choosing the right discrete points is critical. As part of our research, we developed the most accurate discrete approximations possible. These approximations are now in use within the oil &amp; gas industry.   3. In practice, decision analysts often ask experts to assess probability distributions. This is accomplished by assessing a limited number of points from a cumulative distribution (i.e., percentiles). The analyst then seeks to fit a continuous distribution to these assessed points. The difficulty, however, is that probability distributions are generally parametrized by their moments (e.g., mean, variance, etc.), not their percentiles. We overcame this significant limitation by developing and entirely new class of probability distributions that we refer to as "Johnson Quantile-Parametrized-Distributions." This new distribution system lends itself very well to Monte Carlo simulation and we except it to be widely adopted.   The broader impacts of this work included (1) the graduation of three PhD students, (2) bringing decision-making skills to at-risk children, and (3) application of our methods in socially important problems. We address each of these below:   1. As discussed above, our work followed three important research directions. Each of these served as foundational research for three PhD students. Two of these students were US citizens, who are now working in the US.   2. During this research, the PI worked with the Decision Education Foundation (DEF) to bring decision-making skills to at-risk youth. The PI offered several seminars during which high-school instructors were taught the latest methods to improve personal decisions.   3. All of the methods we developed have been applied to commercially and socially important decision problems. The later includes modeling the uncertainty associated with climate change.
