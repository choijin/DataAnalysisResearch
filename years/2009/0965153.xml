<AbstractNarration>This NSF/CONACyT research project seeks to address issues in the area of micro assembly, which will benefit American manufacturing organizations in a variety of domains.  Micro devices, which possess different materials, or complex geometries, cannot utilize the widely available monolithic MEMS fabrication techniques. In such situations, assembly of micro devices becomes inevitable.  The overall objective of this research is to investigate the modeling of gripping forces for micro assembly applications.  In addition, the role of interactive forces coming into play during nano manipulation will also be studied. Educational modules targeting under graduate and graduate engineering students will also be created as part of this project.  Specifically, the objectives are to: (a) Develop a taxonomy for gripper system configuration and design  (b) Investigate the modeling of gripping forces and their effects on the geometry of components (b) Support educational activities through development of educational modules (targeting engineering students) as well as facilitate outreach efforts to school students in New Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational activities proposed will introduce the next generation of industrial and manufacturing engineering students to cutting edge concepts addressed in this project.  Sandia National Laboratories will be the industrial collaborator in this project; they will provide real world case studies and necessary knowledge, as well as play a role in validating the project findings.&lt;br/&gt;A focus in this project is the education of minority students at New Mexico State University (NMSU).  Outreach activities involving school students and teachers will be conducted as part of the Soaring Eagle initiative at NMSU.  This project will enhance the existing infrastructure at NMSU as well as highlight the usefulness of Internet2 for learning activities. Dissemination activities will include publishing papers in leading journals, through a project web site, as well as through paper presentations at conferences such as the annual American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE) conferences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In this project, an advanced virtual reality (VR) environment to support the assembly of tiny micron sized parts was developed.  Two physical work cells have been built to demonstrate feasibility of newly proposed gripping and assembly techniques.           The virtual environments have been interfaced with a state of the art Virtual Reality (VR) Powerwall.           The most exciting outcome of this grant is using the Virtual Reality environments to introduce school students to engineering as part of the Soaring Eagle program at OSU (grades 1 - 12).     The research environments are being used to support teaching of micro assembly concepts in engineering at OSU  Other findings:     Los Alamos National Laboratory fabricated saw toothed shaped gripping surfaces to test out our hypothesis that van der waals forces come down when using such asurface profile.  Stillwater Public Schools   They participated in the Soaring Eagle program which is an outreach activity aimed at introducing school students to engineering activities. We used the virtual environments and physical micro environments to provide an exciting introduction to students grades 1 -12 from Stillwater public schools as well as schools in las cruces. NM.   Major accomplishments to date include:  * Creation of an advanced virtual reality environment to support the creation of a micro assembly factory  * Design of an information based manufacturing framework to facilitate the rapid assembly of micron sized devices   Sample parts from sandia and Los Alamos National Labs have been assembled.    Training and Development:  Undergraduate students have participated in research activities related to micro / nano assembly.   These students were first provided an introduction to micro assembly theory and practises by the PI; papers were reviewed; models were built and compared; research papers were submitted to conferences.  Some of the simulation environments were used to educate elementary school students in stillwater about micro assembly technologies as well as virtual reality technologies.   Outreach Activities:   Soaring Eagle workshops  School students from Stillwater (Oklahoma), Mescalero Apache (New Mexico) and Anthony (El Paso, Texas) and Stillwater (Oklahoma) schools were introduced to the domain of micro assembly through use of the virtual environments created in this project.  School teachers also participated in the Soaring Eagle workshops  Other activities:  REU students from other universities worked on several research activities related to this project including modeling of van der Waals forces, design of grippers, etc.  .   * modeling of adhesive forces which come into play during gripping activities.  * The creation of virtual reality based simulation environments to assist in the assembly of micro devices  * Development of preliminary models focusing on the interaction of a manipulator and target cells in bio-engineering contexts  * Creation of new course modules in micro assembly for under graduate and graduate students    * Involvement of NSF REU participants in project activities* Involvement of NSF RET participants (school teachers in southern new mexico) through workshops and research activities  * Design of a virtual factory related simulation environment        Last Modified: 02/29/2012       Submitted by: J.
