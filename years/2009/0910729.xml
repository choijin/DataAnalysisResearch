<AbstractNarration>The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Robert M. Waymouth of Stanford University who proposes studies to devise new kinetic strategies for the catalytic conversion of olefins into high-value materials and chemical intermediates. Specific aims are to develop synthetic strategies to generate polyolefins of defined sequence distribution and to generate new classes of telechelic oligomers derived from readily available olefin feedstocks. Specific intellectual gains anticipated from the proposed work include: (1) an understanding of the role of conformational dynamics to generate "smart" catalysts that can access multiple kinetic states, (2) an understanding of the necessary and sufficient criteria for chain-shuttling polymerization as a strategy to generate multi-state catalysts, and (3) further insights on metallacycle mechanisms for selectively oligomerizing ethylene. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research by Professor Waymouth will engage students in a highly interdisciplinary research area that combines organic and organometallic syntheses, computational methods, mechanistic inorganic and organometallic chemistry, catalytic olefin polymerization, and analysis of polymer structure and properties. The catalytic polymerization of olefins constitutes one of the major technological achievements of the 20th Century. Olefin polymerization catalysis is prototypical translational science, where new scientific insights and advances in catalyst developments have transformed industrial practice. In addition to the impact of Professor Waymouth's research and his mentoring activities, this NSF sponsored research will be coupled with a number of initiatives that will broaden the impact of his scholarly activities. Professor Waymouth plans to recruit a high school science teacher to spend the summer of 2009 in his laboratory to develop teaching modules associated with macromolecular science, and to the extent appropriate, the intriguing features of multiblock polyolefins. He has taken an active role in recruiting and mentoring women, underrepresented, and disabled students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
