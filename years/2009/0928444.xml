<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT HRD 0928444&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of the District of Columbia (UDC) STEM Center for Research and Development is continuing to build upon the successes of previous HBCU-UP funding and is introducing additional novel and effective programs to enhance the likelihood that more STEM students will complete their undergraduate education and enroll in graduate programs. After an extensive recruiting effort, the Center is fostering innovative activities that will retain and improve academic competencies of the STEM undergraduate students and provide the required confidence and basic research skills that will serve as the foundation to support the development of future STEM researchers. There will be an introduction of new and an enhancement of existing multidisciplinary course offerings (bioethics, computational biology, statistics, genomics).  New enrichment activities will add to the success of the existing ones, such as a partnership with the new UDC Office of International Development specifically designed to facilitate experiences for its undergraduates interested in international summer research. For the first time, the Center has a major focus on increasing the pedagogical skills of STEM faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also support for the plan to increase accommodating Students with Disabilities through partnership with the UDC Office of Disabilities that will support the Center students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STEM Center objectives are: (1) to provide support activities that will promote a seamless transition from high school or community college, to undergraduate school, to graduate school in STEM disciplines; (2) to provide opportunities for faculty to improve their research and teaching skills; and (3) to improve the STEM curriculum to include new and enhanced courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project gives the University additional support to advance curricular reform, increase student training, and enhance faculty development. The UDC goal of institutional quality is consistent with the tangible goal and objectives of the STEM Center, specifically retaining high quality faculty actively conducting student-assisted research, improving teaching capabilities, and producing well qualified graduates.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Implementation Grant: STEM Center for Research and Development          The University of the District of Columbia (UDC), the NationÆs only Urban Land-Grant Institution, was awarded a 5-year NSF/HBCU-UP Implementation Grant (HRD 0928444) on September 1, 2009.  A no-cost extension was granted in 2014 and 2015. We present the progress or our efforts that were accomplished because we achieved our goal and objectives. The goal of the program was to promote initiatives, strategies, and activities that will increase the number of minority students pursuing careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The objectives of the program were to: 1) Provide support activities that will promote a seamless transition from high school or community college to undergraduate school, to graduate school in STEM disciplines, 2) Provide opportunities for faculty to improve their research and teaching skills, and 3) Improve the STEM curriculum by including new and enhanced courses.  Intellectual Merit: The STEM Center implemented a series of activities designed, specifically, for underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduate STEM students and STEM faculty.  We introduced concepts that originated in the Center as a result of our extensive experiences in working with STEM minority students, as well as data accrued and modified from the published literature. These novel activities included:  the Junior Year Experience (designed to guide students through their junior year negotiating all of the necessary steps that will assist them with the transition to graduate programs); Journal Club (a faculty-led interdisciplinary forum that provides students with the most up-to-date information in the STEM disciplines); highly informative seminars and interactive workshops (to enhance studentsÆ academic skills); multidisciplinary new course offerings (Genomics and Bioethics); and additional resources to augment the teaching and research skills of STEM faculty.  We have established a foundation for studentsÆ academic successes and faculty development that translates into increased enrollment, retention, and graduation rates in STEM disciplines at UDC.  Broader Impact:  The objectives achieved in the second grant cycle sought to reverse the trends that support the dearth of minorities in STEM professions. In every category assessed, the data strongly indicate the activities of the Center had a major impact on student achievement and faculty development.  During the 5-year period (2009-2014), the CenterÆs activities impacted 69 students engaged in the Junior-Year Experience; 168 students attending Journal Club; 92 students engage in year-round research and presenting their research results at national conferences; and 423 students enrolled in STEM Center Courses.  A major initiative of the Center is to offer gate-keeper and sophomore-level courses with a research component to increase academic skills and generate greater interest in STEM. The STEM Center courses included biological science I and II, general chemistry I and II, cell biology, signals and systems, and integrated science.  Passing rates of C or better for all STEM Center courses increased from 77% to 89% respectively after introduction of the research component.  A large cadre of students 1,325) participated in the CenterÆs enrichment activities.  The seminars, workshops, and special events were opened to the UDC community and the public. STEM Center faculty participated in workshops to enhance their teaching and research skills and 13 Center faculty received 46 grants and published 116 books, book chapters, conference proceedings, or refereed articles.  These data were presented at national conferences and published in a book chapter.  The STEM Center maintains a website linked to and from the UDC website.
