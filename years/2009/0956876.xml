<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project is to develop a prototype biosensor array system for rapid surveillance of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) operated by minimally-trained personnel. MRSA, one of the major bacterial pathogens for healthcare acquired infections (HAI), afflicts overcrowded and understaffed US hospitals. Thus, an urgent need exists for a more rapid, reliable yet affordable testing method for HAI screening. The proposed tip sensor?s novel sample concentration mechanism enables rapid screening of whole cells followed by confirmation of genetic signatures. The project implements a proprietary sample concentration mechanism for highly efficient capture and detection of bacterial pathogens in a size-exclusive manner. The novelty of the proposed work involves studying DNA reaction kinetics enhanced by a high-frequency electric field on a high aspect ratio tip. The transformative nature of the proposed biosensing technology enables screening for pathogens and nanoparticles without culture and amplification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to establish a solid fabrication and detection method for a high-throughput biosensor. The tip sensors offer a specific concentration of whole bacterial cells (screening) and an accelerated DNA detection (confirmation). The proposed method will pave the way to high-throughput screening of pathogens through the specific detection in terms of target-geometry, electric properties, and affinity chemistry. The operation cost and time can be minimized through superior concentration performance. Considering the concentration and detection mechanisms, the tip sensor works as a universal platform for low cost detection of various pathogenic analytes including bacteria and viruses, proteins and nucleic acids in clinical samples. The societal impact of this biosensor platform will fulfill an unmet need to save healthcare costs associated with specific pathogens. The technology would eventually be deployed in resource-limited settings including individual uses, for the detection of various pathogens. Thus, this technology will directly impact the fields of micro/nanochip fabrication, biomedical sensors, and low-cost diagnostics.</AbstractNarration>
