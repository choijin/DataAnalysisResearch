<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for a combined geochronologic, petrographic, geochemical, and Sr-Nd-Pb-Os-O isotopic investigation of existing lava samples from the seamounts in the Adare Basin and from the adjacent continental Hallett Volcanic Province in Northern Victoria Land. A comparative study of contemporaneous intraplate oceanic and continental alkaline volcanism will be used to evaluate sources and processes responsible for magma production and differentiation. The seamount lavas will provide an opportunity to better characterize the composition of their underlying mantle source whereas the continental lavas will provide information on any effects of contamination by continental crust on their source signatures. The cause of Cenozoic magmatism in West Antarctica has been explained by a variety of models based primarily on geochemical evidence from continental volcanism. The proposed investigation will for the first time provide detailed geochronologic and geochemical data for both continental lavas and adjacent oceanic seamount lavas, thus offering a means by which to critically assess whether Cenozoic alkaline volcanism is due to plume or plume-related activities or magmatism unrelated to mantle plumes. The classic element of this controversy is whether the geochemistry of the magmas represents melting of mantle asthenosphere or subcontinental lithosphere and whether there is a degree of contamination as they rise through relatively thick and chemically heterogeneous continental crust. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This project will support a PhD and MSc student. Undergraduate students will also be involved in sample preparation, analytical work and interpretation via honors/senior theses. A post-doctoral associate will be involved in the oxygen isotopic analysis of the samples. The students will be involved in a multi-institutional and international collaboration. The geochemical database generated will be made available to other researchers in the region and the results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ According to the plate tectonics theory, the EarthÃ†s outer layer consists of lithospheric plates that are constantly in motion and interacting with each other. A major manifestation of such phenomena is continental rifting. Two major geologic processes are complexly intertwined in continental rifting &ndash; tectonic and magmatic. Tectonic processes result from the build up of stresses due to the interactions of lithospheric plates and/or release of pressure of magmas melted from the EarthÃ†s mantle at depth. Magmatic processes result from the escape of magmas upwelling from the mantle and/or response of the mantle due to tectonic processes at the surface.     The composition of mantle melts or magmas such as that preserved in volcanic rocks can help scientists better constrain why continents break apart. Specifically, a popular working hypothesis is that continents break when they hover over "hotspots" in the mantle where copious melting occurs.  In general, geochemically "enriched" volcanic rocks from hotspots can be readily recognized when they are erupted through the normal, geochemically "depleted" oceanic plate; however, these are often hard to identify when hotspot magmas erupt through the thicker, compositionally more heterogeneous and likewise geochemically enriched continental plate.   Cenozoic magmatism associated with the west Antarctic rift system (WARS) has important implications for models of continental rifting. Although young volcanic lavas in the WARS are believed to be localized along fault zones and, thus, the WARS is considered magma-poor, some scientists propose that rifting here is mainly due to hotspot magmatism. In contrast, other scientists call upon continental magmatism associated with passive or active tectonic rifting. Incidentally, previously available data for rocks from on-land volcanoes in the northwest Ross Sea (NWRS) region that are clearly associated with the rifting process posses equivocal signals of either hotspot magmatism contaminated by continental material or simply continental magmatism sampled through tectonism.  Through a pilot study funded by NSF-OPP, P.I. Pat Castillo from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD and co-P.I.

Together, these samples provide a compositional transect that allows an investigation of whether a continent-type compositional signal disappears from continental to oceanic environment or, conversely, a hotspot-type compositional signal disappears away from the ocean as it gets diluted or contaminated towards the continent.  Detailed analytical results for Adare Basin samples show their petrographic, major element, trace element, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions resemble those of volcanic rocks from ocean islands with a distinct, hotspot compositional affinity.  Combined with literature data for volcanic rocks from the continental margin in the NWRS region, all samples show a remarkable orderly compositional variation toward the continent, suggesting they were all generated from a common heterogeneous mantle source at progressively greater degree of melting from ocean to continent. Small degree partial melting preferentially taps the more easily fusible, hotspot-like component of the mantle whereas higher degree melting incorporates a greater proportion of the ambient mantle. Significantly, new oxygen and osmium isotopic results for both continental and oceanic samples are consistent with such a partial melting scenario although they also suggest a small, but steady increase in crustal contamination toward the continent.
