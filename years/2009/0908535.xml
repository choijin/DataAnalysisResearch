<AbstractNarration>This project covers three areas related to multiply scattered waves: coherence propagation, focusing, and imaging in cluttered media. Firstly, a comprehensive and rigorous framework is formulated to analyze the space-frequency coherence properties of waves in random media. Secondly, the multiply scattered evanescent waves will be taken into account to enhance the wave focusing in cluttered media. Thirdly, imaging methods based on the compressed sensing techniques will be developed to achieve stable, accurate imaging of multiple targets in clutter with nearly minimal sensing resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple scattering is a basic phenomenon in wave physics. It affects how signals and information are transferred in clutter prevalent in both natural and urban environments. In addition to fundamental research in wave physics, the main applications of the project are in remote sensing and near-field imaging. In particular, the project on detecting intruders hidden in clutter is important for homeland security and tissue imaging. The project on imaging in the background of rough surfaces will have impacts on aerial sensing of natural resources and targets in the terrestrial environment, as well as design of nanophotonic sensors for detecting biological and chemical agents. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The field of imaging  is, by nature,  an interdisciplinary activity with mathematical, numerical, software and hardware components. This project focuses on  the mathematical and the numerical aspects of imaging.     The proposed imaging methods take advantage of prior knowledge of the targets and use efficient measurements to collect relatively few data to fully recover the targets by efficient algorithms. It is proved for the first time  that the standard resolution limit can be still be achieved with such sparse measurements. These methods have been applied to radar with superior performance demonstrated in numerical simulations.     In addition, the project develops efficient algorithms that incorporate prior knowledge of the targets to achieve enhanced resolving power beyond the standard resolution limit. These algorithms can be applied to other highly coherent measurement schemes arising in  radar imaging with excellent results demonstrated numerically.      Finally this project proposes a novel approach to coherent imaging with intensity-only measurements based on joint deployment of random masks and object constraints. The benefits are reduced number of needed data, rapid convergence of numerical procedures and greatly enhanced efficiency. The superior performance can be realized even with very roughly calibrated masks. This method is pertinent to imaging modalities such as X-ray, optical and electron microscopies.
