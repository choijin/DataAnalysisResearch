<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of high quality video production and post-production equipment to support research at Syracuse University. Several research projects at Syracuse University currently collect and analyze large quantities of digital video (DV) data to investigate diverse questions that consider both the obvious and the subtle interactions people have with each other and with technology. Digital video data analysis, which requires high quality video production and post-production equipment and specialized analytical software, allows for repeated and detailed examination of acquired footage and increased analytic accuracy. Findings from DV data analysis can play an important role in fostering the integration of research and education in research-intensive learning environments and can play an important role in reconfiguring research practices that challenge the distinction between practitioners and researchers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Syracuse University currently lacks comprehensive infrastructure for supporting research endeavors that generate and analyze DV data. Because of the lack of robust DV infrastructure, researchers at the University have not been able to engage in research on questions that are best addressed by methodologies that generate DV data. The requested equipment and software will have a direct and immediate impact on faculty in three disciplines involved in research in Science Education, Teacher Education, Instructional Technology, and Linguistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research supported by this equipment is in the areas of science teaching and situated cognition that refine and enhance science pedagogy, which will be integrated into K-12 and higher educational practices and will include pre-service and in-service teachers. Undergraduate and graduate researchers will work on all of the projects enabled by this grant.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was implemented to build robust video data research capacity at Syracuse University to support research efforts that collect and analyze large quantities of digital video (DV) data. Researchers from a range of disciplines have used this infrastructure  in projects that investigate diverse questions considering both the obvious and the subtle interactions humans have with each other or with technology. Such questions include:  How does a video-enhanced reflection process shape teachers' development in parent interaction to ultimately foster parental engagement and student learning? What indicators of students' engagement are teachers utilizing in science instruction? How do variations in usability factors affect the use of technology by people with disabilities? What usability factors have the broadest positive effect? How can video analysis document message-passing strategies, demonstrate authorship, and validate typed communication for people who do not use verbal speech?   DV data analysis, which requires high quality video production and post-production equipment and specialized analytical software, allows for repeated and detailed examination of research footage and increased analytic accuracy.  Findings from video data analysis can play an important role in fostering the integration of research and education in research-intensive learning environments and can play an important role in reconfiguring research practices that challenge the distinction between practitioners and researchers. The project had a three-year timeline (2010-2013). Year 1 focused on hardware and software installation, backup infrastructure development, and video-capture development.  Year 2 of the project included installation of a fixed research lab and pilot research projects in undergraduate courses.  Year 3 concluded capacity and infrastructure development phases with the addition of the portable computer lab for fieldwork and full implementation in a variety of research project as well as graduate and undergraduate research training.   Prior to this porject, Syracuse University lacked comprehensive infrastructure for supporting research endeavors that generate and analyze DV data. While the University does have high quality video production and post-production equipment, the use of those resources is limited in quantity and only available to students and faculty in media-production fields within the School of Public Communications.  Researchers at Syracuse University have been using this infrastructire to improve and streamline research projects that capture, code, transcribe and analyze DV data. The project was cross-disciplinary, including faculty and students from 9 departments and programs and provided research experiences for undergraduate students in multiple disciplines using leading-edge tools and techniques.  This project supports  MRI-R2 Program Goals by:  Supporting the acquisition of major state-of-the-art instrumentation, thereby improving access to, and increased use of, modern research and research training instrumentation by scientists, engineers, and graduate and undergraduate students; and Enabling academic departments, disciplinary and cross-disciplinary units, and multi-organization collaborations to create well equipped research environments that integrate research with education.
