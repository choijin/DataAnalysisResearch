<AbstractNarration>Gluesing-Luerssen&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0908379&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project aims at furthering the mathematical theory of&lt;br/&gt;convolutional codes.  The error-correcting quality of these codes&lt;br/&gt;can be measured by a variety of distance parameters that have&lt;br/&gt;been introduced in the engineering-oriented literature.  The main&lt;br/&gt;idea of the project is the investigation of convolutional codes&lt;br/&gt;based on the weight adjacency matrix, a single parameter that&lt;br/&gt;comprises, among other things, all those different distance&lt;br/&gt;measures.  So far two major results have been established by the&lt;br/&gt;investigator: a MacWilliams Identity Theorem stating that the&lt;br/&gt;weight adjacency matrix of a code fully determines that of the&lt;br/&gt;dual code, and a theorem stating that codes without non-zero&lt;br/&gt;constant codewords and sharing the same weight adjacency matrix&lt;br/&gt;are monomially equivalent.  These results open up new directions&lt;br/&gt;in convolutional coding theory.  Firstly, self-dual codes can be&lt;br/&gt;studied theoretically.  Besides the obvious fact that the weight&lt;br/&gt;adjacency matrix of a self-dual code is invariant under the&lt;br/&gt;MacWilliams transformation, the close link between self-dual&lt;br/&gt;convolutional codes and self-dual block codes obtained by&lt;br/&gt;tail-biting plays a crucial role.  It can be expected that,&lt;br/&gt;conversely, positive results for self-dual convolutional codes&lt;br/&gt;will also have an impact on the theory of self-dual tail-biting&lt;br/&gt;block codes.  Furthermore, the investigator explores the&lt;br/&gt;MacWilliams Identity and its consequences for minimal&lt;br/&gt;conventional and tail-biting trellises for linear block codes. &lt;br/&gt;The analogy in the graphical representation of trellis block&lt;br/&gt;codes and convolutional codes indeed suggests a parallel&lt;br/&gt;treatment of these two classes of codes.  Another subproject aims&lt;br/&gt;at investigating under what conditions one may declare two&lt;br/&gt;convolutional codes identical with respect to their algebraic&lt;br/&gt;structure and error-correcting capabilities.  In light of the&lt;br/&gt;result about monomially equivalent codes mentioned above, the&lt;br/&gt;weight adjacency matrix is expected to play a crucial role in&lt;br/&gt;this project as well.  The goal of this subproject is a&lt;br/&gt;classification and a comparison of convolutional codes in the&lt;br/&gt;sense of classical coding theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This project focuses on the algebraic theory of&lt;br/&gt;error-correcting codes.  Such codes protect data against&lt;br/&gt;alteration through noise and enable the reconstruction of the&lt;br/&gt;original data from the corrupted information.  All current&lt;br/&gt;standards of data transmission and data storage have built-in&lt;br/&gt;error correcting mechanisms.  The most famous examples are the&lt;br/&gt;compact disk player, cell phones, the internet, satellite and&lt;br/&gt;deep space communication systems.  The project aims at deepening&lt;br/&gt;the mathematical theory of convolutional codes.  This specific&lt;br/&gt;class of codes forms one of the major players in many&lt;br/&gt;communication schemes, mainly in deep space communication and&lt;br/&gt;other wireless data transmission schemes.  With the ever-growing&lt;br/&gt;demand of sophisticated information technology there is a&lt;br/&gt;continuing need of a thorough mathematical theory in order to&lt;br/&gt;improve the performance of such communication devices. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
