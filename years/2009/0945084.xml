    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the specific technical barrier of the immobilization of ceramic nanofibers to rigid ceramic support structures for catalysis applications. In discussions with end-users and strategic partners, specific concerns over the usage of fibrous supported ceramic nanofibers, i.e. the use of ceramic microfibers to form a composite matrix, have been raised, since these types of support structures can cause significant pressure losses during operation. There also is uncertainty as to the durability of these materials under continued use and specific application conditions. The ability to produce a rigid support structure that can effectively immobilize ceramic fiber materials for usage in high-velocity and high-temperature gas flows represents a large market opportunity. In this Phase I project, various ceramic fiber immobilization tactics will be investigated, including different binder materials and procedures, and the results will be assessed in terms of bonding (immobilization) strength and efficiency. The overall performance of the bonded materials will also be investigated and compared to currently established standards based upon fibrous support structures. It is anticipated that careful selection and refinement of binders and procedures will allow for the development of a stable, rigid support platform for catalyzed ceramic nanofibers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the development of rigid catalyst structures integrating the unique properties of catalyzed ceramic nanofibers. This will maximize the efficient use of catalytic materials, enhance the destruction of greenhouse gases from combustion processes, and capture harmful particulates from various gas process streams. The ability to produce thermally stable catalyst structures not only increases the efficiencies of many existing applications, it will create new and alternative application opportunities that can assist in pollution abatement and decrease production costs of specific products. One embodiment of the technology development is the use of advanced ceramic nanofiber based materials for the treatment of small-engine exhaust sources. The US EPA estimates that small gasoline engines account for greater than 25% of nationwide hydrocarbon emissions and 30% of total nationwide carbon monoxide emissions. Currently there is no sound technology to treat exhaust emissions from these engines, due primarily to cost and performance constraints. The technology innovation central to this proposal has the potential of providing a solution to this environmental concern, and thereby positively impacting the environment.</AbstractNarration>
