<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project aims to develop a wearable computer system with an innovative multimodal input mechanism. The objective of this research is to assess the feasibility, efficiency, and quality of documentation performed with a wearable computer utilizing speech recognition against the current methods of laptop input and paper notation. To measure the impact, field trials will be performed at two local EMS agencies, replacing their current method of field documentation with this wearable computer system. Data will be gathered on accuracy, documentation time, and other metrics for both their current system and the Phase I prototype. The anticipated results include an increase in percentage of documentation completed, reduction in time taken for documentation and communication, and reduction in documentation errors per trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seamless exchange of patient information will impact emergency care on a national level for both EMTs and patients. As new regulations are introduced to require electronic patient records, EMS agencies will be forced to transfer their current operations to digital records. This wearable computer system will enable a smoother transition from paper to electronic documentation as it follows the EMT?s current workflow for documentation input. For patients, hands-free documentation at the point-of-care can decrease the number of errors and allow EMTs to focus on their patients, enabling faster and higher quality care during transport and at the hospital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
