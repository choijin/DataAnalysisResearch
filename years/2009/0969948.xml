<AbstractNarration>High-energy particle astrophysics has been revolutionized during the last decade as a result of discoveries made by ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes and air shower arrays have now detected more than 80 point sources of gamma-radiation at energies above 100 GeV, the very high-energy (VHE) regime. In some cases the emitted radiation exceeds energies of 20 TeV. The detected VHE sources include pulsar nebulae, binary systems, supernova remnants, the Galactic center, blazars, radio galaxies, and starburst galaxies. With detailed measurements of these sources, we are making great strides towards understanding the acceleration and emission mechanisms taking place in the most energetic objects in the universe. The need to more fully explore the high-energy sky to search for, and understand, these cosmic accelerators is now stronger than ever. In space, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope surveys the GeV sky with much greater sensitivity than its predecessor, EGRET. On the ground, VERITAS (the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System), an array of four large atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, is now fully operational at a sensitivity level more than an order of magnitude better than the previous generation of instruments. Indeed, VERITAS is presently the most sensitive gamma-ray telescope in the world. It has operated extremely well during the last two years and is already producing a wealth of scientific information, including the discovery, and detailed measurements, of many of new sources of VHE gamma-rays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the UCLA group's efforts that will be focused on maintaining VERITAS, taking and analyzing data, and continuing the scientific harvest. UCLA also plays a leading role in the dark matter key science project that searches for gamma-ray signatures of annihilating dark matter. A critical activity in all of these scientific areas will be to incorporate results obtained from Fermi data and to collaborate with Fermi scientists. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal include a commitment of the UCLA group to supporting the overall VERITAS Education and Public Outreach (EPO) program, which it helped to develop. The EPO program reaches local audiences at the Whipple Observatory Visitor's Center, museum audiences at the Adler Planetarium, and the general public through the VERITAS education web site.</AbstractNarration>

By carrying out astrophysical observations using gamma-ray telescopes, we thus study the most energetic processes in the universe, such as those associated with intense gravitational fields near black holes and strong magnetic fields near pulsars.  Gamma rays observations can also be used to study questions of fundamental physics such as the nature of dark matter.  This award supported researchers involved in the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) project to carry out high-energy gamma-ray observations and to analyze the data from these observations.  As shown in the first figure, VERITAS is a state-of-the-art gamma-ray observatory that employs four large telescopes at the F.L. Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona, USA.  High-energy gamma rays are detected on dark, clear nights from the short flashes of Cherenkov radiation produced in the atmosphere. The researchers supported on this award were closely involved in the original design and construction of VERITAS and played a major role in the data-taking and analysis of data from the observatory over the period of 2010 to 2014.  The astrophysical research carried out under this award focused on three major areas: dark matter, energetic sources in our Galaxy and intergalactic radiation fields.   Dark matter, the unknown material that makes up approximately 85% of the mass of universe, is a deep mystery confounding physicists and astronomers today. Many theoretical models predict a new dark matter particle that would decay or annihilate to produce high-energy particles and radiation, including gamma rays. VERITAS carried out observations of astrophysical objects (particularly small satellite galaxies of the Milky Way) and placed the most constraining limits to date on the density of dark matter in these objects.  Our Milky Way galaxy is filled with very energetic particles and radiation.  The origin of these cosmic rays is not fully understood.  The researchers supported here used VERITAS to carry out a multi-year survey of the Cygnus region of the Galactic plane &ndash; one of the densest regions of supernovae and young stars in the Galaxy.  This survey led to follow-up observations that revealed a number of new, powerful astrophysical sources of very high-energy gamma rays. One such object, shown in the second figure, is called SNR G78.2+2.1.  This object is a relatively famous supernova remnant that is also known as gamma-Cygni.  The second figure shows the image of this source, as discovered by VERITAS for the first time in very high-energy gamma rays.  The VERITAS image is the color scale and the contours and symbols represent data from other observatories.  We know relatively little about the vast amounts of space that lies between galaxies in the universe. In particular, we have almost no knowledge about whether or not there are magnetic fields in this extragalactic space.  Detecting such a field would be exciting as it could provide insight to primordial processes that occurred in the early universe.  The researchers under this award developed a novel technique to study this extragalactic magnetic field. The technique involved using gamma-ray observations of distant active galaxies. The detected gamma rays were used as tracers of magnetic field processes over the long distance of travel to Earth.  An important part of this project is to make a positive and beneficial impact on our nationÆs scientific and technological infrastructure and to engage the general public in the results from the research.  This award helped to support a total of seven university students, three graduate students and four undergraduates.  The students all received training in computer systems and algorithms, in scientific analysis and in public presentation. Several members of the group gave public lectures in Los Angeles area and at the VERITAS site in Arizona. The group also produced exhibits for...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
