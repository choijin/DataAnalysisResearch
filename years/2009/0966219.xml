<AbstractNarration>This project is providing 20 scholarships to academically talented and financially needy students at in two baccalaureate degree engineering technology programs (Computer Engineering Technology and Mechanical Engineering Technology) at Indiana State University (ISU). The project develops new support mechanisms including multi-disciplinary seminars, industry forum, and online academic/social networking to compliment mature student support services, such as learning community and co-ops/interns.  Interactions among students and industry professionals help increase the focus and interest of students, enhance the educational experience of students, and build a relationship of feedback and exchange for students' ongoing success.  Women and underrepresented minorities are also being recruited as participants of the project. An independent evaluator is involved in project evaluation.</AbstractNarration>
