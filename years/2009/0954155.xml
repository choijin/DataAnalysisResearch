<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this CAREER award is to develop a non invasive, quantitative microscopy method with enhanced spatial resolution and depth penetration for the study of collagen fibers in living biological systems such as the cornea.  The method, second-harmonic generation microscopy, is a nonlinear optical process that allows detailed imaging without the need for stains or contrast agents. The microscope would combine second harmonic nonlinear scattering with three dimensional control of light polarization and software analysis methods. The resulting system will enable noninvasive determination of the spatial organization of collagen fibers, allowing differentiation between fibrillar collagen types and assessment of collagen fiber spatial orientation and spacing.&lt;br/&gt;The educational objective of this award is to promote optical science and engineering education to the general public. To accomplish this, an online educational YouTube series ("Photonics TV") on optics for high-school and college students will be established. A hands-on optics module ("Optics Circus") will be developed for middle school students, and a Minority Contributions to Science and Technology Series set for use in the local community.

More than half a dozen peer-reviewed journal articles and a dozen conference presentations directly resulted from this work.

In addition to the aforementioned technical achievements, the project also resulted in several educational and outreach milestones. Theses or final projects for at least 1 Ph.D. and a half dozen M.S. students also resulted from this project.
