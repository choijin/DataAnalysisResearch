<AbstractNarration>The goals of this project are to develop collaborative tools for helping to solve difficult managerial and societal problems and to test these tools on an important problem confronting the world today:  global climate change. Inspired by systems like Wikipedia and Linux, the project will develop a global, on-line forum - called the Climate Collaboratorium - in which thousands of people around the world can create, analyze, and ultimately select detailed plans for what humans can do about global climate change. At the core of the system will be an evolving collection of user-created plans based on computer simulations of the actions humans can take and the predicted impacts of those actions. Users will also be able to debate the pros and cons of different plans and vote for the plans and arguments they find most credible and desirable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit &lt;br/&gt;The primary intellectual contributions of this work will be lessons about how to design large-scale model-centric collective decision-making tools and the communities to use them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;At a minimum, this on-line forum can help educate the general public about the real issues involved in global climate change. But more importantly, by constructively engaging a broad range of scientists, policy makers, and ordinary citizens, this forum may help develop plans and policies that are actually better than any that would have otherwise been developed. In short, it could become a combination of a kind of simulation game for climate change, a Wikipedia for controversial topics, and an electronic democracy on steroids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the Climate CoLab is to harness the collective intelligence of thousands of people from all around the world to address global climate change. Inspired by systems like Wikipedia and Linux, the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence has developed an on-line forum where citizens create, analyze, and select detailed proposals for what to do about climate change.  Computerized simulation models project the environmental and economic outcomes of the actions proposed by community members, experts review and evaluate the proposals, and both experts and other users select the most promising proposals.   As of mid-2012, more than 40,000 people from all over the world have visited the Climate CoLab, and over 3,800 have registered as members.  A series of three annual contests have been held.  The most recent annual contest, in 2011, addressed the topic:  How should the 21st century economy evolve bearing in mind the risks of climate change?   Winning proposals in the 2011 contest came from teams with members in the US, Nigeria, India, and Australia, and the winning ideas included personal rapid transit systems, reducing meat consumption, and negotiating international climate agreements in North/South blocs.  One of the winning proposals in 2011, was a combination of the three winners from 2010.  Another winning proposal came from a team formed on the Climate CoLab site, including a climate activist from Florida, a sociology professor from Minnesota, and a climate researcher from Australia.  In January 2012, representatives of all the winning teams presented their ideas in briefings at the United Nations in New York and the US Congress in Washington, DC.  In 2012-13, the Climate CoLab is subdividing the overall problem of climate change into many different sub-problems with different groups of people working on different sub-problems (like how to reduce emissions from electric power generation in China or how city governments can adapt to sea level rise).  Each sub-problem area will include not only a community of people developing proposals for what to do, but also expert advisors, potential implementers, and other stakeholders.  Then, in later contests, community members will develop integrated proposals that bring together elements from many different sub-problems into overall proposed solutions for the whole world.  By constructively engaging a broad range of scientists, policy makers, business people, and concerned citizens, we hope this forum will help develop&mdash;and gain support for&mdash;climate change plans that are better than any that would have otherwise been developed.
