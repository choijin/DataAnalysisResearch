<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I seeks to develop a micro-abrasive-waterjet nozzle for machining features between 50 to 100 micrometers. The project is extremely challenging because abrasive waterjet (AWJ) machining involves an ultrahigh-speed, 3-phase flow engaging in complex solid/fluid interactions within very small dimensions that are changing rapidly. The project is aiming to minimize the beam diameters of abrasive waterjets, reshape and refocus the jet stream exiting the nozzle, improve flow characteristics of fine abrasives, and mitigate abrasive clogging. The micro-abrasive-waterjet nozzle with a single-feed port will become the most compact size of its kind by eliminating the vacuum assist and water flushing requirements needed to prevent abrasive clogging. The recent advent of micro-nano, green energy, and biomedical technologies has created tremendous opportunities for low-cost micromanufacturing. The micro-abrasive-waterjet will take advantage of the inherent merits of waterjet technology -- versatility (material independence), cold cutting (preservation of material integrity), cost effectiveness, and fast turnaround -- that are unmatchable by most established tools. The final goal is to further downsize abrasive waterjet nozzles toward micromachining, meet the high demand for low-cost micromanufacturing and further boost the market share of waterjet machine tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of waterjet micromachining will be machining fits well within the 'just-in-time' practice of lean manufacturing; using waterjet machining, small and large parts/lots made from most materials can be completed from design to finish in hours -- something that is not possible through outsourcing them abroad. This project's development of waterjet micromachining will promote waterjet technology for high value-added jobs and further sustain its phenomenal growth. Inserting additional waterjet systems into the manufacturer arena would not only raise the awareness of this technology but also help save jobs from being outsourced overseas. This could have an important society impact through planting the seeds needed to help rebuild a sustainable U.S. manufacturing industry, leading to reversing the three-decade long trend of the continued shrinkage of domestic manufacturing workforce, and revitalizing the once prosperous manufacturing business toward a recovery of America's economy.</AbstractNarration>

Liu And Ernst Schubert OMAX Corporation 21409 72nd Avenue South Kent, WA 98032 253-872-2300 www.omax.com The SBIR Phase I feasibility of developing micro abrasive-waterjet (uAWJ) nozzles capable of machining features between 50 to 100 microns has been demonstrated (1, 2, 3).[1]During the Phase I R&amp;D, experimental nozzles that are smaller than OMAXÆs smallest production nozzle were assembled and tested.

Furthermore, OMAX received for 2011 an in-kind-contribution ($6000 value) from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) through a TAP (Technology Assistance Program) agreement (http://www.pnl.gov/edo/assistance/techassist.stm);  PNNL will offer assistance to OMAX for characterizing the edge quality of AWJ-cut micro parts in its world-class material laboratory, as compared to that machined with conventional machine tools. The new R&amp;D activities carried out and established in Phase IB has laid much ground work for Phase II in developing, assembling, testing, and optimizing prototype uAWJ nozzles and a low-power and small-footprint uJetMachining Center as a complete and versatile system for AWJ micromachining. The versatility of AWJs has been established (2) but conventional systems are not optimized for micro-meso machining; they are simply too bulky, energy inefficient, and cost ineffective. The establishment of uAWJ technology would enable downsizing of key components of AWJ equipment resulting in a highly cost effective, energy efficient, and versatile tool. The affordability of mass-produced low-cost uJetMachining Centers would be the key to entice most small job shops and machine shops to embrace AWJ technology. This would be a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
