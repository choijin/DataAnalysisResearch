<AbstractNarration>Tiospaye in Science is a scholarship program that aims to increase the number of American Indian students graduating from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT) with bachelor's degrees in science.  The targeted degree programs are chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, and physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiospaye is a Lakota word meaning 'extended family'; in this scholarship program, the extended family of science supports American Indian students in their academic, professional, cultural, and social activities.  The financial support through the scholarships in combination with the web of support facilitated through one-on-one and one-on-small group contact with the science extended family serve as strong anchors to increase the pathways to success for American Indian students in science.  The science extended family includes the scholarship recipients as well as the other students, staff, faculty, administrators, alumni/alumnae, employers, the community, student family members, tribal members, and tribal college partners - most notably Oglala Lakota College.  Tiospaye in Science also partners with Tiospaye in Engineering, another scholarship program at SDSMT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through Tiospaye in Science, fifteen scholarships are being awarded to academically talented and financially needy students with a special emphasis on recruiting Native Americans that are members of federally recognized tribes, graduates of tribal high schools, or transfers from tribal colleges or universities.  To ensure success for scholarship recipients, the program:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1.  Recruits academically talented students with financial need and a commitment to a science career. &lt;br/&gt;     2.  Retains these students in an environment that promotes academic and professional success, while supporting the students socially and in their cultural traditions.&lt;br/&gt;     3.  Places these students in appropriate employment or further education through programs emphasizing career planning and professional options.</AbstractNarration>

American Indians are under-represented in STEM fields in the United States. South Dakota is home to nine Indian Reservations and American Indians represent ~15% of the population.

The PI traveled to all nine South Dakota Indian Reservations to a total of 18 high schools, as well as several border high schools and a few high school in neighboring states. The PI traveled to all six tribal colleges in South Dakota, as well as a few in neighboring states. The PI worked closely with Admissions, Registrar, and Financial Aid to recruit and identify eligible scholars.</p> <p>A total of 41 scholars received funding during the duration of the grant. All but one of these scholars were American Indian and the one was Native Hawaiian. Females were represented at 34%. In addition to South Dakota, scholars came from Arizona, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, and Nebraska. Majors represented were Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Mathematics, and Physics. In addition to the Principal Investigator (Engineering Professor), the staff included a mentor, student assistants, and tutors. The management team consisted of the Co-PIs, consisting of faculty from Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. The Tiospaye in Science Program was operated in parallel with our NSF S-STEM Tiospaye in Engineering Program. Scholars were awarded scholarships of up to $8000 per year depending on their FAFSA unmet need. The scholarships were renewable annually if scholars maintained a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5, made adequate progress toward their BS degree, and participated at an acceptable level in program activities. Scholars were required to meet with the PI at least once per month and the program mentor at least weekly. Scholars were required to attend weekly study recitation sessions with the mentor and bi-weekly professional lunch meetings. Topics at these meetings included study skills, testing tips, financial aid, career planning (summer internships, co-operative education, and permanent positions), graduate school opportunities, Native elders, counseling services, summer research opportunities (including NSF REUs), assessment activities, etc. Scholars were required to meet with their academic advisor at least once per semester and register for classes up to two semesters in advance. Scholars were expected to register for cohorted sections in College Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus I/II/III, College Chemistry, and University Physics courses. The PI and mentor worked with scholars to develop their resume and update them at least once per semester. Scholars were expected to join and participate (at least moderately) in the American Indian Science &amp; Engineering Society (AISES), as well as a professional society in their department. The university provided a Tiospaye study room, which was accessible to scholars, not only on school days, but also most evenings and weekends. With the help of donated funds from companies and philanthropists, we were able to provide carpeting, white boards, a smartboard projector, a printer (free of print credits), microwave, refrigerator, extra textbooks, and study guides.</p> <p>The results of our program are as follows.
