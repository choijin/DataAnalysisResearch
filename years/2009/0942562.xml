<AbstractNarration>By adopting and adapting the Paradigm in Physics curricular materials developed at Oregon State University, this project is working to improve undergraduate education in a second-year modern physics course and in a third/fourth-year quantum mechanics course at the University of Vermont.  In addition to using these course materials, the project is using validated assessment instruments to measure increases in student knowledge and, through the use of longitudinal surveys, to assess the evolution of ontological beliefs about modern physics and quantum mechanical concepts.  Dissemination is specifically targeted at other physics departments in the state of Vermont.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  This project seeks to improve undergraduate education in modern physics and quantum mechanics at the University of Vermont (UVM) and disseminate the materials we have adapted to other colleges and universities in Vermont to better prepare our students for a conceptual understanding of modern physics and quantum mechanical ideas.  This process builds upon existing Physics Education Research (PER) studies and employs validated assessment instruments to measure student knowledge. The research findings inform our approach to teaching. We use proven educational materials and teaching strategies and develop methods to incorporate these materials in our existing curriculum. This process directly addresses CCLI components 3 and 4,Implementing Educational Innovations and Conducting Research onUndergraduate STEM Education. The project implements new instructional strategies by adopting and disseminating PER-derived instructional strategies to reflect proven pedagogical techniques.  PER-derived materials will be introduced to an introductory modern physics course and two upper-division quantum mechanics courses. The impact of the changed instruction upon student learning will be assessed through PER-validated instruments and by assessing the evolution of ontological beliefs about modern physics and quantum mechanical concepts using longitudinal surveys of the student population.         Improving Quantum Mechanics Instruction at UVM     We will adopt PER-informed methodologies and content into our introductory Modern Physics course and the two-semester upper-division Quantum Mechanics sequence. These techniques will be implemented by the PI in at least one of the courses each semester and the PI will work with the instructor of the other courses to develop curricular materials.     We will measure student learning by performing pre- and post-instructional assessment. To determine the impact of curricular changes upon student learning, we will begin assessment in Fall 2009 as well as perform longitudinal assessment through the curriculum to see how students exposed to different teaching methods and curricula fare in subsequent courses and how tightly they hold on to identified misconceptions post-instruction.     We will disseminate curricular materials to diverse learning environments via local Vermont college physics instructors. In addition we will adapt these materials and teaching strategies for high school physics teachers through summer professional development workshops and academic- year visits.         Broader Impacts  We will disseminate the curricular materials and methodologies we have adopted to Vermont colleges that offer bachelors degrees in Physics.
