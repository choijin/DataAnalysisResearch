<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0909273, DMS-0909021&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Joshua M. Sabloff, Lisa Traynor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators propose to investigate flexibility&lt;br/&gt;and rigidity questions that are central to the character of&lt;br/&gt;symplectic and contact topology by exploring knotting phenomena&lt;br/&gt;of Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds.  Approaching&lt;br/&gt;symplectic and contact geometry through a topological lens has&lt;br/&gt;given rise to a young and thriving discipline with interesting&lt;br/&gt;questions that explore the boundary between flexibility (when the&lt;br/&gt;symplectic world behaves topologically) and rigidity (when the&lt;br/&gt;symplectic world behaves geometrically).  In particular, the PIs&lt;br/&gt;plan to study the Arnold Conjecture for Legendrian submanifolds,&lt;br/&gt;squeezing phenomena for Lagrangian disks, and the cobordism&lt;br/&gt;theory of Lagrangian submanifolds.  Special attention will be&lt;br/&gt;paid to Legendrian knots in contact 3-manifolds and Lagrangian&lt;br/&gt;surfaces in symplectic 4-manifolds. The methods used in&lt;br/&gt;addressing the aforementioned problems are of interest in their&lt;br/&gt;own right.  On one hand, the PIs plan to develop and use&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-holomorphic techniques initiated by Gromov and Floer, and&lt;br/&gt;expanded to the Symplectic Field Theory (SFT) framework by&lt;br/&gt;Eliashberg, Givental, and Hofer. On the other, the PIs plan to&lt;br/&gt;develop and use generating family techniques.  Investigations&lt;br/&gt;into the structure of the holomorphic and the generating family&lt;br/&gt;based invariants will yield insight into geometric flexibility&lt;br/&gt;and rigidity; making connections between these different types of&lt;br/&gt;invariants will increase understanding of each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic and contact topology have their roots in physics as&lt;br/&gt;the language of classical mechanics and geometric optics.  While&lt;br/&gt;remaining in touch with those roots, symplectic and contact&lt;br/&gt;topology have blossomed into a central mathematical field that&lt;br/&gt;combines features of geometry (the science of measurement) and&lt;br/&gt;topology (the study of the shape of space).  This field has a&lt;br/&gt;variety of applications including fluid mechanics, differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, and the study of the possible shape of the&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional space and the 4-dimensional space-time in which we&lt;br/&gt;live. The goal of the PIs' project is to achieve a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how symplectic and contact topology sit between&lt;br/&gt;geometry and topology, and thereby strengthening the foundation&lt;br/&gt;for the aforementioned applications.  The PIs'research activities&lt;br/&gt;will bring a diverse set of students at both the undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and graduate levels into the process of discovering new&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, with the PIs' research with undergraduates serving&lt;br/&gt;as a pedagogical laboratory for integrating mathematical research&lt;br/&gt;into the PIs' curricula.</AbstractNarration>
