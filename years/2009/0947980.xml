<AbstractNarration>Graduate Teaching Fellows in Community Situated Research: The Triple Helix of University, K-12, and Community Knowledge Production&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)&lt;br/&gt;PI and Co-PI(s): Ron Eglash (RPI), Lupita Montoya (RPI), Jonathan Dordick (RPI), Daniel Stilson (Albany Schools)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In RPI?s Community Situated Research project, graduate fellows will examine the potential relations between their STEM research, and the social issues facing local low-income and minority communities (health, environment, poverty, crime, information access, etc.). These same local communities will also be the location for the fellows? middle school collaborative teaching program. Thus graduate fellows will gain a greater awareness of the connections between their research disciplines and pressing social issues, as well as the training that enables them to communicate these connections to the public. On the GK-12 side, studies show that many minority students are disinterested in STEM academics because they do not see its relevance to their particular lives. By working with graduate fellows trained as ?civic scientists,? (along with content from our international program) GK-12 teachers will gain new opportunities to engage those disenfranchised students. It is critical that graduate teaching fellows and their faculty mentors are empowered to select projects situated at the frontiers of STEM research, and not merely applications of established knowledge. Science and Technology Studies graduate students and community mentors will be researching the social and environmental issues in these communities to help find the intersections with STEM research. A studio class will create new educational technologies that translate the grad fellows? STEM research (eg microchips for chemical analysis) into learning labs for the middle school students. Rather than a one-way ?trickle-down? of knowledge, we will explore the possibilities for a ?triple helix? collaboration between university, GK-12, and community knowledge production.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Triple Helix GK-12 grant funded graduate Fellows in research projects that brought together cutting-edge STEM investigations in the university, and community-based issues such as health, environment, poverty, information access, and so on. That research was further developed as K-12 STEM education lessons, and evaluated in classrooms through the grad collaborative teaching program with local middle and high schools serving low-income and under-represented communities.</p> <p>The program was highly successful for both grad Fellows and schools, and there was demonstrable community benefit as well. Of 23 grad fellows there were a total of 5 from underrepresented ethnic groups (Black and Latino), and 6 women, far above the average for their respective departments (primarily CS and EE). All have been placed in either professional positions in STEM industries, or have made progress towards a tenure-track academic career.&nbsp; Our activities instilled graduate STEM fellows with a greater awareness of the connections between their research disciplines and pressing social issues, and provided them with the training to communicate these connections to the public.

For example, several fellows combined skills in biomedical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science to develop a project that turned high school basketball courts into &ldquo;DIY sports science labs.&rdquo; They showed statistically significant improvement in STEM interest for underrepresented students, and one of their papers received first place in the MIT/Sloan data analytics conference.

This group of fellows similarly produced peer-reviewed papers showing statistically significant STEM performance and interest for underrepresented students. While the majority of school populations involved our local communities in the NY capital region, we also used these &ldquo;ethnocomputing&rdquo; simulations with Native American groups in the southwest, Latino communities in California, and inner city communities including Cleveland and Boston.

Our fellows published papers showing that these simulations could produce statistically significant improvement in both African and US school populations using this approach. A side project in the African context involved the improvement of sustainability of textiles, replacing the wood fires used for ink production with solar energy. Our research indicated that forests in which the bark for this ink was harvested were protected from deforestation; thus adding additional environmental sustainability. Further community collaborations for this team also included work on HIV prevention, creating a DIY condom vending machine that could be used to reduce embarrassment at the point of purchase.
