<AbstractNarration>The emerging technologies in nanoscale metrology and manufacturing have the potential for significant contributions to the growth of the nation's economy over the next several decades. In spite of the rapidly growing need for qualified nanotechnology technicians, current undergraduate programs of most engineering schools do not offer nanoscale metrology and manufacturing in their curricula. In order to produce a properly prepared nanotechnology workforce, there is a need for educational opportunities in the advanced manufacturing technology arena. This project will address the absence of nanoscale metrology and manufacturing education by developing a packaged suite of discovery-based laboratory modules. Combined with proposed lectures, the laboratory materials will enable many engineering programs to offer nanoscale metrology and manufacturing in their curricula, thereby increasing opportunities for engineering and science students to be exposed to this emerging field early in the formative years of their career. This project will bring relevant nanoscale engineering physics and chemistry into the educational experience of undergraduate engineering students as well as develop and test a set of collaborative lecture and laboratory modules in nanoscale metrology and manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overall goal of the project is to develop an innovative manufacturing curriculum based on cross-disciplinary and collaborative teaching methodologies to address the impact of nanoscale metrology and manufacturing to the nation and industry, and to introduce science, technology and engineering of discovery-based laboratory metrology and manufacturing to our students. The basic philosophy of the educational approach is that while there are physics and chemistry at the nanoscale with which students may not be familiar, the fundamental principles of engineering are not difficult at these length scales. With this in mind, nanotechnologies are in general accessible by students at all levels. During this two-year Phase I project, we have addressed the lack of nanoscale metrology and manufacturing in the current engineering curricula by developing and providing a packaged suite of comprehensive lecture and laboratory modules. In total, 8 new lecture and laboratory modules have been developed and all of them have been tested at Drexel University via new and existing courses. Student surveys were carried out for each laboratory module. The new laboratory materials and overall laboratory experience were very positively evaluated by participating students. A lab manual for each module was developed in the form of presentation that outlined the objective of the module, provided a brief historical perspective of the technique to be studied, and then discussed the technique in detail. The protocols are easy to follow and together with the manual allowed the students to independently carry out each technique. Three senior design teams and three graduate students participated in the design and fabrication of the devices for nanometrology and nanomanufacturing lab modules. The graduate students had opportunities to instruct lab classes for the imprementation of the new lab modules. The lab modules were used in outreach programs such as INSPIRE academy, Science in Motion, and a Day in College at Drexel University. Two assessment based courses: Fundamentals of Nanomanufacturing and Applications and Fundamentals of Nano Metrology and Best Practices were developed and are now available on the American Society of Mechanical Engineers&rsquo; Nano Educational Series. The courses focus on fundamentals of nanoscale metrology and manufacturing and new nanosystems applications, which are delivered in manageable modules of information allowing users to take the courses at their own pace and designed for the working engineers/students/professional with some working knowledge of nanometrology.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/24/2013<br>      Modified by: Minjun&nbsp;Kim</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/0941512/0941512_10019048_1377373170526_MEMPhotography-EvanRosenPhotography-74--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/0941512/0941512_10019048_1377373170526_MEMPhotography-EvanRosenPhotography-74--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Focused Ion Beam Lab Session"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/0941512/0941512_10019048_1377373170526_MEMPhotography-EvanRosenPhotography-74--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Focused Ion Beam Lab Session"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A TA is presenting how to use a FIB for nanomanufacturing</div> <div class="imageCredit">MinJun Kim, Drexel University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div cla...]]></DRECONTENT>
