    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the acquisition of a JEOL JSM-6510LV/LGS scanning electron microscope (SEM) for the Biological Imaging Facility in the Department of Biological Sciences at Minnesota State University, Mankato (MSUM). The facility is a core multi-user facility in the College of Science, Engineering and Technology at MSUM. The instrument provides detailed three-dimensional views of biological cells and tissues. For instance, the instrument will provide a means to examine the complex architecture and structure of blood vessels in biological tissues. The instrument will facilitate ongoing research, educational and training activities within the university and South Central Minnesota. Several features of the SEM system will lessen the complexity of training and encouraging novice use. For example, the SEM will be controlled by a computer-graphic-user-interface making its operation user friendly for students and faculty. Furthermore, the microscope will be accessible via the Internet for remote classroom and conference use. To expand the utility of the equipment and to serve the needs of the university, the proposed SEM will be equipped with a low vacuum system and an energy dispersive spectroscopy system which will accommodate diverse variety of specimens and provide a means to analyze the chemical elements present in a specimen. Use of the SEM will be incorporated in established student outreach programs, which promote scholarly activity and foster diversity. In addition, several courses will integrate use of the SEM in their curriculum. Finally, the system will advance existing undergraduate, graduate and faculty research projects at MSUM and foster intercollegiate collaboration. Projects include analysis of the three-dimensional structure of vasculature in diverse tissues and organs and structural analysis of normal and abnormal hearts. Ongoing and future research projects that utilize the SEM will have a high potential for widespread dissemination at local, regional and national meetings. Outcomes of the research projects will be communicated through presentations by students and faculty at regional or national meetings, in peer reviewed journal publications, and the internet.</AbstractNarration>
