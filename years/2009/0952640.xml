<AbstractNarration>The rampant growth of stealthy rootkits poses a serious security &lt;br/&gt;threat to cyberspace. Specifically, with the capability of directly &lt;br/&gt;subverting the software root of trust of a computer system, a rootkit &lt;br/&gt;can surreptitiously take over the control of the system and maintain &lt;br/&gt;a hidden presence thereafter.  To effectively defend against them, &lt;br/&gt;researchers have explored various anti-rootkit solutions. Unfortunately, &lt;br/&gt;to our disadvantage, the state-of-the-art defense is mainly reactive &lt;br/&gt;and cannot meet the challenges in the arms-race against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a systematic immunization approach to &lt;br/&gt;proactively prevent and exterminate rootkit attacks. This goal is &lt;br/&gt;being achieved in three key steps. First, we are developing a fundamental &lt;br/&gt;immunization capability  self-nonself discrimination to reliably discern &lt;br/&gt;and prevent malicious rootkit code execution. Second, we are investigating &lt;br/&gt;a kernel shepherding technique to enforce kernel control-flow integrity. &lt;br/&gt;Third, we are designing and implementing a high-assurance hypervisor &lt;br/&gt;with a minimal trusted computing base to establish and sustain the &lt;br/&gt;root-of-trust of the entire computer system. We expect the results &lt;br/&gt;from this research will substantially elevate our defense capability &lt;br/&gt;against elusive rootkits as well as more generic malware. We will &lt;br/&gt;disseminate our results by releasing the tools developed as well as &lt;br/&gt;associated education materials appropriate for undergraduate and &lt;br/&gt;graduate courses and IT staff training in industry and government &lt;br/&gt;agencies.</AbstractNarration>
