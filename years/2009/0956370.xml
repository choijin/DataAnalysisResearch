<AbstractNarration>An award had been made to support for one of the largest tissue collections of fishes in the world, Saint Louis University's Genetic Resources and Collection (GRC), started in the late 1980's.  This collection contains tissues and associated information that are irreplaceable with respect to geographic coverages of species and species diversity, suitable for a plethora of evolutionary, ecological, molecular, and toxicity studies. The GRC is an important, internationally known repository and contains important temporal samples and geographic materials for use in investigations associated with gene expression, ecology, toxicology, epidemiology, and physiology, and anatomy. The thoroughness of this collection provides materials significant to human health, food security, human security and safety, and long-term livelihood and socio-economic development, and systematic and evolutionary biology of fishes.  This award will provide funding for two years to enhance the curation of the GRC.  Activities will include purchase of new freezers and a freezer databasing system, and will support a web-based system for more efficient collection management and user access, an effective tracking and inventory system, and chain-of-custody.  A new staff curator position will serve as a permanent collections manager.  Since 1980 the GRC has gifted or exchanged 24,122 specimens to 122 institutions and 532 scientists (sometimes multiple requests by individual); gifts range from 1 to 4,484 specimens and from 1 to 2,884 species; 55 Ph. D. dissertations have used materials from the collection.  This grant will also allow for enhanced public access to the holdings of the collection and the development of a best practices manual for tissue collections and a survey of the world's tissue resources on fishes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award focused on the official development and organization of a large collection of tissues of fishes from around the globe.  The collection of samples has been stored in both optimal conditions and less than optimal conditions for one to be able to obtain protein and DNA samples to be used in a variety of environmental, climate change, and evolutionary studies.  With the support of this project all of the tissues have been organized into a series of freezers and properly logged into a database that will be very important for scientists to access and search for availability of tissues from species that they are interested in studying.  With the gift of tissues to researchers they must provide an equal number of tissues from an equal number of species.  In this way the collection expands for the betterment of science through crowd-sourcing for growth.  This collection of tissues will be used by researchers from around the world but likely mostly researchers in the USA.  The samples will also be fundamental to many National Science Foundation funded projects and will provide a great resource to, in some instances, reduce the costs of other funded projects by having the samples in advance.
