Such organization is often detrimental to both the individual and the group. We propose four experimental studies to study how racial inequality in task groups can be lessened. The first two studies examine how presentation of the group task affects racial inequality. The next two studies test whether group members can transfer their experiences from groups in which racial inequality is lessened to new groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The results reflect upon interactions common to many small groups, such as research teams or classrooms. Additionally the studies involve research training for both graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Our research addresses how racially and ethnically diverse groups interact.   We investigate how the information provided to group members about their group tasks might affect both the interaction within the group and the completion of the tasks.   We study this by comparing groups that are not provided information about the complexity of the tasks and the different abilities associated with the tasks with groups that are provided such information. Initial results, using measures of influence, demonstrate that emphasis upon complexity has effects.  In particular, such emphasis decreases racial and ethnic inequality in influence.  Additionally, we find the effect lasts over several weeks of interaction.      In a second portion of the study, we find that individuals who interact in racially/ethnically diverse groups at one point in time can transfer norms for equality in influence to other diverse groups.  This effect seems to occur in all of the groups that experience success in the initial point in time.     We are still analyzing the results.  We will further examine components of the interaction including how each group organizes the tasks, allocates duties and deals with disagreements.  We will analyze how well each group does on each of the tasks.  The tasks are quite complex and require logical and innovative reasoning; these kind of tasks that are relatively common in work groups.
