<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the design of an infrastructureless communication system that makes it easy for people without expertise in computer security to safely communicate with friends and family members without being subjected to third-party surveillance, censorship, propaganda, or reprisal.  The primary goals of this work are to (1) further open access to information people require to educate themselves and (2) make sharing information easier.  Particular attention is paid to designing protocols that do not rely on centralized control points, which are subject to attack.  The influence of patterns in human behavior on communication system performance, energy efficiency, and security are being studied, and the findings used to guide the development of better, user-aware, communication protocols.  Design and analysis of communication protocols; defenses against side-channel attacks on portable communication devices; distributed system architecture; and energy-efficient software systems play central roles in the work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Internet is often credited with broadening the ability to access and share information. Comparing the global impact of the Internet with that of the Gutenberg press during their first 35 years of existence confirms its importance. Already, traditional and centralized sources of information are losing markets to both formal (e.g., news websites) and informal (e.g., personal friends-and-family mailing lists and blogs) decentralized sources of information that use the Internet for distribution. However, the Internet has characteristics that can undermine privacy and freedom of speech. A largely-static infrastructure that channels the majority of traffic through a limited number of locations eases surveillance and censorship.  This project focuses on the design of an easy-to-use, infrastructureless, reliable, secure, private communication system that has the goal of resisting surveillance, censorship, propaganda, and reprisal by providing anonymity, privacy, confidentiality, deniability, robustness, and good performance. Our work builds a theoretical foundation for designing such secure and privacy preserving communication protocols, validated based on simulations and real deployment. We pay particular attention to designing protocols that do not rely on centralized control points that may be vulnerable to attack. Our system is designed to be suitable for use by people without special training.  Intellectual Merit: This project seeks to answer the following questions.  1) Efficiency: How can an easy-to-use, secure, anonymous, real-time communication and transport protocol be kept efficient enough to permit infrastructureless operation on battery- and resource-constrained portable cellphone-class embedded systems?  2) Robustness: How can this infrastructure-less communication system be made resistant to attacks by adversaries interested in using it for propaganda and surveillance?  3) Trust: What manner of trust model and management system are appropriate in this context for users with little training in security?  4) Usability: How can such a network, which is based on a complex set of protocols and technologies, be made easy and compelling for untrained people to use?  5) Mobility: How can the motion patterns of humans be used to improve the efficiency of the network through cooperative routing while preserving privacy and anonymity?  6) Platform Design: How can the implementation and hardware--software substrate on which our communication system is built be secured adequately to make indirect attacks expensive and localize the extent of the damage caused by a successful attack.  7) Traffic Hiding: How can member nodes avoid revealing their participation to attackers?  A key focus of the project will be considering the relationships among research questions and goals in the context of a complete communication system. We believe that building the system sheds light on new research questions, something we have already experienced in our preliminary work on WHISPER.  Broader Impacts: The project will have the following impacts on the world beyond those in its immediate research community.  1) Privacy and freedom of speech: The proposed technology helps achieve censorship resistance by enabling anonymous and secure communication.  2) Education: The primary goal of the project is to open access to the information people need to educate themselves. We also believe the project will provide a clear and compelling motivation for undergraduates to improve their knowledge of state-of-the-art communication technologies, and will open numerous opportunities for interdisciplinary research on security, human mobility, and social networks. Given strong teaching records, the PIs will also use the subject matter of the proposal in education and outreach, by integrating into undergraduate and graduate curriculum.  3) Community and family: Communities and families are strengthened by the ability to communicate in private.  4) Economic: On the m...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
