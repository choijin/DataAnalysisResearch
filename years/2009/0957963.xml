<AbstractNarration>Upon infection with certain microbes, plants become more resistant to subsequent infections with a broad spectrum of disease-causing agents. Characterization of this phenomenon, called systemic acquired resistance or SAR, has great societal impact through the development of environmentally friendly and sustainable methods for protecting crop plants from disease. In the previous NSF-sponsored project, SAR was found to be associated with defense priming through the increased production and long distance transport of a plant metabolite called azelaic acid. When plants are primed due to exposure to azelaic acid, they activate their defenses more quickly and to higher levels when a new infection ensues. The current renewal project aims to use genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology to (1) examine the characteristics of the primed state of plant cells and (2) discover which plant components are important for the production and action of azelaic acid. This research will result in the creation of essential new knowledge that can be exploited for crop protection strategies. Specifically, the research will discern the degree to which the primed state is associated with changes in proteins called histones that bind genetic material and enable specific genes to be readily deployed for defense activation. The research will also define where and how SAR-associated components act in the priming pathway activated by azelaic acid. The project will provide excellent educational opportunities for a postdoctoral fellow as well as under-represented undergraduate and high school students who will be recruited to the project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Microbes can cause a range of diseases that affect plants, causing wilting, rotting, and/or spotting of tissue that generally compromises their growth. When plant crops are affected, these diseases impact food quality and quantity. Plant resistance to microbes can occur through different mechanisms, including genetically encoded resistance that is typically a target of breeding. Other mechanisms of resistance are more plastic, meaning that different environmental conditions and the history of a plant (such as whether it was infected before) confer enhanced resistance. This project addressed the latter types of resistance, which are mediated by chemicals that the plant naturally makes, some of which can be mobilized throughout the plant. An important lesson from the project is plants use the same building blocks to make different protective chemicals at different times. These different chemicals enhance the ability of the plant to mount a stronger defensive response when a disease-causing microbe is present. Another important lesson is that plants possess specialized cellular components that are needed to mobilize defense chemicals throughout the plant. These components move between different compartments of cells and show dynamic properties. A first analysis of how the right locations in cells are targeted was successful and showed that a new pathway of targeting was discovered that might be specific for situations where an infection must be suppressed. The findings can lead to alternative ways to boost plant immunity through enhancing plant responses to their own natural chemicals that provide protective functions. The work involved the training of a postdoctoral scholar who will soon begin his independent research position. Additionally, several highschool and undergraduate student researchers were involved, one of whom made a key finding that was included in one of the two publications resulting from the work.
