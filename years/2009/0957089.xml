<AbstractNarration>This dissertation compares bioethics committees in the private and public sectors of the United States to better understand the similarities and differences between their recommendations and impact on scientific practice. Although individuals may assume private sector ethics boards are less effective or strident than public sector ethics committees, there is little empirical evaluation of this assumption. This project studies the missions, personnel, and activities of two private sector ethics committees, SmithKline Beecham's Ethics and Public Policy Board and Advanced Cell Technology's Ethics Advisory Board, and of two government ethics committees, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission and the President's Council on Bioethics. The goal is to compare experiences and tensions across public and private sector bioethics committees (in terms of mandate, membership, legitimacy, and advice), and the impact (if any) bioethics committees can have on their particular intended audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigating how ethics committees function in corporate laboratories and government agencies (and the cross-over of ethicists between the two sectors) will contribute to a broader understanding of how these boards work in practice. Through literature review, qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews, and theory-building, this project will contribute empirically grounded policy guidance about the constitution and mandate of future bioethics committees. Moreover, an analysis of ethics boards' contributions in both the public and private sectors will provide knowledge about their strengths and weaknesses, thereby potentially aiding organizations that wish to create more effective ethics advisory committees. In turn, more effective ethics boards may enhance the societal benefits derived from science and technology research and development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Corporations in biomedicine hold significant power and influence, in both political and personal spheres. The decisions these companies make about ethics are critically important, as they help determine what products are developed, how they are developed, how they are promoted, and potentially even how they are regulated. In the last fifteen years, for-profit private companies have been assembling bioethics committees to help resolve dilemmas that require informed deliberation about ethical, legal, scientific, and economic considerations. Private sector bioethics committees represent an important innovation in the governance of emerging technologies, with corporations taking a lead role in deciding what is ethically appropriate or problematic.  The intellectual merit of this project, which set out to uncover what bioethics  activities corporations were creating and engaging in, was that it combined conceptual and normative work with the qualitative social sciences in the pursuit of empirically grounded guidance on the constitution of valid, valuable bioethics advice. It was a critically important project, with significant broader impacts, because it starts to shed new light on the activities of bioethics in private settings, and also to permit the development of frameworks for analyzing the legitimacy, credibility, and authority of bioethics advice. The development of these frameworks will be a key broader impact, for bioethics and science studies. Through qualitative interviews and an in-depth literature review, the investigators were able to discern the logics of bioethics advice-seeking in various corporate settings, and to reveal the varied rationales of both advice seekers and those whose advice they sought.
