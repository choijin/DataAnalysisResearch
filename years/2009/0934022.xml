<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Humboldt State University (HSU) to establish an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) program to engage under-represented minority students in a research and mentoring program to prepare them for graduate study in the biological sciences. A cohort consisting of six students will be trained,  except the first cohort in which only five students will be involved. NSF funds will be used to support each undergraduate participant for a total of two calendar years while in the program. Over the 5-year period of the grant, a total of twenty three (23) students will be trained in the program. The program will primarily recruit Native American and Latino/a students with the goals of increasing the number of students from these groups who graduate from HSU in the biologically-related sciences and facilitating their transition into graduate programs. Students will enter the program during the summer after their freshman year, and will engage in a series of three rotations to explore various research projects and meet potential research mentors.  During their first Fall semester, the students will enroll in a Research Methods Course that will cover topics in scientific method, study design, proposal preparation, scientific writing and presentation.  During the course, each student will develop a detailed research proposal for a project that they will pursue for the remainder of the program.  Student research will be individually mentored by one of at least sixteen faculty coming from seven departments in HSU's College of Natural Resources and Sciences. The research areas of the faculty are grouped into three themes: 1) Ecology and Evolution, 2) Physiology, Cell and Molecular Biology, and 3) Natural Resource Management. The HSU URM program will offer students a variety of courses, seminars, workshops, presentations, and other activities that will provide them the foundation and structure to succeed. More information is available by contacting the Program Director, Dr. Bruce A. O'Gara, at bao3@humboldt.edu, or by visiting the program website at http://www.humboldt.edu/urm/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Humboldt State University (HSU) URM Grant Program provided stipends and research support for 24 students from underrepresented backgrounds.  Each student was supported for 24 months while in the program.  At the time of this report, 16 of the 24 students have graduated from HSU with degrees in Biology, Botany, Fisheries, Wildlife or Zoology.  All of the remaining eight students are currently undergraduate students at HSU and on track to graduate.  Of the 16 students who have graduated, seven have entered graduate school in the biological sciences, one has entered a postbaccalaureate program and another has entered a Nursing program and four are employed in science-related jobs.  During their first year in the program, each student was enrolled in a 3-unit "Research Methods" course where they learned how to access information in the scientific literature, how to evaluate that information, the basics of experimental design, data analysis and presentation, research ethics and the preparation of a research proposal.  Each student participated in an in depth research project overseen by a faculty mentor.  At the time of this report, the program's students have made at least 67 presentations of their research at regional and national scientific meetings and published their research in three peer-reviewed journal articles.  The URM Program provided financial, academic and emotional support for our interns, and as such, has increased the probability that these students either have graduated or are making good progress in completing their degrees.  The experiences these students had in the program have given them life experience that will serve them well in their post-college life.  These experiences have increased their self confidence, which is likely to lead to these individuals taking leadership roles in both their professional lives and in their communities.
