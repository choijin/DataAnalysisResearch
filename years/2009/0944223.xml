<AbstractNarration>The dynamics of a warming Southern Ocean and its interactions with Antarctic continental shelf circulation patterns brought about by the intensification of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies, circumpolar winds which prevail between 30 and 60 0 S, remains uncertain in several respects. Current global climate models (e.g. IPCC/AR4) attribute intensification of the westerlies to anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases in the troposphere along with decreased levels of stratospheric ozone, seasonally observed as the polar ozone hole. Other dynamical oceanic processes may also be involved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This numerical and analysis project seeks to further evaluate the contribution of oceanic heat content to the accelerating warming and sub-glacial melting currently being observed in the terminal ice streams in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, and the adjacent rapidly warming Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Use of the Palmer Station LTER data set, which extends back to 1993, provides a observational series which in part covers the time period where changes in atmospheric circulation and air temperatures are most likely to have taken place. Use of a regional oceanic numerical model (3-D, fully dynamic) under contrasting wind regimes corresponding to observed (more positive) trends in the Southern Annular Mode will shed light on the dynamics of climate change in these sensitive continental shelf regions of the continent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of melting glaciers and ice sheets on global sea level rise is an acknowledged area of uncertainty in the most recent IPCC assessment, and would be a direct impact of climate change on society in this century.</AbstractNarration>

This warming is due to processes in both the atmosphere and the ocean. For example,  water movement and temperature on the continental shelf responds to  hanges in wind speed and direction. Understanding temperature changes in the coastal ocean is crucial for predicting the rate of ice loss from Antarctica, and therefore global sea level rise. One specific question that needs to be answered is how warm  water is able to move from the deep ocean onto the shelf providing heat to melt floating ice shelves and glaciers.   Due to the remote and inhospitable nature of Antarctica, there are few ocean observations in the region. Therefore, we are using numerical ocean models to help improve our understanding of ocean variability, as well as interactions with the floating ice or atmosphere. Two different ocean models have been developed, with different grid spacing: 4 km and 1.5 km. The 4 km model is an upgrade of a previously model (also with 4 km grid spacing) in which the bottom topography and the thickness of floating glacial ice sheets has been improved based on recent measurements. In particular, a glacially created trough (Belgica Trough) in the southern part of the wAP is much better represented.   Previous studies have shown that small-scale swirls and narrow currents are important for transporting heat towards the coast; features that cannot be fully resolved on a 4 km grid. A separate model has been set up with a grid  pacing of 1.5 km to better represent these small features.  Most large-scale climate models have grid spacing much larger than 4 km.
