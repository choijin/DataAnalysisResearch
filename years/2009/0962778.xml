<AbstractNarration>Mathematical ACES: Algebraic Concepts for Elementary Students (ACES), is a partnership between California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB) and  Ontario Montclair Elementary School District (OMSD).  Supporting partners include the CSUSB Center for the Enhancement of Mathematics Education and THINK Together, a non-profit provider of after-school programs.  To improve student success in 8th grade algebra, ACES  is  targeting the critical juncture in the mathematics education continuum as students move from elementary concepts to algebra.  The vision is to create and sustain professional learning communities (PLCs) who work collaboratively to provide high quality instruction and continuously improve mathematics instruction. Teachers develop a view of math as exciting and interesting and gain a broad and deep understanding of the curriculum within and across grade levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACES is developing a distributed, classroom-based, cadre of 60 grade-level teacher leaders who adopt math as their area of expertise and provide math leadership to colleagues.  Project goals include: 1) increase the mathematics understanding and achievement of (grades 4-8) students; 2) increase teachers' mathematical conceptual content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and effective application of pedagogical skills; 3) cultivate replicable cultural and systemic changes that result in continuous improvement of mathematics instruction; and 4) conduct empirical research to increase evidence-based contributions to the teaching and learning knowledge base. Program components include: 1) intensive summer institutes; 2) monthly workshops; 3) PLCs focused on use of lesson study; and 4) teacher collaboration time.  Innovative features include creating a new model for classroom-based capacity building in which a cadre of grade-level mathematics lead teachers gradually increase their mathematics knowledge, earn mathematics certification, and become lesson study facilitators.  Instead of removing teachers from the classroom to assume coaching type assignments, the program creates a new model for distributed grade-level leadership involving a widespread network of teacher leaders who remain in the classroom, whose professionalism is highly respected by their colleagues and administration, who guide their peers in enhancing their teaching, and whose leadership is a natural outcome of this professionalism rather than a district-appointed position.  At the university, lesson study is being introduced into the pre-service teacher education program by math faculty engaging in lesson study for teaching math courses to pre-service elementary teachers, and education faculty utilizing a lesson study model for math and science methods courses in the credential program.  The research focuses on the degree to which teacher variables of mathematics content and pedagogical knowledge, goal structure for students, approach to instruction and to improving instruction, self-efficacy to teach mathematics, and classroom teaching performance predict student mathematics achievement, self-efficacy to do mathematics, goals orientation, and perceptions of goal structure.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The ACES (<em>Algebraic Concepts for Elementary Students)</em> project addressed a national need for improved mathematics education through combined content and pedagogical professional development (PD) for 100 teachers and 40 administrators in a highly diverse high-needs district (broader impact) with research on teacher beliefs, teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching, and how these interact to improve mathematics instruction and subsequently increase student achievement (intellectual merit). Essential components involved teaching diverse learners, problem-based learning, developing mathematical habits of mind, conceptual understanding, multiple representations, and applying these to standards-based instruction.

Essential components involved teaching diverse learners, problem-based learning, developing mathematical habits of mind, conceptual understanding, multiple representations, and applying these to standards-based instruction. (full logic model)  Research and Development  ACES researchers developed, validated, and used instruments to measure teacher traits regarding mathematics instruction:  &#9679;      "Proclivities for teaching mathematics" are defined as the beliefs, knowledge, and dispositions that are actionable in the flow of instruction.  The resulting project-developed instrument is the Proclivities for Teaching Mathematics Instrument (PTMI). We argue that growth in this area contributes to positive change in mathematics instruction. Proclivities for teaching mathematics encompass four domains: productive disposition, openness to new ideas, thought processes, and organization of mathematical thought.  &#9679;      Beliefs regarding self-efficacy for teaching mathematics and outcomes expectancy for students' learning of mathematics were measured by the project-developed self-report measure, the Mathematical Practices - Teacher Efficacy Beliefs Instrument (MP-TEBI).  We argue that both constructs are beneficial when investigating teachers' approaches to instruction of mathematics.  In addition to these, several other variables were measured. Bivariate associations found among variables measured throughout the project provided excellent support for the initial proposed conceptual model. These associations are presented in Figure 1. All correlations presented are simple Pearson r's with the exception of associations with Student Performance, which are estimated r's based upon multi-level analyses for students nested within teachers. To summarize, mathematical knowledge for teaching as measured by the LMT was an excellent predictor of video-recorded teaching performance in the classroom as measured by the MQI. Self-efficacy and outcome expectancy beliefs (MP-TEBI) were moderate to strong predictors of self-reported proclivities for teaching mathematics (PTMI) -- positively correlating with student-oriented proclivities and negatively correlating with teacher-oriented proclivities. Student-oriented teaching proclivities produced small to moderate positive correlations with student performance, and scores based upon video evidence (factors of the MQI) all produced moderate to large correlations with student achievement scores.  In the final year, student achievement for ACES teachers was compared with non-ACES district teachers; ACES students' (at least 8 months with an ACES teacher) SBAC scores were statistically higher, with the mean of 2481.91 compared to 2458.37 (effect size small to moderate; eta2 = .04).  ACES researchers studied the effects of lesson study on teacher learning, overall instruction, and formative assessment.  A specific use of records of practice was developed to enable teachers to reflect upon teaching practices that impacted their learning of mathematics during problem-based lessons, thereby promoting transfer to the teachers' classroom practice.  Collaborative logic modeling was used throughout the project to develop and refine project goals and activities. The process was studied by ACES evaluators and researchers, to better understand the effects on project processes, in particular the collaboration between facilitators and evaluators.  Four papers, two book chapters, and one doctoral dissertation were published, one paper is under review, 37 refereed papers were presented (seven by participating teachers), and two lesson study conferences were organized and supported. See here for a detailed list.  Professional Development (PD) and Infrastructure  Over six years, ACES teachers participated in summer institutes and monthly seminars, lesson study, and self-facilitated PD. A subset also participated in leadership PD. District administrators participated in PD around ACES topics in order to support their teachers in conceptual-based instruction and the state-mandated transition to Common Core State Standards. ACES teacher leaders now serve in a variety of site and district leadership roles, and provide support for their colleagues in teaching conceptually and developing instruction that supports habits of mind for doing mathematics.  Participating teachers grew in all aspects measured by project data: mathematical knowledge for teaching (increasing, eta2 = .04, small to moderate), proclivities for teaching mathematics (PTMI most teacher-oriented factor decreasing, eta2 = .51, large; PTMI most student-oriented factor increasing, eta2= .26, large), self-efficacy (MP-TEBI SE increasing, eta2 = .10, moderate), outcomes expectancy (MP-TEBI OE increasing, eta2 = .09, moderate).  This growth is reflected in student achievement (see above).  ACES work also served to support collaboration between mathematics and education faculty, who created significant changes in both the preservice mathematics program and teacher credential programs. This collaboration subsequently heavily influenced the transformation and design of the new semester programs, to which CSUSB will transition in Fall 2020.  Ongoing impact includes expansion of lesson study expertise and implementation regionally, "Dinner and a Math Problem" at CSUSB, and an ongoing mathematics education PLC involving mathematics and education faculty and K-12 experts.
