<AbstractNarration>Macrocycles are molecules that contain many atoms in their rings relative to "normal" ring sizes (5-7 atoms. Rings containing eight or more atoms in their ring are macrocycles. One consequence of the ring's size is that it may twist into different semi-rigid shapes that can be either right- or left-handed. This proposal aims to define what factors determine the handedness of macrocyles on an atomic level. If a given molecule is equivalent to a hand (by analogy), then the proposed work will look at how fingers (local features) affect the contours of a hand (global shape). For example, the location of a thumb can be used to differentiate between a human hand and a canine hand (paw). The objectives will be accomplished through chemical synthesis of a group of related macrocycles followed by a detailed analysis of their structures. Once local-global structural correlations can be cataloged, they can be utilized. They will motivate drug discovery efforts and the development of novel liquid crystalline displays (LCDs) and molecular electronic devices. The principles developed in this investigation will a priori facilitate the prediction of structures (and ultimately function) of macrocyclic molecules; they will also provide guidance to chemists as to how these molecules should be synthesized.&lt;br/&gt; There are a number of broader impacts associated with the proposed project. Identified determinants can be applied to the design of new macrocyclic drugs and inducers of chiral liquid crystals for molecular electronic devices. Students will gain excellent conceptual knowledge and technical experience in synthetic and characterization technique, and the PI is actively engaged in a number of outreach and engagement activites that benefit the university, local, and national communities.</AbstractNarration>
