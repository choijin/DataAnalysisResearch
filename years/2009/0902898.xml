<AbstractNarration>A course in Aquatic Environmental Science is being developed at Northwest Florida State College (NWFSC), a two year college. The cornerstone of the course is a series of field sampling activities using a combination of field analytical instruments and web-enabled GIS products to assess, in real-time, spatial and temporal variability of biogeochemical parameters in a local estuary. Teams of students are collecting data using handheld multimeters to perform field analyses for physical parameters (temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) and separate portable colorimeters to measure biogeochemical parameters (nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate). Students are using field laptop PCs to upload water quality data (via a wireless network card) to a GIS webserver, maintained at a nearby four-year university, the University of West Florida (UWF). The data from all sampling teams are compiled by the GIS server and used to generate GIS layers that graphically depict the spatial variability of water quality parameters using the entire data set. While still in the field, these GIS layers can be immediately accessed by students and instructors to obtain a whole basin view of spatial variation in water quality parameters. These summary results are used to generate and test field hypotheses or to facilitate in-the-field comparison with historical data collected during previous semesters and stored on the field laptop. The Aquatic Environmental Science course is a component of Physical Sciences in the Science Department at NWFSC. The target audience for this course includes students enrolled in an AA program and students enrolled in the Middle School Science Teacher Program for pre-service teachers. The major field sampling component of the course is designed to meet a number of goals related to both STEM disciplines and technical workforce training by creating an experiential learning activity based on field data collection. Specifically, the new course has field and classroom components that provide students with the opportunity to use a variety of field technical equipment within the context of an ecological assessment. The goal of this combination is to simultaneously address STEM learning and technical aptitude within a field-based project. The proposed field activities also are being used as an articulation opportunity to introduce two-year college students at NWFSC to GIS technology and environmental sciences. By collaborating with a UWF there are opportunities for recruiting NWFSC students into baccalaureate and graduate programs. The field activities also are being integrated into a workshop for regional in-service high school science teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Community College Students Use GIS Program to Map Water Quality Data From Sea  Community college students enrolled in Aquatic Environmental Science, a new course at Northwest Florida State College, spent their semester working onboard several boats in a local estuary. During field trips, three student teams each focused on a different region of the estuary.  Students used a variety of field sampling and analysis instruments, including fluorometers to measure chlorophyll in the water, colorimeters to measure nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, and multimeters to measure temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen.  Water quality data (including temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration, and nutrient concentrations) were analyzed at different "stations" throughout the estuary under the guidance of instructors from NWFSC and from the University of West Florida.  While students were working, they used a new geographic information system (GIS) "portal" to compile the data from all teams into a master data set. The GIS portal also generated a series of maps to represent the spatial relationship of the water quality data in a way that was more accessible to students compared to data tables and graphs.  This class provided significant hands-on technical experience and training to a number of two-year college students as part of their Aquatic Environmental Science course.  This intensive field-based learning resulted in measurable improvements in the ability of NWFSC students to learn science.  This improved learning ability was measured in several student learning components, including increasing student acceptance of technology and improving the cognitive function (i.e., a personÆs ability to process thoughts) of students using the field-based learning versus those who used traditional lab-based methods.  Overall, the students who employed field-based learning methods showed moderate, but significant, improvements in their ability to learn.
