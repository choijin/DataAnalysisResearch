<AbstractNarration>Technical: The research objective of this CAREER award is to synthesize and investigate a new class of novel, rare-earth-activated, one-dimensional luminescent nanomaterials and to tune their optical properties through controlled synthesis. While previous research on one-dimensional nanostructures has focused mainly on elemental and binary materials systems, recent studies have demonstrated incorporation of additional components such as rare-earth ions into one-dimensional nanostructures, forming luminescent nanobelts that exhibit new compositions, new crystal structures, and new luminescence properties and mechanisms. To maximize the potential of using these new luminescent nanobelts as building blocks in nanophotonics, fundamental understanding of the interrelationships between synthesis conditions, materials properties, and optical properties is essential. This project 1) systematically investigates the luminescent nanobelts growth behaviors by studying the growth parameters, 2) performs morphological, compositional, and structural characterizations of the nanomaterials using a wide range of advanced analytical tools including electron microscopes and synchrotron x-ray microanalysis techniques, and 3) studies the optical properties of the luminescent nanomaterials using a broad excitation sources (including UV light, x-ray beam and electron beam) and explores their applications in nanophotonics.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The success of the project is expected to have impacts on the further advancement of nanophotonics and, in general, nanoscience and nanotechnology. The research and education activities of the project are integrated. The education activities include 1) incorporation of research themes into lecture and laboratory classes to engage students as active participants in the scientific process, 2) training and enrichment of graduate and undergraduate students participating in the proposed research by development of experimental and analytical skills, presentations at conferences and seminars, and authorship of research articles, 3) increase of minority undergraduate and K-12 students participation in science and engineering through the programs on campus, and 4) increase of general public awareness on nanotechnology by holding NanoArt shows on campus, local schools, and galleries.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit: This project produces two types of new luminescent materials. (1) Divalent europium (Eu2+)-activated aluminate-based luminescent nanoribbons. We have fabricated three series in a total of ten kinds of Eu2+-activated aluminates nanoribbons, including three europium aluminates (Eu-Al-O, EAO), three strontium europium aluminates  (Sr-Eu-Al-O, SEAO) and four barium europium aluminates (Ba-Eu-Al-O, BEAO). The three EAOs are blue luminescent, tetragonal EuAl6O10 (b-EAO), green luminescent, monoclinic EuAl2O4 (g-EAO) and orange luminescent, hexagonal EuAl2O4 (o-EAO). The three SEAOs are blue luminescent, tetragonal Sr1-xEuxAl6O10 (0&lt;x&lt;1) (b-SEAO), green luminescent, monoclinic Sr1-xEuxAl2O4 (0&lt;x&lt;1) (g-SEAO), and yellow luminescent, hexagonal Sr1-xEuxAl2O4 (0&lt;x&lt;1) (y-SEAO). The four BEAOs are blue luminescent, tetragonal Ba0.8Eu0.2Al6O10 (b-BEAO), green luminescent, hexagonal Ba0.98Eu0.02Al2O4 (g-BEAO), yellow luminescent, orthorhombic Ba0.93Eu0.07Al2O4 (y-BEAO), and red luminescent, hexagonal Ba0.6Eu0.4Al2O4 (r-BEAO). Except for the three green-luminescent products, the other seven aluminates are new compounds with new lattice structures that were not reported before. The o-EAO, y-SEAO, y-BEAO and r-BEAO exhibit new luminescence properties and mechanisms. The y-BEAO was used to fabricate single phosphor-converted warm-white LEDs, which is the first prototype warm-white LED with color correlated temperature (CCT) &lt;4000 K and color rendering index (CRI) &gt;80 basing on a single-phosphor, single-emitting-center-conversion model. (2) Persistent phosphors emitting in the near-infrared (NIR, 700&ndash;950 nm) and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 950&ndash;1700 nm). For NIR persistent phosphors, we have discovered and successfully developed four novel series of trivalent chromium (Cr3+)-activated gallate-based NIR persistent phosphors, including Cr3+-doped Ga2O3, Cr3+-doped zinc gallogermantes (e.g., Zn3Ga2Ge2O14:Cr3+), Cr3+-doped lithium gallates (e.g., LiGa5O8:Cr3+), and Cr3+-doped La3Ga5GeO14. These Cr3+-doped gallates are superb NIR persistent materials exhibiting strong emission at 690&ndash;800 nm and with a super-long persistent luminescence of more than 100 h. In the Cr3+-doped gallates, we have also discovered and achieved several new, interesting luminescence phenomena including photo-stimulated persistent luminescence (PSPL), rare-earth up-converting ion-pair (e.g., Yb3+/Er3+)-assisted up-converted persistent luminescence (UCPL) and phonon-assisted UCPL. For SWIR persistent phosphors, we have discovered and developed two types of new SWIR persistent phosphors, i.e., divalent nickel (Ni2+)-activated gallates and trivalent ytterbium (Yb3+)-activated MgGeO3. The Ni2+-activated gallates exhibit a single broadband emission in the range of 1100&ndash;1600 nm and with a persistent time of more than 10 h. The MgGeO3:Yb3+ phosphor emits at 950&ndash;1150 nm and exhibits a very-long persistent time of more than 100 h. Both the NIR and SWIR persistent phosphors exhibit promising potentials in a variety of important applications such as biomedical imaging, night-vision surveillance, identification, and solar cells.  Broader Impacts: One postdoc, five graduate students, five undergraduate students and six high school students received training in this project. The new Eu2+-activated aluminate compounds with new compositions, new lattice structures and new luminescence properties enrich our knowledge and understanding on Eu2+-activated luminescent materials. The discovery and synthesis of the NIR and SWIR persistent phosphors leads the persistent luminescence research into the invisible spectral regions, which have important implications to many applications that cannot be achieved by their visible counterparts.
