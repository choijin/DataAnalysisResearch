<AbstractNarration>(Biological Sciences 61) &lt;br/&gt;Biologists at the University of South Alabama are integrating cutting-edge scientific research into two undergraduate courses with the intent to expand this approach into other courses. The specific objectives of this project are: to integrate modern molecular approaches into undergraduate laboratory courses by developing two upper-level project-based lab courses in molecular ecology and bacterial genomics each featuring genomics and bioinformatics; and to foster students' abilities to comprehend scientific writing and generate novel scientific hypotheses and inferences through inter-disciplinary peer-review exercises.  For each course the first half of the semester focuses on techniques and basic theory, while the second half of the semester is dedicated to collaborative student research. Cross-course collaboration for student projects is encouraged for students co-enrolled in the two courses.  Specifically designed blogging software provides students with a comfortable platform on which to discuss relevant literature as well as their own projects.  All efforts are being evaluated to aid in adjustments to future course offerings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  The intellectual merit of this project lies in the opportunity students are receiving to engage in on-going research projects using techniques newly introduced into the science they are studying.  It builds on the research expertise of the team of investigators at the University of Southern Alabama.  In addition the novel web-based approaches being used help students develop their scientific reading and writing skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  These two courses serve as a model for other mid-sized or smaller institutions, particularly those with academically diverse faculty.  The online materials being developed are being made available to others interested in this approach to undergraduate education in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
