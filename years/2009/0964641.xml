<AbstractNarration>Pay-as-you-Go investigates security and privacy for Integrated Transportation Payment Systems (ITPS).  The research addresses integrated payments for trains, subways, buses, ferries, and recharging of electric cars, as well as toll collection for roads, bridges, and tunnels.   Multi-disciplinary aspects include novel cryptographic protocols and lightweight implementations of privacy-preserving payment systems.  Challenges include providing security and privacy in a low-cost, usable, and reliable manner.  Payments for transportation differ significantly from general-purpose e-commerce in terms of both security and engineering constraints. For instance, transportation operators wish to observe user behavior to improve the overall performance of the system---seemingly contradicting privacy.  Moreover, payment devices must be extremely cheap, mass produced, and tolerant of a wide range of passenger demands.&lt;br/&gt;The expected results and activities include: (1) design of novel cryptographic algorithms achieving privacy at low cost while retaining the benefits of meaningful data collection for ITPS; (2) implementation of hardware and software to perform modern cryptographic operations on low-cost devices; and (3) testing of human factors and performance under realistic conditions that must balance security and privacy with cost and usability. The broader impacts are extensive as transportation systems are a critical part of most aspects of society, from the economy, to defense, to public safety. Moreover, information gathered from ITPS applications can facilitate advanced traffic management, travel time estimation, emergency management, congestion pricing, carbon emissions control, and environmental justice assessments. A substantial outreach plan builds on the research team?s significant experience working with transportation professionals in industry and government.</AbstractNarration>

For instance, payment devices for transportation systems must be extremely cheap: they need to be produced in massive quantities (often millions of tokens per year) and are often only used for a short time (in extreme cases, one-time use). As a result, many sophisticated cryptographic techniques are much too computationally intensive to be used in such devices. Until recently, the desire for user privacy has seemed to be at odds with the cost constraints. Additionally,transportation operators want to be able to observe certain aspects of user behavior in order to improve the overall performance of the system, and this also seemingly contradicts privacy.     Our Pay-as-you-Go approach  demonstrated that it is possible to get privacy at a low cost while retaining the benefits of useful data collection.  The project raised awareness about privacy for all citizens, beyond just those using computers in their daily lives.  This has broad implications and is particularly relevant given recent events concerning privacy.  Contributions to Intellectual merit included showing that lightweight implementations of privacy preserving ecash protocols are possible in RFID, smartcard and mobile phone platforms.   This opens up numerous additional applications beyond transportation.  It also shows that useful data may be collected without unnecessarily compromising privacy.  Broader impacts included the application to Implantable Medical Devices, education of students with ability to work across ECE, CS and Transportation disciplines,  and international collaborations.    More general application to hardware security impacts the semiconductor and computer industries.   Several workshops were held that demonstrated methods and results to professionals in Transportation, Payments, and Medical Devices.
