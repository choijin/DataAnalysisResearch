<AbstractNarration>To answer three open questions in the field of extra-galactic astronomy Dr. Scott will lead and carry out a study of three related, but distinct, topics in this CAREER proposal. While the study of each of the topics in itself is interesting, there is extra motivation for this work in the way that the research topics overlap. Starting with an analysis and improved measurement of the extragalactic ultraviolet radiation field at high redshift, and ending with a look into the large scale environs of distant quasars, the PI and her research team are poised to answer broad questions about processes at work in the early Universe. Both ground-based and space-based telescopes will be used in this research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposal are centered on the development of research opportunities for the undergraduate science students at Towson University. Additional educational and outreach activities will take advantage of both an on-campus planetarium where Dr. Scott will lecture to students and the public and at an existing ProjectASTRO site in nearby Baltimore. As part of her CAREER award Dr. Scott will maintain and expand this ProjectASTRO site.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Goals<br /></strong>The proposed research was organized around several questions regarding: (1) the ambient ultraviolet background radiation field (UVB); (2) the connection between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galaxies themselves; and (3) quasar environments and how they manifest in line of sight absorption. I report the primary results in all these areas below.</p> <p>In addition scientific results, the broader impacts of the project are embedded in the integrated educational activity of supporting undergraduate research at my institution, Towson University (TU). I have mentored and directly supported a postdoctoral researcher, one high school student, ten undergraduate students, and one former TU undergraduate over the full period of this grant.&nbsp;</p> <p>Other educational activities include the expansion of Project ASTRO, an outreach program I co-founded in 2008 to serve students in local schools. With this grant, we quadrupled our program from about 10 to over 40 individual partnerships between astronomers and educators in our region.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Results<br /></strong><em>(1) The Ultraviolet Background&nbsp;<br /></em>I worked with a TU undergraduate to measure the ultraviolet background radiation field at high redshift, or early cosmic history, using a previously obtained data set in combination with published data.&nbsp;Our results show good agreement with previous measurements of the z~4 UVB&nbsp;and do indicate evolution in the UVB with cosmic time. (Fig. 1)</p> <p><em>(2) IGM-Galaxy Connection</em><br />With TU undergraduate students, I devised a statistical method&nbsp;to find the most probable galaxy matches for specific absorption features in a quasar's UV spectrum. We tested the method, using a sample of 44 quasar spectra from Hubble Space Telescope that also have galaxy photometric data in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalogs. Our approach also draws on the absorption properties of galaxy circumgalactic media (CGM) reported in the literature. (Fig. 2)</p> <p>Our scheme identifies nearly 1200 potential galaxy-absorber pairs. One undergraduate researcher explored galaxy groups through the large impact parameter matches. Groups containing galaxy matches to line of sight absorbers tend to be richer than their non-matched counterparts. Another student examined the properties of the galaxies found to be likely matches to absorbers in the quasar spectrum. Absorbing galaxies have a slight tendency to be bluer, disk type galaxies.&nbsp;The distribution of orientation angle indicates that galactic outflows may not be primarily responsible for the CGM.</p> <p><em>(3) Quasar Environments<br /></em>From 90Prime data we obtained, we constructed catalogs in u, g, r, and i filters of galaxies in ~1 degree fields around relatively nearby 12 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). &nbsp;We measured galaxy clustering around these AGN using two standard techniques: correlation amplitude (B<sub>gq</sub>) and two point correlation function. The B<sub>gq</sub>&nbsp;statistic agrees with the literature values, and does not correlate with any of the AGN properties we investigated, AGN luminosity, black hole mass, or AGN activity. Thus ongoing accretion activity in these AGN, which powers them, is not reflected in the large scale environments from ~10 h<sup>-1&nbsp;</sup>kpc to ~0.5 h<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;Mpc (about 50,000 to 2.3 million light years) and may indicate a non-merger mode of AGN activity in this sample of mostly radio quiet Seyfert galaxies. (Fig. 3)</p> <p>Student research assistants compiled archival ultraviolet spectra of the 90Prime sample quasars and identified 14 associated absorption systems seen in several ions. We did not identify any galaxies in the 90Prime data responsible for proximate absorption in these quasars.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Baltimore Project ASTRO</em><em><br /></em>This program aims to improve attitudes toward and performance in science in elementary and middle schools in both urban and suburban school districts in Maryland. We form and support astronomer- educator partnerships with annual workshops and materials stipends. (Fig. 4)</p> <p>My co-director and coordinator and I completed a study on the characteristics of effective scientist-educator partnerships in the Project ASTRO model. Effective astronomer partners are willing to volunteer time and provide supplies and resources.
