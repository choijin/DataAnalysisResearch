<AbstractNarration>Rice University leads a collaborative proposal to extend the impact of the Empowering Leadership: Computing Scholars of Tomorrow Alliance (ELA) through partnerships with new institutions and regional collaboratives that will adopt and expand ELA's successful models of engagement. The goal of ELA is to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who major in computing at the nation's research universities.  Additionally, ELA supports these students in securing positions in computing following graduation. The premise of the ELA is that minority students at research universities face challenges that can be mitigated by a supportive community that provides academic, social, and personal support. National in scope, the ELA is developing a network of computing faculty and leaders dedicated to providing this support. In addition to Rice University, ELA originally included Boston University, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Texas, Austin. With this proposal,  the ELA will add the University of Georgia, Clemson University, Tufts University, and Stony Brook University as new lead institutions, along with several new partners including MentorNet, the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), and the New England Computer Science Chairs (NECSC). The ELA uses three intersecting models of engagement, including the National, Regional and Local Models. The National Model seeks out and supports individuals across the country, building a virtual (and sometimes in-person) network; the Regional Model builds a support network among multiple universities within a region; and the Local Model builds a local support community within a single university. These three models serve to connect ELA students with each other and with tailored opportunities including internships, mentoring, conference participation, and summer research programs. The proposed extension will strengthen the three models at their current sites and test their scalability and transfer to the new lead institutions. It will also add programs developed under BPC demonstration projects to the suite of ELA offerings and test their scalability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Professor Richard Tapia has committed his entire life to sharing the excitement and relevance of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) to underrepresented minority students (URM) and women. He also readily warns that "While race and ethnicity should not dictate educational destiny, they continue to do so today. The minority populationÆs growth outpaces the rate at which we are improving our effectiveness in educating this segment of the population. The concern with underrepresentation is no longer a moral or ethical issue; it is a simple matter of our nationÆs survival and competitiveness with the rest of the world."  A major challenge that research oriented universities face is the migration away from STEM to somewhat more comfortable majors on the part of underrepresented undergraduates.

ELA was developed with the following goals in mind: 1) increase retention of minority undergraduate students through graduation; 2) increase interest and enrollment in graduate school; 3) increase retention of minority graduate students through graduation, and 4) enhance careers and placement for URM students and women, especially in the professoriate.

Dozens of other universities, professional organizations, and government laboratories provide their support to its mission. ELA activities include:   Meet and network with faculty and peers at community meetings. Learn more about cutting-edge scientific research via lectures and research symposia.  Participate in a one-on-one faculty mentoring program. Meet distinguished minority faculty and professionals. Learn about the many opportunities available through science and engineering careers. Scholarships to participate in national conferences. .  Participating in networking dinners and community-building meetings. Attending distinguished lectures and talks from outstanding leaders in academia and industry. Participating in online webinars offering technical training, mentorship, and professional development from outstanding leaders in academia and industry.  Developing leadership and professional skills to succeed.    One of the positive results of the ELA-BPC grant that will live beyond the life of the grant is the vibrant listservs that were created over the years. These listservs continue to be utilized by other NSF-funded programs including the XSEDE Scholars Program and iAAMCS. It grows every year disseminating vital information about REUs, webinars, internships, fellowships, scholarships, lectures, conferences, graduate programs, and both technical and professional development training in STEM.  Another key outcome has been the impact that attending conferences and webinars have on students. ELA students have made it clear through their surveys that attending confer...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
