<AbstractNarration>0967423&lt;br/&gt;Sun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is to carry out a fundamental study of carbon as a new element for quantum dot-like fluorescent nanomaterials. Recently, the PI?s group found and reported that small carbon nanoparticles could be surface-passivated to exhibit strong fluorescence in the visible and nearinfrared spectral regions. The focus of the proposed project will be on the further exploration and development, both fundamentally and technologically, of these fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (dubbed ?carbon dots?).  While the original discovery of carbon dots was driven largely by carbon being obviously non-toxic, subsequent studies have revealed their many superb characteristics, including their being highly competitive in fluorescence performance. There are very good reasons to expect that with further development the carbon dots technology will play a significant role in advanced optical imaging and sensing for biomedical and human health related applications. In addition, an understanding of the fact that nanoscale carbon exhibits semiconductor-like optical properties should contribute to the fundamental knowledge on materials at the nanoscale, which may inspire the discovery of new concepts and new materials.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project is on carbon "quantum" dots or more appropriately called carbon dots as high-performance yet nontoxic fluorescence agents. In terms of intellectual merit, we have achieved our dual objectives and their associated outcomes: developing successfully carbon dots of excellent fluorescence properties and demonstrating their generally nontoxic nature. Some key findings as outcomes are summarized as follows. (1) We have shown that carbon dots can be made brightly fluorescent, with fluorescence quantum yields reaching up to 75-80% in the green spectral region that is covered by the green fluorescence proteins. In the same green spectral region, the performance of carbon dots at the individual dot level is competitive to that of the comparable commercially available semiconductor CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, so is the case for the comparison <em>in vivo</em> (mice). (2) All cytotoxicity and <em>in vivo</em> toxicity evaluations yielded results suggesting that carbon dots are nontoxic to cells at concentrations much higher than what are necessary for cell imaging uses, nor to mice at substantial concentrations. (3) Significant progress made in the mechanistic understanding. We have also realized and argued that the photoinduced charge separation and subsequent processes in the mechanism have far-reaching implications beyond carbon dots. For example, in our recent effort on comparing carbon nanomaterials of quantum dot-like properties, including especially "graphene quantum dots", we found that a dominating theme in these fluorescent nanomaterials is their structural and/or surface defects, thus their sharing the same mechanistic characteristics with carbon dots. Overall, the NSF support has resulted in many significant findings that are worthy of dissemination, with more than 20 peer-reviewed journal papers already published. The project has also had broader impacts in a number of aspects. We have pushed for the relevance of our research outcomes to technology development by high-tech startups, fostered by our State as a part of the strategy for knowledge-based economy. Another impact is reflected by the recent discovery on the excellent biocidal functions of carbon dots in environmental and food safety applications. Talking about food, the "BBQ project" for involving and outreaching to high school students has been successful, with the overcooked BBQ produced by the students used as precursors and processed into carbon dots for optical imaging and photocatalysis uses.
