<AbstractNarration>The second workshop on Resource Discovery (RED)  is co-located with&lt;br/&gt;the 35th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB)&lt;br/&gt;on August 28, 2009, in Lyon, France. This project provides travel fellowships &lt;br/&gt;to students enrolled in US universities in order to attend the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is concerned with the design and development of models and &lt;br/&gt;prototypes that support the representation of resources, the discovery of &lt;br/&gt;resources on the Web, the identification, localisation, and composition of &lt;br/&gt;resources. A resource corresponds to an information source such as a data &lt;br/&gt;repository or database management system (e.g., a query form or a textual &lt;br/&gt;search engine), a link between resources (an index or hyperlink), or a service &lt;br/&gt;such as an application or tool. Resources are characterized by core information &lt;br/&gt;including a name, a description of its input and its output (parameters or format), &lt;br/&gt;its address, and various additional properties expressed as metadata. Resource &lt;br/&gt;discovery is the process of identifying and locating existing resources that have a &lt;br/&gt;particular property. Machine-based resource discovery relies on crawling, clustering, &lt;br/&gt;and classifying resources discovered on the Web automatically. Resources are &lt;br/&gt;organized with respect to metadata that characterize their content (for data sources), &lt;br/&gt;their semantics (in terms of ontological classes and relationships), their characteristics &lt;br/&gt;(syntactical properties), their performance (with metrics and benchmarks), their quality &lt;br/&gt;(curation, reliability, trust), etc. Resource discovery systems allow the expression of &lt;br/&gt;queries to identify and locate resources that implement specific tasks.
