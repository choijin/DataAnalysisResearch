<AbstractNarration>The STEM Scholars Program at James A. Rhodes State College aims to increase the number of well-educated and skilled employees in technical areas of national and local need by recruiting, selecting, and enrolling 102 full-time, academically talented, financially needy students for scholarships over five years. The main focus of the Program is the enrollment and financial support of underrepresented groups (e.g. women, minorities, and persons with disabilities) in Engineering Technology and Information Technology fields, and the improvement of educational opportunities and support programs for these students in order to maximize probability of their retention, graduation, employment or transition to four-year institutions. Integral to success of the Program is the strengthening of ongoing partnerships between the sponsoring college and K-12 school systems, the West Central Ohio Tech Prep consortium, four-year institutions, regional education initiatives, and local high tech industries in order to improve collaborative efforts in providing academic and social support services, and internship and mentoring relationships for scholars. The STEM Scholars Program is building upon the current academic and social support structures available to all students at Rhodes State College, such as services offered by 1) the Learning Center and the Math/Science Skills Center for enhancing STEM Scholars' academic skills and providing techniques for college success; 2) the Student Advising and Development Office for tracking scholars' academic success and providing social support; and 3) the Career Placement Office for assisting the scholars with job placement or transfer to four-year institutions. Specific programs initiated for STEM Scholars to ensure success in the program include 1) creation of cohort groups to provide a network of support for the scholars as they work collaboratively and collectively on improving their own and others' learning experiences, growth and development; 2) a tutoring program that offers targeted tutoring sessions for cohort members whose needs have been identified by an educational planning form and advisement process; and 3) innovative multidisciplinary sessions that assist scholars with integrating coursework and workforce readiness and professional development. The STEM Scholars Program is broadening participation by increasing recruitment, admission, retention and graduation of targeted groups who are underrepresented in STEM fields. The program is advancing the understanding of the unique needs of these groups by tracking their individual academic and student support requests, incorporating the needs expressed in the requests into each STEM Scholar's educational planning process, and coordinating services through community partnerships. This method is expected to be of benefit to other institutions of higher learning as they attempt to bring about more comprehensive support systems for underrepresented students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rhodes State College (Rhodes State ) submitted a plan to increase the number of female and underrepresented technicians that would enter  the local high-tech workforce areas of engineering and information technology.  Rhodes StateÆs goal was to  actively recruit promising students who met the  qualifications to excel in Engineering and Information Technology, so that the  skilled workforce within the area would be significantly enhanced.   The objective of the STEM Scholars program, to enroll underrepresented groups (e.g. women, minorities, persons with disabilities) was achieved.  The expected outcomes of the cohort group being maintained at full capacity with  50% of STEM scholars coming  from underrepresented groups was met and exceeded.  Of the 93 students awarded (not including 6 bridge students who received additional funding to continue at a 4 year college), 78 students (84%) met the target demographic and 44 students (47%) graduated with an Associate degree.   The Rhodes State  grant proposal estimated that  by Year 5, 102 students would be awarded with a total of $510,000 in STEM scholarships, and received the education necessary to obtain employment in  high tech fields. At the end of Year 5, Rhodes State  awarded a total of 99 STEM scholarships amounting to $496,157.82 ( 97% of grant  goal).   Ten percent of STEM Scholars were projected to transition into 4-year institutions with 5% of the scholars  receiving funding.  The goal was achieved as 10 students, (11%) continued their education at a 4 year institution, with 6 of the 10 funded as bridge students.  The institutions Rhodes State graduates/STEM scholars attended to continue their education include Bluffton University (Bluffton, Ohio); Bowling Green State University (Bowling Green, Ohio); Franklin University (Columbus, Ohio); Miami University (Oxford, Ohio) and University of Toledo (Toledo, Ohio).  The grant PI worked with the students and the 4 year institutions to ensure eligibility requirements were met and funding was used appropriately. By the end of Year 5, 20 STEM scholars are still pursuing their Associates degree.   Once a student becomes a recipient of the STEM scholarship, their academic pathway is  clearly mapped out.   An Educational Planning Form (EPF) is developed which documents studentsÆ college degree program from start to finish.  In addition to meeting with the PI to complete the EPF, STEM scholars attended monthly "Lunch and Learn" sessions where they were provided an opportunity to meet and discuss success strategies, financial aid, college readiness, course/program completion, and workforce readiness with the PI, Co-PI, peers and others.  The Rhodes State College STEM scholarship program played an important role in advancing knowledge about STEM fields/careers and helped in the  recruitment and retention  of  underrepresented populations.  In addition to the STEM Scholarship program activities, faculty within the Division of Information Technology and Engineering Technology (IT/ET) collaborated with the Division of Arts and Sciences to create a first year experience course (SDE 1010) specifically geared towards IT/ET majors and with the STEM Scholars in mind.  The SDE1010 for IT/ET course was implemented during AY 2014-15 with the intended goal of  creating a cohort model and  experience for IT/ET students, while  providing them with an introduction to the Division and Campus community while emphasizing assessment and development of the academic, interpersonal, time management skills  necessary to be successful throughout their academic career. Additionally, the course was designed to provide activities and assignments in which students could apply and develop their critical thinking and professional skills to areas specifically related to their field of study .  The broader impact of the STEM Scholars Program was the impact that the program had on student participants.  Knowledge gained by the STEM scholars  impacted the region as they ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
