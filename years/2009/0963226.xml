<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lincoln University, Jefferson City Missouri, is a historically black, 1890 land-grant, public, comprehensive institution. Lincoln's mission is to provide excellent educational opportunities including theoretical and applied learning experiences to a diverse population within a nurturing, student-centered environment. Lincoln University's Department of Life and Physical Sciences has expanded its research program and is renovating Founders Hall, the science building, to upgrade existing space to accommodate research activities and undergraduate research training. The proposed renovations would convert the current spaces into fully operationally wet labs for research and also to upgrade two previously converted spaces housing research. Renovations will include electrical and plumbing installation and upgrades, installation of permanent bench tops and cabinets, asbestos removal, and the addition of new fume hoods. These spaces are currently allocated to five research areas supported by the Department of Life &amp; Physical Sciences including: (1) arthropod vectors and disease ecology (2) adaptive interferometry using photorefractive multiple quantum wells (3) bioenergy production from algae (4) nanotechnology and biosensor production and (5) synthesis of metal complexes of quinone-based compounds. Renovation of these spaces will increase the quality of space for research activities and student projects while providing increased access to research equipment and resources.</AbstractNarration>
