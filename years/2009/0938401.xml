<AbstractNarration>A three-year research project will be conducted to investigate processes leading to the formation, maintenance and destruction of persistent, multi-day, mid-winter temperature inversions or cold-air pools that form in the Salt Lake basin (SLB). These persistent inversions occur frequently as well in other regions throughout the western US and throughout the world, and their initiation and breakup are quite difficult to forecast. Air pollution can reach unacceptably high levels during persistent inversions in urban basins, and when the inversion breaks the breakup can carry pollution vertically to produce regional-scale air pollution and climate impacts. Because of poor mixing, fog and stratus can build up in the inversion leading to hazardous episodes of persistent freezing rain, drizzle or fog and interfering with ground transportation and aviation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are to 1) identify the meteorological processes that lead to buildup, maintenance and breakup of persistent inversions, 2) determine the consequences of these processes on air pollution transport and diffusion in urban basins, and 3) determine how meteorological models can be improved to provide more accurate simulations of such persistent inversions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes observations, analysis, and modeling. The initial focus will be modeling of an event in the winter of 2000-2001 using existing meteorological data. The analyses of this recent event study will identify the key physical mechanisms leading to persistent inversion formation and destruction in this case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A field experiment will be conducted in the SLB from 1 Dec 2010 to 7 Feb 2011 to obtain the detailed meteorological data on several more cases needed for further model simulations and analyses. A mesoscale meteorological model will be used to interpret the observations, verify hypotheses, provide further insight into physical mechanisms, and evaluate the air pollution implications of the inversion processes. The simulations will take account of the often-observed fog and stratiform clouds that form and dissipate within the SLB inversions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project will advance knowledge and understanding of the physical processes that affect persistent inversions. This increase in knowledge is expected to lead to improvements in models and, ultimately, in weather forecasts for the western U.S. and throughout the world. The work uses innovative approaches, employs conceptual models of relevant physical processes resulting from earlier research, and uses a combination of analyses of prior data and collection of new data and numerical modeling to gain understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Broader societal impacts are promoted through the integration of the research into university teaching, through the support of undergraduate and graduate students and through the promotion of investigator/student diversity. Project results will be widely disseminated through peer-reviewed scientific publications and presentations. The results have potential benefits to society through improved understanding of cold pools with potential applications for better understanding air pollution dispersion, weather forecasting and climate.</AbstractNarration>

A comprensive evaluation of the WRF model forecast using the field observations collected from the PCAP field campaign in the Salt Lake Valley (conducted by the project collaborators at the University of Utah) provided guidance on the selection of model physical parameterizations for improved PCAP forecasting.  A large set of controlled numerical experiments using the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) model with a newly implemented canopy module (ARPS-CANOPY) provided the first detailed look at how a vegetation canopy can mitigate nocturnal cooling of the valley atmosphere and modulate the strengths of temperature inversions, as well as how the effects of the canopy vary with valley geometry and ambient atmospheric conditions.      While the results yielded from this project confirmed some of the previous findings about PCAPs, they have provided new insight into the characteristics of and physical mechanisms for PCAPs.  One new finding is related to the role low-level clouds play in maintaining the temperature inversions and lengthening PCAP duration.  The climate data analysis revealed that less than a quarter of all PCAP events were accompanied by significant low-level cloud cover, suggesting that the presence of low-level clouds are not as critical as previously thought for prolonging PCAP events.

It was found that the strength of the valley temperature inversion and overall nocturnal cooling were substantially modified by sidewall vegetation with the coldest overall valley temperature occurring with no vegetation cover and the warmest occurring when the valley sidewalls were fully covered with vegetation. In the case with partial vegetation cover, the nocturnal cooling was found to be sensitive to which portion of the sidewall was covered by canopy. It was also found that the cooling of the valley atmosphere and the formation of the temperature inversion varied with valley geometry and this result supports the hypothesis that an "ideal...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
