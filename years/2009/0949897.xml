<AbstractNarration>While transformations to an aquatic lifestyle have been intensely studied in organisms ranging from insects to whales, basic questions remain unanswered for birds: e.g., how many times has 'aquatic flight' been gained and aerial flight lost? A large collaborative team will focus on resolving the controversial evolutionary relationships of wing-propelled diving birds (including new fossils). Phylogenetic comparative methods will be used to investigate musculoskeletal, neurosensory, and feather microstructure changes across aerial to aquatic flight transitions. Techniques such as X-ray computed tomography, histology, and computer modeling will also be utilized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts focus on interdisciplinary undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training in systematics, histology and biomechanics. Highlights include a mentored research experience for undergraduate students from under-represented groups. Public outreach and education activities include co-instruction of a 3 year Geoscience module of the nationally-recognized UTeach secondary school teacher preparation program, Expanding Your Horizons workshops to encourage young women to pursue science careers, web-cast lectures and distribution of curricular materials via university and museum  programs, and a dedicated blog.  Broad dissemination of research findings is achieved through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and data sharing via online databases.</AbstractNarration>

We discovered that penguin feather morphology evolved early in their evolution before major skeletal changes (a pattern also seen in the origin of avian flight).

We reassessed the evolution of character systems including wing proportions, bone histology, wing feathering, feather coloration, eye, inner ear and brain morphology across the target clades.
