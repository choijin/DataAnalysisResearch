<AbstractNarration>Endangered Florida manatees have a number of unusual anatomical and behavioral adaptations related to their unique role as mammalian aquatic herbivores.  Chief among these is the presence of sensory hairs over the entire body, whereas in most mammals these are only present as facial whiskers.  The present research uses two captive manatees at Mote Marine Laboratory to assess the ability of this system of specialized hairs to detect water-borne vibrations associated with other moving animals, river currents, and tidal flows, all of which are cues likely to be used in navigation.  This research relates not only to the normal behavior of manatees, but also to their ability to detect and avoid approaching boats.  These two animals have been trained on a number of related tasks and are able to report behaviorally whether a stimulus has been detected.  It will be possible to determine the range of frequencies and amplitudes to which the animals are capable of responding, and their degree of directional localization ability.  It will also be possible to discover whether certain portions of the body are more sensitive than others.  Anatomical experiments on postmortem brains will be performed at the University of Florida to map the neural connections that mediate these abilities.  This work utilizes special fluorescent tracers that travel down nerve fibers by diffusion over a period of several months.  In addition, a significant portion of this project includes educational interactions with students and teachers at Mote, New College, the University of South Florida, and the University of Florida.</AbstractNarration>

Subsequent testing indicated slightly higher thresholds (less sensitivity) of postcranial areas of the body.  To assess the sensitivity of the postcranial vibrissae we placed a neoprene wrap around the manatees with a small window, which allowed about 10 &ndash; 20 hairs to be exposed.  This reduction in total number of hairs and body area was associated with less sensitivity.  Since two variables, number of hairs and body area, were simultaneously manipulated we do know which one(s) accounted for the higher detection thresholds.  To resolve this ambiguity, we are currently doing an experiment in which the hairs within a window are trimmed to determine the effect on threshold.  The hairs grow back rapidly.  In another study subjects also demonstrated the ability to determine the left/right direction of hydrodynamic stimuli with accuracy greater than 85%.   Manatees have modest visual acuity and although they have good hearing, they do not echolocate. The neural components of the olfactory system are reduced and there is a paucity of taste buds in manatees.  In other words, vision, audition, and chemical senses may not provide the primary information necessary for manatees to find their way around.  Our studies suggest that in the dimly lit, turbid manatee habitat the sensory hairs that cover the manatee?s entire body (a unique arrangement among mammals) may act as a three-dimensional array for orientation and navigation.
