    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with several open topics in the theory of randomization. While the investigator''s previous NSF grant focused on asymptotic theory, this project deals with exact and Monte Carlo techniques, and proposes to solve problems regarding the properties of bias, balance, and inference with respect to randomized clinical trials. In particular, exact distributional properties of Efron's biased coin design will allow for a detailed inspection of selection and accidental biases, the exact balancing properties of the design, and exact computation of the variance of the randomization test. Monte Carlo techniques are proposed to deal with virtually every type of inference required from randomized clinical trials, including longitudinal outcomes, incorporating covariates either through covariate-adaptive randomization or through covariate-adjusted regression models, and sequential analysis of treatment effects. Under this complete theoretical and computational template, the practitioner will be able to determine appropriate Monte Carlo sample sizes and appropriate methods of determining power and preservation of type I error rates. Finally, the investigator will compare&lt;br/&gt;exact, Monte Carlo, and asymptotic procedures where appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will impact clinical medicine, and has the potential to change the way clinical trials are analyzed. The results will provide clinicians with the appropriate way to fully incorporate the design (randomization procedure) into the analysis. It will impact clinical trials practice by providing analytic tools to evaluate the properties of the trial design, which will allow the clinical trials personnel to choose the most appropriate designs that will minimize bias and variability of the trial results.</AbstractNarration>
