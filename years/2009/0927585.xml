<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop a methodology to investigate the deformation and failure mechanisms of the scaled skin of fish for biomimetic applications. This protective system resists penetration thanks to extremely tough scales made of a nanostructured mineral/collagen composite material. In addition, scaled skin is ultra-light, ultra-thin and compliant. The proposed research will deploy a wide array of experimental and modeling techniques to investigate this complex system and to pinpoint which structural features are key to its performance. More specifically, the objectives of the project are (i) to characterize the microstructure of the fish skin system across several lengths, (ii) to measure its mechanical properties and assess its deformation and failure mechanisms, (iii) to develop multiscale continuum damage models for their failure and (iv) to use these models to establish guidelines for the biomimetic design of fiber-reinforced composite and scaled-structures. Such a bio-inspired material will duplicate the key mechanisms found in fish-scales while using different components.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will find applications in full body personal armor systems, high-performance protective coating or morphing aircraft skins. A deliverable of this award will be a computational tool that will guide the design of bio-inspired material, such that they reproduce the high-performance of biological materials while made of different building blocks. The methodology will be tested by constructing a prototype of a synthetic fish-scale structure. This research will be an avenue to expose undergraduate engineering students to the potential of bio-inspiration in engineering through undergraduate research experiences. In addition, an international dimension will be brought to the project through a strong research collaboration between McGill University (Canada) and CU-Boulder, allowing students broaden their research experience.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
