<AbstractNarration>The Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil are considered one of the World's biodiversity "hotspots"; nearly half of the plant species in the Atlantic forests are unique to this region. Within these coastal forests, those in northeastern Brazil (from Bahia to Rio Grande do Norte) are the most biodiverse and the most critically endangered. Nevertheless, the distributions of the plant species in this region and their relationship to species in adjacent regions are not known. The goal of this project is to study the vegetation of these northeastern forests and demonstrate that the forests of the southern portion (Bahia) and those of the northern portion (Pernambuco) are not as distinct as previously hypothesized. This will be accomplished by collecting and identifying plant specimens in targeted forest fragments throughout the region which will make it possible to map and predict the distribution of plant species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovering new species and clarifying the distribution of forest plants in northeastern Brazil will enhance our understanding of the history of this unique region and its flora. In addition, data on species and their distributions will be provided to appropriate government bodies and local organizations so that decisions about conservation priorities can be made wisely. The PI and Co-PI will provide training in botany, ecology and conservation to student both in the U.S. and in Brazil.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The highly endangered Atlantic forest of Brazil is home to many endemic species, species that occur nowhere else on Earth. Many of these species are grouped in areas called "centers of endemism." These "centers" are important biologically and for conservation. Our goal was to study two of these centers and demonstrate that the biogeographic relationships between the two areas, the forests of Pernambuco in Northeast Brazil and those of Bahia, are stronger than previously thought. To do that, we documented the vascular plant diversity in the forests of the small states of northeastern Brazil.  By the end of the project, we:  tested whether there is a gap between the Bahian and Pernambucan centers of endemism? showed that some species thought to be exclusive to one center were found in the other? showed that many tabuleiro (lowland) forest and submontane forest species are less restricted in distribution than previously believed? collected 33,400 specimens (including silica samples) for specialists for expert identification and study, and for use by monographers and floristicians? compiled regional checklists of species to augment the existing checklist of the flora of Northeast Brazil? extended known distributions for rare and seldom collected species, and made predictions about their occurrence? and brought biologically valuable but little known forest fragments to the attention of biologists and conservationists.
