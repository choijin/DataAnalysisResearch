<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop methods to design control systems for humanoid robots that show human levels of competence, robustness and flexibility in locomotion on human-scale rough terrain, focusing on responses to errors such as slipping and tripping, and responses to perturbations caused by irregular terrain. The research is motivated by the large disparity between human performance and current robot performance.  The project uses a data-driven approach, utilizing motion data recorded from people to create trajectory libraries of these behaviors.  It develops algorithms that allow these libraries to be adapted for robot control and generalized through interpolation, resequencing, and optimization for new environments.  The project also explores strategy selection, modeling what strategies humans use in different situations. The project will have intellectual impacts in making better robots and understanding people better. The project will demonstrate better robot performance as well as more accurate models and simulations of human behavior.  In both cases scientific publications will be augmented by extensive additional material and data on the web. Potential applications include insight into how the changes in the motor and sensory systems due to aging increase the risk of falling. The project may develop ways to change environments and train at-risk people to reduce the risk of falling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have developed better ways to control humanoid robots.  Our methods  are based on making libraries of behavior. When a new behavior needs  to be performed, the library is quickly searched for an appropriate  behavior, and that behavior is adapted to the current situation.  One  question we have addressed is how to keep the library a reasonable  size.  To do this we have developed powerful planning methods that can  modify a stored behavior to a wide range of new behaviors. We have  also developed ways to model good behavior, so we can predict a good  plan in situations where we don't have a stored plan.  To test whether  these methods work we have implemented them on actual robots.    One big problem in robot control is that how the robot responds to  commands varies across robots and also changes with time. We developed  a method that plans behaviors taking that variation into account, by  planning the behavior for several different robots simultaneously.  This technique is known as multiple model behavior design.    It is more difficult to learn a behavior that works in many situations  than a single behavior. In addition to building a library, we developed  planning methods that work for many situations, known as "global  planning".    We worked with colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh to collect  data on human behavior, so we could model that behavior and accidents  such as tripping and slipping. We use this human data to improve robot  performance.    In terms of broader impacts, we played a large role in the creation of  the robot character Baymax in the Disney movie Big Hero 6, as well as  having a graduate student appear on a Discovery Channel TV series,  "The Big Brain Theory: Pure Genius".
