<AbstractNarration>Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form beneficial associations with the roots of most plant species, including most crop plants.  These fungi increase plant access to immobile soil minerals and receive plant carbohydrates in return.  While this interaction can be mutually beneficial between plants and fungi, the extent to which the fungi increase plant growth varies across soil environments and fungal isolates.  Moreover the benefit has been observed to increase and degrade over time.  Currently, there is little basis for predictive understanding of these dynamics.  Recent work has demonstrated that plants can allocate their carbohydrates preferentially toward the most beneficial fungus.  This preferential allocation allows the effective fungus to increase in the face of competition from non-beneficial fungi provided that there is sufficient spatial separation between the fungi within a plant's root system.  Preferential allocation may form a foundation on which to understand the persistence of beneficial fungi and change in their abundance over time.  The proposed work will test resource triggers and environmental dependence of preferential allocation and test patterns of preferential allocation across plant and fungal species.  Finally, fungal population response to manipulation of spatial mixing of the fungi within the plant root system will be evaluated.  These results will be used to develop predictions for changes in abundance of beneficial fungi across environmental gradients.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will train undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral scientists in techniques used to measure and manipulate beneficial AM fungi.  In addition, this research will create opportunities for independent undergraduate research.  In particular, an experiment testing how mycorrhizal fungi may benefit restoration of a native prairie on the campus of Indiana University will be initiated as part of a non-majors course in environmental biology. Students will thus be exposed to multiple aspects of ecological research related to this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form beneficial associations with most plant species, including most crop plants.  These fungi increase plant access to immobile soil minerals and receive plant carbohydrates in return.  While this interaction can be mutually beneficial to both plants and fungi, the extent to which the fungi increase plant productivity varies across soil environments and fungal isolates.  Moreover the benefit to plants has been observed to increase and degrade over time.  Currently, there is little basis for predictive understanding of the direction of these dynamics.  In fact, it is not known what forces prevent more non-beneficial fungi, which can be most competitive, from replacing beneficial fungi.       We used split root chambers in which soil phosphorus and carbon dioxide were simultaneously labeled and monitored to demonstrate that plants can allocate their carbohydrates preferentially toward the fungus that provides the most phosphorus.  This preferential allocation allows the effective fungus to increase in the face of competition from non-beneficial fungi, particularly when there is sufficient spatial separation of the fungi within the plant root system.  The strength of plant preferential allocation would then predict the direction of change in the efficiency of this mutualism.  We found that the strength of preferential allocation declines when the soil is fertilized.  We found that as much as 35% of the plantÆs fixed carbon from photosynthesis is allocated to roots infected with the most efficient fungus in infertile soils and that this declines to 10% with high phosphorus fertilization of the soil.  About 10% of the plantÆs fixed carbon was allocated to roots infected with non-beneficial fungi regardless of soil fertilization, suggesting that this amount of plant investment maintains roots.  There is a similar decline of preferential allocation when the plant is shaded.  Together, this work suggests that beneficial fungi will increase, and with them the efficiency of mutualism, in environmental conditions of high light and low soil fertility.      AM fungi vary widely in their efficiency of mutualism and we tested whether plants can distinguish between four different fungi that varied in their ability to promote plant growth.  We found that the degree of plant preferential allocation was generally correlated with the difference in growth benefit of the fungi.  This is a positive indication that preferential allocation is a general result and not something that depends upon the particular identity of the beneficial fungus.      We also found that plant species vary in their ability to allocate their resources preferentially to the better AM fungi.  We find that weedy plant species are not dependent on AM fungi and have limited abilities to allocate preferentially to the most efficient mutualist.  In contrast, slow growing, late successional species often are very dependent on AM fungi for their growth and reproduction and the four late successional species tested were able to preferentially allocate to the best fungal mutualist.  This work suggests that the most effective AM fungi should decline with dominance of weedy plant species and increase with time since disturbance as late successional plant species become more common.  This work also suggests that inoculating with beneficial fungi can be important for the success of late successional species within native plant restorations.    We find that the competitive ability of AM fungi can depend upon their initial spatial arrangement and on the physical complexity within the soil.  We constructed mathematical models and computer simulations which show that plant allocation is best able to target beneficial fungi when they are spatially separated from non-beneficial fungi.  Manipulative experiments confirm that beneficial fungi increase when initially spatially separated from non-beneficial fungi.       Through this grant we have trained a large ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
