<AbstractNarration>This research project will advance understanding in the area of prejudice and stigma reduction by contributing to understanding the obstacles people face in prejudice confrontation.  Prejudice remains a significant and frequent experience for members of stigmatized groups; one with important consequences for physical and psychological well-being. Previous research on prejudice reduction demonstrates that one effective way to decrease prejudice is to confront it when it occurs. Not only does prejudice confrontation reduce subsequent expressions of prejudice, but it also empowers victims of prejudice. Despite these positive consequences of prejudice confrontation, people often refrain from confronting the prejudice they witness. Understanding the factors that predict whether people will confront prejudice would benefit our understanding of an important social psychological phenomenon.  The project also includes development of a training program to teach people how to overcome the obstacles to confrontation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research builds on previous knowledge about prejudice confrontation. The first set of studies investigates participants' judgments about the urgency of taking action against prejudice by measuring perceptions of harm and injustice as a function of the type of prejudice, target presence, and witness reactions. The second set of studies measures participants' perceptions of responsibility for confronting prejudice as a function of the number of witnesses, target presence, and role accountability. The third and final set of studies examines whether participants confront prejudice as a function of perceptions of confrontation self-efficacy and outcome expectancies.  Importantly,  this research can provide a base from which to build training programs to empower those who witness prejudice to voice their disapproval, and ultimately these findings may generalize and be useful in attenuating the occurrence of other incivilities (e.g., bullying, teasing).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Previous research has shown that confrontation -- communicating one's displeasure with or disapproval of a perpetrator's prejudicial or discriminatory behavior directly to the responsible actor -- is an effective way to curb further incidents of bias and to change perpetrator's attitudes. It has also shown that confrontation empowers targets of discrimination and that, when targets fail to confront, they often suffer psychologically. Despite these clear benefits of confrontation, previous research has also revealed that people are often reluctant to confront perpetrators. Given the benefits associated with confrontation as well as the detriments associated with failing to confront, it is crucial to understand factors that influence the likelihood that people confront prejudicial remarks and discriminatory behavior.</p> <p>The research funded by this award focused specifically on the role of confrontation self-efficacy (CSE) in predicting confrontation. CSE is an individual difference variable involving perceptions of one's ability to confront a perpetrator successfully. As with other forms of self-efficacy, CSE likely develops from past experience.
