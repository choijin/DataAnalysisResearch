<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project (SISMAT) are to combine research, training, and outreach to help further the understanding of the complex information security problems and to nurture the expertise and talent of students capable of confronting these challenges. The team proposes to create a structured, in-depth, and hands-on course material in real-world information security problems like penetration testing and real-time intrusion analysis, defense, and recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project plans to eliminate a gap between the types of active learning environments needed to help undergraduates understand complex attacks and the static trace captures used in current labs. The team plans to investigate the network, systems, and management aspects of a standard for describing and encoding high-interaction hands-on information security training scenarios, and of a simulated network environment capable of supporting simulations of complex enterprise-class networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SISMAT contains a comprehensive outreach program. It creates a repository of projects undertaken by SISMAT participants that is freely shared with the public. It also directly engages security researchers and industry experts as faculty mentors. Project personnel and student participants help forming a community of academics, professionals, and practitioners by supporting conferences like Annual Conference on Education in Information Security.</AbstractNarration>
