<AbstractNarration>Cells release various products to the outside through a process called exocytosis.  In the nervous system, exocytosis mediates the release of chemicals including neurotransmitters, and a number of highly conserved proteins have been shown to control this process. In this project, a hypothesis will be tested that one protein originally discovered in yeast, VSM-1, may regulate exocytosis in the nervous system of multicellular animals. To test this hypothesis, the impact of mutating the gene coding for VSM-1 will be examined by studying the resulting changes at the level of molecules, cells, and whole organisms in C. elegans. At the cellular level, it will be determined if communication between neurons is impaired in mutants lacking the gene.  Finally, whole mutant animals will be examined using pharmacological tests and fluorescent microscopy.  Preliminary unpublished data showed that C. elegans strains containing the mutation in the VSM-1 gene are hyperactive and have more nerve endings than wild type animals. Insights into the mechanism of VSM-1 from this proposal will advance understanding of the nervous system of higher animals, including humans, because there are no reports yet on the function of VSM-1 in multicellular animals. The proposed research will also significantly enhance and promote students' training in the field of neuroscience since it will primarily be conducted by undergraduate students enrolled at Southwestern Oklahoma State University (SWOSU), a teaching institution in rural western Oklahoma with a growing commitment to research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chemical synapses are the main form of communication between neurons and other neurons or non neuronal target cells.  These synapses are characterized by two elements: the presynaptic terminals and the postsynatic area.  At the presynaptic terminal, synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitters fuse to the plasma membrane of the cell via the formation of protein aggregates called SNARE complexes.  Research shows that SNARE complexes are the minimal machinery underlying synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.  To further investigate the molecular mechanism regulating SNARE complex formation and function, we began examining the role of the v-SNARE master protein 1 (VSM-1) at synapses.  To this end, we utilized two model organisms: C. elegans nematodes and fruit flies.  Based on prior research on yeast, we hypothesize that VSM-1 inhibits SNARE complex formation and neurotransmitter release.  To test this hypothesis, we studied mutants lacking this protein and found that neurotransmitter release is increased in the fruit fly and worm mutants. Furthermore, morphological analyses of chemical synapses show that mutant presynaptic terminals have more branches and increased connectivity, suggesting that inhibition of SNARE complex formation negatively regulates neurotransmitter release and the development of synapses.  Additionally, the mutant phenotype of increased synaptic connectivity was correlated with increased swimming rates and enhanced responses to associative learning and memory tests. Taken together, this report revealed that the homolog of yeast VSM-1 acts in multicelluar organism to control synaptic function and physiology.
