<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel funds to assist approximately 20 US-based graduate students to attend the Sixth Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI).  The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community?including computer networking, distributed systems, and operating systems?to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well-suited as a target for student participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sixth Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI) will be held in Boston, MA, on April 22-24, 2009. The conference focuses on the design principles of large-scale networks and distributed systems and, in particular, challenges that are shared across systems as diverse as internet routing, peer-to-peer file sharing, sensor nets, scalable web services, and distributed network measurement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. Participation in NSDI and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field, and exposes students to leading edge work in the field. The award enables the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend NSDI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
