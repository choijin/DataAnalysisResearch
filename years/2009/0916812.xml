<AbstractNarration>The ability to estimate motion of objects from video is a fundamental scientific problem that arises in many tasks: finding out how the human body moves, tracking vehicles movements on a highway or the motility of schools of fish.  Despite many advancements the problem remains hard because of sudden, often highly nonlinear changes and the high dimensionality of the object's configuration spaces.  Much prior work has focused on building complex physics-based models, in an "analysis-by-synthesis" paradigm dominated by expert's domain knowledge.  When such knowledge is lacking, the resulting models may produce inaccurate predictions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these issues, this project investigates a new paradigm of using limited amounts of carefully collected data to learn direct predictive models of high-dimensional motion. We approach the problem as that of the structured regression, a novel generalization of traditional statistical methods that specifically exploits the spatio-temporal structure of the data to avoid the need for "analysis-by-synthesis".  This research will result in a set of robust techniques and computational algorithms that support this new modeling framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tools and techniques developed here will have wide applicability in many areas of technology and industry that rely on design of accurate prediction models in complex space-time domains, leading to more general and sustainable forecasting solutions. Through engagement of graduate and undergraduate students in key research activities, the project also provides advanced technical training vital for success of a new generation of computer scientists.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ability to estimate motion from video is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Estimation of articulated 3D motion of the human figure or the human face, tracking movements of vehicles on a highway or the motion of schools of feeding fish are just some of the numerous applications in motion interpretation and recognition that could benefit from robust and accurate motion estimation methods.  However, despite significant progress in motion modeling, current approaches often yield motion estimates with inadequate accuracies, especially when faced with high-dimensional motion, such as that of the human body.  This project investigated principled mathematical and statistical approaches to high-dimensional motion modeling.  This key challenge was addressed by developing a new framework of structured regression models.  The proposed framework is able to leverage various natural constraints that exist in high dimensional motion, such as the notion of motion categories and motion intensities.  To that end, a class of models called Conditional Ordinal Random Fields (CORF) were developed to tackle the problem of modeling naturalistic facial affect.  Naturalistic facial affect develops along both nominal (categorical) and ordinal scales over time: a facial expression is simultaneously characterized by its intensity and its category (e.g., fear, disgust, etc.)  The CORF approach extends the successful structured classification model (Conditional Random Field) to the setting where the latent states live in an ordinal space.  By imposing the ordinal constraints the CORF model is able to achieve a significantly higher generalization quality compared to the traditional CRF models on the tasks that naturally model the motion intensity.  Within the context of the facial affect modeling, this project has demonstrated that CORF family of models can successfully tackle tasks such as the simultaneous facial emotion and intensity estimation,  the intensity estimation in Action Units (AUs), or the intensity estimation of pain from facial motion artifacts.  The second key contribution of this project is in development of a joint framework for multitarget tracking and target recognition.  By exploiting the structure of the domain, in particular the inclusion/exclusion/layout constraints based on target identity or arrangement, the project has developed a max-margin structured regression framework for tracking of multiple objects.   Both modeling contributions of this project rely on the fact that accurate training data is available, which can be used to estimate e.g., the CORF parameters. Nevertheless, in the context of subjective characteristics of social or human signals, such as the intensity and the category of emotions, the labels assigned by different human experts often show large variations and disagreements.  The third outcome of this project is a framework for multiexpert label fusion.  The approach developed here, based on the notion of probabilistic dynamic canonical correlation models, is able to identify annotator consensus/disagreement even if the annotations exhibit different temporal patterns or delays, as is often the case when annotating human motion.  Together, the three development present new contributions to the domain of high-dimensional motion modeling.  While the core of the project focused on modeling of the human motion the outcomes of this project may have wide applicability in many areas that rely on accurate prediction models in continuous state domains with exploitable structure, such as the modeling of dynamics of linked stock options, biological motility of groups of living species (e.g.,swarming, schooling of fish), or understanding the perceptual bases and limits of the human object tracking (e.g.,multiple target tracking). Solving these problems may have profound impact on economy, biological sciences or understanding of social learning and collective cognition.
