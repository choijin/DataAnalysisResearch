<AbstractNarration>Asymptotic Geometric Analysis is concerned with geometric and linear properties of finite dimensional objects, normed spaces and convex bodies, especially with asymptotics of their various quantitative parameters as the dimension tends to infinity. The achievements of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis demonstrate new and unexpected phenomena characteristic for high dimensions. These phenomena appear in a number of domains of mathematics and adjacent domains of science dealing with functions of infinitely growing numbers of variables. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The last few years have seen tremendous progress in the field of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis. The Thematic Program at the Fields Institute will be an opportunity to attract some of the leading mathematicians of our time and also to create an environment in which students could profit from the interaction with such top experts.  New applications of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis will continue to have an impact on a broad range of fields, including combinatorics, complexity theory and probability.</AbstractNarration>
