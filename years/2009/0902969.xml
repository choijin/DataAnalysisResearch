<AbstractNarration>PI name: C.T. Laurencin &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Virginia Main Campus &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0736002  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EFRI-CBE: Biological, Chemical, and Mechanical Surface Cues for Cell Migration, Proliferation, and Differentiation: An Integrated Approach to Regeneration of New Tissues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance the scientific understanding of the role of nanoscale cues on cell adhesion and differentiation. As illustrated in the testbeds, this new understanding of these cues can be applied towards the construction of three-dimensional polymer scaffolds for the repair of complex tissues such as ligament and nerve, tissues that require a greater degree of precision for adequate healing and regeneration. The motivation is to focus specifically on matrices for ligament and nerve repair stem from vital clinical need and in this way will be of significant impact on the NSF effort in Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation. Many individuals suffering from musculoskeletal connective tissue and nerve injury live painful disabled lives. The design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel synthetic constructs engineered to precise specifications through innovative methodologies represent the next generation of nanoscale tissue engineering. These emerging technologies are ideally-suited to the regeneration of those tissues that depend on their complex structure for complete functional restoration, and thus far have proven an insurmountable challenge to repair due to their inherent complexity.  Additional strength of this proposal comes from the previous accomplishments of its interdisciplinary team by integrating experts in polymer chemistry, materials science, computational modeling, and stem cell biology and utilizing each of these tools toward one unified objective.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will have a significant impact on the field of nanotechnology and tissue regeneration. Inherent in the mission of the assembled team will be to ensure that this impact is felt not only in the research community but also in teaching, training, and education. Of particular focus is the inclusion of underrepresented minorities in the scope of its impact. By encompassing scientific and educational goals one hopes to achieve this. The Principal Investigator's laboratory has trained over 80 minority students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels over the past several years, with attention to minority recruitment, training, and mentorship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tissue engineering has been defined as the application of biological, chemical, and engineering principles toward the repair, restoration, or regeneration of living tissues using biomaterials, cells, and biological agents, alone or in combination.  Within this context a central goal of this work was to uncover the nanoscale and molecular cues that occur as nanopatterned surfaces interact with cellular environments, thus providing the opportunity to engineer these cues to promote adaptation of these surfaces in physiological environments. A unique feature of this project was the utilization of nanobased architectural cues for cellular interaction with polymeric materials to directly explore applications of these engineered biomaterials systems for tissue regeneration. Based on the fundamental information gained from work in this proposal, the use of these platform constructs in engineering both musculoskeletal and neural systems was explored through experimental and theoretical testbeds.  The work of this grant was broadly organized into three focal points: to synthesize novel, bioactive, biodegradable polyphosphazenes with controlled surface chemistry, diverse mechanical properties, tunable degradation rates, and established potential as nanoscale scaffolds, to take these newly developed materials and from them construct morphologically, chemically, and electrically modified polymeric nanostructures, and to evaluate the potential of these scaffolds as platforms for tissue regeneration.  During this project a number of new biodegradable polymers within the polyphosphazene family were developed with specifically tuned physicochemical characteristics.  Additionally extensive work was completed developing methodology to create nanoscale fibers, referred to as nanofibers, in patterns similar to those seen in the microscopic structure of some human tissues like skin, nerve, ligament, and tendon.  While the diameter of the fibers is small, on the scale of 100th the thickness of a human hair, we developed a method in which they could be oriented in predictable patterns with considerable accuracy using controlled electric fields, a process called dielectrophoresis.  We oriented these fibers in parallel configurations to mimic tissues such as ligament and tendon as it was noted to be critical in guiding the direction in which fibroblasts and neuronal cells attached and migrated.  Indeed the more parallel the nanofibers the more predictable was the direction of migration of seeded fibroblasts.  We have also evaluated the impact of roughened surfaces and more hydrophilic surfaces, those that are more attracted to water molecules, on different cell types and found that the polymers modified as described here were more likely to influence human adult stem cells to become tendon cells. We have also investigated nerve regeneration using conduits, or tubes, composed of aligned nanofibers that helped direct the nerve cells down the length of the tube.  This sought to overcome the longstanding challenge of nerve regeneration where the healthy nerve cells are typically unable to traverse the injury site to repair the damaged nerve.  We found that by directing the cells through the tube by allowing them to migrate along aligned fibers greatly facilitated their repair.  During this EFRI project additional funding was received by the Research Experience and Mentoring (REM) supplement grants. This supplemental funding allowed the PI and team to mentor underrepresented minority students to prepare them for careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) related disciplines.
