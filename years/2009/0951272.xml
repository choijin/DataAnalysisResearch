<AbstractNarration>Exchange of small molecules between host and pathogen lies at the heart of cellular decisions in both organisms that result in either compatible (i.e. disease) or incompatible (i.e. resistance) interactions.  A subset of these molecules are oxygenated lipids (oxylipins) produced by conserved oxygenases in both organisms. Of intellectual and potential economical significance is the investigators' recent discovery that maize and fungal volatile and non-volatile oxylipins play a pivotal role in fungal growth, spore and toxin production by Aspergillus flavus, a major seed infecting fungus that produces the carcinogenic mycotoxin aflatoxin.  Our central hypothesis is that fungi and plants induce, intercept and recognize each others oxylipins and that these interactions direct the outcome of the host-pathogen interaction.  The overall goal of this project is to elucidate molecular, biochemical and cellular mechanisms governing oxylipin regulation and perception in both maize and A. flavus. By using oxylipin mutants in both organisms, the investigators will assess the role of these lipid molecules in seed colonization, fungal development and aflatoxin production.  They will also test the hypothesis that maize oxylipins are perceived by A. flavus G-protein coupled receptors to modulate pathogenesis processes. The results will generate conclusive evidence of cross kingdom lipid-based signaling communication that governs the outcomes of host-pathogen interactions.  These results will be of significance to the scientific community involved in studies of cross-talk signaling in plant-insect, animal- and human-pathogen interactions.  The broader impacts of this project include insights required for the incorporation of mycotoxin resistance into commercial germplasm, an advance of immediate significance for the general public, seed industry, maize growers and breeders. A key component of this project is to train graduate students and postdocs in cross-disciplinary fields of plant and fungal genetics, molecular biology and lipid biochemistry and mentoring of undergraduates in laboratory and class settings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative grant with Drs. Michael Kolomiets and Nancy Keller was designed to understand the interaction between the plant pathogenic fungus, Aspergillus flavus. and its host, the maize plant.  Aspergillus flavus grows in maize kernals where it produces the carcinogen, aflatoxin (AF).   When consumed as food or feed products by humans and animals, AF causes liver cancer and even death.  Currently there are few control measures and the economic and health costs to the USA and other countries are large.   Kolomiets (maize molecular biologist) and Keller (Aspergillus molecular biologist) examined the hypothesis that Aspergillus and maize induce, intercept, and recognize each others fatty acids and their oxygenated derivatives (oxylipins) which in turn directs the outcome of the maize/fungal/AF interaction.     To summarize the work from Keller lab, we were able to create a full set of A. flavus oxylipin mutants by deleting the genes encoding the enzymes generating the oxylipins.  We followed this work by deleting all of the fungal receptors that we hypothesized would recognize either plant or fungal oxylipins, two in particular appeared to be important to recognize oxylipins.  Lastly, we identified three fatty acid regulatory genes that contribute to the ability of the fungus to colonize maize seed.   On the plant side, the Kolomiets lab, has generated maize lines defective in single, double, and triple genes in the oxylipin biosynthetic pathways. We used these lines as genetic tools to help us understand how different oxylipin producing genes interact with each other while the seed defends itself against A. flavus.  We have found that host individual oxylipin biosynthetic genes regulate either positively or negative, in additive or antagonistic manner, specific proccesses in A. flavus such as growth, spore production, and toxin generation. Our laboratory and field tests identified four genes that are reuired for maize resistance to fungal colonization and ability to produce the carcinogenic toxin. Moreover, under the field conditions, we showed that two of the lipoxygenase mutants showed five-fold reduction in the levels of aflatoxin, suggesting that these two genes are susceptibility factors required by the pathogens to produce toxin.

The results provide clear evidence that as hypothesized, oxylipins from both the host and the pathogen are involved in sophisticated signaling cross-talk that govern the outcomnes of the their interactions.  The Intellectual merit of this research contributed multiple lines of biochemical, molecular and genetic evidence supporting the hypothesis that plants and their fungal pathogens interact via lipid-derived signals and that the ability of fungi to colonize the host, reproduce and synthsize toxic to humans and animals secondary metabolites. The novel lipid-based mechanisms of cross-kingdom communication are exoected to be broadly applicable to other inetracting organisms including plant pathogens, insect herbovores, beneficial microorganisms colonizing roots and other plant orgnas.  The genetic tools developed within the objectives of this project will provide a solid foundation for future endevours to improve our understanding of lipid-based signaling in plant responses to other pathogens, insect herbivores and broader interactions with the plant above- and below-ground microbiomes.   The Broader impacts have led to the identification of fungal receptors important in recognizing maize oxylipins or fungal development and mycotoxin synthesis that could be potential targets of novel anti-fungals.  Several maize genes and novel alleles were identified to improve seed resistance to mycotoxin produc...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
