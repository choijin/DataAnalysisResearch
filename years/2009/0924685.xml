<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop an ultrafast solid-state magnetic sensor using MgO-based magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ). The operating frequency range will span from DC to 2 GHz, the broadest among competing technologies. The sensor will have a compact size and high sensitivity and will operate at ambient conditions with no supporting system. The ability to mass produce these devices will provide a significant cost advantage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a critical unmet need in ultrafast sensors. These sensors can perform non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of VLSI semiconductor chips, aircraft components and engine turbines, they will allow computers to process information faster in data storage devices, and they can be used to measure fast currents in devices such as antenna. The sensors hold great promise for monitoring the health of aircrafts. Ultrafast sensors can also monitor the performance of VLSI in failure analysis, enhancing the competitiveness of the semiconductor industry by shortening the development cycles. Knowledge gained in ultrafast sensor can be used to make faster data storage devices and build better national defense infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
