    <AbstractNarration>A three-day workshop is being held to address challenges specific to projects in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program (STEP) that are partnerships between two-year and four-year institutions. The five challenges that are being addressed include choosing and tracking appropriate impact measures that span the different academic environments; creating undergraduate research opportunities for more community college students; fostering inter-institutional collaborations, even among distant institutions; ensuring success of STEM transfer students; and sustaining, disseminating, and institutionalizing a project. A total of 42 participants are expected to attend the workshop to be held in October, 2009. The product of the workshop will be a statement of goals and recommendations regarding the challenges most in need of addressing.</AbstractNarration>
