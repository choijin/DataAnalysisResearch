<AbstractNarration>0969023 Iowa State University; R. Bruce Thompson&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;CNDE is seeking a Phase III support (third five-year period) for the Center, including support for center personnel, evaluation and research.  The proposed Center is a single-university Center at the Iowa State University.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CNDE was established in 1985, and is currently a self-sustaining Center that continues to operate under the IUCRC model.  The Center focuses on the use of noninvasive measurement techniques to gather information on defects in materials and the various properties of materials, components and structures-information. Included are techniques that are familiar from medicine, e.g. the use of x-rays and ultrasonic waves to detect cracks and other material conditions that might lead to failure, as well as techniques that have no medical analog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Phase III, detailed brain-storming sessions are planned between the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) and Principal Investigators to guide the evolution of project plans in the context of the generic industrial needs. The work proposed involves research in ultrasonic, x-ray, electromagnetic, signal processing, and magnetic measurement techniques. Additional projects are focused on materials specific problems in the characterization of microstructure and the NDE of composites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will help avoid major structural failures and the resultant loss of human life, create and maintain a unique base of specialized equipment available for use beyond the I/UCRC, and help train a new generation of NDE engineers. Significant attention will be given to broadening participation of under-represented groups through special programs (Science Bound Program), encouragement of women in undergraduate and graduate research, and involvement of women in leadership positions. The Center plans to disseminate information via the Review of Progress in Quantitative Nondestructive Evaluation, an international meeting attended by 300-350 researchers annually.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Center for Nondestructive Evaluation (CNDE), Iowa State University (ISU), successfully completed its activities under Phase III of the NSF I/U CRC Program. It became a graduated center  with effect from the 1st January 2016.  CNDE is the undisputed lead academic research organization in the United States within its technical mission area, providing capabilities in all major NDE technologies, as evidenced by the 27 corporate/agency center participants and the community that has developed around Center, through projects and alumni, and the Annual Review of Progress in Quantitative NDE.  In 2015 Center had total expenditures of almost $4M.  In terms of the Phase III original (2010) major goals CNDE has (i) pursued research in NDE problems of interest to sponsors, (ii) it has increased the number of students engaged in both undergraduate and graduate programs with an emphasis on NDE and (iii) it is a focal point for NDE technology transfer to industry. There has been mixed success in the fourth goal focused on efforts to drive the emergence of NDE as a full-fledged engineering discipline. The role and need for the "NDE Engineer," to lead and increase the science and technology level needed to ensure product safety, reliability and quality is increasingly recognized with activities and new positions advertised in high technology industry.  In the USA an NDE Engineering Division is being formed (late 2015/16) within the American Society for NDT and the IEEE Reliability Society is now a technical co-sponsor for the Annual Review of Progress in Quantitative NDE.  CNDE, as an IU CRC, has had a significant impact in developing and harmonizing the science and technology that comprises NDE in the nation and worldwide. This includes: the  web based NDT Resource Center, the editors-in-chief the two leading scientific NDE journals;  sponsorship and organization of the world leading Annual Review of Progress in QNDE, for which the proceedings published by the American Institute of Physics and formal cooperation with organizations globally, through the World Federation of NDE Centers (WFNDEC).    The increased attention on safety, reliability and quality is being driven by requirements for effective use of our natural resources which forces technology to reduce safety margins for design of components, however a reduction of reliability and safety cannot be tolerated. The damage tolerance of a structure is related to its ability to sustain performance, even with the presence of defects, until it can be safely repaired.  The result is that NDE has become an integral element not only for structural health monitoring, but also for component design and technology development. Advanced diagnostics, material state awareness and prognostics, giving the ability to reliably estimate a components safe life. New questions and inspection tasks are arising that will require significant development and need advanced research in the future.  This is especially so for new materials where in some cases basic damage nucleation and progression is not fully understood or for new fabrication technologies like additive manufacturing) where the product is not the same as similar material formed  using subtraction fabrication methods. The measurement technologies which comprise the science and technology base for NDE are very suitable tools for materials and technology development to give needed in-process and finished product characterization.  The activities of CNDE are now focused primarily on the assessment of problems associated with the reliability of structural materials, with some applications to address the needs of electrical materials, and biological systems that are requiring unique measurement capabilities and applications.  CNDE continues to have a major role in NDE education, but is now operating for such activities in partnership with the College of Engineering. An NDE Education Sub-committee, comprised of faculty active in CNDE has oversight and ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
