<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project replaces the R/V Baldwin, a floating research laboratory used by Middlebury College in Vermont for hands-on, experiential, research training of students on Lake Champlain.  The R/V Baldwin has reached the end of its useful life and will be replaced by a new, larger, more highly capable, "green", and seaworthy vessel outfitted to allow college student and faculty research projects to be carried out.  Middlebury College is an undergraduate institution that is widely considered as an important engine for educating and training undergraduates who continue on to graduate school in the environmental sciences.  The new vessel will double the number of people that can be present on the boat at any given time.  Unlike the present vessel, which is restricted to shallow parts of the lake, the new ship will be able to fully navigate the lake, which will dramatically increase the types and numbers of research projects that can be carried out. The new vessel will impact research in disciplines as diverse as geology, biology, environmental science, and chemistry, enabling research in areas as diverse as hydrodynamics, paleoanthropology, paleoclimate, sedimentology, geophysics, aquatic ecology, and environmental chemistry.  Broader impacts of the project include increasing the infrastructure for interdisciplinary science and the research training of large numbers of undergraduate students at Middlebury College and other local colleges and universities in Vermont, which is an EPSCoR state.  It will also provide jobs in Washington State where the ship will be built.  Other impacts include improved environmental assessment and monitoring of the 6th largest freshwater lake in the nation; one that serves the recreational and economic needs of a large number of people in the northeastern US.  Research training of K-12 teachers who will use the vessel will be implemented.  Public outreach using data collected by researchers using the vessel will be carried out through involvement with local maritime museums.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit  The first research work was scheduled for summer 2012 in Mississqoui Bay, to include senior thesis work by two geology students. The Folger was also slated to be used for Alumni College at the end of the summer and three different Middlebury College courses (Oceanography, Marine Geology, and a First Year Seminar) that fall. However, transport of the vessel to the east coast-- initially scheduled for early May -- was repeatedly delayed by the marine transport company; the Folger didnÆt reach Lake Champlain until September.

In June 2013, the Folger was used for a three-week program of hydrodynamic and sediment studies in Missisquoi Bay. This interdisciplinary project involved undergraduates from Buffalo State College (NY), St. Michaels College (VT), University of Vermont (VT), Middlebury College (MC) and interns from Puerto Rico.     Scientific Impacts     Interdisciplinary scientific projects initiated within 12 months after the research vessel reached home port:     ? Mapping of Fish Spawning Grounds and Larval Distribution: The new vessel is mapping the topography in several locations, and this data is available for use by researchers concerned about fish spawning grounds. Several areas have been mapped since Fall 2012: Converse Bay, near Otter Creek delta, south of Four Brothers Plateau, Shelburne and Missisquoi Bays.     ? Geologic History of the Champlain Valley since the Last Deglaciation: Seismic lake-bottom profiling is being collected, integrated with existing data, and tied to on?shore datasets to increase knowledge of the glacial and post-glacial history of the lake and its surroundings.
