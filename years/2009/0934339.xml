<AbstractNarration>IIP 0934339&lt;br/&gt;Florida Atlantic University&lt;br/&gt;Furht&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Florida Atlantic University (FAU) is planning to join the existing Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "Center for Advanced Knowledge Enablement" (CAKE) which was established as a single-university Center in 2008 at Florida International University (FIU).      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAKE conducts research in performance studies, benchmark evaluations, and the application of novel algorithms, routines, data models, network analyses and software tools to large-scale data sets. The goal of the FAU site is to provide the synergy to the Center, include additional industry partners, and provide collaboration between FIU and FAU researchers, and industry partners.  The FAU faculty of the proposed I/UCRC site will carry out research in existing and new technologies for various Web-based applications, video compression and communication, video transcoding systems and servers, next generation of hardware/software development techniques and tools for mobile devices, and RFID-based automation systems. The research plans at the FAU site are well laid out and promise high likelihood of success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities proposed have a wide ranging impact on the industry for improved application of data management and access. The addition of FAU as a research site helps the Center expand the interaction of researchers, students, and industry members beyond one university, and broadens participation of underrepresented groups in several ways. FAU plans to expand opportunities of mentoring and graduating computer scientists from under-represented populations at the BS, MS, and PhD levels, and will extensively involve female students via its faculty affiliation with the FAU's Women in Computer Science student organization. FAU also plans to include other US universities and international collaboration in the framework of the Latin American Grid Project, an existing NSF PIRE project, and other collaborations with European, South American, and Asian universities.</AbstractNarration>

The project on developing a &ldquo;Driver's Drowsiness Detection System&rdquo; combines smartphones with machine learning to detect drowsiness in real time. In this project we developed and implemented a driver drowsiness detection system based on visual input, such as driver&rsquo;s face and head. Our innovative algorithm combines software components for face detection, human skin color detection, and the classification algorithm for the eye state (open vs. closed). The system uses commercially available devices, Users&rsquo; smartphones are used to monitor drivers. Visual cues are then used to detect signs of drowsiness, and, when signs of drowsiness are detected, the system issues an alert. The system uses innovative machine learning algorithms that continuously monitor driver behavior, and alerts the driver in real time when certain thresholds are met. Once in place, it begins a training process to determine the baseline head position and eye movement. After this calibration, real time monitoring begins, sending the alarm if the head dips or eyes close for prolonged periods; both are indicating that the driver is falling asleep.

Massive amounts of data from various sources including Twitter feeds, Facebook and Google were used. This data was then fed into a decision support system that models the spread pattern of the Ebola virus and creates dynamic graphs and predictive diffusion models on the outcome and impact on either a specific person or a specific community. As a result of this research, computational spread models for Ebola in the U.S. are created, potentially leading to more precise forward predictions of the disease propagation and tools to help identify individuals who are possibly infected, and perform trace-back analysis to locate the possible source of infection for a particular social group.&nbsp; We closely collaborated with LexisNexis Risk Solutions (LN), which is a leading big data company and a member of our I/UCRC for Advanced Knowledge Enablement. LN has provided the large amount of data about relationships among people in the U.S., and we combined it with data analytics techniques and tools to model disease spread patterns.</p> <p>Jointly with the LN research team, people clusters were created based on proximity and a model using weighted scores was built, which approximated physical contacts (Figure 3). In creating people clusters, we used public record graphs to calculate distances between an affected person and his/her relatives and friends. Based on this model, the disease propagation path was developed.</p> <p>As I/UCRC CAKE continues to grow in Phase II of the project, the Center, jointly with FIU as the lead site, will build a cohesive structure spanning multiple institutions by enabling extended research visits at partner sites for both faculty and students.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/04/2016<br>      Modified by: Borko&nbsp;Furht</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0934339/0934339_10029164_1470321564884_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0934339/0934339_10029164_1470321564884_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0934339/0934339_10029164_1470321564884_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Research focus of the I/UCRC for Advanced Knowledge Enablement: synergetic research sub-areas and related vertical applications.</div> <div class="imageCredit">N/A</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Borko&nbsp;Furht</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0934339/0934339_10029164_1470322437372_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0934339/0934339_10029164_1470322437372_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0934339/0934339_10029164_1470322437372_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Four stages of Drowsiness Detection System.</div> <div class="imageCredit">N/A</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Borko&nbsp;Furht</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0934339/0934339_10029164_1470324600689_Figure3.--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0934339/0934339_10029164_1470324600689_Figure3.--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0934339/0934339_10029164_1470324600689_Figure3.--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Identifying families and tightly connected social groups.</div> <div class="imageCredit">LexisNexis collaboration team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Borko&nbsp;Furht</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3.</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
