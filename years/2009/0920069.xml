<AbstractNarration>The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism that senses and responds to sex pheromones in a gender-specific manner: males are attracted to female pheromones, but females avoid the pheromones. The goal of this project is to understand how molecules and nerve cells generate gender-specific behaviors.  This species is very well-suited for studies of behavior since it is the only organism for which we know the complete wiring diagram of the nervous system.  In this study the pheromones will be purified and their molecular structure determined.  These pheromones bind to receptors on the surface of the olfactory cells and signal to the brain that females are present.  In addition, the brain circuit required for male response to the pheromones will be determined. One of the eventual goals of this project is to test models for how brain activity generates behavior. The C. elegans nervous system is simple enough that it should be possible to reprogram behavior and thereby confirm models for nerve cell function and behavior. Part of this project will be carried out by undergraduates, thus the proposed research will train students in genetics and neurobiology, and give them a practical basis for understanding fundamental principles. The results of this proposal will be made available by publication in scientific journals and presented to the public by the PI in community and university presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research  The research objective of the project was to describe how sex-specificity of behavior arises in nematode worms (Caenorhabditis elegans). In the short term, we wanted to identify the neurons required for male-attraction and hermaphrodite avoidance behaviors in C. elegans.  The long-term goal of the project was to understand how pheromones act to activate neural circuits that determine these behaviors.   We demonstrated that masculinization of the hermaphrodite brain is sufficient to generate male sexual behavior. We identified the minimal circuit that must be masculinized in the female brain to generate male behavior.  These neurons include sensory neurons required for sensing pheromones and a subset of the downstream interneurons. Our work has implications for understanding behavior. A tenet of modern neu&shy;robiology is that behavior is generated by patterns of activity in a neural system. The system can be comprised of a few hundred worm neurons or the millions of cells in the human brain. Both are basically the same: a collection of neurons wired together.  The neurons themselves, their properties, and connections are all genetically determined, so the behavioral output of all neural systems is, ultimately, genetically determined. Working in a simple system allows us to show how a few small genetic changes leads to changes in physiology (that is, neuron-intrinsic properties) or connectivity, and how these changes consequently re&shy;program behavior&mdash;from masculine to feminine and vise versa. It follows that the output of more complex neural systems are similarly determined, and can be manipulated and effec&shy;tively re-programmed by similarly small changes, introduced either genetically or pharmaco&shy;logically. These basic principles therefore address a variety of human issues, most clearly the medical treatment of human behavioral disorders, but also the social policies guiding such treatment.  Education  There were three main goals of the educational activities for this project:  Education aim 1: Undergraduate research training.  Introduce undergraduate students to laboratory research and train them to prepare them for careers in science or medicine.  Education aim 2: Senior level training.  Train students, postdocs and philosophers in research methods.  Education aim 3: Public education. Further public understanding of basic research in neurobiology through the outreach programs of the University of Utah.
