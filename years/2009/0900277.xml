<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to establish nonlinear dynamics and control theory techniques that facilitate the design of experimental strategies to predictably manipulate the intracellular signaling pathway dynamics.  The development of this type of dynamical analysis and control theory-inspired experiment design has been hindered by the lack of adequately accurate mathematical models and incomplete knowledge of the intracellular signaling pathways.  Recent developments and preliminary experiments using nonlinear model predictive controller design with sparse grid-based optimization have set the stage for the development of effective control strategies despite these uncertainties.  The refinement of computationally efficient sparse grid-based techniques to rapidly screen model structures and parameters for compatibility with the available experimental data will elucidate data-consistent signaling dynamics, facilitate experiment design to discern between data-compatible mechanisms, and support robust controller design.  The extension of current robust controller design techniques to select controller parameters that minimize the effects from uncertainties in the model parameters and structure and small perturbations in the controller parameter values will maximize the likelihood that the resulting controller actions, when realized in the laboratory, will achieve their desired objectives.  The robust controller design techniques developed to minimize the effects of large degrees of uncertainty in the model parameters and structure will be immediately applicable to control a number of highly uncertain systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intracellular signaling pathways transmit and coordinate signals within the cell to direct fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis.  The ability to predict signaling network dynamics will ultimately provide us with ways to alter cellular responses in a controlled manner.  This ability will find application in medicine and pharmacy, agriculture, and biotechnology.  The intracellular signaling pathways involve numerous chemical species that participate in a complex sequence of events orchestrated by interactions, crosstalk and feedback.  The complexity of these networks hinders the ability of unaided intuition to efficiently design experiments to manipulate the signaling events in a desired manner.  This interdisciplinary research combines and extends expertise and techniques from control theory, computational mathematics, and cell biology to derive approaches to quantitatively design experiments.  Undergraduates and graduate students will participate in the research and primary dissemination of the research results will be through peer-reviewed journal publications, conference presentations, a technical workshop, course material, and the Web.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on developing computational and experimental methods to better understand the processes that govern the behavior of cellular processes, partiuclarly the response of cells in the immune system.  At a general level, this work begins with computational models that encapsulate as much existing biological knowledge as possible about a cellular system.  However, even the best such model has significant uncertainties, so our approach is to use such a model to guide experiments to reduce this uncertainty.  Many previous efforts have focused on reducing the uncertainty in parameters in such a model, while our approach focuses on reducing the uncertainty in the dynamics (the cellular response) directly.  This led us to develop and apply a number of mathematical techniques to explore the possible model responses and to use this information to design experiments that yield the greatest reduction in dynamical uncertainty.  We applied this successfully to resolve the uncertainty in several aspects of a model of T-cell response in the immune system.   We then built on this work to design open-loop controllers for T-cell response.  Open loop control is a type of control in which the desired response is specified and for which inputs can be given as desired, but in which there is no feedback from the system to the controller.  That is, the controller is flying blind in some sense.  By combining several models, each with various strengths and weaknesses, along with a set of experiments designed to reduce the uncertainty in these models and to identify the most reliable operating conditions for each model, we were able to develop open-loop controllers to induce a variety of specified responses in T-cells and were able to verify our results experimentally.     In another extension, we included the possibility of desiging external stimuli into our model-based framework for designing experiments to reduce model uncertainty.  This greatly increases the computational complexity of the resulting design problem since now the possible measurements must each be evaluated against the various possible inputs.  By combining computationally efficient methods for approximating functions in high dimensions with a probabilistic representation for possible experimental outputs, we successfully applied this method to a 19-dimensional T-cell receptor model.  Our results suggest that for resolving dynamical uncertainty,  the ability to design an input sequence along with its associated  measurements is particularly important when the number of  total measurements is limited.  Expanding our work on cellular control, we developed a computationally efficient method to construct explicit model-predictive control (EMPC) systems.  In a series of advances, we generated a robust stabilizing EMPC that is applicable to higher order systems  with matched uncertainties and have  made progress with disturbance invariant sets that will be  particularly useful for controlling systems with parametric and/or  disturbance uncertainties in the matched and unmatched cases.  This  approach generates an EMPC that can stabilize unknown bounded  disturbances using robust state feedback.  Most recently, we have  been developing observers to close this feedback loop.  This  approach has led to a sequence of enhancements that ultimately will  lead us towards controller formulation with performance  guarantees suitable for controlling intracellular signaling  dynamics.  In more theoretically-focused work, we provided mathematically rigorous justification for the experiment design methods we used.  These results imply that even for the complex nonlinear models used to describe cellular signalling networks, our experiment design methods are sufficient to fully resolve the dynamical uncertainty of the model, under appropriate hypotheses.   Finally, we produced a user-friendly computational tool called Nexperiment that implements many of our experiment design methods along w...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
