<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to renovate the research component of Louisiana State University's (LSU's) campus network.  The network includes a bypass feature which allows traffic between researchers and pre-cleared network addresses to bypass the institution's primary firewall and traffic-shaping devices.  Such traffic flows between the border router and the campus network core through a router dedicated to bypass traffic, rather than through the campus firewall and traffic shaper.  This architecture was created by LSU to address two primary concerns associated with the older network architecture, lack of adequate bandwidth over the 'last mile' to researchers with equipment generating or consuming large amounts of data in facilities in distributed locations, and the hindrance to high bandwidth, low-latency data flows imposed by various network security and integrity controls.  The renovation involves upgrading multiple levels within the campus network.  The goal is to upgrade the campus network in such a way that when, subsequently, a new high-bandwidth, low-latency connection is required at some location on campus, this can be deployed rapidly and inexpensively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upgraded network will enhance research in many areas, including coastal modeling, the visualization of coastal models, computational biology, relativistic astrophysics, computer science, advanced networking research, and nontraditional areas of computational study such as music, theatre, and the visual arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing infrastructure for research, the upgraded network will also have an impact outside of science and engineering, on research related to technologies for use in the arts and digital media.   The infrastructure will support research training since many of the people using the network in research activities will be graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cyberinfrastructure has been advanced tremendously in the US and globally this decade. Investments by the NSF, other national and international research funding entities, institutions, and the R&amp;E community have built a vast collection of high performance computing and storage centers, and high-speed network connectivity to regions and large institutional/laboratory connectors. However, challenges remain with enabling  researchers  to  access  these  advanced  resources  and  networks  due  to  "narrowing  of  the arteries" on campuses; researchers with equipment in facilities in distributed locations are hindered by the lack of "last mile/meter" network connectivity on the campus itself.  As well, overall campus core network designs are very much constrained by various network security and integrity controls, such as firewalls, which are designed to protect the institution and its resources in the face of sometimes withering assaults.  These controls that protect the institution also hinder the flow of research-enhancing data from the national cyberinfrastructure to the researcher at the end of the pipeline.       At Louisiana State University (LSU), researchers have access to a variety of high performance computing infrastructure.  However, the speed of access to this infrastructure influences the speed with which research can be conducted.  The majority of research buildings on campus were connected to the network core via 1 Gbps network links.  Researchers trying to transport large data sets would experience slow network performance and response.  The intent of the ARI/BIPAS grant was to enable these research buildings faster access to network and compute resources both on and off the LSU campus.  After the completion of the ARI/BIPAS project, the majority of research buildings were connected via 10 Gbps (up from 1 Gbps) to the network core which provided faster access to network resources both on and off campus.  The majority of desktop computer network connections were upgraded from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps. In some cases 10 Gbps to the desktop was provided.  The network core was also upgraded to allow faster throughput of data.  All of these actions enabled researchers to conduct science faster without the hindrance of excessive delays.   Through this pervasive access to high-speed connectivity, researchers across campus were able to consider and pursue new avenues of discovery unhindered by "the tyranny of place" as they develop ideas and proposals, collaborate with colleagues, and access resources with connectivity readily available without regard to location. This "IT abundance" concept will advance groundbreaking discoveries in the Sciences, the Arts, and Coast and Environment Studies.  Through our past research projects, we have demonstrated how 10 Gigabit-per-second (Gbps) connections can have major impact on computational science research, including the PetaShare Data Research initiative.  Beyond the sciences, the expanded connectivity will enhance non-traditional areas of computational study, including music, theatrical, and visual arts applications.     Outcomes of this project include the following research or presentations:  2010 Internet2 Fall Member Meeting in Atlanta, Georgia: LSU Information Technology Services staff delivered a presentation titled 'BIPAS: Expanding a Research Network'.  The LSU School of Music participated in a network concert with organizations from California, Colorado, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Northern Ireland.  This "network concert" is something that has not been done before in this manner and is something that would not have been possible at LSU without the infrastructure upgrades.  The performance was reported in the Wall Street Journal Online and can be found here:  http://on.wsj.com/HPWSgJ.        The ARI-funded project made it possible for LSU's astrophysics researchers to more effectively transfer large datasets between researcher offices and national supercomputing centers suc...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
