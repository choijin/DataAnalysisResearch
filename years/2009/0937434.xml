<AbstractNarration>This pilot project will investigate new strategies to enhance the preparation of chemistry professionals to communicate with broader audiences. The overall goal is to cultivate a cadre of chemistry communication leaders who can 1) help bring about a cultural change in the field of chemistry to value and reward public communication; 2) serve as mentors and ambassadors for chemistry communication efforts; and 3) share a modular chemistry communication curriculum/resource guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will generate new knowledge about strategies to enhance the preparation of informal science educators with particular attention to the following central questions: 1) to what extent does this course improve chemists' ability to communicate their own research to broader audiences; 2) how does the role-playing experience of being a journalist for a few days affect the preparation of chemists to serve as sources for journalists; 3) how does this preparation affect, if at all, chemists' understanding of and attitudes toward the process of public communication of chemistry; and 4) how does the course affect participants' ideas, attitudes, plans, and actions with respect to undertaking communication efforts in their home departments? These questions will be addressed by means of pre- and post-course writing assignments, pre- and post-questionnaires, and follow-up surveys and email/phone interaction with participants.</AbstractNarration>
