<AbstractNarration>The plant cell wall is a self-assembling supramolecular structure of interpenetrating carbohydrate polymers: cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin, and a minor component of extensin proteins. Wall properties arise from correct self-assembly, but very little is known about how this occurs. It is known that one (RSH) of the 20 different extensins in the model plant, Arabidopsis, is critical for correct formation on new plant walls and that this extensin has the capacity to self-assemble to form a scaffold. Several lines of evidence suggest that extensins provide templates on which other components organize themselves. The central question here is how do extensins form scaffolds? Extensins are highly repetitive glycopeptides of alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid motifs, with an abundance of the positively charged amino acids lysine and histidine. Functionality of these extensin components will be tested using synthetic genes to replace RSH in the rsh mutant. In addition to this genetic study, purified RSH analogs and walls containing them will be characterized, biochemically, by isolation and characterization of wall peptides, including cross-linking assays, and biophysically by imaging of analog self-assembly using atomic force microscopy. The project also aims to identify plant and wall differences with extensin analog sequences. Defining the molecular interactions of extensins in the primary cell wall, and the precise roles of the conserved peptide motifs, are highly relevant to understanding wall self-assembly, defense responses and plant morphogenesis. As the most abundant biomass on earth, plant cell walls contribute crucially to self-sustaining civilizations from shelter, to food, fiber and fuel. A potential impact of this work is wall remodeling to enable new and improved uses of plant cell wall, not least the production of biofuels. Junior researchers including those with minority status will work as part of a team crossing several scientific disciplines to solve this significant biological problem.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plants produce a family of hydroxyproline-rich structural glycoproteins (HRGPs) that are involved in synthesis of the cell wall.  Our early work demonstrated that one HRGP in particular, named EXTENSIN3 (EXT3) was critical in the first steps of new wall assembly, such that mutant plants that lacked EXT3 produced abnormal cell walls and eventually died (Cannon et al, 2008, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105:2226-2231).  In order to determine what features of EXT3 were required for normal wall development, we made a series of EXT genes that had alterations or deletions that hypothetically addressed the function of specific parts of EXT3.   For example, we made EXT3  analogs that lacked one or both of the unique end sequences  of EXT3. We also made EXT3 analogs that were not capable of crosslinking in the cell wall, a suspected function of EXT3 in normal walls.  Our approach was complicated by later observations that some plants that were indeed mutants, in that they did not make EXT3, still displayed normal growth (designated revertants).  Nucleic acid analysis of several mutant plants that displayed normal growth indicated that although they lacked EXT3, they apparently rescued themselves from death by expressing other HRGPs and regulatory molecules (Saha et al, 2013, The Plant Journal 75:104-116).  To determine if the conclusions of Saha and colleagues was also valid at the biochemical level, we examined the proteins present in 1) the cell walls of normal plants (expressing EXT3), 2) mutant plants that showed abnormal growth (and ultimately died), and 3) mutant plants having normal growth without making EXT3 (revertants). We found that the walls from normal plants were rich in EXT3, whereas the mutant walls of both types essentially lacked EXT3, all in agreement with Saha and colleagues.  Notably, all walls were rich in one particular type of HRGP that is not an extension, and  another type of extensin.  The walls of revertants showing normal growth and the walls of the lethal mutant differed from the wild type wall in that they also contained two leucine-rich repeat extensins.  However, we found no obvious differences that explained why some mutants grew normally and others did not. We speculated that the normal grow displayed by the revertants resulted from the adjustment in  the relative ratio of  commonly expressed extensins/HRGPs in the normal, revertant, and mutant walls.               We also isolated and cloned  Arabidopsis and tomato peroxidases hypothetically  involved in intermolecularly crosslinking EXT3 and other extensins in vitro.  Currently we are attempting to express these candidates in E.coli, yeast and tobacco BY2 cells, the goal being biochemical characterization of the expressed peroxidases.
