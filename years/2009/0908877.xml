<AbstractNarration>AST-0908877&lt;br/&gt;Gary Ferland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the continued development of the spectral synthesis code "Cloudy."  Cloudy is a widely used astrophysical modeling program used to simulate the microphysics of a non-equilibrium gas, determine its microscopic properties, and predict the resulting spectrum.  It is used to understand spectra from astronomical objects over the whole range from star forming clouds to the cores of active galaxies, with over a hundred scientific papers per year acknowledging its use.  Dr. Ferland has recently expanded the program to include states from fully molecular to fully ionized with comprehensive treatments of H2, H I, He I, other ions, and dust emission.  During this award, additional improvements will be implemented, including a database driven framework for atomic and molecular physics which will expand the number of species that can be modeled in the spectra, various infrastructure changes to permit parallel processing and new radiative transfer methods.  The code infrastructure changes are also the first steps in a longer-term effort to allow 3D simulations.  All of these improvements will greatly enhance the capabilities of this important software tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Ferland continues to involve junior researchers throughout this project, and this award helps to support a postdoctoral scholar, training in modeling plasmas and radiative transfer.  Talented scientists with such skills are critical to interpreting the increasingly detailed astronomical data coming from current and future ground- and space-based observatories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the central questions in astrophysics is how the supermassive black holes that are found in the centers of large galaxies affect their surrounds.  Very massive galaxies are usually found near the centers of large clusters of galaxies.  Most of the detectable mass in found in very hot gas, with temperatures of roughly ten million Kelvin, rather than in stars.  This hot gas is expected to cool and fall into the central galaxy, producing a "cooling flow", but the black hole appears able to prevent this collapse through a process that is not now understood.   Such "cool-core clusters of galaxies" have long (20 kilo parsec) narrow (less than roughly 70 parsecs) filaments that have extensive quantities of molecular gas, as shown as the first Figure in this report.  For comparison, our Milky Way galaxy is the size of one of the smaller faint blobs on this image.  The infrared molecular hydrogen emission lines produced by the emission are among the strongest observed anywhere.  How do these filaments form, what powers them, and how can fragile molecules be protected from the surrounding hot gas?  These are crucial questions because the filaments are believed to be part of the feedback process that couples energy from the central black hole to the surrounding intragalactic medium.   These cluster filaments have many properties in common with filaments in the Crab Nebula, a bright supernova that was observed to occur in the year 1054.  A picture of the Crab, emphasizing its filaments, is the second figure.  The material blown off in the explosion contains the molecules, dust, and chemical elements that make life on Earth possible.  Such supernovae were the original sources of the material that made planets possible in the young universe.  Like the cluster filaments, the Crab filaments have large quantities of molecules and are surrounded by very hot gas that should destroy them.  We have shown that penetrating particles produced by the hot intracluster medium can energize molecules in the cluster filaments without destroying them.  Magnetic fields play a dominant role in helping protect the molecules, and inhibit star formation.  Substantial amounts of uncounted molecular reservoirs must exist, making the cluster filaments an important part of the mass budget and cluster feedback process.  Our work on the Crab has shown that molecular hydrogen is found most often in blobs near the ends of the bright filaments.  Strong molecular hydrogen emission is associated with significant emission from many low ionization species in the optical.  The kinetic temperature in the molecular regions is very high, of order 3000 K.  All of these properties are also found in the cool core galaxy cluster filaments, showing that we do indeed have a nearby analogue of these extragalactic systems.  In the case of the Crab the synchrotron emission produced by the rapidly spinning pulsar in the center energizes the molecular emission.  Such investigations are only possible by understanding how matter emits the light we observe.  This is critical because astronomy is an observational rather than experimental science.  We have developed a large computer code, Cloudy, that simulates the filaments, including ionized, atomic, and molecular regions, with particular emphasis on fundamental atomic and molecular processes. I am working with graduate students, undergraduates, and postdocs to carry out this work.  They are being trained in the development of a large complex C++ code, learning atomic physics and radiative transport theory, and gaining skills in the interpretation of astronomical spectroscopy.  We use modern coding methods to insure reliability in the face of complexity. Computers are a new way to understand the Universe - we can compute anything we can imagine.  A person who can develop large codes is in a position to make broad contributions to astronomy and society.  We make Cloudy openly available to the astronomical community.
