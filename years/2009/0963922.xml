<AbstractNarration>Analysts in all areas of human knowledge, from science and engineering&lt;br/&gt;to economics, social science and journalism are drowning in data. The&lt;br/&gt;proliferation of digital information requires tools and techniques for&lt;br/&gt;exploring, analyzing and communicating data in a manner that scales as&lt;br/&gt;both the data and the organizations analyzing it grow in&lt;br/&gt;size. Throughout the data life-cycle, sensemaking is often a&lt;br/&gt;collaborative process. As different analysts each contribute to data&lt;br/&gt;acquisition, cleaning, analysis, and interpretation they contribute&lt;br/&gt;contextual knowledge that deepens understanding. Analysts may disagree&lt;br/&gt;on how to interpret data, but then work together to reach&lt;br/&gt;consensus. Many data sets are so large that thorough exploration by a&lt;br/&gt;single person is unlikely. In short, social cognition plays a critical&lt;br/&gt;role in the process of scalable data analysis. New analysis tools that&lt;br/&gt;address human cognitive characteristics, social interaction and data&lt;br/&gt;analytics in an integrated fashion can improve our ability to turn&lt;br/&gt;data into knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scalable data analysis requires social interaction and therefore&lt;br/&gt;social context must be embedded in data analysis tools. The goals of&lt;br/&gt;this project are (1) to understand how social interaction and social&lt;br/&gt;context can facilitate successful data analysis, (2) to develop models&lt;br/&gt;and tools for representing and annotating data transformations,&lt;br/&gt;visualizations, and social activity (e.g., textual and graphical&lt;br/&gt;annotations, discussions, links, tags), and (3) to design and test&lt;br/&gt;visual interfaces that leverage our tools to support collaborative&lt;br/&gt;analysis practices, including data entry, transformation,&lt;br/&gt;visualization, and interpretation. Central concerns include (a) a&lt;br/&gt;focus on enabling social interaction throughout the data life-cycle&lt;br/&gt;and (b) the use of scalable data transformation routines that can&lt;br/&gt;return results in a time frame concordant with interactive,&lt;br/&gt;exploratory data transformation and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on this project can be found at: &lt;br/&gt;http://vis.berkeley.edu/projects/scalable_social_data_analysis/</AbstractNarration>

As a result we must rethink how we design the tools and techniques for exploring, analyzing and communicating data in a manner that scales as both the data and the organizations analyzing it grow in size. Throughout the data lifecycle, sensemaking is often a collaborative process. As different analysts each contribute to data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, and interpretation they contribute contextual knowledge that deepens understanding. At times may disagree on how to interpret data, but then work together to reach consensus. Many data sets are so large that thorough exploration by a single person is unlikely. In short, social cognition plays a critical role in the process of scalable data analysis. We believe that new analysis tools that address human cognitive characteristics, social interaction and data analytics in an integrated fashion can improve our ability to turn data into knowledge.   The hypothesis of our project is that scalable data analysis requires social interaction and therefore social context must be embedded in data analysis tools. The goals of this research were (1) to understand how social interaction and an understanding of social context can facilitate successful data analysis, (2) to develop models and tools for representing and annotating data transformations, visualizations, and social activity (e.g., textual and graphical annotations, discussions, links, tags), and (3) to design and test visual inter- faces that leverage our tools to support collaborative analysis practices, including data entry, transformation, visualization, and interpretation.    Major outcomes of the work include  - Tools to facilitate data entry and data cleanup. These tools are now being commercialized by Captricity (data entry) and Trifacta (data cleanup) respectively.  - Investigation of how data anlysis is performed in the enterprise.  - A comment-based social data analysis system.  - Tools and techniques for crowdsourcing data analysis with microtask crowdworkers.  - Techniques for performing social analysis of patient-authored texts.  The publications, methodologies, tools and techniques we havedeveloped for this project are all publicly available at our websites:  http://vis.berkeley.edu http://idl.cs.washington.edu          Last Modified: 09/02/2014       Submitted by: Maneesh Agrawala]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
