<AbstractNarration>Seattle Children's Research Institute is awarded a grant to build a community-driven, high-throughput proteomics analysis environment called SPIRE (Systematic Protein Investigative Research Environment). SPIRE is designed to be modular, and will integrate the best publicly available methods and open community standards. The broad applicability of proteomics analyses in biology is hindered by low knowledge penetration throughout the community regarding how and why tools are used and which tools should be used when to produce statistically-sound results. The proliferation of piecemeal, single-use tools and the absence of comprehensive approaches places a high integration and management burden on researchers. A solution is to create an environment that emphasizes integration, modularity, flexibility, ease of use, and community involvement. The SPIRE modules will encompass each stage of mass spectrometry proteomics analyses, such as raw data uploads, experimental design, peptide and protein identification, protein expression measures, and analysis. SPIRE development will be tailored to, and driven by, the needs of the research community. SPIRE is a community science project for proteomics and, as a result, will drastically accelerate proteomics-based biological and environmental research and empower the community as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In conjunction with SPIRE, the team will create InSPIRE, a web-based proteomics resource for middle-school education. InSPIRE will provide resources, reviews, and reference materials related to protein science to "inspire" the next generation of researchers.  Additional information about SPIRE and InSPIRE will be available at www.proteinspire.org</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Proteins are the building blocks of living things, and although a lot is known about many of them, there is much more still to be discovered.  Further, proteins are just part of the complex set of molecules that work together in all of us.  Scientists around the world are working to understand these molecules through gathering data about DNA (genomics), RNA (transcriptomics), and proteins (proteomics) for humans and other organisms.  We aspire to know:  Which genes and proteins are identified, where (organism, tissue, condition, experiment) and when (developmental stage, time point) they are expressed. How much of each of these genes and proteins are expressed  How these genes and proteins interact and in what biological processes (pathways).    This project resulted in two new community resources for omics data, a meta-data checklist for omics data and an educational resource for school age children and the public about protein research  SPIRE (Systematic Proteomics Investigative Research Environment, www.proteinspire.org) integrates search tools and statistical models into a freely available web-based proteomics research pipeline. By implementing novel methods to identify proteins, SPIRE improves the researchersÆ ability to identify proteins in biological samples and provides a consistent method for combining results across experiments.

The resources created by this NSF funded project provide the scientific community, students and the public with the means to explore a wide variety of omics data and experiments. This will enable them to make data-driven biological discoveries and better understand complex biological systems.
