<AbstractNarration>The Fort Berthold Community College proposes the Doka Hóg Wahoo (Where do we come from): STEM Research and Instructional Improvement at FBCC. The four goals of the Project are: 1. To provide a baccalaureate STEM degree by developing and offering a B.S. degree in Environmental Science that incorporates culturally relevant environmental concepts and utilizes constructivist methods; 2. To enhance recruitment and retention of students in STEM disciplines including Environmental Science by using proven cohort strategies and teaching methods based in constructivism, provide dual credit opportunities in environmental science for high school students, and provide teacher professional development to promote STEM interest among elementary and high school students; 3. To expand research opportunities for students in STEM degree programs to include environmental internships designed to stimulate students to enter the STEM workforce or enter STEM graduate programs in Environmental Science; 4. To engage STEM students in examining environmental issues impacting the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation and actively participate in community-wide symposiums examining these issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College (NHSC) is located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in Northwest North Dakota, home of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation.  The Doka Hog Wahoo (Where Do We Come From): STEM Research and Instructional Improvement at FBCC grant was awarded in August 12, 2009.  After several extensions, NHSC is proud to report the following objectives having been met during the grant period:  Establishment and institutionalization of a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science Degree:  The degree was launched during the first two years of the grant and is now funded 100% on its own through the college?s general fund.  It contains culturally relevant course material and puts focus on local environmental impacts. The graduation of five Environmental Science cohorts: Each cohort worked together performing research, holding community symposia on environmental issues, and creating a family support system which resulted in a 65% completion rate for our BS students.   The expansion of research opportunities for NHSC?s Environmental Science students:  Because of the addition of the BS degree in Environmental Science and a shifted focus on research, students were able to complete comprehensive research projects from literature review to analysis of final data, aggregation into a final poster, and presentation of the research at a local or national research conference. Examination of Fort Berthold environmental issues: Cohort students developed and held symposia at all six segments on environmental issues related to Fort Berthold.  The students did all of the planning and execution of each symposium, including oral presentations, demonstrations, and exhibiting their research.
