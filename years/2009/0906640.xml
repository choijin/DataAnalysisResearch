<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The amorphous solid phase is, in principle, endemic to all liquids despite a propensity for some liquids to crystallize when cooled. However, the manner in which a liquid thickens in advance of solidification is vastly different among different materials. Past research has demonstrated a clear link between the dynamics of a supercooled, glass-forming liquid and its chemical structure and thermodynamic properties referred to as "fragility". In this project, dynamic light scattering, Raman spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry are being applied to probe how liquid dynamics are directly affected by simple structural changes created in network-forming systems. The results will form a precise test of a proposed thermodynamic model (Bond Model) presently available. Work will be carried out both by graduate (MS) and undergraduate students providing hands-on research experience to augment their science education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology thrives on exploiting the novel properties of materials. Among these, glassy materials possess unique mechanical, optical and electrical properties of importance for many state-of-the-art devices. However, for their potential to be realized, glassy materials must be solidified from the liquid state without crystallization occurring. This then requires an understanding of the liquid-to-glass transition and in particular an understanding of how chemical structure of the liquid affects the thickening process itself. In this project, visible light scattered by a glass-forming liquid is used to monitor this thickening process on a microscopic level. A series of glass-forming liquids are to be investigated in which the chemical structure can be systematically altered by either increasing or decreasing the average number of chemical bonds present in the liquid. With each modification of the structure, the corresponding changes in dynamical properties of the liquid will be assessed to test predictions of a simple model based upon the average number of bonds present. Graduate (MS) and undergraduate students will conduct this research as means of training the next generation of professional scientists.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Anyone that has watched an artisan glassblower working can attest to the rather delicate balance between flow and solidity that must be maintained to work a glass object into a desired shape.&nbsp; Moreover, this delicate balance is integral to larger scale manufacturing of glass products and is one of the reasons for efforts to be able to predict the properties of the glassy melt based on details of its chemistry and atomic bond structure alone.&nbsp;

Chemistry can be used to either increase or decrease the density of these bonds between atoms with corresponding changes in the fragility of the melt.&nbsp; In our light scattering studies of sodium phosphate glasses, we observed the fragility to increase as sodium was added due to its tendency to reduce the connectedness of the network (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>).&nbsp; Interestingly, our trend matched a previous result for, non-oxide, chalcogenide network-forming glasses only with a surprising twist: the connectivity of the phosphates only matched if we viewed its network as constructed of tetrahedral "balls" linked together by bridging oxygen "sticks" instead of interconnected atoms (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>) .&nbsp;
