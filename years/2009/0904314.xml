<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative research project combining the expertise of Ashish Goel, Stanford University (IIS-0904325) and Sanjeev Khanna, University of Pennsylvania (IIS-0904314). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, content has been generated by a limited number of publishers (such as book houses, music companies, and newspapers), and its quality then evaluated by professional editors and reviewers. In recent years, however, individuals have become mass producers of content, generating images, blogs, opinions, and recommendations, in a decentralized manner. This content is then discovered and consumed by other users, and centralized review is rendered infeasible by the sheer magnitude of available content. Consequently, there is a need to utilize user feedback, both explicit and implicit, in order to provide optimum rankings and recommendations to Internet users. The same broad problem occurs in online advertising, automatic moderation of discussion boards, and automated deductions of user preference on social networks. In addition to being very large, user activity data on the Internet is also typically very sparse, since each user only performs a small share of possible actions (e.g., searches for a small fraction of keywords, reviews or purchases a small fraction of products). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to design algorithms and optimization techniques to effectively utilize such data. The sparse data is treated as a "prior belief" on user preferences. The project also aims to design economic incentives to obtain useful and corrective data, robust to manipulation. The two parts of this research interact strongly with each other, since the algorithmic component can identify valuable pieces of additional information to acquire. Together, these two parts can help users derive optimum value from Internet data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this project will improve search engine performance and facilitate web applications that employ user feedback. The project Web site (http://www.stanford.edu/~ashishg/sparse_opt.html) will be used to disseminate results. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Overview: The focus of this project was the design of algorithms, incentives, and optimization techniques for network and social data. In recent years, individuals have become mass producers of content, generating articles, blogs, opinions, reviews, and recommendations, in a decentralized manner. This content is then discovered and consumed by other users, and any centralized review is rendered infeasible by the sheer magnitude of the available content. Our goal was to design algorithms and optimization techniques to optimally utilize such data. We also designed economic incentives to obtain useful and rich data, robust to manipulation. In addition to theoretical advances, we have also had significant societal and industry impact. This project was funded by collaborative NSF grants 0904314 (University of Pennsylvania) and 0904325 (Stanford University).   Key Results: We list below some key research findings: (a) We developed the theory of credit networks, a decentralized currency suited for peer-to-peer and exchange economies.  (b) We developed algorithms for fast computation of recommendations and reputations in social networks.  (c ) We studied opinion formation processes that could lead to societal polarization, and developed algorithms to facilitate large scale consensus.  (d) We made significant advances in the theory of privacy as it applies to web search logs and social network advertising. (e) We developed a small space algorithm for estimating the size of the largest matching when the network is revealed in a streaming fashion. (f) We developed a near-optimal algorithm for solving the bipartite matching problem in regular graphs, strongly improving a long-standing bound. (g) We discovered an information-theoretic justification for ambiguity in human language, namely, it helps in compression. (h ) We showed that the influence maximization in symmetric networks can be better approximated than in asymmetric networks. (i) We showed how the structure of social networks can facilitate high precision information transmission.    Broad Impact: Several pieces of research funded by this project had impact on industry, including the design of TwitterÆs recommendation and advertising systems and QuoraÆs incentive scheme. Our work helped understand and improve FacebookÆs privacy settings for advertising (http://nyti.ms/1aYx3d4). Our techniques helped design a crowd-sourced public policy experiment in Finland (http://bit.ly/1cklNaw) and a scheme for collaborative budgeting (http://on.wsj.com/n58wMe). The PIs also gave several short courses to high-school students that help students discover the broad applicability and the power of algorithmic thinking in computer science and other disciplines.
