<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project explores materials science of high indium content InGaN and InN semiconductors for high-efficiency solar cells and thermoelectric applications. Fundamental studies of metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth of InN and high In-content InGaN (with In&gt;50%) alloys on sapphire and silicon (111) substrates will be conducted. The investigations include the use of alternative precursor (Dimethyl-hydrazine), pulsed MOCVD, InN-GaN superlattices along with various types of characterization to evaluate the potential for solar cell and thermoelectric applications, and to further basic understanding of the doping mechanism for p-InN and p-InGaN semiconductors.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: This project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. High-efficiency solar photovoltaic cells have broad potential impact on economy and human life through more efficient electrical energy generation. Thermoelectric materials provide important solutions for device cooling and heat recycling and for electrical power generation. The project allows graduate and undergraduate students to be trained in a multidisciplinary research environment, encompassing the physics of semiconductor, optoelectronics materials and devices, materials science and MOCVD epitaxy, physics of semiconductor nanostructures, and semiconductor device design and fabrication. Graduate students also serve as mentors for undergraduate students conducting independent studies in the PI's lab. Outreach activities focusing on grade 5th - 9th female and underrepresented minority students are included to raise their interest in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The NSF program focuses on the material physics, material epitaxy, and applied physics of In-containing III-Nitride material systems covering from both InGaN up to InN, and AlInN up to InN material systems. The development of new methods of epitaxy and characterizations of these new material systems for energy applications were performed. The energy applications include thermoelectricity, solar cells, and solid state lighting. In this program, the identifications of new growth method by using pulsed MOVPE for enabling the growth of InN material system was accomplished, and the growths of AlInN for thermoelectricity applications in III-Nitride systems were carried out. The finding of record Z*T value (thermoelectric figure of merits) for ternary AlInN represents an important advance in the fields of nitride-based thermoelectricity. The implementation of both high In-content InGaN and AlInN were shown to have significant impacts for solid state lighting device technologies. The development of numerical models and thermoelectric characterization methods for III-Nitride and III-V semiconductors were also completed.
