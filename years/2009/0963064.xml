<AbstractNarration>There is increasing evidence that iron is important not only in the regulation of bulk phytoplankton production in large regions of the world oceans, but that it also profoundly influences the speciation of algae within the phytoplankton assemblage. The broad implications resulting from these dual effects range from impacts on the global carbon cycle to the possible stimulation of harmful algal blooms. There is a strong need for ultra-sensitive, real-time monitoring and detection technologies that capture the reactive iron pool in seawater that is available to eukaryotic phytoplankton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI?s request funding to ?biocalibrate? the reactive iron fraction to gain a measure of iron availability to marine eukaryotic phytoplankton. The PI?s will combine Time Resolved Fluorescence (TRF) and Fluorescence Resonate Energy Transfer (FRET) to develop an ultra-sensitive photoactive nanodevice that uses the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFB) as the iron-selective sensor interface, lanthanide fluorescence to report the presence of iron in this receptor, and Q-dot nanocrystals to greatly amplify this signal to achieve the picomolar level sensitivity needed to study both coastal and offshore ocean waters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sensor will be calibrated with a range of nearshore and offshore species of cyanobacteria, diatoms and dinoflagellates, and the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi; phytoplankton important in the regulation of carbon export from surface to the deep ocean. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a photoactive nanosensor that allows real-time in situ measurements that reflect phytoplankton growth rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of new generation of sensor to measure labile iron in-situ will greatly advance our knowledge of iron biogeochemistry. In addition, due to extremely short response time, this sensor will provide a unique opportunity to measure iron kinetics, cycling which is one of the biggest challenge in this research area, believe to be critical to control iron bioavailability to phytoplankton. Therefore this project will certainly lead to the burgeoning of this research area, potentially leading to new findings. In addition to supporting graduate students and undergrads, this proposal involves middle school teachers. Orcutt has obviously established productive relationships with local educators, and the letters from these teachers outlining their enthusiasm for continuing the relationship gives confidence that the proposed work will lead to an effective educational outcome. The potential for involvement of minority students at Southern Miss. is also significant. The proposed work also has the benefit of ?fertilizing? the field of oceanography with advances in other sciences (chemistry, materials).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientific Merit:  The major nutrients of nitrogen, phosphorus and silicate are vital for phytoplankton growth; however, iron is also a key requirement too.  Large areas of the oceans have dissolved iron concentrations that limit total phytoplankton production, and in other areas iron concentrations are low enough that ecosystem structure is likely affected.  Yet we still lack a means to measure iron in seawater without the complicated laboratory-scale analyses and, in particular, being able to parse what fraction of this dissolved iron can be readily utilized by phytoplankton. We have employed the first use of polymeric materials, over single molecule chemistries, for the detection of dissolved iron, and thus have made a significant step forward towards developing a "sensor technology" for iron.  Much of the project revolved around the new challenges with working with these new materials, for example controlling the matrix size and rendering it more water soluble.  During this project period we have developed a "tool boxÆ of molecular fluorometric probes that fluoresce upon coordination with iron,  the group has successfully incorporated these probes into polymeric matrices favorable for use in sensor surfaces, and have shown them to be selective for iron against aluminum; a common interferent in this class of molecules. This project identified some of the developmental boundaries for creating iron sensors that may be useful for quantifying iron limitation of phytoplankton communities.  We are optimistic that these advances will provide a pathway for the future development of iron sensor interfaces suitable for use on moorings and other autonomous sensor platforms.  Broader Impacts:  One of the goals of this project was to advance critical thinking skills by using concept mapping in the classroom. Orcutt developed a new graduate seminar class called "Approaches to Biogeochemistry", a lecture and student discussion-oriented course that combines topics about the philosophy behind how we approach science and the fundamentals of biogeochemistry. One of the projects in this course was centered on the use of the Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence &ndash; Ocean Science (COSEE-OS) CLIMB interactive software (http://cosee.umaine.edu/climb/index.cfm) website to build concept maps on marine science topics related to biogeochemical cycles.

The webinar was broadcasted nationally and received very high ratings from the general public, students, and other teachers.  An additional goal of the project was to integrate research activities into the teaching of science at the K-12 levels. Orcutt worked with two eighth grade teachers in Mississippi and Louisiana to develop lesson plans on climate change, the nitrogen cycle and ocean circulation. The teachers were paid participants on this NSF funded project. One teacher was at Gulfport Central Middle School, MS and the other was at Lake Charles High School, LA. Two video microscopes were purchased for these two schools and allowed the students to visualize phytoplankton in the classroom.
