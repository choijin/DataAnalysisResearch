    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the viability of a new III-V nitride semiconductor alloy and bipolar transistor structure with the potential to enable ultra low power device operation in applications requiring both RF and digital electronics. Increasing power efficiency has been a major issue for portable and high performance electronic devices and the use of specially designed thin-film device structures on silicon or GaAs substrates can make a huge impact in applications ranging from microprocessors to wireless electronics. This proposal will develop and commercialize ultra low power nitrogen-based semiconductor transistors that will have a large impact on power consumption in the realm of high-performance personal communication electronics. The ultra-low voltage transistors offer an exciting opportunity to achieve ultra low power electronic device operation. Thus, the proposed device embodiment has enormous potential for applications in next generation portable and wireless technology requiring high performance while minimizing power consumption. This program will begin with device design, material synthesis and materials testing and end with proof-of-principle p-n junctions and transistor action demonstrations of our device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will allow a new generation of transistors which have advantages over existing silicon-based and GaAs-based devices with regard to reduced power consumption ? thus this new transistor embodiment could impact the entire electronics industry. The potential societal and most importantly the commercial impact of the project will allow the development of the next generation portable, wireless, mobile internet and assistive technology devices to become ever more functional since they will require significantly lower turn-on voltages so as to minimize power consumption while sustaining operation over longer periods of time. The market sector would include the chip manufacturers, aging population, mobile electronics users, the military, and portable electronic manufactures that require reduced power consumption amplifiers. This low voltage transistor innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding of the basic material physics of ultra small energy bandgap materials which can be used in many other applications as long wavelength detectors and lasers.</AbstractNarration>
