<AbstractNarration>A fundamental but challenging issue in information security is secure sharing and management of sensitive data and information among numerous organizations that form large-scale e-enterprises. Today, an increasing number of enterprises are using the Internet for managing and sharing users? and enterprise information through online databases. However, security and privacy of data is an overriding concern currently limiting the proliferation of information technology. Among others, the two key security issues are; (a) interoperability challenge of diverse security policies exercised by collaborating organizations for sharing sensitive information and; (b) using collaborative knowledge for detecting and responding to any emerging security or emergency threats. The objective of this project to develop a scalable multi-domain information security framework which: (a) facilitates large-scale integration, mining, and analysis of multimedia data residing in multiple domains for identifying sensitive information that require controlled dissemination (b) allows distributed real-time content analysis of multimedia data streams across multiple-domains for correlating detectable events, (c)l provides integration and evolution of inter-domain access control policies for distributed multimedia applications, and (d) ensures protection of user?s information.  The project uses several innovative approaches to meet these objectives. First, novel real-time data mining and stream-correlation methods is used for extracting useful content and detecting events embedded in data streams by using multiple sliding window operators. Second, an efficient privacy/security based multimedia data clustering mechanism allows a prevailing security policy to be adaptable to the changing context and the datasets. The uniqueness of this approach is the adaptive nature of security policies. In addition, a novel XML-based integrated mechanism is used for encoding of multimedia data in conjunction with multi-domain security policies for ensuring technical viability and portability of the system.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is expected to have direct and long-term impact on developing secure information infrastructures, such as e-commerce, digital libraries, and healthcare systems, which are projected to have an important role at a global scale for the next several decades. The research results can help in alleviating the heavy financial risks associated with information and system security and in general, meeting the national information infrastructure security needs and threat management.  The research will be pursued in collaboration with Cyber Center, the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS) and PURVAC facilities at Purdue University with which the PI?s have strong affiliation and on-going collaboration. Results and tools developed will be made available over the Web to research community. In The team has a track record of providing their research results and tools to various research communities in the areas of multimedia databases and information security management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at the&lt;br/&gt;URL: http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~dmultlab/  &lt;http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/%7Edmultlab/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With the rise of elaborate supply chains and the growing need toward collaboration among companies, organizations that have invested heavily in their security infrastructures are now being asked to open them up. Yet, they also need to keep sensitive operations secure from competitors and malicious hackers. Security and privacy of data is an overriding concern for on-line collaboration. This project supported the development of a comprehensive framework to address two key security and privacy challenges that arise among several collaborating organizations in terms of : (a) interoperability challenge of diverse security policies exercised by collaborating organizations for sharing sensitive information and; (b) using collaborative knowledge for detecting any security threats.&nbsp;The contributions that led to the development of this framework can be broadly categorized in the following activities.&nbsp;</p> <p>1. A mechanism for secure information sharing among multiple organizations has been developed. The mechanism depends on the nature of the collaborative environment, which can be broadly categorized as federated, loosely-coupled and ad-hoc (Figure 1). Federated collaboration is characterized by a high degree of mutual dependence and trust among the collaborating organizations and is used to support long-term interoperation. It requires a global meta-policy, which needs to be consistent with the local policies. In a loosely-coupled environment, interactions among organizations are governed by the local policies. This collaboration is more flexible and autonomous in terms of maintaining local policies. In ad-hoc collaboration, an organization may be aware of only a few other organizations to which direct sharing can be carried out. &nbsp;Since apriori knowledge about any information access by an application may not be available at the start of a session, an organization may deny access.&nbsp;These collaborations are evaluated using several metrics including: degree of interoperation which indicates the level of information sharing among organizations; autonomy which refers to the ability of an organization to perform its local operations without any interference from external accesses; degree of privacy which specifies the extent of information an organization discloses about its internal policies; and complexity associated with verifying the correctness of multi-policy constraints. The tradeoffs between collaboration types and the aforementioned metrics are depicted in Figure 1.</p> <p>2. An integrated privacy-aware RBAC mechanism for various types of datasets, including relational databases, streaming data, and graph databases, has been developed (Figure 2). &nbsp;Graph datasets are emerging in numerous applications such as social networks, semantic Webs, and biological networks. Authorization and privacy of these databases pose several challenges. For these datasets, access implies satisfying authorized rules based on relational, sliding-window, and graph-based queries. &nbsp;In addition, we have developed an XML-based policy specification framework to capture generic privacy requirements. A prototype, called Intelligent Privacy Manager (iPM), for sharing and collaboration of personal information (e.g. Personal Health Records (PHR)) in a secure and private manner, has been developed (Figure 3). iPM is a user-centered system that intelligently guides a user to synthesize a consistent privacy-aware RBAC policy for sharing information with other users.&nbsp;</p> <p>3. A mechanism for analyzing real-time data streams and detecting events for various applications including epidemiological surveillance for monitoring multiple outbreaks and Cyber-based systems (CBS) for detecting multiple network attacks has been developed. The mechanism uses a statistical approach using Hidden Markov Model (HMM).&nbsp;</p> <p>4. With the growing use of large datasets, particularly, in security and surveillance applications, achieving high query throughput has become a challenge. &nbsp;Maintaining steady query output is essential for applications that require continuous monitoring or real-time response. For this purpose, we have developed a scalable and massively parallel data stream system (M3) for processing large number of moving objects that continuously generate spatio-temporal data streams. M3 uses Hadoop MapReduce framework for processing continuous queries over streams of data.</p> <p>5. We have developed a secure infrastructure for collaborative services, such as Cloud computing datacenters (CCD). Due to its unique multi-tenancy and virtual resource environment, CCD poses several security challenges. In particular, we have proposed a distributed access control architecture and virtual resource management mechanism for CCD.</p> <p>In addition to aforementioned results, project the following broader contributions to science, technology, and society have been made:</p> <p>1. The formalisms developed in this research can be of significant value to other disciplines of science and technology, such as knowledge engineering, systems modeling, privacy management, and secure collaborative technology.</p> <p>2. The proposed research is expected to have a direct and long-term impact on developing secure information infrastructures, and in general, meeting the information security and privacy needs for our society&nbsp;both in public and private sectors. &nbsp;The project can provide a pragmatic approach to addressing the growing security needs of newly emerging Cyber infrastructures, such as cloud computing, e-commerce, digital libraries, healthcare systems, intelligent transportation systems, which are projected to have important societal and economical roles at a global scale for the next several decades.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/09/2018<br>      Modified by: Arif&nbsp;Ghafoor</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0964639/0964639_10015452_1533854838165_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0964639/0964639_10015452_1533854838165_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Multi-Organizational Security-Driven Collaborative Environments"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0964639/0964639_10015452_1533854838165_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Multi-Organizational Security-Driven Collaborative Environments"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: Multi-Organizational Security-Driven Collaborative Environments</div> <div class="imageCredit">AG</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Arif&nbsp;Ghafoor</div> <div class="imageTitle">Multi-Organizational Security-Driven Collaborative Environments</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0964639/0964639_10015452_1533854922687_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0964639/0964639_10015452_1533854922687_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2: Integrated Privacy-aware RBAC Mechanism"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0964639/0964639_10015452_1533854922687_Slide2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Integrated Privacy-aware RBAC Mechanism"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2: Integrated Privacy-aware RBAC Mechanism</div> <div class="imageCredit">AG</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Arif&nbsp;Ghafoor</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2: Integrated Privacy-aware RBAC Mechanism</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0964639/0964639_10015452_1533855016898_Slide3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0964639/0964639_10015452_1533855016898_Slide3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3: (a) iPM Tool   (b) Functional Architecture of iPM"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0964639/0964639_10015452_1533855016898_Slide3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3: (a) iPM Tool   (b) Functional Architecture of iPM"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3: (a) iPM Tool   (b) Functional Architecture of iPM</div> <div class="imageCredit">AG</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Arif&nbsp;Ghafoor</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3: (a) iPM Tool   (b) Functional Architecture of iPM</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
