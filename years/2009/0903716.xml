<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>American Indian people continue to be greatly underrepresented in the secondary STEM teaching workforce in the United States. To address this shortage, the <em>Developing American Indian Secondary Teachers</em> project at Salish Kootenai College established the Bachelor of Science in Secondary Science Education degree (BSSE). Combining a cohort model, rigorous STEM and education coursework, field experiences in tribal communities, science research internships, and clinical experiences in schools with high Native student enrollment, the BSSE prepares high quality Native teachers competent in supporting students? success in diverse settings. Secondary education faculty members collaborate with STEM faculty to deliver a program that support BSSE students? grasp of the nature of science, as well as development of deep science content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. Ongoing evaluation of the program over its six-year life has led to degree modifications to optimize its effectiveness. BSSE teacher candidates study a slate of topics to develop well rounded teacher candidates, including evidence-based pedagogies, contemporary social issues in STEM education, strategies for literacy development, and the effective use of instructional technologies. Early, frequent and varied clinical experiences allow teacher candidates to broaden their perspectives of teaching and hone their instructional skills under the tutelage of Master Teachers in local schools. While also serving non-Native students, the degree draws students from Native communities across the United States fostering a richly diverse set of perspectives within the program. The BSSE was fully accredited by the State of Montana in 2014 and has been recognized nationally for its excellence. To date, ten students have graduated from the program, with another three slated to complete the degree in Spring 2019. BSSE graduates are consistently inundated with job offers each year and nearly all are teaching in high-needs rural schools with majority Native student populations. Graduates regularly present their successful strategies for working with Native students at professional conferences and have been recognized for their excellence in working with Native students.
