<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This award is for the acquisition of laser systems and an atomic force microscope to pursue novel work in the engineering and characterization of interfaces.  Each of the three investigators brings a unique knowledge base and experience, and the equipment will allow special collaborative opportunities to develop.  The research that will be performed with these tools includes laser deposition of polymer films, the characterization of fungal-plant interfaces, and liquid crystal diffraction grating research. While the pairing of two physicists and a biologist may seem unusual, it is precisely this type of interaction that will allow for the advancement of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries.  An example of this work is the nanomechanical characterization of the plant-fungi interface and the subsequent capture and interrogation of the vapors emitted by competing species of fungi.  It would not be likely that we could pursue this research as individual investigators and the equipment will allow us to thoroughly capitalize on our mutual interests.  Other research that will be pursued involves the deposition and characterization of liquid crystal nanocomposite films and the resonant desorption of analyte compounds to facilitate the detection of explosives and other chemicals of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the award begin with the fact that it is intrinsically multidisciplinary (as noted above) and therefore affords the participation by a wide group of students drawn from each of the three science departments.  Rutgers-Camden is located adjacent to Philadelphia in the city of Camden, NJ.  It draws a very diverse pool of students from an area that has been historically recognized as one of the most troubled cities in America (Camden).  However, Camden borders on Moorestown and Cherry Hill, which are nationally known as some of the best suburban towns to live in.  Since most of our students come from the surrounding counties, the student body greatly resembles the populace.  As part of Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey, we have institutional resources that are greater than most schools of our size, yet the distinct character of this campus is rooted in and informed by a commitment to undergraduate education with an emphasis on student participation in research.  The acquisition of this equipment will greatly enhance both education and practical training through laboratory curricula and advanced research projects.  Finally, each of the investigators will forge&lt;br/&gt;new directions in their respective research programs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant enabled three groups of researchers to collaboratively pursue projects in materials science, soft condensed matter physics, and biology.  The grant provided funds for the purchase of a tunable infrared laser system and an atomic force microscope.  The tunable infrared laser system was used for research projects such as the deposition of organic thin films, the synthesis of nanoparticles, and the creation of organic-inorganic nanocomposites.  The nanoparticles and thin films created in this work played a key role in research projects on the optical properties of the thin films and the bactericidal properties of nanocomposites.  In addition, we explored ways in which nanoparticles of different sizes may be created.  The atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to characterize thin film topography and structure.  A typical application of AFM is to determine the surface roughness and characteristics of thin films, and these types of measurements are the most commonly performed.    However, there are many other ways in which the AFM was utilized.  A technique known as piezoforce microscopy was performed on an organic ferroelectric material. Surface potential measurements were performed on nanocomposites of silver and polymer that were found to actively retard the growth of S. Aureus.  One unique application of AFM involved the investigation of fungal hyphae (branching tubes) that are grown on surfaces such as cellophane.  Ultimately, the goal is to investigate the ways in which fungi utilize resources from the surfaces that support them .  To that end, force map measurements were performed on surfaces that allow us to create an image of how and where the leaf (or other substrate) is being digested.   Finally, the AFM was used in order to image liquid crystal nanocomposites in order to determine their structure on a microscopic scale.  Liquid crystals have many important applications, but the most well known one is in display applications.  Here, our research showed that addition of nanoparticles decreased the switching time and other characteristics that are essential for creating quality displays.  The research projects that were enabled by this grant afford the participation of scientists from a wide variety of fields.  Researchers from six faculty members' groups, including two graduate students and ten undergraduates who received advanced training on this equipment.  The presence of the equipment actively fosters collaboration and has led to further funding applications and research projects.  We are genuinely grateful to the NSF for this support.
