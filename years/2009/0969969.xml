<AbstractNarration>Quantum information processing (QIP) harbors vast potential scientific and technological payoff, in the form of algorithms which are fundamentally more powerful than their classical counterparts. One of the most promising ways of achieving QIP involves adiabatic processes, wherein a system is slowly tuned from an initial lowest-energy input state to a final output lowest-energy state which contains the answer to a computationally difficult problem. This approach is known as adiabatic quantum computation (AQC). The rate limiting step for AQC is passage through a regime where the energy gap to the nearest excited state is smallest. In the limit of large system sizes this passage is usually accompanied by a quantum phase transition (QPT). AQC can be understood as a flow on the manifold of control parameters used to tune the system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop new differential geometry and variational calculus tools for an analysis and unification of AQC and QPT. For AQC this will be done by using two complementary approaches. On the one hand, it is natural to view AQC as a time-optimal control problem, wherein one attempts to minimize the time it takes to tune the system subject to the constraint of adiabaticity. This leads to the formulation of AQC as a variational optimization problem. On the other hand, optimal AQC can be seen as a geodesic on a manifold equipped with an adiabatic metric tensor. This project aims to place these two approaches on a rigorous footing, and to show their equivalence. The investigators will find new optimal AQC algorithms, by solving the corresponding Euler-Lagrange and geodesic equations. For QPTs, this project aims to develop a powerful new differential geometric approach based on the concept of operator fidelity susceptibility (OFS), which is also a metric, namely a pull-back of the metric on the projective quantum space onto the control parameter manifold. The OFS detects the change in fidelity between operators for a quantum system in a state that is evolving over time as control parameters are varied. This approach can be directly applied to the problem of QPTs that arise as an AQC algorithm is taken through a critical region. In this manner the investigators hope to unify the description of AQC and QPTs using differential geometric methods, and shed new light on both.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The introduction of differential geometry into the analysis of AQC is likely to generate new insights for the larger quantum information science community, as well as bring mathematicians closer to the plethora of fascinating problems that have arisen in the field of quantum computation. The unification of AQC and QPTs via differential geometry will also benefit mathematical physicists working on problems involving strongly correlated systems in condensed matter physics. The work provides a significant training and educational opportunity to the graduate student and postdoc involved. The graduate student, postdoc, and principal investigators will participate in institute-wide programs to increase the role of underrepresented minorities in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this Mathematical Physics project we aimed at exploiting ideas and tools borrowed from (differential)geometry and topology in the field of quantum information processing (QIP).  The funding from NSF allowed us to explore a wide variety of research lines related to the overall project goal stated above. The project has been very succesfull its many findings  have been reported in a large number of publications. Here below I will just sketch just a few of the Project's main findings in view of their potential interest for the general public     1-  We proposed an adiabatic quantum algorithm for generating a quantum pure state encoding of the PageRank vector, the most widely used tool in ranking the relative importance of internet pages. Extensive numerical simulations provided evidence that this algorithm can prepare the quantum PageRank state in a time which, on average, scales polylogarithmically in the number of webpages. We argued that the main topological feature of the underlying web graph (see Fig) allowing for such a scaling is the out-degree distribution.      2- We developed a  general framework for analyzing the recently discovered phase transitions in the steady state of dissipation-driven open quantum systems. In order to do so we extend the so-called fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions to open systems whose steady state is a Gaussian Fermionic state. We endowed the manifold of correlations matrices of steady-states with a metric tensor g measuring the distinguishability distance between solutions corresponding to different set of control parameters. The phase diagram can be then mapped out in terms of the scaling-behavior of g (see figure) and connections with the Liouvillean gap and the model correlation functions unveiled . The fidelity approach, thanks to its differential-geometric and information-theoretic nature, provides novel insights on dissipative quantum critical phenomena as well as a general and powerful strategy to explore them.     3- Quantum information processing requires a high degree of isolation from the detrimental effects of the environment as well as an extremely precise level of control on the way quantum dynamics unfolds in the information-processing system. We have shown how these two goals can be ideally achieved by hybridizing the concepts of noiseless subsystems and of holonomic quantum computation. An all-geometric universal computation scheme based on non-adiabatic and non-Abelian quantum holonomies embedded in a four-qubit noiseless subsystem for general collective decoherence has been proposed.      4- Extracting useful information from large data sets can be a daunting task. Topological methods for analyzing data sets provide a powerful technique for extracting such information. Persistent homology is a sophisticated tool for identifying such topological features -- connected components, holes, or voids -- and for determining how such features persist as the data is viewed at different scales. We designed quantum algorithms for calculating Betti numbers in persistent homology, and for finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the combinatorial Laplacian. The algorithms feature an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for topological data analysis.
