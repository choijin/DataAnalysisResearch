<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to elucidate the mechanisms of viscous energy dissipation on superhydrophobic surfaces and to enable robust operation of micro and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) in water through surface engineering. MEMS and NEMS are miniaturized mechanical devices, which are fabricated using semiconductor processes and are suitable for numerous technological applications, including ultrasensitive bio-sensing. The research approach is to shrink the solid-water interface area of MEMS and NEMS by engineering these devices with superhydrophobic surfaces.  The research will combine theoretical and numerical work with experiments.  Superhydrophobic MEMS and NEMS will be fabricated based on the numerical and theoretical surface designs; the devices will be tested in water to assess the designs. The main device parameter to be optimized is the quality (Q) factor, which quantifies the viscous dissipation in water. The deliverables are scalable superhydrophobic materials and coatings for nanoscale device applications, high-performance MEMS and NEMS devices in water and a fundamental physical understanding of solid-liquid-gas interfaces under high-frequency oscillations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will provide an enabling technology for MEMS and NEMS devices in water. Operation of MEMS and NEMS in water-based biochemical solutions is crucial for future mass and force sensing applications. MEMS and NEMS sensor elements can provide powerful new approaches to bio-threat detection, drug screening, and medical diagnostics in liquids. In scanning probe microscopy (SPM), force sensitivity of the microcantilever probe can be improved in liquids by the results of this research. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in a wide cross-section of engineering and physics including nanoscale surface engineering, nanometrology, and fluid dynamics through classroom instruction and participation in research. Outreach activities co-sponsored by Boston University will be used as a platform to engage K-12 students and disseminate the results of the research broadly.</AbstractNarration>
