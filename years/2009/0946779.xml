<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professors David F. Wiemer, James B. Gloer and Lynn Teesch from the University of Iowa will acquire a high resolution gas-chromatograph time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC-TOF-MS) capable of carrying out experiments with electron ionization (EI) and chemical ionization (CI) sources. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) isolation and structure determination of bioactive natural products from fungi; 2) studies of manganese-mediated coupling reactions for the synthesis of natural products; 3) studies of Pd(II)- and Ni(II)-catalyzed synthesis of aminoglycosides and other biologically active carbohydrates; 4) studies of dearomatization approaches to the synthesis of carboxylic and heterocyclic natural products; and 5) characterization of synthetic terpenoid phosphonates and schweinfurthin analogues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GC-TOF-mass spectrometry is an important technique for obtaining accurate molecular weights on large molecules, with high sensitivity. Use of a GC-TOF mass spectrometer with easily exchanged ionization sources is a standard technique for the study of chemical reactions. The instrument is capable of using volatile or semi-volatile samples that can be introduced through the gas chromatograph. An autosampler will accommodate multiple sample experiments. Solid samples will be introduced either on the heated direct insertion probe or on the direct chemical ionization probe. This research will have a significant impact in a number of areas, especially chemistry, natural products and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF CRIF: MU award was used to purchase a Waters GCT Premier time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer interfaced with a gas chromatograph (GC). The instrument installation was completed in January 2011.  The GCT is housed in the Chemistry Building within the University of Iowa High Resolution Mass Spectrometry Facility (HRMSF).  The HRMSF is a central research support facility funded by the Office of Vice-President for Research and Economic Development and its instrumentation is available to researchers across campus.  The acquisition of the GCT mass spectrometer has enabled the provision of new services to our users, most of whom are researchers in the Department of Chemistry. It is being used to foster improvements in research productivity, as well as opportunities for training graduate students and postdoctorals in hands-on mass spectrometry methods.  During the three year period of this grant, over half of the users that requested training in the "hands-on" operation of the GCT have been female graduate students.  Thus, it has assisted the Department's move towards its goals of broadening participation.  Applications to date have mainly included characterization of compounds generated by a variety of organic and inorganic synthesis methodologies, structure determination of new natural products, and identification of trace environmental contaminants.  These studies will advance understanding of basic chemical processes in both laboratory and environmental settings. Compounds arising from some of this work have potential broader impact as anticancer, antibiotic, and antifungal agents, as well as potential uses in drug delivery therapies.
