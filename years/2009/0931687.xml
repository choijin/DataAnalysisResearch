<AbstractNarration>0931687&lt;br/&gt;Berger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to improve the use of near-infrared light for studying infants' brain activity. Although current optical methods of monitoring brain activity in infants show promise, many poorly-corrected variables (physical, physiological, and anatomical) still corrupt the data from too many infant participants. Through the research team's combination of expertise in biophotonics, brain and cognitive sciences, and pediatrics, the sources of noise will be reduced to levels where meaningful scans can be performed on babies routinely. The method used will be near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which measures changes in the absorption of light by blood in the scalp and brain. The instrumentation will include dedicated "scalp-only" channels whose source-detector separations (~5 mm) are too short to be sensitive to brain signals. When one of these channels' readout is subtracted from standard channels (with separations of 20-35 mm), much physiological noise is cancelled, and stimulus related activations become easier to observe. The researchers' home-built corrected-near infrared-spectroscopy (C-NIRS) system for adults will be restructured for infant studies and enhanced with more sources and detectors, enabling measurements from a stimulated region and concurrent monitoring of a "control" region. An instrument of this scale designed with dedicated near-channel noise-suppression will be the first of its kind. In parallel, a more flexible silicone-based headband will be developed to fit a range of head shapes, be comfortable and safe for infants, and reduce the amplitude of motion artifacts in the data. The new instrument will be tested on a cohort of 60 healthy, alert infant participants (age 6-9 mos.), along with a commercial near-infrared instrument that lacks correction channels.&lt;br/&gt;Measurement protocols will focus on well-studied visual and auditory stimulation paradigms. The reductions in physiological noise and motion artifacts should yield a higher "hit rate" of meaningful data runs using the C-NIRS instrument than for traditional NIRS, thereby establishing C-NIRS as a valuable tool in the arsenal of the cognitive scientist studying infant development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated an optical method of measuring brain activity.  In this approach, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), optical fibers deliver low-power near-infrared light to the surface of a person's head in multiple locations.  Some of the light penetrates deeply enough into the head to reach the outer brain and the blood vessels that support it.  Other optical fibers on the surface of the head detect light that comes back out after these interactions. By measuring how much light comes back out as a function of time, it is possible to sense changes in the levels of blood in the outer brain.  This is how fNIRS detects brain activity: by detecting blood concentration changes that occur in response to the brain's demand for more oxygen during periods of increased activity.  In this project, the goal was to enhance the abilty of fNIRS to measure brain responses by reducing the sensitivity to unrelated or "background" blood activity.  Special additional optical fibers were placed closer than usual to the illumination fibers.  These extra fibers captured light that had only penetrated shallowly into the head, staying most within the scalp and skull regions, not the brain underneath.  These so-called "short" measurements, named for the shorter source-detector separation, in principle should measure only scalp blood activity, but none in the brain.  Subtracting the "short signal" from a standard "long" channel's signal should ideally remove the effect of extracerebral blood, producing a signal that is more unique to the brain.  The first outcome of this project, from a visual-stimulation study, was the demonstration that 6 mm short channels are more effective than 13 mm in improving the quality of fNIRS activation signals in adults.  In fact, activation signals were even detected in some 13 mm channels.  This suggested that if the methodology were to be translated to infants, it might be essential to use separation distances that were less than 10 mm.  The next results from of the project came from a visual-stimulation study on 54 infants between 6 and 9 months of age. In the past, fNIRS studies on alert, upright infants in this age range have usually reported having to reject all data from up to 50% of the infants studied, due to various experimental nonidealities.  The first outcome was a demonstration that usable fNIRS signals can be gathered from well over 50% of infant participants.  Specifically, analyzable data were obtained from 45 out of 54 infants (83%).  This was achieved by improving three aspects of the experiment: lowering the number of optical fibers to reduce bulk; checking the optical power to determine whether to readjust the probe on the infant's head; and designing a visually and aurally compelling stimulation protocol that kept the infant's attention even during the rest periods.  A second outcome from this study was that activation-like signals were observed from 31 of those 45 infants (69%) who supplied analyzable data.  This indicated that when data are collected and screened carefully for evidence of good optical contact and absence of motion-induced artifacts, the majority of infants will exhibit stimulus-linked blood responses.  Combining the findings from the first two studies, a new study was launched to determine how well short-channel signal correction wold work on infants.  The short channels had separations of 5mm, inspired by the adult study.  The stimulation protocol folllowed the one described in the infant study described just above.  Eight infants were measured in this fashion.  The tentative outcome from this last study was that 5mm short channels did not help to make visually-stimulated brain activation signals show up more clearly.  In some cases, the activation responses were so uncontaminated in the long channels that there was nothing to remove. In other cases, whatever background-like trends seen in the long channels were not replicated in the short channels, meaning ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
