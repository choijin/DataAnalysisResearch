    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009. The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Information processing in the motor control of flight." The host institution for this research is the University of Washington, and the sponsoring scientist is Thomas Daniel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central challenge in understanding the remarkable locomotion capabilities of animals is determining how neural feedback acts through muscles and skeletal elements to control motion. Information theory provides a common metric, information for relating neural and mechanical signals across sensory stimuli, motor commands, and body dynamics. However, understanding the meaning of this information requires grounding the relevant signals in their functional context through neuromechanical experiment, simulation, and validation. This research develops information-based analytical tools for motor control while addressing specific hypotheses of flight control in a winged insect, the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta. First, an information optimization procedure is being used to reveal the functional organization of groups of hypothesized power and control muscles. Second, maximal information algorithms describe the components of wing kinematics and body dynamics most informed by neural feedback through these groups of muscles. Existing biomechanical simulations and direct manipulation of neural and muscular activity in behaving animals are used to validate the proposed functional link between muscle groups, wing parameters, and body dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general principles of information transfer from this research offer a common language for sensorimotor integration in biological systems. On the applied side, revealing principles of information flow in neuromechanical systems is critical to the emerging fields of neural prosthetics, biologically-inspired robotics, and brain-machine interfaces. Perhaps most importantly, this project offers an interdisciplinary training approach. Specific training goals include 1) developing a new computational neuromechanics short course 2) direct mentoring of younger (high school) researchers in projects requiring experimental, engineering, and programming skills and 3) public outreach through an established collaboration with the Pacific Science Center Museum of Flight.</AbstractNarration>
