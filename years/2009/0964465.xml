<AbstractNarration>The success of the future Internet will not be measured by performance alone, but by its social and societal effects that alter our quality of life. The next-generation Internet must connect not only machines but also users: families and friends, representatives and rights advocates. There are immense technical challenges in facilitating communication while protecting user privacy and guarding their security. We address three key challenges. First, we apply user-focused research into developing practical secure communication between friends, laying the groundwork for social messaging without trusting centralized authorities to provide identities. Second, we develop advanced cryptographic techniques for processing private data without divulging it to application providers, placing private social applications on a solid theoretical foundation. Finally, we propose to fundamentally change how cooperation is encouraged and misbehavior is punished in distributed applications by embedding social network data into the design of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has important broader impacts. Social networking is incredibly popular and maintaining privacy is a significant problem within these systems. The desire for privacy prevents individuals from participating fully and makes those who do participate vulnerable to various problems including potential identity theft. Because of the importance of the problem and problem domain, the results of our research will have significant public impact. Graduate and undergraduate students working on this proposal will gain experience with social applications, evaluating cryptographic protocols, and building systems that combine social data. We have actively involved undergraduate students in our research, and expect to continue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The success of the future Internet will not be measured by performance alone, but by its social and societal effects that alter our quality of life.  The next-generation Internet must connect not only machines but also users: families and friends, representatives and rights advocates. There are immense technical challenges in facilitating communication while protecting user privacy and guarding their security.  Online social networks today forge ahead on this path, providing users with new protocols and applications, but often without putting the privacy of their users first.   This project was focused on understanding and improving user privacy when using online social networks.  Described below, this project encompassed the development of techniques to measure the correctness of privacy settings, measurements of real user's (in)correct privacy settings, and the development of approaches that can provide users with easier privacy management and better privacy tradeoffs.   Intellectual Merit:   The first major component of the project involved measuring the incidence of incorrect privacy settings.  Today, instead of just being content consumers, individual end users are now required to be content creators and managers. For every single piece of content shared on sites like Facebook---every wall post, photo, status update, and video---the uploader must decide which of his friends, group members, and other Facebook users should be able to access the content.    By surveying over 300 real Facebook users, the PIs found that the current Facebook privacy settings match users' expectations only 37% of the time, indicating that current settings are incorrect the majority of the time. More worrisome, when the settings are incorrect, they almost always tend to be more open than the users' desired settings, exposing the content to more users than expected.     The project also focused on developing techniques to ease the task of being a content manager.  First, the PIs leveraged the Facebook friendlist mechanism, which allows users to (privately) group their friends for purposes of sharing content.   Unfortunately, the user must manually create friendlists and keep them up to date over time.  Instead, the PIs developed techniques to automatically detect friendlists and keep them up to date, based only on the structure of the user's social network.     Second, the PIs developed the notion of "exposure control" as an alternative to "access control".  Many violations of privacy often do not involve violations of access control (e.g., when the Facebook News Feed was released, Google Maps images, etc)---these systems did not change the set of users who were able to access a given piece of content.  However, they did change the set of users who would be expected to access this content.  Exposure captures the set of users expected to eventually view a piece of content.     Third, the PIs created a new approach to building web-based services called Priv.io, which represents a new point in the design space for online services.  With existing systems, all content is hosted by a central provider (e.g., Google, Facebook) who provides the service for free.  In exchange, the provider monetizes the content (typically via ads) to fund the service.  Priv.io works differently, requiring users to host their own content on cloud providers (e.g., Amazon) in encrypted form.  Priv.io works with unmodified browsers and enables users to share content (as they would on existing services) without any third-party having access to it.  Priv.io provides privacy-conscious users with an alternative, enabling them to enjoy the benefits of social networks without having to give up their privacy to the provider.   Broader Impact:   The PIs developed and released two (free) Facebook applications that explore different techniques for improving user privacy.  The Friendlist Manager application inspects a user's social network and makes two sets of  suggestions: new addition...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
