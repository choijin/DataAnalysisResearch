<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a method of&lt;br/&gt;patterning chemically sensitive organic electronic materials using photolithography and other standard cleanroom processes. The technology is based on the development of a fluorous based photoresist. The process to be developed will not damage organic semiconductors, which are destroyed by most organic solvents and water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology will solve many of the problems that plague the organic electronics industry, particularly related to OLED manufacturing. The technology has the potential to enable large scale manufacturing of OLED displays using existing LCD equipment, dramatically lower the cost and improving yields by using proven techniques.</AbstractNarration>
