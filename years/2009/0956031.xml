<AbstractNarration>This project, from the Board on Science Education of the National Research Council, proposes a Roundtable on Climate Change Education. Roundtables create opportunities for analysis and engagement with the issues rather than provide advice.  This Roundtable will foster ongoing discussion of the challenges to and strategies for improving understanding of climate science and climate change among federal officials, the business community, policy makers, educators, and scientists.  The Roundtable will meet five times over the two-year grant period, and will call for commissioned papers and organized presentations on critical issues related to climate change education.  Each year, the Roundtable will hold a public workshop in conjunction with one of its meetings.  A workshop summary report will be written for each workshop and published by the National Academies Press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project responds to a Congressional mandate that NSF create in 2009 and 2010 a program on Climate Change Education, and a recommendation that NSF consult with the National Research Council as part of that effort. The project will focus on four critical areas and the challenges, opportunities, evidence, and stakeholder groups related to each: public literacy and action; formal education; the scientific, technical and educational workforce; and decision makers.</AbstractNarration>
