<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to elucidate the fundamental nanoscale and mesoscale mechanisms associated with microstructure development and evolution during vapor deposition, through combined use of atomistic and phase-field simulations.  Historically, models for microstructure development during vapor deposition are formulated via extensive experimentation and materials characterization.  These phenomenological models do not consider atomic or mesoscale material behavior and thus cannot predict microstructure development in complex heterophase material systems, such as alumina.  In this work, atomistic simulations will be used to provide an understanding of the role of ion flux on phase evolution and to compute interface energies between solid metastable phases in alumina.  This information will be incorporated into a phase-field model and used to study phase formation and evolution in alumina thin films during simulated physical vapor deposition conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physical vapor deposition is selected as the application of interest in this CAREER proposal because of its broad relevance across a diverse range of science and engineering disciplines.  This proposal strives for a predictive model of microstructure formation during vapor deposition; such a model will allow industry to refine process conditions in a simulation environment rather than through extensive experimentation and materials characterization.  This research plan is integrated with education and outreach activities designed to inspire future generations of young men and women to pursue science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).  A partnership is proposed with local Boy and Girl Scout organizations to create opportunities for Boy and Girl Scouts to earn merit badges or project award patches in STEM related fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this CAREER award was to develop strategies for modeling the nanoscale and mesoscale mechanisms associated with microstructure development and evolution during physical vapor deposition (PVD), through combined use of atomistic and phase-field simulations.  This work focused on complex polymorphic materials where multiple solid phases could form during vapor deposition.  Despite industrial use and vast experimentation, no predictive model for microstructure formation and evolution is available for the PVD process.  Combined use of atomistic and phase-field simulations is a novel approach to address this important problem.  At the atomic level, this work investigated the structure and energetic stability of different alumina (Al2O3) bulk phases, surfaces and interfaces using molecular statics and molecular dynamics simulations with the ReaxFF interatomic potential. Simulations throughout this work were characterized using a new virtual diffraction algorithm, developed and implemented for this research, that creates both selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) line profiles without a priori knowledge of the crystal structure of the sample.

Virtual XRD patterns uniquely identified each phase to validate the minimum energy bulk structures through experimental comparison. Next, a wide range of alumina surfaces and interfaces were studied. Predicted minimum energy structures of &alpha;-Al2O3 interfaces were in agreement with prior work, which provided the foundation for the first atomistic study of metastable alumina grain boundaries and heterophase alumina interfaces.
