<AbstractNarration>Although scientific knowledge about many dimensions of global-scale climatic change has been growing for a number of decades, many organizations are ill-prepared to address challenges posed by changing environmental conditions.  Information upon which they base decisions is incomplete and sometimes erroneous, and the processes used to formulate, consider, implement, and evaluate decisions may be incomplete or lacking.  This distributed interdisciplinary collaborative group will combine knowledge and research methods from behavioral and decision sciences, engineering, and natural science to assist individuals, corporations, governments, and the international community to better address many of the difficult climate decisions they now face.  The group's researchers are associated with about 10 different organizations.  They will address a range of topics, including decisions about reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from the energy system, decisions related to adapting to the impacts of climate change, issues that arise as a result of interactions between reducing emissions and adapting to change, and dealing with unexpectedly rapid or large changes or impacts.  While addressing these climate decision problems, the group's investigators will work to identify limits to existing theory and methods and to make fundamental contributions to the development and dissemination of new frameworks, theory, and methods in the social, behavioral, and decision sciences.  In order to assure that this more fundamental work occurs in a regular and systematic way, the group regularly will convene theory and methods workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group's anticipated contributions are four-fold.  It will provide guidance and support for a number of key climate-related decisions.  It will develop and demonstrate advanced tools and methods to support improved decision making and disseminate those new tools to decision makers and to the policy and research communities.  The group will educate a cadre of high-quality interdisciplinary Ph.D. and M.S. researchers who will make future contributions in the field.  Through a Teacher Professional Development Program, the group will provide large numbers of high school students across North America with the opportunity to learn with, and make use of, materials derived from the group's research.  This collaborative group project is supported by the NSF Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences through its Decision Making Under Uncertainty (DMUU) competition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (CEDM) is a distributed NSF-supported collaborative effort between Carnegie Mellon University and several North America and European institutions. Since 2010,  61 Ph.D. students affiliated with CEDM have been graduated, CEDM investigators have published over 200 peer-reviewed publications, run several Theory &amp; Methods workshops, developed and disseminated a variety of tools for decision support, provided briefings and other forms of support to many stakeholders, and conducted numerous educational and outreach activities, including programs for middle-school teachers and for 9th grade students.     The overall goal of the center for Climate and Energy Decision Making has been to improve theory and methods in climate- and energy-related decision making. This includes making fundamental contributions in how key issues can most usefully framed and in developing and demonstrating the utility of the new methods in providing insights that allows both public and private decision makers to better address the decisions they face. We do this through a strong interdisciplinary, collaborative-research environment operating across multiple institutions.     The Climate and Energy Decision Making center has focused on: (1) assisting private and public organizations to make climate- and energy-related decisions that are scientifically informed, cost-effective, socially equitable, and behaviorally realistic. Often these decisions are made in the face of deep uncertainty about future climate and its variability, as well as many other social and physical factors; (2) advancing the basic state-of-the-art by developing and demonstrating new methods and approaches for decision-making under uncertainty (3) preparing a new generation of graduate students with the knowledge and skills for careers at the forefront of basic and applied research and problem solving on climate, energy and environmental problems from a multidisciplinary perspective; (4) employing a variety of methods and outreach activities to disseminate the Center?s insights and results to students at many levels and to the general public; and, (5) creating and sustain a strong interdisciplinary collaborative research environment across multiple disciplines and institutions in order to achieve the goals and advance the missions of the Center.     The educational goals have been: (1) to educate outstanding graduate students from the natural and social sciences in a way that provides them with the knowledge and skills to work at the forefront of basic and applied research; (2) to solve problems related to climate and energy using interdisciplinary perspectives and methods; and, (3) to inform high school teaching and learning on issues involving climate and energy as well as working directly on improving the understanding among students.     CEDM?s outreach goals have been to: facilitate interactions among researchers and decision makers; develop tools to support decision makers and increase their ability to make sound decisions over multiple time-scales; disseminate tools and other products of value to stakeholders and other interested groups; work with science museums and similar groups to help design interactive exhibits and activities that will help to improve general public understanding of climate and energy decision making.
