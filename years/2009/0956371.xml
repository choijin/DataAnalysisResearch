<AbstractNarration>Scientific specimens, typically found in museum collections, serve as the anchor for an expanding array of information that grows and changes over time. This information, about specimens and the species that the specimens represent, is often scattered geographically across institutions and across independent computer systems, making it difficult to access or synthesize. The goal of this project is to develop a two-way system of linking and tracking scientific specimens and specimen-related data across biological collections, and to make this system widely available to the scientific community and the public. This system would employ globally unique identifiers, or GUIDs, to tag and update information associated with specimens, allowing communication between end users and collections.  This project will improve data quality and quantity for non-scientists and scientists, and will actively engage use communities through training workshops, summer student internships, and community BioBlitz enhancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to integrate specimen data and associated information across biological collections will enable critical studies related to systematics, biogeography, and changing species distributions. These in turn have implications for climate change, changing land use, and other questions key to understanding the past, placing changes in an historical context, and predicting the future of species and environments. This project is part of a 10-year effort to digitize and mobilize the scientific information associated with biological specimens held in U.S. research collections. The images and digitized data from this project will be integrated into the online national resource as outlined in the community strategic plan available at http://digbiocol.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/digistratplanfinaldraft.pdf.</AbstractNarration>

At the heart of these collections are specimens, which have been collected in nature, and brought into museums for perpetuity.

For example, these specimens yield new derivatives, such as tissues used in genetic and genomic analyses, digital records that can be mapped en masse for reconstructing current and past species distributions, and images and other digital content that can help in quantifying the shape and size of biodiversity. As biocollections continue to be rapidly digitized and mobilized, a critical challenge is assuring that the digital content about specimens remains connected together. For example, an analog label associated with a specimen may be digitized in order to gather digital content about taxonomy, data and location of the collecting event and other associated content. This record might be further processed in order to conform to community data standards, and published online as part of ongoing efforts at mobilization. That same specimen at a later date might be subsampled for a tissue and those tissues processed for genomic DNA and ultimately used for genetic or genomic analyses.

As well, there were as inconsistent (at best) practices among the community when reporting specimen identifiers associated with derivative digital data such as sequences.

Unlike images or PDFs, specimen records that point to a physical object are often bundled together as datasets, with each row pointing back to a specimen. As well, there are likely over a billion such records, straining the capacity of systems such as digital object identifiers (DOIs) commonly used.
