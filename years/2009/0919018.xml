<AbstractNarration>Understanding the ways in which animals choose mates has applications that include determining the necessary population size and structure for conserving vulnerable species, assessing the chance of hybridization between species, and helping to predict the spread of genes throughout populations. The large majority of the mathematical models of mate choice in animals are based on the premise that males mate indiscriminately while females are choosy.  A growing body of evidence across species suggests, however, that males often are not indiscriminate.  This grant will develop basic mathematical models of mate choice when males, as well as females, are selective in choosing mates.  It will assess under what conditions males would gain genetic benefits from mate choice and determine how this is affected by whether individuals in the species form pair bonds.  These developments will render current theory of mate choice more realistic and more broadly applicable.&lt;br/&gt;There is wide recognition of the growing need for biologists to have mathematical training and expertise.  Under the broader impacts of a previous NSF grant the PI has been developing a mathematical track in a biology core class at UNC that is dedicated to increasing this training especially for women, an under-represented group in mathematics.  The track uses a variety of techniques to reduce math anxiety, a problem documented to affect women more than men. This grant will continue and broaden this training by adding a module in which students in the mathematical track participate in tutorials in mathematical biology for the broader core class.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It has long been recognized that males generally have more mating opportunities than females, because females invest greater amounts of energy into each reproductive attempt. This leads to the general outcome of females being the choosing sex, while males compete over females. However, there has been increasing realization, highlighted by reviews in recent years, that males do in fact seem to choose from among available females in polygynous mating systems (defined as when more males than females are available to mate at any given time), more often than was previously appreciated.   Along with previous work by the PI, the work in this grant has pinpointed a variety of situations in which male mate choice based on female traits would, and would not, be expected in the most common mating system, polygyny.  Situations that have been shown to allow the evolution of male choice include when females have disproportional preferences for high courtship amounts, and when male choice reduces the chance of hybridization.  The effects of several factors, such as learning and stochastically acting selection, on these preferences has been studied.  Work under this proposal has also included exploration of the evolutionary effects that male choice may be expected to have, including when it can lead to female trait evolution and when it can affect the evolution of population differentiation and speciation.  Finally it has been shown that male mate choice can evolve in monogamous systems more easily than under polygyny, including in situations where female traits are indicators of their competitive ability.  This grant has also included studies of the evolution of signals and displays between females and males within the pair bond.  This work has lead to the discovery that such displays can become permanently established in populations if they stimulate the partner to invest more in the pairÆs offspring. This provides a simpler counter-explanation to the idea of differential allocation, which states that displays occur to enable individuals to continue to assess the quality of their mate.  The broader impacts of this work include work of the PI in an ongoing mathematical track in the core Ecology and Evolution course at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, focused on encouraging undergraduates, especially women, to use mathematical approaches to biological problems.  The training components have included career mentoring of a postdoc, the training of three graduate students and three undergraduate students, and dissemination of the results of the grant in publications and talks in national and international venues.
