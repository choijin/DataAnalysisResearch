<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to fundamentally understand human expert driving skills and the human-machine-environment (HME) interaction, and to design new human-inspired control of agile maneuvers for enabling the next-generation active vehicle safety technology. The proposed research is inspired by extremely agile human driving skills (e.g., professional racing car drivers and motorcycle riders) for handling and recovering unstable vehicle motion in emergencies, such as high-speed obstacle avoidance and skidding on icy roads. This CAREER project will develop new modeling and control strategies for agile-maneuvering systems, including (1) a human-driving skill-capturing framework through modeling HME dynamic interactions; (2) a new control system design for handling transient unstable vehicle motion with guaranteed-safety; (3) a new sensor-enabled tire/road interaction modeling framework for real-time predicting vehicle safety limits; and (4) experimentally testing and validation of the proposed modeling and control framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will result in significant contributions, both theoretical as well as practical, in bio-inspired control of dynamic systems. The success of this CAREER project will provide new HME formulations and models, novel control strategies for tracking unstable target HME dynamics with guaranteed transient motion performance, new sensor-enabled adaptation techniques and new sensing mechanisms and models for dynamic interactions between deformable and rigid components in mechanical systems (e.g., tire/road interaction). One of the direct project outcomes is to advance active safety technology for the next-generation of ?accident-free? vehicles. The project will use online virtual driving environment development and the project website to disseminate the research outcomes, designs, models, source codes, experimental data, and documentation to the general public. In addition, the educational objectives of the project include developing a number of integrated research and education programs to attract students from underrepresented groups into engineering fields, such as active participation in the Rutgers TARGET and SUPER programs, involve undergraduate students into the research activities, and participate in international collaborations for global graduate education.</AbstractNarration>
