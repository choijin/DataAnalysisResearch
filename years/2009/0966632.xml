<AbstractNarration>0966632&lt;br/&gt;Balsara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This energy related project is a collaborative experimental and theoretical study of the effect of morphology on electron and ion conduction in nanostructured polymer materials with clearly defined independent channels for electronic and ionic transport. Regio regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) block polyethyleneoxide (PHT-PEO) will be synthesized by coupling aldehyde terminated PHT chains with living styryl-PEO anions, and doped with the appropriate salts to make the PHT domain electron conducting and the PEO domain ion-conducting. The morphology of the mixtures and charge carrier distribution will be characterized by standard techniques such as electron microscopy and X-ray scattering, as well as element specific techniques such as energy filtered EM and resonant soft X-ray scattering. A combination of DC- and AC-impedance spectroscopy will be used to measure the ionic and electronic conductance of the doped copolymer. Concurrently with the experimental efforts, theoretical and simulation studies will be performed to understand the underpinnings of the experimental observations regarding morphology and dopant distribution, and to provide insight for designing second generation systems with optimal properties. In particular, a ribbon coil model will be developed to predict the morphology of PHT-PEO systems. Theories that incorporate both ion solvation and chain deformation will be used to predict dopant distribution. Computer simulations used to predict ion transport will be validated using experimental measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will be the first study of the simultaneous electronic and ionic transport in nanostructured polymer materials. The combined experimental and theoretical efforts will yield rich insights into: how charge carries are distributed in nanostructured materials, how the motion of charge carriers couples to the segmental dynamics of the polymers, how the local nanostructure and large scale grain structure influences charge transport, and how doping agents alter the morphology of the self assembled polymeric structures. These insights may lead to entirely new design strategies for electrode architectures in rechargeable batteries and fuel cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is in sync with the nationwide efforts at creating clean and more efficient energy technologies. The systems studied have potential to directly translate into new battery technologies. Furthermore, in both PI's home departments, there is an increasing need among the graduate students to work in energy related research areas; the  projects fulfill that need by providing them with the opportunity to do research in a technologically important area, while receiving a multidisciplinary training in theory, simulation, modeling, thermodynamics, synthesis and characterization of polymers, optics, scattering, and electrochemistry. Equally important, the proposed research serves as a platform for developing new educational packages for high school and undergraduate students. In this respect, the PIs will develop and execute lectures and demonstrations on electrochemistry and batteries as part of the Math and Science Summer Academy program at Berkeley.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Collaborative Research: Simultaneous Conduction of Electronic and Ionic Charges in Block Copolymers (NSF Grant Nos. CBET-0966632 and CBET-0965812)  Technical accomplishments We have successfully characterized block copolymers that conduct both electrons and ions and demonstrating the use of such a polymer to improve the functioning of lithium batteries.  An unexpected outcome of this work is that the polymer substantially improves the safety of lithium ion batteries.  When a battery is fully discharged, further use of the battery can cause side reactions which can potentially result in catastrophic battery failure (e.g. the battery catches fire or explodes).  When the cell is fully discharged, the polymer automatically cuts of current to the active particles in the battery electrode thereby preventing side reactions.  Our research was carried out in close collaboration with a theoretical group at Caltech headed by Professor Zhen-Gang Wang (NSF Grant No. CBET-0965812).  This work was focused on theories related to charge transport through block copolymers.  The presence of ionic moieties in block copolymers has a profound effect on the nanostructuring of block copolymers as we have shown in collaborative publications.   Student development and broader impacts The NSF funds were used to support Shrayesh Patel, a PhD student who graduated a few weeks ago.  He started his post-doc at University of California at Santa Barbara on May 15 2013.  His long term goal is to start a tenure-track faculty position in 2015.  Professor Wang and Dr. Nakamura (Professor Wang's post-doc) have come to Berkeley every summer to participate in the Math and Science Summer Academy program at Berkeley.  The program brings approximately 60 students from local high schools to the University campus to participate in a six-week enrichment program in math and science.  Typically half of the participants are African American, one quarter Chicano, and the remaining quarter are Asian, Caucasian, Filipino and Latino.  The two groups spend a day with students of the Math and Science Summer Academy discussing the importance of batteries in the broader context of science education and employment.   Significance and Societal Impact Lithium ion batteries, used traditionally to power personal electronics, are being considered for powering electric vehicles, storing energy from the sun and wind, and for providing electrical power on airplanes.  The electrolyte used in current lithium batteries is a flammable organic solvent.  Safety concerns have limited the use of large format lithium ion batteries.  Our research is related to the fundamental thermodynamic and transport characteristics of solid polymer electrolytes for lithium batteries.  The electrolytes are nonflammable and thus have the potential to deliver energy more safely than current systems.  There is considerable interest in developing solid electrolytes for rechargeable lithium batteries as they are nonflammable. Publications   1.
