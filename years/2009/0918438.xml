<AbstractNarration>With the FACETS project, Education Development Center, Inc. is developing and testing a 2-year, intensive professional development model for building middle grades mathematics teachers' facility with formative assessment. Using a combination of institutes, ongoing professional learning communities, and web-based resources, this model attends both to teachers' knowledge of critical aspects of formative assessment and their implementation of formative assessment in the classroom. Implementation consists of teachers integrating practices associated with critical aspects of formative assessment into mathematics instruction on a daily basis; full implementation, which the project is working towards, requires internalizing a comprehensive understanding of these aspects. The project has two rounds of professional development: a pilot version with a first cohort of 40 teachers and a revised, field test version with a second cohort of 60 teachers. The audience for the FACETS project is middle school math teachers including special education teachers who are responsible for some math instruction, professional development providers, and the research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main research questions are: 1) How do mathematics teachers' knowledge and practice of formative assessment change as a result of participation in the proposed professional development? 2) What learning trajectory describes teachers' developing knowledge and practice of formative assessment, and what common barriers are associated with different parts of that trajectory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is collecting evidence of teachers' learning at a number of different points during the 2-year professional development experience. Teachers' understanding and use of six critical aspects of formative assessment will be assessed before, during, and after the professional development sessions though a series of surveys and questionnaires. In addition, the project will use classroom observations for a sub-sample of participants to chart changes in classroom practices over the course of the professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data related to barriers and challenges to teachers' understanding and implementation of formative assessment come from teachers' survey responses as well as from classroom observations and observations of professional development activities. These data inform modifications to the pilot version of the professional development and drive the larger set of revisions for the field test version. The data also inform the articulation of the participants' learning trajectories and provide value to the mathematics education and formative assessment research communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables include a model of professional development for the learning of formative assessment in mathematics, a facilitator's guide describing the components of the professional development model and suggestions for using the model to provide a professional development program, cyberlearning products such as interactive forums, video and other materials for the professional development activities and resource library, and journal articles describing teachers' learning trajectory for implementing formative assessment in middle grades mathematics classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;External evaluation of this project is carried out by Char Associates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Formative Assessment in the Mathematics Classroom: Engaging Teachers and Students (FACETS) developed a professional development model for formative assessment that presents a comprehensive understanding of formative assessment and focuses specifically on mathematics. Formative assessment is an instructional approach that helps teachers and students address three key questions:  What are my goals for my learning? Where am I currently in relation to my goals? If I havenÆt yet met those goals, what do I need to do next to move toward meeting those goals?  While it is applicable to any subject area, the specific ways that teachers address these key questions are driven by domain-specific learning goals. The FACETS model of formative assessment organizes formative assessment into four critical aspects and two supporting aspects of classroom instruction that help teachers and students address these three key questions. Critical aspects of formative assessment include:  Learning intentions and success criteria: teachers share the lessonÆs intended learning goal (Learning Intention) and indicators of successful achievement of the intended learning (Success Criteria) with students, and support studentsÆ use of learning intentions and success criteria to manage their own learning. Eliciting and interpreting evidence of studentsÆ thinking: teachers provide opportunities for students to make their thinking explicit in order to assess their conceptual, as well as their procedural, understanding with respect to the lessonÆs learning intention and success criteria.  Formative feedback: teachers provide students with specific, actionable feedback about their progress toward the success criteria that scaffolds continued learning, and students also provide feedback to each other. Student ownership and involvement: teachers support studentsÆ active engagement and increasing intellectual independence through development of self-regulation skills, and students monitor their own learning and respond to formative feedback.  FACETS developed this model over two iterations of a two-year professional development program for upper elementary and middle grades mathematics teachers. For each iteration of the professional development, the project also investigated how teachersÆ knowledge and practice of formative assessment changed after participating in the FACETS program, how learning to implement formative assessment developed over the two-year period, and what were the common challenges or barriers to implementation. Research findings indicate that teachers in each iteration of the professional development deepened their understanding of formative assessment and implemented formative assessment practices more often and more effectively. Teachers moved through three phases of implementation: (1) reinterpretation of existing practices and development of new practices consistent with formative assessment, (2) integration of individual critical aspects, informed by tighter connection between the theory and the practice of formative assessment, and (3) greater emphasis on studentsÆ roles in assuming ownership and regulation of their own learning. Teachers encountered a number of challenges when learning to implement formative assessment practices. Common challenges included the following:  developing learning intentions and associated success criteria about mathematical concepts (the "why" of mathematics) as well as mathematical procedures (the "how"); using learning intentions and success criteria to focus studentsÆ work over the course of a lesson; gathering evidence about the thinking behind studentsÆ correct answers to problems as well as their thinking about incorrect work; providing students with specific feedback regarding progress toward lessonÆs success criteria; providing students with opportunities and time to follow up and respond to formative feedback; creating structures and supports to scaffold studentsÆ development of self-regulation skills....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
