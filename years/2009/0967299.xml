<AbstractNarration>Quantum field theory is the major framework for the study of the interactions of elementary particles.  Professor Daniel Freedman from MIT proposes to utilize new techniques for the computation of scattering amplitudes between these particles --- techniques which have supplanted the traditional approach via Feynman diagrams. He plans to focus on the properties of superamplitudes, which compactly package information concerning many different particle processes in a single expression. The initial goal, which has already met with success, is to use superamplitudes to explore properties of the N=8 supergravity theory. These properties are relevant to the conjecture that N=8 supergravity is the first consistent field theory of gravity at the quantum level.  Numerous other applications of and extensions to this technology are envisioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several broader impacts associated with this work.  At a scientific level, any increase in our ability to evaluate on-shell amplitudes is extremely valuable, for such amplitudes have been applied to subjects as diverse as the computation of background QCD events for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and the search for an ultraviolet-finite field theory of quantum gravity.  Furthermore, this subject matter is an excellent area for the advanced education and training of young researchers. Indeed, Freedman's recent mentees include Henriette Elvang, who recently began an Assistant Professorship at the University of Michigan and is the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The standard model  was constructed  to describe  the strong, elctromagnetic, and weak interactions of elementary particles. It fits experimental data very well, and yet it has important shortcomings.  It contains no clear explanation of dark energy and dark matter; it includes the Higgs particle but does not explain its mass; it is difficult to calculate many quantities at low energy when forces become strong; and it does not provide any hints on how to incorporate the gravitiational force at the quantum level. New physcs is thus needed and  my research has been guided by the question "What is the new physics beyond the standard model?"  Historically, the consideration of symmetries of the basic equations of a theory led to many of the steps needed to construct the standard model. Supersymmetry is a powerful idea that predicts that every known elementary particle has a partner of different spin but much higher mass.  Many physicists, including me,  hoped that supersymmetry would provide the next step in the study of fundamental physics.  We are disappointed that the LHC accelerator in Geneva has not found any evidence for the necessary super-partners, although they may be found in the new higher energy data from the LHC. Somewhat independently, supersymmetric theories have a very special structure that allows many questions about the limit of strong forces to be answered cleanly.  Much of my recent research concerns these special features.  One feature is that supersymmetry can be extended to incude gravity. I was a co-inventor of the first such supergravity theory in 1976.  A more complicated version of that theory, called the N=8 supergravity was proposed  as a possible consistent theory of quantum gravity.  Very detailed calculations show that it is consistent through 4-loop order.  An increase in the loop order indicates improved accuracy of the calculation.  In 2010 my collaborators and I formulated a new way to analyze  calculations at a given loop order without actually doing those calculations.  We showed that the N=8 theory is consistent through 6-loop order.  At 7-loops there are potential new difficulties. These would make  the theory inconsistent unless new features which go beyond our analysis in 2010  are found.  In 2015 I found with other collaborators a new theory of N=1 supergravity in which the spacetime geometry, called de Sitter space, may be needed to describe dark energy.  Our construction is considerably simpler than earlier work. In another paper in 2015, we studied non-supersymmetric theories in de Sitter space from the novel viewpoint of their quantum wave functions.   Much of my recent research was devoted to the AdS/CFT correspondence, developed in 1997 by Princeton physicists and motivated initially by superstring theory and supergravity.  Using AdS/CFT,  physicists can calculate strong force effects in certain quantum field theories in 3 space and 1 time dimension from a supergravity theory in 4 space and 1 time dimension.  This has proven to be a very powerful technique which has led to a great deal of insight into the behavior of quantum theory in the regime of strong forces.  Two of the papers I wrote with collaborators in 2013 involved precisions tests of this technique in two of the rare situations in which detailed results from the higher dimensional gravity dual  can be compared directly with the corresponding supersymmetric field theory. I was invited to speak about this work at the Strings 2014 conference at Princeton.  During late 2014 and in much of 2015,  I developed with two collaborators a new application of AdS/CFT to the problem of explaining the value of the Higgs particle mass.  We studied an analogue of this problem, called the little hierarchy problem, in anti-de Sitter space and developed an original mechanism to solve it.  Further study of this theory continues.  Over many years my research has benefited greatly from a series of grants from the Theoretical Physics Program o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
