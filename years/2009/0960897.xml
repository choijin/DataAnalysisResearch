<AbstractNarration>ABI: Systems Bioinformatics Approaches to Modeling and Deciphering Plant Transcriptional Regulatory Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation is awarded a grant to investigate how genome scale transcriptional regulatory networks control gene expression. The project will address diversity and complexity of gene regulation in plant systems and key regulatory elements, including transcription factors, microRNAs (miRNAs), trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs), and emergent regulatory elements. Using systems bioinformatics approaches to decipher plant transcriptional regulatory networks, specific aims include: 1) developing graphical models to model and simulate plant transcriptional regulatory networks; 2) developing novel computational algorithms to infer large-scale gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from high throughput functional genomics data in model plants; 3) constructing Arabidopsis Gene Regulation Networks (AGRN) focusing on hormone-related regulatory networks; 4) constructing legume gene regulatory networks (LGRN) involved in regulation of nodulation in three model legumes: Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus, and Glycine max; and 5) developing integrated web systems to host AGRN and LGRN along with supportive genome-scale data, and network discovery, search and curation tools as plug-ins of popular Cytoscape-based open-source network visualization software linked to AGRN and LGRN web services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating these systems will not only fulfill the needs of the plant biology research community and plant breeders, but will ultimately lead to the development of better engineered economically important crops, e.g. forage legumes. The proposed work is trans-disciplinary and requires the application of genomics, computational biology, and bioinformatics to the classical disciplines of genetics, molecular and cell biology, and plant physiology. By providing a single training ground at the Noble Foundation, this project will empower postdoctoral fellows, visiting scientists, students, and technical staff to acquire many of the research skills that are essential for cutting-edge biological research.  A strong student outreach program will be harnessed to maximize teaching and learning outcomes for this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ I.    SUMMARY       This proposal was designed to develop systems bioinformatics approaches to investigate how genome-scale transcriptional regulatory networks control gene expression in plants. The project aimed to address diversity and complexity of gene regulations in plant systems. Our research and development activities therefore centered on advancing bioinformatics to understand interactions and networks among key regulatory elements, including transcription factors, microRNAs (miRNAs), trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs), and emergent regulatory elements in plant systems.     We successfully achieved all the goals of the original proposal. All specific objectives were fully fulfilled.     The work in this proposal is trans-disciplinary, requiring the application of genomics, computational biology, and bioinformatics to classical genetics, molecular and cell biology, and plant physiology. This project brought together leading and enthusiastic research scientists, who together formed a team committed to excellence in research and training.        II.  RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND ACHIEVEMENTS      We adopted two strategies, i.e. the bottom-up approaches and top-down approaches (Figure 1), to achieve all the goals of the original proposal. Our central methods involve (1) the development of novel informatics approaches and tools for discovering key regulatory elements and inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) by mining large-scale sequences and Microarray-based or RNA-Seq based gene expression data, (2) modeling and deciphering genome-scale associations among key regulatory elements such as genes, functional non-coding RNAs, proteins, metabolites and  signaling components using graphical models, and (3) system and data integration to elucidate gene regulatory networks.     The efforts of PIÆs team have resulted in fifteen original peer reviewed papers and reports published in reputable bioinformatics and/or plant science centered scientific journals and two book chapters that are important in the principal disciplines of the project as of February, 2015 (see Figure 2 for the list of publications).         III.  BROADER IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH      Training Bioinformatics Research postdoctoral Fellows and Research Associates     By providing integrative education and trainings, this project has empowered postdoctoral fellows, students, and technical staff to learn many of the research skills that are essential for cutting-edge bioinformatics and biological research. Six postdoctoral research fellows and research associates have been trained.     Training Intern Students     The Noble Foundation has strong student education and outreach programs that have been harnessed to maximize teaching and learning outcomes in this project.     In the summers of 2010 and 2011, The PIÆs Lab hosted an undergraduate student, Michael Parker, from Millersville University, PA. Michael Parker worked on and first-authored the paper entitled "comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of terpene synthases in Arabidopsis and Medicago" (Parker, et al., 2014). Michael parker is now a Ph. D. student at the Yale University.     The PIÆs Lab hosted the internship student, Ruixin Li, from the Plainview Public High School, Ardmore OK in May 2010, June 2011, and June 2012 respectively. Ruixin Li assisted in literature mining, microarray data organization and data curation for the construction of AGRN. Ruixin Li is now an undergraduate student at the Carnegie Mellon University.     Another internship student, YingYing Lei, from the Plainview Public High School, Ardmore OK, worked in PIÆs Lab in June 2012. Ms. Lei assisted in literature mining and data curation for the construction of AGRN. Yingying Lei is now an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California.     Computer Demos and Bioinformatics Workshops     We annually presented talks, posters and computer demos to introduce projects and give tutorials and hand-...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
