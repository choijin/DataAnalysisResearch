<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Gordon Research Conference on "Electronic Processes in Organic Materials" is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) and Electronic and Photonics (EPM) programs and provides an ideal setting to discuss in depth transformative developments with leading scientists from academia, government, and industry. The field of organic electronics and photonics has enjoyed tremendous progress since the discoveries in the late seventies of conducting polymers and in the late eighties of efficient electroluminescent devices based on small organic molecules or polymers. The market for organic electronics-based products is now projected to reach over $30 billion by 2015.  Various sessions will be devoted to the chemistry, physics, biology, materials science, optical science, nanoscience, engineering, and device fabrication of electrically-active and optically-active organic materials. This conference has consistently hosted presentations at the cusp of important new directions for the field. Meetings have driven progress at critical stages of developments in areas including organic opto-electronics, polymer light-emitting diodes, single-molecule studies, organic electronics, and organic solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key researchers will be present to address the critical questions through a combination of presentations and informal discussions. Invited speakers and session chairs represent the highly interdisciplinary nature of the Organic Materials field with experts from chemistry, physics, material science and engineering, chemical engineering, and electrical engineering with both experimental and theoretical approaches. Speakers and sessions chairs are from a diverse background, including 7 from outside US and 4 female. A primary goal of this funding request is to assist researchers in the early stages of their careers (students, postdoctoral researchers, and/or new faculty) to participate in the conference and join the "Electronic Processes in Organic Materials" community. The conference will enhance their research programs and proposals by inspiring goals and ideas at the leading edge of the field. At the same time, the intimate atmosphere of the conference will allow them to have more exposure of their work within the community and make important connections.</AbstractNarration>
