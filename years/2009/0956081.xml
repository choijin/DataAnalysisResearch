<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Photonic materials with properties that can be tuned by external stimuli have important applications in areas such as color displays, biological and chemical sensors, inks and paints, or active optical components.  This proposal, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) and Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) programs in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Particulate and Multiphase Processes program in Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET), aims to develop an integrated self-assembly approach for building magnetically responsive photonic crystal structures with photonic properties rapidly and widely tunable using external magnetic fields. The main strategy is to design the superparamagnetic colloidal building blocks in accordance to the liquid media so that a strong interparticle repulsion exists to balance the magnetically induced attraction force and eventually induce the self-assembly of particles into ordered structures.  By changing the strength of the magnetic field, the periodicity and consequently the photonic property can be rapidly tuned.  Through manipulation of surface chemistry of the magnetic particles, electrostatic, solvation and steric forces will be employed as repulsive forces countering the magnetically induced attractive forces for optimal assembly.  Unlike conventional colloidal assembly approaches, this new strategy allows instant creation of photonic crystal structures, and rapid and fully reversible tuning of the photonic properties in a wide spectrum range, thus providing a new platform for many photonic applications.  This proposal also explores the use of this self-assembly approach and the magnetically tunable photonic systems for applications such as full-color high resolution printing and rewritable photonic papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop a unique self-assembly approach for the preparation of photonic structures whose color can be changed rapidly and reversibly by applying an external magnetic field.  Upon establishing a balance between the repulsive and attractive interactions, magnetic colloidal particles can be instantly assembled into ordered structures with photonic properties that are tunable by changing the strength of the magnetic field.  These responsive photonic structures will have important applications in areas such as color displays, biological and chemical sensors, inks and paints, or active optical components.  The proposed research efforts will be closely integrated with educational outreach to promote the interest of students, especially those from underrepresented groups, in science and engineering.  Results from the proposed research will be incorporated into a new core course "Nanoscience and Nanotechnology" offered to graduate and senior undergraduate students at the UC Riverside.  Undergraduate students from UCR and local small liberal arts colleges and local high school students will be recruited and given the opportunity to conduct related research through regular academic and summer internship programs.  Onsite and online exhibitions will be developed through partnerships with museums, science centers, and educational websites to broadly disseminate the research results and to enhance the public's understanding of science and technology.  Effective collaborations with researchers at UCR, industry, national laboratories, and international research groups will be established during the project period.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we developed a unique set of photonic nanostructured materials whose optical properties can be changed rapidly and reversibly in response to external magnetic fields.  The general strategy is to assemble uniformly sized magnetic colloidal particles of iron oxide into secondary structures with periodic arrangements so that they diffract visible light and display bright colors.  The periodic ordering of the magnetic particles is formed in solution phase by establishing competing electrostatic repulsive and magnetic attractive forces between these colloids. Changing the strength of the external magnetic fields can therefore alter the force balance and then the periodicity of the assemblies and thus the photonic property (color).  With instantaneous and fully reversible photonic response to the external fields, these new materials are expected to have important applications in areas such as color displays, biological and chemical sensors, inks and paints, security features in anti-counterfeiting devices, or active optical components.  Our studies further revealed that uniform magnetic nanoparticles, when exposed to external magnetic fields, can assemble into ordered structures of various symmetries including one-dimensional periodic chains, two-dimensional sheets, and three-dimensional colloidal crystals, as determined by the local particle concentration and the interplay of magnetic interactions and various repulsive forces. All these three types of assemblies possess periodicity and therefore show changes in diffractive color in response to external magnetic fields, however with one-dimensional periodic chains being the most tunable systems and the three-dimensional colloidal crystals having the highest diffractive intensity.  The one-dimensional assemblies can be wrapped individually in a silica shell or as ensembles in polymer spheres, with diffractive color tunable by orientational control using external magnetic fields.  The principle of magnetic assembly and tuning can also be extended to nonspherical building blocks; and the resultant assemblies show diffractive color strongly dependent on the field direction.  The ability of producing magnetic ellipsoidal nanoparticles also allows us to extend our research to the fabrication of magnetically responsive liquid crystals whose polarization property can be instantly and reversibly controlled by orientational manipulation using considerably weak external magnetic fields.  Educationally, in this project we focused on developing effective graduate, undergraduate and K-12 outreach programs to attract and educate the youth to join the future workforce in the interdisciplinary area of nanostructured materials.  The research efforts were closely integrated with educational outreach to promote the interest of students of all levels from K-12 to postgraduate, especially those from underrepresented groups, in science and engineering.  The students involved in this project have been exposed to many research fields relevant to materials science and received extensive training in scientific research, and therefore developed complex skills necessary for launching their future careers. Results from this project were incorporated into a new core course "Nanoscience and Nanotechnology" offered to graduate and senior undergraduate students at UC Riverside.  Graduate students were exposed the state-of-the-art user facilities at the national laboratories to further expand the scope of training.  Undergraduate students form UCR and local small liberal arts colleges and local high school students were recruited through both regular academic and summer internship programs.  Some of the undergraduate/high school students reported their research results in the form of video presentations which were posted to the group website to attract other undergraduate/high school students to STEM fields.  The results obtained from this project have been disseminated mainly in the form of scienti...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
