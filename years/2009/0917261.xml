<AbstractNarration>This project designs and implements tools for frictionless information systems that work behind the applications that people use in their work and everyday lives, automatically finding and presenting contextually relevant, useful, and interesting information.  To be relevant to a user's information needs in a given context, information must add something new: it must be similar in certain respects to the context, but dissimilar in certain other respects.  The technology utilized in this project explicitly and specifically searches or filters for interestingly different information, dissimilar in systematic ways that reflect information attributes relevant to a user's goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops useful information attributes and dimensions of dissimilarity as well as technologies that can utilize these attributes and dimensions to find useful and relevant information based on the user?s current context.  The particular dimensions that matter in a given context will depend upon the user, task, and domain at hand.  To address this variability, the project is aimed at a general architecture and a set of tools and libraries that will support the rapid development of frictionless information systems for a wide range of application settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results are expected to lead to development of information systems that can provide people with information that is contextually relevant, genuinely interesting, and diverse, resulting in broader and deeper understanding.  The results will be disseminated in academic venues as well as through public release of prototype systems via the project Web site (http://infolab.northwestern.edu/). The project is well integrated with educational activities. Relevance Engine platform will be utilized in class projects for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, and some of these systems may be aimed at educational settings. Students will be involved in development of corpora for testing prototypes, informal assessment of prototypes using web resources, and gain valuable experience in research, design and implementation, and validation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding the context of information online, even in the age of web search and social media, is often quite difficult.  This project is about inventing new technology to automatically find such information in order to enrich the understanding of readers of online content, including online news.  We've also investigated the use of social media data for preference prediction, recommendation, and analysis of complex social attitudes.  We've built and released a number of demonstration projects (available for public use on our web site) including: Tell Me More: A system that, given a news story, automatically finds and presents additional information from other stories describing the same situation, but not contained in the original story. Stakeholder Tweetback: A system for automatically finding and presenting tweets from stakeholders (people and organizations) mentioned in a news story that are relevant to the topic of that story. TweetTalk: A system for automatically finding and presenting "Top" tweets (as determined by Twitter) relevant to a news story a user is currently perusing. readdit: A system for automatically finding and presenting reddit discussion threads relevant to a news story or other document the user is currently reading.  Most significantly, this thread of research culminated in the Context Project&mdash;a platform and component libraries that make it significantly easier to construct contextual information systems like these.   This project also supported research in social media data analytics, primarily but not exclusively for preference prediction and recommendation, including: Twitter Profiling: A system for using your social media posts, specifically on Twitter, to produce a personalized news experience. Tweetcast Your Vote: A system for predicting how a given user of Twitter will (or would have) voted in the 2012 and 2016 US Presidential elections. BookRecs: A system for recommending books to you based on your tweets.  (More than 60 thousand people have tried this system.) LocalRecs: A system for recommending local shops, restaurants, and cultural venues to you based on your tweets. Attitude Buzz: A system for analyzing and presenting complex social attitudes based on geo-located social media data.  Our goal in both strands of work has been to develop technology to help people better understand the information and data now available online--and in our applications of these technologies to news and journalism, to help us all become better-informed citizens.
