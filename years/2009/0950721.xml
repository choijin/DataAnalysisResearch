<AbstractNarration>Sexually dimorphic communication signals evolve rapidly and are among the most widespread, diverse, and conspicuous behaviors that animals produce. This project will combine evolutionary and physiological approaches to study how sexual differentiation of the brain evolves in relation to sex differences in behavior. The project will address this question by comparatively studying mechanisms that regulate sexual dimorphic signals in a species-rich family of South American electric fish. These animals generate weak electrical signals to communicate information about species, sex, social rank, and motivation. The magnitude and direction of sex differences in electric communication signals vary across species. Sex differences in these signals are regulated by hormones like testosterone and estrogens and by neuromodulators like serotonin. The brain circuit that controls electric communication signals is well-characterized and relatively simple. These features facilitate investigations of how hormone-brain-behavior interactions evolved to produce species diversity in sexual dimorphic behavior.&lt;br/&gt;The project has four  goals: (1) to compare sex differences in signals across species and investigate the coevolution of sex differences in different signal components; (2) to determine whether species diversity in sexual dimorphic behavior evolves through changes in the hormonal sensitivity of behavior; (3) to determine whether sex differences in behavior evolve through changes in neuromodulation in brain regions that control communication signals; and (4) to determine whether sex differences in behavior evolve through changes in the intrinsic physiology of brain cells.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates will help collect and analyze data and will be trained and encouraged to pursue scientific careers. The project will maintain a robust international collaboration between Indiana University and the National Institute of Amazon Research in Brazil. The project will generate recordings of electric communication signals that will be deposited in a public database and provide resources for research and teaching on animal communication, sex differences, biodiversity, sensory biology, and biophysics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background and Rationale:  Communication signals used in courtship or within-sex agonistic interactions are widespread across animals and are often sexually dimorphic; i.e., males produce different signals than females.  Sexually dimorphic signals can evolve rapidly, and they are frequently conspicuous and diverse across species. The ways that hormones and the brain regulate sex differences have been well-characterized in several model systems. Relatively few studies, however, have examined how these physiological mechanisms have evolved to produce species differences in the sexual dimorphism of signals.  This project addressed this question by comparatively studying sexually dimorphic electric communication signals and their hormonal control across related species of electric fishes. These fish have electric organs whose weak electric signals allow them to find their way around in murky streams at night and to communicate information about species, sex, social rank, and motivation. These signals, which are produced during courtship and aggression, differ between males and females in many species; and the sex differences can vary across species.  Sex differences in these signals are regulated by gonadal hormones like testosterone and estrogens.  The brain circuits that control these signals are discrete, well-characterized, and simple. These features make electric fish communication signals an ideal model for studying how hormone-brain-behavior interactions evolve to produce species diversity in sexually dimorphic behavior.   Outcomes:  Intellectual Merits:    This project used gene sequences to determine the evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) of the largest family of South American electric fishes, the ghost knifefishes. This phylogeny was necessary to study how communication signals and hormonal mechanisms that control sex differences evolve in these fishes. It will also be an important tool for future studies on the evolution of the behavior and neurobiology of these animals.    This project used comparative approaches to examine how sexually dimorphic communication signals evolved in electric fish.  The main findings were that sexually dimorphic electric signals evolved rapidly. The structure of signals varied substantially across species, and different signal parameters were sexually dimorphic in different species.  Furthermore, the direction and magnitude of sex differences varied across closely related species, and even across populations within species.    The project examined species diversity in how hormones regulate sexually dimorphic signals. The main findings were that the magnitude and direction of sex differences in signals were tightly linked to the sensitivity of the signals to androgens and/or estrogens.  Specifically, the fishes? electric organ discharge responded robustly to these hormones in species that had large sex differences, but was insensitive to androgens and estrogens in species that lacked sex differences.  This pattern also held across populations of the same species that differed in the sexual dimorphism of their signals. These findings suggest that gains, losses, and reversals of sex differences in behavior may arise from changes in how brain areas that control these behaviors respond to sex-specific gonadal hormones.    The project began to examine how species differences in brain expression of hormone-related genes is related to behavioral sex differences.  The initial findings of these studies were (1) that the brain region that controls the fishes? electrical signals robustly expresses genes for androgen receptors, estrogen receptors, and enzymes that metabolize gonadal hormones; and (2) that expression of hormone-related genes in the brain varied across species that have different patterns of behavioral sex differences. These findings will serve as a solid foundation for future studies to examine how the evolution of gene expression in particular brain regions is linked to evolutionary changes in sexually dimorphic behavior and its hormonal regulation.    Broader Impacts:    The project provided research training and professional mentoring for 1 post-doctoral trainee, 5 graduate students, 20 undergraduates, and 3 high school students.    The project promoted the participation of groups underrepresented in science. Nine of the 29 student and postdoctoral trainees who received research training were members of populations underrepresented in science (underrepresented minorities and/or individuals with disabilities). Nine of the undergraduates were from small colleges with few or no opportunities for research.    The project fostered a collaboration between the PI?s laboratory and the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amaz&ocirc;nia in Brazil. This included cross-disciplinary training of both U.S. and Brazilian graduate students.    The project generated and populated a large, publicly accessible database of recordings of the communication signals of electric fishes (http://www.indiana.edu/~efishlab/catalog/faqs.php).  This database currently contains over 900 high-quality recordings of signals from 100 fish of 13 species, and new recordings are continually being added. The database has been used by numerous scientists, college and K-12 educators and students, and members of the general public.    The PI mentored five high school teachers in the Bloomington Science Institute program. The PI helped these teachers develop curricular materials and high school laboratory demonstrations and exercises based on the project and tied to core elements of the AP Biology curriculum.  These materials were shared with other teachers in the program.                Last Modified: 09/28/2016       Submitted by: Gerald T Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
