<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the effects of forest encroachment in alpine regions for the Rocky Mountain Apollo butterfly, a species restricted to habitat above treeline. Using historical aerial photography documenting past encroachment, habitat mapping, and tree ring dating, areas above treeline that are and are not subject to forest encroachment will be determined at three sites in the front range of the Rocky Mountains. These data will be combined with existing long-term population data for the butterfly to predict if continuing forest encroachment will affect the butterfly, and if so, when these populations may begin to see effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses an important question for conservation as well as for ecological and evolutionary research: Does habitat change in alpine systems necessitate extinction or will local refugia be sufficient to permit persistence? Currently, the elevation of treeline is rising in many alpine areas throughout the world, potentially threatening organisms restricted to alpine habitats. The project will provide training for one graduate student, three to nine undergraduates and one postdoctoral researcher. The investigators participate in the WISE and McNair programs and the Girl Scout summer program and have a strong record of outreach to diverse groups. The project has been featured in park visitor centers and magazine and newspaper articles.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
