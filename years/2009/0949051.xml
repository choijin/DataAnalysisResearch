<AbstractNarration>In all animals, motor behaviors such as walking, breathing, swimming, or flying rely upon the coordinated patterns of muscle contractions, which in turn, depend on information processing in neural circuits located in the nervous system. Motoneurons transfer neural information from the central neural networks to the muscles. Although the neural network plays critical roles in generating the coordinated information output to the muscles, motoneurons are equipped with intrinsic membrane currents that also sculpt the final motor output. Motoneuron membrane properties are further influenced by neuromodulatory substances which can be released during motor activity to shape patterned motor output. Despite a half century of studying motor pattern generation, our knowledge of how motoneuron membrane currents shape patterned motor output remains fragmentary. One major experimental problem in studying the specific functions of motoneuron membrane currents has been that most pharmacological or genetic loss-of function experiments target all neurons of the network. This project will use the genetic tools available in Drosophila to target genetic manipulations specifically to motoneurons without affecting the rest of the network.  In a comparative approach the experiments will focus on two locomotor activities with different requirements for motoneuron activation; larval crawling and adult flight. In the first step, the study will determine which genes code in motoneurons for calcium, calcium-activated potassium, and hyperpolarization activated currents. Based on this, specific currents will be manipulated genetically only in these motoneurons to test their functions by recordings during motor behavior. The investigators expect to unravel new motor strategies and cellular properties that are relevant to normal motoneuron function and to understanding defects of motoneurons perturbed by disease or injury.  The Broader Impacts of this work include interdisciplinary training of undergraduates and graduate students.  Additional educational activities will include training of students from underrepresented groups; for instance, the PI will recruit students from the local Bioscience High School and mentor these students while the students are involved in the proposed research.  Finally, the PI will contribute to the University?s Minority Access to Research Careers program to increase participation by underrepresented undergraduate students in STEM.</AbstractNarration>
