<AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to develop compact ultra-high-Q three-dimensional photonic crystal resonators and demonstrate optically-pumped and electrically-pumped low-threshold microlasers defined in a complete photonic band gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Photonic crystal technology is currently limited by the boundary set by 2D photonic crystal slab. It is apparent that there is a huge space beyond the boundary to explore. The most significant thing in 3D photonic crystals is that they can have a complete photonic band gap. This unique feature enables three-dimensional light localization in an extremely small space as a resonance state. In this program, the developed UHQ microresonator and low-loss waveguides designs will be built by a simple fabrication method without wafer bonding in order to demonstrate 3D photonic crystal microlasers by optical and electrical pumping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This program consists of research, training, and education components. &lt;br/&gt;The developed technology would break the boundary set by current light localization technology and open up possibilities of creating new light localization devices and enhance the performance and functionality of optical devices. The efforts would impact other scientific communities to enhance capabilities of light localization and light-matter interaction. The developed components for light localization would be excellent test beds for investigating condensed matter physics and optical physics, including light-matter interaction, quantum information science, and 3D optics. Furthermore, current-injection UHQ microlasers and resonators will make light localization technology practical. The program provides students in underrepresented groups with educational, training and research opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
