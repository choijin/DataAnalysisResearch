    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a low-cost non-destructive, non-contact probing method for surface and sub-surface characterization of inhomogeneous materials and devices. New artificial and nano-material development requires fast, low-complexity and ultra-sensitive high-resolution characterization of materials, as well as defect detection during fabrication processes, with sub-micron spatial resolution. The approach focuses on combining a near-field microwave probing system with optical interferometry for topology sensing and correction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research stems from new electronic designs through investigation of fundamental limitations, and miniaturization through integration, enabling a scalable solution. Electromagnetic and noise analysis, design of calibration test structures, and related metrology, are used to understand the fundamental limitations on sensitivity and design miniaturized active probes. Different penetration depths enable sub-surface probing by using different frequencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research are to provide a fast and inexpensive tool for detection of defects for new material technologies and rapid classification of samples into batches for yield and uniformity analysis. Such a tool can impact material manufacturing technology and maintain the nation?s leadership in this area. An impact on the institution will be development of core competency in the field and interactions with existing research projects and multidisciplinary education. A new module will be added to existing K-12 outreach, entitled Electromagnetic Eyes, where children ?see? a coin through an opaque cover. A successful recruiting effort which focuses on under-represented groups will expand, and the international collaboration with one of the top engineering universities in Germany, Technische Universität München, developed.</AbstractNarration>
