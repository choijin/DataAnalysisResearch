<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this grant is to study the structure of certain categories of sheaves on symplectic algebraic varieties.  When the variety in question is the cotangent bundle to a flag variety, then the category that one obtains is equivalent to a block of the "Category O" of representations of a Lie algebra, originally introduced by Bernstein, Gelfand, and Gelfand.  For this reason, this category is referred to as "Geometric Category O".  This category is conjectured to have many beautiful properties, which have been verified in certain special cases that arise naturally from representation theory and polyhedral geometry.  Chief among these conjectures is that the categories are Koszul, and that each symplectic variety has a "symplectic dual" whose associated category is Koszul dual to that of the original variety.  This phenomenon is expected to form a bridge between various approaches to categorification of Lie algebra representations and link invariants that were previously thought to be unrelated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic algebraic varieties arise naturally from many different areas of mathematics. Geometric and topological properties of hypertoric varieties have shed new light on the topology of hyperplane arrangements and the combinatorics of matroids. Quiver varieties provide geometric realizations of actions of infinite dimensional Lie algebras, leading to canonical bases and to actions on categories of sheaves. This grant plays a key role in this picture, providing new geometric insight to such phenomena as Gale duality in combinatorics and level-rank duality in representation theory. This project will contribute to each of these endeavors independently, and will also advance a common treatment that unifies our understanding of the various individual phenomena.  In addition to the research component, the grant includes an annual workshop for graduate students and postdocs that bridges these various fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main research focus of this project was on the representation theory of algebras obtained as quantizations of symplectic resolutions.  Many of these algebras,such as universal enveloping algebras,finite W-algebras, symplectic reflection algebras, and rational Cherednik algebras, have been extensively studied on an individual basis, using a mixture of geometric and purely algebraic techniques.  Building on foundational work on Bezrukavnikov-Kaledin and Kashiwara-Rouquier, my collaborators and I have attempted to make the case that these algebras should be studied all at once.  We have given a definition of category O for a quantized symplectic resolution, generalizing the classical definition of Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand for the universal enveloping algebra.  Most significantly, we have introduced the notion of symplectic duality, which is a relationship between pairs of quantized symplectic resolutions built around the idea that their categories O should be Koszul dual to each other.     The main educational component of this project was the WARTHOG workshop series (Workshop in Algebra and Representation Theory Held on Oregonian Grounds).  This series began in 2010, with Andre Henriques lecturing on operator algebras and conformal field theory.  Other topics have included cluster algebras, categorical representation theory, quantum and affine Schubert calculus, Soergel bimodules, log concavity in algebraic geometry, knot homologies, and symplectic duality.  Despite the end of the grant, the WARTHOG workshops are continuing with renewed NSF support.       Last Modified: 06/01/2017       Submitted by: Nicholas J Proudfoot]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
