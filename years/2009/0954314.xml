<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to investigate biorenewable thermosetting polymers derived from vegetable oils and to explore the use of microencapsulated liquid healing agents in these bio-based polymers as multifunctional composites with the ability to heal damage autonomically (i.e. self-healing bio-based polymers).  These biorenewable polymers will be synthesized from the ring-opening metathesis polymerization of modified castor, soybean, and linseed oils to maximize the thermal and mechanical properties of the resin for structural composite materials.  The research approach then examines whether viable and compatible self-repair mechanisms can be incorporated into these systems to mitigate damage, similar to those developed for synthetic epoxy systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide biorenewable alternatives to petroleum-based resins.  These bio-based thermosets employ substantial amounts of renewable resources which are substantially cheaper than the petroleum-based feedstocks used in conventional composites, suggesting that this technology should have a huge impact economically and environmentally.  In addition, polymeric structural materials are prone to microcracks and the ability to heal them will enable structures with longer lifetimes and less maintenance.  Though the potential benefits are quite high, there are several practical limitations (such as crack healing kinetics, manufacturing limitations, and stability of the healing agent system to environmental conditions) that need to be overcome in order for the benefits to be realized in society.  This research program is a first step in transitioning this technology to biorenewable polymers and overcoming the limitations that plague the current state-of-the-art in self-healing materials. The goals of the project will be realized by actively involving both undergraduate and graduate students in the research process and in the development of an immersive educational video game about bio-renewable and multifunctional polymers, broadening the type of resources currently utilized in polymer science outreach.</AbstractNarration>
