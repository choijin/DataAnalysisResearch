<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the design of an infrastructureless&lt;br/&gt;communication system that makes it easy for people without expertise&lt;br/&gt;in computer security to safely communicate with friends and family&lt;br/&gt;members without being subjected to third-party surveillance,&lt;br/&gt;censorship, propaganda, or reprisal.  The primary goals of this work&lt;br/&gt;are to (1) further open access to information people require to&lt;br/&gt;educate themselves and (2) make sharing information easier.&lt;br/&gt;Particular attention is paid to designing protocols that do not rely&lt;br/&gt;on centralized control points, which are subject to attack.  The&lt;br/&gt;influence of patterns in human behavior on communication system&lt;br/&gt;performance, energy efficiency, and security are being studied, and&lt;br/&gt;the findings used to guide the development of better, user-aware,&lt;br/&gt;communication protocols.  Design and analysis of communication&lt;br/&gt;protocols; defenses against side-channel attacks on portable&lt;br/&gt;communication devices; distributed system architecture; and&lt;br/&gt;energy-efficient software systems play central roles in the work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project took two independent paths, one led by the PI and one led by the co-PI.  ---- From the PI.  The Internet was once credited with broadening access to information, and the ability to share it.  However, this consensus has been changing over time.  ``The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.''   - John Gilmore, 1993.  ``I used to believe the Internet offered limitless opportunities for free speech; now I believe it is becoming a smorgasbord of opportunities for authoritarian control.''   - Simon Davies, 1998.  There are now many examples of the Internet being used against free speech.  It is fundamentally an infrastructure-based and largely centralized structure that concentrates communication in a few locations, where it is susceptible to attack.  This project has focused on developing technology foundations allowing normal people to communicate freely, without being subject to blocking, censorship, or surveillance.  The key idea is using direct and transitive communication among commodity smartphones.  Instead of talking to a cellphone tower or a wireless access point, you talk directly with another phone.  And if you want to get your message across town, it hops from phone to phone until it reaches its destination.  But that approach is challenging, and opens many questions.  - How many people need to use the technology before your messages can reach the people you want to talk with?  - What happens if an attacker tries to trick you into thinking he is someone else?  - How can you stop spam and other network abuse when you don't trust anybody?  In this project, we pulled together a team of 15 students, most of them volunteers, to answer these questions and figure out whether it is practical to build a community network that will keep working even if someone pulls the plug on the Internet.  We learned a lot.  When only 0.2% of the students on a college campus used our research prototype application, messages reached 85% of users, with user motion helping to spread messages.  One of the big challenges to using decentralized wireless networks is that malicious users can pretend to be numerous normal users, something called a Sybil attack.  We developed a defense against Sybil attacks that works even when nobody in the network is trusted.  We also developed a way to use predictable human motion to get messages to users quickly and privately.  The project continues, thanks to volunteers and an NSF technology commercialization program.  If you are interested in becoming involved, please contact us (http://1am-networks.com/).  ---- From the co-PI.  In this project, we have worked on several aspects to realize the goal of WHISPER, including the following.  We developed defense against eavesdropping attacks, censorship, and privacy leakage on mobile platforms by uncovering a new class of UI State Inference and Novel Android Attacks and designing defense solutions for it.  We focused on these three aspects to understand eavesdropping, censorship and privacy leakage threats on mobile platforms due to the design of the OS platform and applications. (1) We designed a tool called QoE Doctor to understand application QoE (Quality of Experience) based on UI events, which allows us identify performance based differentiation as a form or censorship.  (2) Using a tool we call AppProfiler, we have investigated techniques to uncover privacy-sensitive behavior in mobile apps and explain how Android permissions may lead to privacy leakage when users interact with mobile apps. (3) Finally, we uncovered a new attack on mobile platforms such as Android that uses UI state inference to launch new attacks such as camera peeking, data (e.g., password) theft, and UI hijacking.  Finally, we investigated how social network information can benefit the discovery of malicious activities, which can improve the security and integrity of network services.  We propose SocialWatch, to detect attacker-created accounts and hijacked acc...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
