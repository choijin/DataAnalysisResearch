<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to develop and verify a mixed unit life cycle analysis model of the US electric industry that includes environmental effects and the relationships to many major industries. The model will include both economic and energy/electricity flows.  It is anticipated that this model will be a useful tool in energy and environmental policy decisions.  Advances in the model will be due to including more interactions with other industries and a disaggregated (i.e. source-specific) power generation sector in the US.  The model, if successful, will be an important tool for planners and policy makers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Bruce K. Hamilton&lt;br/&gt;2/24/10</AbstractNarration>
