<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor William P. Malachowski and colleagues Sharon N. Burgmayer, Jonas I. Goldsmith and Frank B. Mallory from the Department of Chemistry at Bryn Mawr College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer outfitted with a broadband probe, a dual 1H-13C probe, and variable temperature unit. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) synthetic tools for therapies and IDO inhibitor development for anti-cancer treatment; 2) reactions of pterin-dithiolene molybdenum complexes; 3) synthesis of [n]phenacenes for use as molecular wires; and 4) design of multimetallic transition metal complexes for light harvesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
