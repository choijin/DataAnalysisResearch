<AbstractNarration>Scholarships are being provided for academically talented/ financially needy students to enter the workforce following completion of a baccalaureate or graduate degree in computer science, technology, engineering or mathematics (CSTEM). Affinity Groups are created to assist recipients in completing project oriented degree requirements. Recipients are being recruited from partnering high schools, community colleges, and current students at the university. At least 12 undergraduate and 4 graduate students per semester are being supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: All college scholarship recipients are required to participate in the award winning Scholars Academy (SA) at the university and an Affinity Group (AG), which consists of a faculty member paired with three undergraduates and one graduate student. Integrating community college transfers into an AG helps prepares these students to succeed in programs at the university. As members of the Scholars Academy, students participate in programs that provide instructional enrichment opportunities such as research projects during summer / academic year; peer tutoring; a Collaborative Learning Community Center, a college culture not usually found in urban commuter colleges; special advisement /mentoring; GRE preparation; and career guidance and placement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Activities broaden participation in STEM fields for traditionally underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities as discovery and understanding are advanced while emphasizing teaching, training and learning. The program provides integrated research and education activities, serving as national model for replication. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
