<AbstractNarration>Researchers are in the first phase of a study to analyze the impact of three different curricular approaches to the learning of algebra.  The three approaches are represented by: 1) instructional materials developed with NSF support (The Interactive Mathematics Program and Contemporary Mathematics in Context, also known as Core Plus Mathematics); 2) "hybrid" curricula (University of Chicago School Mathematics Project and the Discovering Mathematics Series by Key Curriculum Press); and 3) traditional texts (those published by Glencoe, McDougal Littell, and Pearson Prentice Hall).  The primary criterion for selecting these curricula is the level of market penetration.  This first phase of the study analyzes the three approaches in order to develop comparative maps that highlight the algebra content and cognitive demands across the curricula being studied.  This project is developing reliable and valid instruments to assess student learning, which, will be used to examine and compare student understanding of algebra in the later phases of the study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report  NSF DRL #0901311 Examining Different Curricular Approaches and their Impact on High-School Students? Understanding of Algebra:  Phase 1 &ndash; Studying the Intended Curriculum     In this project we set out to answer the general research question:  What are the characteristics of different curricular approaches to algebra?  We did this through consistent application of existing taxonomies to code all items from the narrative and homework sections within the algebra strand of six different textbook series.  These textbook series are listed below, and additional information about them is in the attached image.  Center for Mathematics Education (CME) Core-Plus Mathematics Program (CPMP) Discovering Mathematics (DM) Glencoe Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP) University of Chicago School Mathematics Program (UCSMP)   Across the six textbook series, 63,174 textbook items were coded by mathematics educators, a mathematician, and high-school mathematics teachers.  Coding items in the textbooks and subsequent analyses focused on two dimensions that are commonly used for textbook analysis:  content (i.e., the breadth, sequence, and depth of topics covered) and cognitive behavior (i.e., how the content is intended to be experienced by students).  In addition to content and cognitive behavior, during the coding process three other readily available pieces of information were obtained about items in the textbooks &ndash; binary codes were used to indicate which items in the textbooks (a) are set in a real-world context, (b) require use of calculators or computers, and (c) require use of manipulatives, such as algebra tiles, coins, dice, and paper (e.g., folding a piece of paper on the parabola?s axis of symmetry).  Findings suggest that these six textbook series are vastly different across the curriculum variables studied.  Therefore, students experience a course in algebra in quite different ways, depending on the perspective of algebra taken by their teachers and the textbooks they use.  Results of this study, in which we explored the content of the algebra strand of six high-school textbook series in coherent, comprehensive, and commensurable ways, might influence several groups of people.  For instance, people who serve on textbook selection and adoption committees might use results from this fine-grained examination of mathematics textbooks to influence their decision making.  Also, our methodology might provide mechanisms for their own explorations of the content and cognitive behavior of items in textbooks being considered for use, or already in use, in their schools and districts.  Policy makers might also be impacted by the results of this study.  Does the content of the textbooks align with current standards for mathematics?  If so, which standards?  If not, where are the gaps?  Results from this study might affect the design and interpretation of large scale, high-stakes assessments with respect to opportunity to learn.  For example, is there equal opportunity for students to learn particular content that is emphasized on such assessments?  What is the "common ground" across these textbook series, and how might this inform the design of assessments?  Lastly, results of this study might influence curriculum developers as they consider revising their textbooks.       Last Modified: 08/09/2017       Submitted by: Mary Ann Huntley]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
