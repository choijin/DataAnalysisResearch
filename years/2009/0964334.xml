<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop methods to design control systems for humanoid robots that show human levels of competence, robustness and flexibility in locomotion on human-scale rough terrain, focusing on responses to errors such as slipping and tripping, and responses to perturbations caused by irregular terrain. The research is motivated by the large disparity between human performance and current robot performance.  The project uses a data-driven approach, utilizing motion data recorded from people to create trajectory libraries of these behaviors.  It develops algorithms that allow these libraries to be adapted for robot control and generalized through interpolation, resequencing, and optimization for new environments.  The project also explores strategy selection, modeling what strategies humans use in different situations. The project will have intellectual impacts in making better robots and understanding people better. The project will demonstrate better robot performance as well as more accurate models and simulations of human behavior.  In both cases scientific publications will be augmented by extensive additional material and data on the web. Potential applications include insight into how the changes in the motor and sensory systems due to aging increase the risk of falling. The project may develop ways to change environments and train at-risk people to reduce the risk of falling.</AbstractNarration>

Subject demographic information was also included such as age (young, middle aged, and older adults), as well as the subjectsÆ functional balance, results of formal clinical balance testing, and range of motion.  Other types of data included, when available, were electromyographic data (EMGs) from muscles in the lower legs that give an indication of when muscles are creating forces.  Also, ground reaction forces generated under the feet walking from force plates were included.  Finally, an additional data set was generated from further experiments done within the laboratory on patients with ParkinsonÆs disease and age-matched controls. This data will be useful in understanding responses when there are problems within the motor control system.     These databases are now being analyzed by our CMU colleagues to evaluate the trajectories to build new approached to humanoid robot control.  The techniques being used include machine learning and other trajectory-analysis methods.  The results of this analysis will be finalized this coming year.   We hope to also be able to then incorporate those models into our existing walking robots.       Last Modified: 02/28/2014       Submitted by: Mark S Redfern]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
