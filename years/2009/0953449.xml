<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to evaluate quantitatively the capabilities of human operators in human-machine interaction (HMI). The research approach consists of two parts. In the first part, the human operator is viewed as a hybrid neural controller. The capabilities of the neural controller are evaluated based on physiological constraints and modeled functions of the neural system. In the second part, the human operator is viewed as an information processor and a communication channel. The capacity of the neural system is quantified in terms of rate of information exchanges between the human and the machine. These two parts offer complementary views and synergistically combines control theory, information theory, computational neuroscience, non-invasive human experiments, and computer simulations in the study of human-in-the-loop control systems. &lt;br/&gt;         &lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide quantitative indications of the effectiveness of HMI and fundamental limitations of the human controller. This will be instructive to discard impossible designs or specifications, determine system controllability or task achievability, and design HMI interfaces that may maximally utilize human control commands. This research will also promote the understanding of neural organization and mechanism for movement control, learning, and information processing. These neural principles will inspire new concepts and techniques for intelligent and advanced control. The educational component of this project will create more opportunities for students and working engineers to appreciate the importance of human factors and to learn techniques to handle these factors in engineering system design. A new student chapter of IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society will be instituted to facilitate student involvement in research and professional activities related to human-centered design in real engineering world.</AbstractNarration>
