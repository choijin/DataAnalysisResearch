<AbstractNarration>0944199/Matsuoka&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to test the hypothesis that abrupt changes in fabric exist and are associated with both climate transitions and volcanic eruptions. It requires depth-continuous measurements of the fabric. By lowering a new logging tool into the WAIS Divide borehole after the completion of the core drilling, this project will measure acoustic-wave speeds as a function of depth and interpret it in terms of ice fabrics. This interpretation will be guided by ice-core-measured fabrics at sparse depths.  This project will apply established analytical techniques for the ice-sheet logging and estimate depth profiles of both compressional- and shear-wave speeds at short intervals (~ 1 m). Previous logging projects measured only compressional-wave speeds averaged over typically 5-7 m intervals. Thus the new logger will enable more precise fabric interpretations. Fabric measurements using thin sections have revealed distinct fabric patterns separated by less than several meters; fabric measurements over a shorter period are crucial.  At the WAIS Divide borehole, six two-way logging runs will be made with different observational parameters so that multiple wave-propagation modes will be identified, yielding estimates of both compressional- and shear-wave speeds. Each run takes approximately 24 hours to complete; we propose to occupy the boreholes in total eight days. The logging at WAIS Divide is temporarily planned in December 2011, but the timing is not critical.  This project?s scope is limited to the completion of the logging and fabric interpretations.  Results will be immediately shared with other WAIS Divide researchers. Direct benefits of this data sharing include guiding further thin-section analysis of the fabric, deriving a precise thinning function that retrieves more accurate accumulation history and depth-age scales. The PIs of this project have conducted radar and seismic surveys in this area and this project will provide a ground truth for these regional remote-sensing assessments of the ice interior. In turn, these remote sensing means can extend the results from the borehole to larger parts of the central West Antarctica.  This project supports education for two graduate students for geophysics, glaciology, paleoclimate, and polar logistics. The instrument that will be acquired in this project can be used at other boreholes for ice-fabric characterizations and for englacial hydrology (wetness of temperate ice).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We need to better understand the factors that control the flow of glaciers and ice sheets so that we can better estimate their contribution to sea-level rise. Ice crystals deform readily in one direction, but hardly at all in other directions. We often use an analogy of a deck of cards: the cards slide on their faces easily past each other, but you can't move the cards "through" each other.  The equivalent of the faces of the cards for ice is called the basal plane. Therefore, the direction of those basal planes in an ice sheet is a strong control on flow.   Seismic waves travel slower in the basal plane of a crystal and faster perpendicular to the basal plane (that direction is known as the c-axis), so by measuring the speed of those waves, information about the crystal orientations can be obtained.  A borehole sonic-logging tool basically consists of a small speaker that generates sound pulses that, which are converted to seismic waves in the ice around the borehole.  Microphones in the tool detect the waves after they have traveled through the ice.  From the time it takes for the energy to travel through the ice, and our knowledge of the distance between the source and the receiver, we can measure the seismic wave speed in the ice and therefore estimate the crystal orientations.   Under this collaborative award, researchers from University of Washington and Penn State University used a borehole sonic tool to continuously measure the speed of the elastic waves in the walls over moving 3-meter intervals, as the tool was lowered or raised smoothly over the entire depth of the 3.4 km core-hole at the West Antarctic Ice Divide.  However, because the tool transmitter was damaged in shipment, and because the flow pattern at the WAIS Divide site generated a more-complicated pattern of c-axes than expected, the results were  inconclusive.   With approval from NSF, the research team used the remaining funds in the project to work with a geophysical tool manufacturer (Earth Science Systems LLC, of Wheat Ridge  CO) to develop a more-capable tool with modern electronics, software, and communication capabilities, greater data storage, and 5 receivers (instead of the two receivers in the previous generation tool), and improved ability to detect and resolve multiple phases of waves, and reveal more information about the crystal-orientation statistics at each depth in the ice sheet.  The new tool has been designed, built,  and tested in the ESS Lab and in a test well in Denver.   The tool will be field-tested in the West Antarctic core-hole in December 2016.  The collaborating institutions (University of Washington and Penn State University) have agreed with NSF that the new tool will become the property of NSF., and on its return from Antarctica, it will reside with and be maintained by Ice Drilling Design and Operations (IDDO), which is NSF?s contractor providing tools and ice-drilling services for NSF-funded research projects.   The new tool will then be available to researchers who request its use by following standard NSF procedures.
