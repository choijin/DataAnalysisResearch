<AbstractNarration>The fifth Pacific Rim Conference on Mathematics (PRCM) will be held at Stanford University from June 28, 2010 through July 2, 2010. The organizing committee consists of Tai-Ping Liu and Richard Schoen. It will be a high-profile, broad-based conference covering a wide range of areas of mathematics which are well represented in universities on the Pacific Rim. The PRCM will have 10 sessions each with a plenary speaker and six session speakers. The sessions are in the following areas: 1) Algebraic Geometry, 2) Combinatorics, 3) Differential Geometry, 4) Electromagnetic Waves, 5) Functional Analysis, 6) Kinetic Equations and Gas Dynamics, 7) Mathematical Imaging, 8) Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations, 9) Number Theory, and 10) Random Systems and PDEs. The full list of organizers and speakers is available on the conference website at &lt;http://math.stanford.edu/PRCMindex.html&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PRCM was conceived in the middle 1990s by a group of mathematicians from over 10 major universities on the west coast of the United States, in Canada, China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Korea, and Australia. It has been held every three years since 1998 in various locations on the Pacific Rim. This summer's PRCM will be the first to be held in North America. &lt;br/&gt;One of the main reasons for initiating this meeting was the recognition that the Pacific Rim region is not only economically vibrant, but also becoming increasingly important in scientific research. The objectives are to present the latest trends in mathematical research to a wide audience and to develop stronger ties between mathematicians in the Pacific Rim region. We expect the PRCM to be attended by approximately 200 mathematicians from Pacific Rim universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Pacific Rim Conference On Mathematics is an international conference series. Toward the end of the last century, representatives from various mathematical research institutions recognized the importance of promoting cross-Pacific communications. The circumstances were such that the first four of these conferences were held in East Asia, specifically in Hong Kong, Taipei, and Shanghai. The most significant aspect of the Stanford meeting was to break this mold and hold the meeting in North America, making the conference series truly represent the Pacific Rim.    The Stanford Pacific Rim Conference On Mathematics strengthened the bond of the US mathematical community with other mathematical centers in the Pacific Rim regions. There were leading researchers participating in the meeting from all over the region; from Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, and Taiwan.   During the Stanford meeting, the organizers agreed on the organizing institutions for the following two conferences. It was agreed that Japan should organize the next one, as Japan is the next most active mathematical region after the US. Indeed, the 2013 Pacific Rim Conference On Mathematics was held in Hokkaido, Japan in June of 2013. The 2016  Pacific Rim Conference On Mathematics will be held in Seoul, Korea.   The Stanford meeting served an important role in making  the Pacific Rim Conference On Mathematics a truly international and high-impact conference series. The US played a pivotal role in the conference, with Stanford, UC Berkeley, and UCLA among the 17 Participating Institutions in The Pacific Rim Conference On Mathematics. After the 2010 Pacific Rim Conference On Mathematics, there was a follow-up workshop on kinetic theory.     Mathematicians from the US Participating Institutions will be actively involved with future Pacific Rim meetings by organizing sessions and presenting their work.
