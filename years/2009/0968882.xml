<AbstractNarration>Research in algebraic geometry is concerned with the solution sets &lt;br/&gt;to systems of algebraic equations, and it offers tools and models &lt;br/&gt;for non-linear problems across the mathematical spectrum. It now &lt;br/&gt;has numerous applications in the sciences and in engineering. This &lt;br/&gt;project is aimed at four specific directions: Spectrahedra and &lt;br/&gt;Orbitopes, Algebraic Statistics, Tropical Geometry, and &lt;br/&gt;Implicitization of Higher-Dimensional Varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectrahedra and Orbitopes are fundamental objects in convex &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry, an emerging interdisciplinary direction that &lt;br/&gt;focuses on convex bodies with a distinguished algebraic representation.&lt;br/&gt;It is driven by applications in convex optimization, especially in the &lt;br/&gt;theory of semidefinite programming. The project will cement the &lt;br/&gt;development of convex algebraic geometry, and it will lead to new &lt;br/&gt;semi-numerical algorithms for non-linear optimization problems with &lt;br/&gt;a special algebraic structure. Such problems arise frequently in  &lt;br/&gt;Algebraic Statistics. That area is concerned with statistical &lt;br/&gt;models that can be represented by polynomials in the model parameters. &lt;br/&gt;These include graphical models for both Gaussian and discrete random variables.&lt;br/&gt;The project will resolve fundamental questions concerning these models, and it&lt;br/&gt;promises novel computational tools for statistical inference. Tropical Geometry&lt;br/&gt;is a piecewise-linear version of algebraic geometry that is custom-taylored &lt;br/&gt;for modeling applied problems. The project is aimed at key open problems on &lt;br/&gt;the combinatorial side of the field. Implicitization in Higher Dimensions is&lt;br/&gt;a new paradigm for computer algebra, and it will lead to new tools for finding&lt;br/&gt;the defining equations of parametrically specified algebraic varieties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Algebraic geometry furnishes the geometric underpinnings of  non-linear algebra. While linear algebra is widely used as a foundational  tool in applied mathematics, computational science and engineering, the  use of non-linear methods has only recently been recognized as as equally   important, and this led to the development of Applied Algebraic Geometry.   In this field, one develops models that are based on polynomial equations  in several variables, and a key task is to compute solutions to such systems.     This project has made major contributions to the advancement of Applied  Algebraic Geometry, in particular as it pertains to Statistics and Optimization.  The PI has published 35 articles that make original contributions to arithmetic geometry, combinatorics, commutative algebra, computational biology, computer algebra, convexity, information theory ,finance, matrix theory, moduli spaces, multilinear algebra, numerical methods, tropical geometry, optimization, probability, real algebraic geometry, and statistics.     Concrete outcomes include new solution strategies for hard global optimization problems such as that of Structured Low-Rank Approximation,  and Euclidean Distance Minimization for a given Algebraic Variety.  Other results have a bearing on pure algebraic geometry as well, for instance the explicit tropicalization of moduli spaces, such as the  moduli space of marked del Pezzo surfaces and the moduli space of plane  quartic curves.       Within the context of this project, the PI trained 13 doctoral students and  numerous postdoctoral scholars.       Last Modified: 07/02/2014       Submitted by: Bernd Sturmfels]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
