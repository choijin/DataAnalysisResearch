<AbstractNarration>This research will examine how the efficiency of energy flow through food webs is affected by sunlight, nutrients, and predators. Sunlight and nutrients affect the chemical composition of algae, including the amounts and ratios of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus as well as essential fatty acids (EFAs). In addition, light and nutrients can determine which algal species are present, and their digestibility for herbivores. Variation in carbon:nutrient ratios, EFAs, and digestion resistance of algae can determine the production of herbivores, but little is known about how these effects propagate to animals at the top of the food chain, e.g., fish and other carnivores. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will conduct three large-scale experiments to investigate effects of light, nutrients, carnivore species, food web structure, and nutrient ratios on food chain efficiency. They will also develop next-generation, stoichiometrically-explicit computer models which will provide mechanistic understanding of the experimental results, and expand the scope of the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide critical information for decision-makers involved in water quality protection and fisheries management. For example, fisheries yields depend on food chain efficiency, specifically the proportion of algae production that is converted into fish or shellfish species harvested by humans; eutrophication results from the inefficient use of plant production by herbivores after excessive nutrient enrichment; carbon storage in deep waters and sediments (which reduces greenhouse gases in the atmosphere) is related to energy that is not consumed in pelagic food chains; and the concentrations of contaminants at each trophic level is affected by energy flow through food chains. In addition, many global-scale environmental problems, such as eutrophication and climate change, alter the supplies of light and nutrients, and can mediate food chain efficiency. In addition the project will provide numerous opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, who will be actively engaged in all aspects of the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this research was to investigate the generality of light and nutrient effects on food chain efficiency in aquatic ecosystems.  Studies of food chain efficiency are important to our understanding of food production in lakes and to our understanding of the stability of food webs in aquatic ecosystems under different conditions of climate and land use.  We conducted three experiments to test the potential drivers affecting food chain efficiency. In each experiment we focused on the interactions of predator type with the availability of light, nitrogen, and phosphorus, which are three environmental actors that often determine the productivity of lake ecosystems.  Our results showed that predator type was an important factor driving food chain efficiency.  Food chains where bluegill was the top carnivore were consistently higher in food chain efficiency under high light and high nutrient conditions. Cyanobacteria were most abundant in high phosphorus treatments and were a higher proportion of the community when phosphorus was high and light was low.  Nitrogen fixation and toxic microcystin production were strongly and positively correlated with the rate of primary production, which were elevated when light, phosphorus supply, and the ration of nitrogen to phosphorus supply were high. These findings support the idea that excess nitrogen, and a high nitrogen to phosphorus ratio, promotes cyanobacteria abundance, which leads to lower water quality and conditions that promote toxic algal blooms.   The project resulted in research training and experience for numerous students. Two master's students and three PhD students included this research as a major portion or as their entire thesis and dissertation. A total of 17 undergraduate students (15 females, 3 males and 4 minorities) have completed independent projects related to the research activities of this grant. All of the undergraduates presented their research at Miami University symposia focusing on undergraduate education. Eight of these undergraduates also presented their research at the Midwest Ecology and Evolution Conference. Five of these students were participants in the Miami REU program: Ecology in Human-Dominated Landscapes and another five undergraduate students wrote small proposals to obtain additional funding through Miami Research programs to promote undergraduate involvement in research (Doctoral-Undergraduate Opportunities for Scholarship Undergraduate Summer Scholar).    From 2011-2014, the PIs developed a laboratory excercise based on this research for an upper level Limnology class.  The class experiment focused on experiments testing effect of environmental conditions on aquatic ecosystems, and will be used to promote critical scientific thinking by students.  We have disseminated the results of our research to the scientific community through presentations in scientific meetings.  Since 2011 the PIs, graduate and undergraduate students gave 11 presentations at the national meetings of the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanographers and the Ecological Society of America; 11 presentations at regional scientific meetings; and 4 invited talks (Auburn University, University of Nevada-Reno, the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Germany, and the National Science Foundation).  Three journal manuscripts are currently in review for publication.  The scientific findings of the project will provide critical information for decision-makers involved in water quality protection and fisheries management. Fisheries yields depend on food chain efficiency, specifically the proportion of algae production that is converted into fish or shellfish harvested by humans.  In addition, excessive nutrient enrichment results from the inefficient use of plant production by herbivores, which can lead to lower water quality or toxic algal blooms.
