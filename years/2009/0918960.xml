<AbstractNarration>As the incidence of infectious diseases in both wildlife and human populations continues to rise, studies addressing the ecology of disease are becoming more important.  Too often, though, our understanding of pathogens and parasites in natural systems develops from studies abstracted from the complex ecological communities in which disease dynamics actually play out.  Recent evidence suggests that the presence/absence and relative abundance of different species in the biological community can substantially influence the outcome of host-parasite interactions.  However, changing the composition of the community can result in either an increase or decrease in disease risk, and the mechanisms responsible for these outcomes have been experimentally investigated in very few systems.  This research will experimentally investigate the role of community composition in modulating disease outcomes in a complex host-parasite system composed of snails, amphibians, and a trematode parasite.  A series of experiments will address how infection of parasite hosts is influenced by changes in the composition and relative abundance of multiple hosts, multiple parasite infectious stages and non-host competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will establish a collaborative research program between the laboratories of the PIs at Virginia Tech and Radford University (a predominately undergraduate institution 25 km from Virginia Tech) that will provide broader educational experiences for the students at both institutions.  The partnership between Virginia Tech and Radford University includes collaborative research projects, joint laboratory meetings, and support of graduate students at Virginia Tech and undergraduate student research at both universities. In addition, a teaching module on host-parasite interactions based on the research results will be developed for Ecology and Parasitology courses at Radford University and will be disseminated to the broader teaching community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many parasites and pathogens have several species of host organisms that they can infect. Ecologists now believe that the diversity and relative abundance of different host species in a region plays a major role in controlling pathogen transmission in nature.  A prominent theory in this field is called the "dilution effect", where communities with more host species (often including hosts that aren't as effective at transmitting the pathogen) often have reduced pathogen transmission compared to communities with just a few host species.  The dilution effect is an important idea because of current global losses in biodiversity, and the potential for those losses to result in increases in pathogen transmission and disease risk.  We studied these questions relating to the role of community context in parasite transmission in pond systems, namely with trematode parasites and their amphibian and snail hosts, though the concepts and results could apply to many wildlife and human diseases.  Our results suggest that variation in parasite infection can be explained by variation in host competency and host community assembly in terms of host density, but interestingly in a different way than predicted by the prominent dilution effect theory. Specifically, we found that total infection can increase with increasing host diversity if host species assemble additively in terms of density and are roughly equivalent in terms of host competency. The generality of our result will have to await broader investigations in other systems, but it suggests that the role of biodiversity in disease dilution is not a simple one.  We found that predators can have important impacts on host&ndash;parasite dynamics, as well. We experimentally examined the impact of predatory salamanders (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) and trematode parasites (Echinostoma trivolvis and Ribeiroia ondatrae) on short-term survival of wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica). Parasites and predators both significantly reduced tadpole survival in outdoor pools, but most interestingly, they acted synergistically; when parasites and predators were both present, mortality was higher than would be expected given their individual impacts. These dramatic results suggest that predators may alter transmission dynamics of trematodes in natural systems, and that a complete understanding of host&ndash;parasite interactions requires studying these interactions within the larger ecological framework of community interactions.  We also completed many smaller lab experiments and a large mesocosm experiment investigating the role played by Chaetogaster limnaei in the infection dynamics of pond trematodes. Chaetogaster is an oligochaete worm that lives on pond snails (the first and sometimes second intermediate hosts for our trematode parasites).  Chaetogaster is known to consume trematode infective stages, which is of interest for potentially controlling trematode parasite transmission in natural systems. We demonstrated that Chaetogaster can reduce infection of potential snail hosts, and determined how densities of parasites and symbionts alter the strength of this protective effect.  Our main broader impact was to establish a collaborative research program between the laboratories of PI Belden (Virginia Tech, a research university) and PI Wojdak (Radford University, a predominantly undergraduate institution).  One primary means of doing this was by having joint laboratory meetings each week during the summer field season, and having all the undergraduates from both universities working together and working with the graduate students and both PIs.  This resulted in a diverse and stimulating environment, promoting the exchange of ideas and advancing research goals.  We provided workshops to the undergraduates each summer on CV/resume crafting, applying to graduate school, data analysis and presentation, as well as discussing grant proposal writing and how science is funded in the US.
