<AbstractNarration>While hardware resources for computation and data storage are now abundant,   economic factors prevent specialized hardware security mechanisms from being   integrated into commodity parts. System owners are caught between the need to exploit   cheap, fast, commodity microprocessors and the need to ensure that critical security   properties hold.     This research will explore a novel way to augment commodity hardware after fabrication   to enhance secure operation. The basic approach is to add a separate silicon layer,   housing select security features, onto an existing integrated circuit. This 3-D Integration   decouples the function and economics of security policy enforcement from the   underlying computing hardware. As a result, security enhancements are manufacturing   options applicable only to those systems that require them, which resolves the   economic quandary. We plan to identify a minimal and realizable set of circuit-level   security capabilities enabled by this approach, which can be judiciously controlled by   the software layers. This will significantly assist in reducing both the software complexity   often associated with security mechanisms and system vulnerabilities.   This research introduces a fundamentally new method to incorporate security   mechanisms into hardware and has the potential to significantly shift the economics of   trustworthy systems. A broader impact will result through collaborative and educational   activities. Graduate and undergraduate student research associates will transfer   knowledge to future teachers, researchers and Information Assurance professionals;   and project publications will provide direct technical transfer to the embedded-systems   and hardware-design communities.</AbstractNarration>
