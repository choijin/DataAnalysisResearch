<AbstractNarration>This project aims to promote research and training at the highest level in topology and geometry. The program spans a broad area of geometry and topology. The theory of minimal surfaces, their structure and more generally evolution of surfaces. Riemann geometry, in particular Einstein metrics and the space of metrics. Symplectic topology  and relations to mirror symmetry, and low dimensional topology.  Homotopy theory and its ever closer ties to number theory. Gauge theory and its applicationsto low dimensional topology.  The MIT faculty involved in this program are leaders in these areas. The program, in addition to enhancing the research environment, will provide training and mentoring at all levels, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates. In addition the grant will allow the math department to support a undergraduate program for underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometry and topology remains a major theme in present-day mathematics, and actively interacts with other areas ranging from number theory to physics. New ideas that have entered the subject recently have contributed to the solution of long-standing open problems in mathematics. Moreover the areas of mathematics supported by this program impact many areas of practical importance. Minimal surfaces and evolution of surfaces have historically been important for material sciences, chemistry and chemical engineering.  Symplectic topology has had applications to understanding dynamical systems and lies at the heart of current work in high energy theoretic physics in the areas of string theory and mirror symmetry. Low dimensional topology has had applications to problems in biology in particular quantifying and understanding the knotted behavior of DNA as well as topological phases in matter.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant primarily supported training, from the undergraduate to the postdoctoral level, in geometry and topology, in the MIT Mathematics Department.  - 7 undergraduates from outside MIT (belonging to underrepresented groups) have been supported for summer research projects at MIT. At least 5 out of the 7 subsequently enrolled in graduate school.  - the program supported a large number of research projects by MIT undergraduates.  - the program supported curricular enrichment in the undergraduate program, though directed reading activities.  - 11 graduate trainees were supported for at least one semester;all of them have either completed their PhD already, or are on track to doing so. Those who have already completed their PhDs have gone on to employment either in academia (Princeton, U Texas, Utah, Stony Brook...) or elsewhere (edX, Humin Corp...)  -  The program supported 5 graduate student workshops, organized and run by graduate students under supervision by senior researchers. These were open to students from all institutions.  - The program supported 5 postdoctoral fellows. All have gone on to further employment in the academic sector.  Evaluation of the program impact by participants (only for shorter-term activities, not postdocs or graduate fellows) was carried out by questionaires, with the following questions:  (1)  Did the relevant activity introduce you to new areas of mathematics?  (2) Did it deepen your understanding of subjects that you already knew? (3) Did it improve your writing or communication skills?  On a scale of 0 (= not at all) to 3 (= very much so), the average response scores are:  (1) 2.8 (2) 2.6 (3) 2.1  According to the original design of the RTG, (1) and (2) were the primary goals for participants. The conclusion is that the activities have achieved the desired goal. For graduate students and postdocs, tracking their career progression (as described above) also indicates a successful outcome.
