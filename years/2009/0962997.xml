<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Translight/Starlight Project&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0962997&lt;br/&gt;PI: Tom DeFanti - UC San Diego&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Translight/Starlight team will be pursuing application experiments on international networks with 6 different activity areas.  These areas are:&lt;br/&gt; - Greenlight International - TL/SL will investigate monitoring for energy consumption in selected international-reach experimental networks.&lt;br/&gt; - SCCSnet - TL/SL will support the Science Cloud Communication Services Network by assisting projects that are developing high-performance communication services tailored for computational clouds used by data-intensive scientific applications. These projects are addressing the high-volume, high-performance national and international communication requirements of scientific computational clouds versus general consumer and enterprise clouds, which use the commodity Internet. &lt;br/&gt; - CineGrid ? TL/SL will help enable the production, use and exchange of very-high-quality digital media, including scientific collaborations and visualizations, over photonic networks. UCSD will serve as the lead on CineGrid activities. TL/SL funding will offset personnel time involved in conducting international trials, and for partial participant costs for the annual CineGrid conferences in 2010, 2011, and 2012, held at Calit2.&lt;br/&gt; - High-Performance Digital Media Network (HPDMnet) ? TL/SL will work with international partners to develop new services based on high-performance optical transport (i.e., optical multicast) of large-scale data streams, including high-resolution digital media streams, as well as new capabilities for high-volume scientific data. &lt;br/&gt; - iGENI (International GENI) ? TL/SL will connect existing StarLight resources with current GENI backbone transport resources.&lt;br/&gt; - SAGE - TL/S will help transition SAGE from a transformative research prototype to a hardened technology that provides production-quality, community-driven open services for visualization and collaboration utilizing shared national and international cyberinfrastructure, for the advancement of scientific research and education. Partners sites are in the US, Australia, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Contributions from this project have the potential to strengthen activities in network modeling, exploring leading edge green technology research, simulation, advanced imaging transmissions enabling the IRNC program to play a formative role in the emerging discipline of network science, and enhancing NSF's leading role in sustainable stewardship of cyberinfrastructure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will help IRNC operators better understand their networks by making more effective use of data they already collect as well as newer technologies for measurement and visibility of their networks. The data will have broad applicability to other researchers and pragmatic network operations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Large-scale facilities (such as supercomputers, accelerators, telescopes, and underwater sensor arrays) are an essential part of the global science and engineering enterprise, and supporting them is a major responsibility of NSF. Facilities may be centralized (e.g., Blue Waters and Large Hadron Collider) or distributed (e.g., XSEDE and the Ocean Observatories Initiative). They may incorporate computational infrastructure, multi-user instruments or networks of instruments, or other infrastructure, instrumentation and equipment. More and more, these facilities are incorporating large-scale networking in order to make Big Data available to virtual teams of researchers in a timely manner.  As all of science is not well served by one type of network or one network protocol, the TransLight/StarLight initiative focused on developing and testing new methods and technologies for customized network services and capabilities so that scientific researchers will be able to easily and quickly access these facilities and the Big Data they generate or archive, to ultimately make discoveries.  More specifically, TransLight/StarLight focused on: (1) e-science application and middleware experiments utilizing high-performance networks that connect U.S. researchers to international sites and/or collaborators; (2) international community partnerships, via involvement in conferences, workshops, meetings, publications, communication channels, and forums; (3) involvement with virtual teams of international researchers (such as high-energy physics, bioinformatics, atmospheric science, archaeology, and the arts and humanities, to name a few) to advance network architectures and services in support of end users; and, (4) early access to architectures and services, notably 100 Gigabit-per-second networks, to prototype and evaluate innovative services that will, in the coming years, enable optimal use by researchers. Also, TransLight/StarLight worked with industry to install and test prototype networking equipment on advanced Research &amp; Education network infrastructure.  To do its experiments, TransLight/StarLight relied on physical resources (high-performance optical networks and optical network exchanges) from multiple sources, including those funded by the NSF International Research Network Connections (IRNC) program, foreign Research &amp; Education Networks that connect their countries to the U.S., Federal agency networks, and major consortiums, such as the Global Lambda Integrated Facility (GLIF). TransLight/StarLight has had strong working relationships with members of the IRNC community on many activities related to the coordination and optimal implementation of advanced network circuits and services.  TransLight/StarLight has successfully helped advance knowledge and understanding within the high-performance computing and networking community, and has helped lead and motivate services for 21st-century e-science and computer science innovation by working with global cyberinfrastructure and virtual organizations that use and/or develop next-generation grid services. Results have been disseminated broadly, to enhance scientific and technological understanding, thereby benefiting U.S. academic institutions, industry, and government laboratories.
