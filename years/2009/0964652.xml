<AbstractNarration>Wireless telecommunications are undergoing substantial policy reforms in pursuit of better spectral efficiency. A key element in these reforms entails granting full property rights to spectrum license holders, thereby paving the way to secondary spectrum markets. Spectrum markets hold a remarkable potential to increase spectrum utilization by making it available to a larger fraction of public at lower cost. Yet, although a favorable regulatory framework has been in effect in the last few years, liquidity of spectrum markets is inhibited due to uncertainties perceived by spectrum license holders. These uncertainties stem from complex relationships between effects of electromagnetic interference and economic considerations. This research involves a constructive study of viability of spectrum markets by establishing methods and algorithms that render such markets profitable for their participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators focus on analytical study of profitability of spectrum markets, and its empirical verification. Main thrusts of the research program are: (i) fundamental elements of pricing and interference externalities for efficient and economically viable use of spectrum; (ii) algorithms for spot market use and real-time measurement-based pricing policies; (iii) empirical techniques for testing demand model specification, and formative models of demand-price relationships via experimental studies. This research is interdisciplinary and it is based on identifying incarnations of both novel and classical notions in economics in the specific context of wireless communications and spectrum markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research impacts legal and economic policies for the future wireless industry and provides a tool for assessing potentials of the secondary spectrum market.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  This project aimed at facilitating the full realization of secondary spectrum markets through constructive demonstration of their benefits to market participants. The project used formal methods to establish profitability of spectrum sharing and its insensitivity to parameters that are typically unknown or that would require extensive measurements. The project provided a platform to identify spectrum sharing policies that are profitable and built on the notion of profitability to describe possible competitive equilibria that may arise in prominent spectrum sharing modalities currently under consideration by regulatory bodies.  Key achievements of the project include the following:  1) Demonstration of the existence of a critical price value, the break-even price, that guarantees profitability for a license holder participating in a secondary spectrum market.  2) Provision of methods to compute bounds on the break-even price in general network topologies. The methods explicitly account for interference effects.  3) Design of adaptive, distributed control policies for the admission of secondary users in general topology networks, and derivation of explicit, closed-form expressions of these policies for the special case of acyclic network topologies.  4) Characterization of optimal spectrum access and pricing policies for preemptive secondary service provision.  5) Development of learning-based iterative techniques for revenue maximization when the demand function is unknown.  6) Characterization of price equilibria in markets of private commons service involving multiple providers competing for a common pool of secondary spectrum users: a. Under coordinated access, for general forms of secondary demand, the license holder with the lowest break-even price captures the entire market, as a result of a a price war. b. Under uncoordinated access, for general forms of secondary demand, proofs of existence and uniqueness of two critical prices for each provider: the break-even price and the market sharing price. The market sharing price is always greater than the break-even price, leading to a price interval in which a provider is both profitable and willing to share the market.  7) Design of analytical and numerical methods to establish guidelines on the amount of spectrum reservation required to maintain a competitive cellular telecommunication market.  8) Applications of the results to traffic and network models that are consistent with 4G architectures.  Broader Impacts  The project's main theme of profitability shed light on an important concept in economics and operations research.The literature in these two disciplines focus on profit maximization, and a principled approach with solid theoretical underpinnings is likely to attract attention to the issue of profitability that is central to market feasibility.  The project was central to the professional development of students, both at the graduate and undergraduate levels, that gained solid understanding of both wireless communications technologies and economic principles that guide the modalities in which they are available to the public.  Novel profitability-driven methods addressing fundamental issues in spectrum access, as established in this project, can spur growth in wireless devices and service industries in terms of products, jobs, and market size. Hence, technical insight and careful planning of the future of wireless communications play an important role in sustained growth in this sector. Anticipated benefits in this respect include more affordable and accessible network services in rural areas left outside business models of global players in the industry.
