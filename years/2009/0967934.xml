<AbstractNarration>0967934&lt;br/&gt;Barat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work which will be conducted by Profs. Barat and Gorun at New Jersey Institute of Technology is to design active catalyst species which are in essence miniature reaction vessels. This feature makes them similar to enzyme catalyst sites. The PIs intend to use perfluorinated phthalocyanines as hydrophobic vessels surrounding hydrophilic metal centers for the aerobic oxidation of mercaptans to disulfides. These perfluorinated phthalocyanines should be more resistant to damage by catalytically-produced oxygen radicals than other oxidation catalysts, which is another feature in common with enzymes.  The work proposed is a straightforward study of the influence of ligand structure on catalyst activity, and stability. The authors propose to study the kinetics of the homogeneous radical-based oxidation, as well as evaluating heterogenized versions of the catalyst (Cobalt-based phthalocyanines coordinated to SiO2 through imidazolyl groups).&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to provide catalysts for oxidation of molecules which are more "green" than previous catalysts by allowing the use of air for the reaction without the catalyst being destroyed by the oxygen. This is done by replacing reactive C-H bonds with unreactive C-F bonds in the catalyst species. Further fine tuning of the catalyst is possible by using organic chemistry modifications of the catalyst. The investigators have chosen mercaptan oxidation, now used to remove sulfur from gasoline, as the first reaction for study. This is a useful benchmark, and success will allow projection of the concept to other catalysts and reactions. These studies will be of interest to the community enrolling at NJIT, and the PIs will involve undergraduates in the research program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report           Award: 0967934            July 2014   Introduction   The environmental and health benefits derived from reducing the sulfur content of fuels is well documented.  Lower sulfur fuels result in less acid rain, reduced smog, and lower concentrations of fine particulates.  In fact, the EPA recently announced a ceiling sulfur content target in gasoline of 10 parts-per-million (ppm) by 2017.   The agency already requires the sulfur content of highway diesel fuel to not exceed 15 ppm.   These ultra low sulfur contents in motor fuels present significant challenges to petroleum refiners.  The generally more severe processing conditions required reaching these low sulfur levels sometimes results in a parallel lowering of the quality of the parent hydrocarbon stream.  For example, catalytic hydrotreating of petroleum naphtha, where the sulfur is removed as hydrogen sulfide by a heterogeneous catalytic reaction with hydrogen, can reduce the octane rating of this stream, thus requiring even more and costly upgrading before the naphtha can be blended into gasoline.  Therefore, the research task is to find catalytic approaches whereby the sulfur content can be lowered without severely impacting the parent hydrocarbon stream quality.   For valuable, lighter streams like catalytic cracker naphtha, milder processing conditions are preferred wherein the sulfur compounds &ndash; primarily thiols (mercaptans) &ndash; are removed as disulfides by reaction with oxygen (from air).  Organo-metallic, homogeneous catalysts catalyze these processes.   The oxidation of thiols to disulfides is also important biologically and industrially. Corrosive and malodorous thiols exist as contaminants in wastewater discharge from mining facilities, pulp and paper mills, and tanneries. Due to its corrosive nature, thiols in gas products can also inhibit catalyst activity for some downstream processes.  This research project produced and demonstrated novel homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of thiols to disulfides.  These catalysts use an organo-metallic molecular structure &ndash; phthalocyanines (PcÆs) in this study &ndash; wherein a transition metal &ndash; cobalt in this case &ndash; is coordinated at the center of a complex organic ring-like structure.  This metal atom is the heart of the catalyst.  By attaching selected substituents (e.g. fluorine atoms) on the outer perimeter of the molecular ring, the catalytic properties of the central metal atom are enhanced.  This structure offers a unique pathway for the oxidation chemistry to proceed at relatively mild processing conditions for thiol removal.      Major Accomplishments of this Project  Construction of a small bench-scale reactor system, with gas chromatography / flame ionization detection (GC/FID) analysis of extracted liquid samples, to obtain kinetic data for the liquid-phase reaction of thiols with dissolved O2 homogeneously catalyzed by various PcCo catalysts.    Obtained original kinetic data from 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) and 4-fluorobenzenethiol (4-FBT) oxidation with O2 and air in tetrahydrofuran / aqueous NaOH solutions      Without       any PcCo catalyst  Alternately catalyzed with three       PcCo catalysts of increasing fluorine content:  H16PcCo, F16PcCo, and F64PcCo     Interpreted the original kinetic data, including elementary mechanisms, and obtained several reaction kinetic and thermodynamic parameters.      Correlated the reactivity to homogeneous catalyst structure including Lewis acidity and steric hindrance.    The above accomplishments for the homogeneous catalysts demonstrated that thiols-based sulfur can be chemically removed at mild processing conditions.  The activity and longevity of these catalysts can be enhanced by increasing their fluorine content.    Synthesized Pc catalysts chemically anchored, via an imidazole bridge, to a heterogeneous silica support.      Characterized these heterogeneous catalysts using spectros...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
