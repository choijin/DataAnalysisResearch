<AbstractNarration>The marine facility (MARFAC) at the University of California San Diego will host the 3rd annual workshop for the Large Facilities Office of NSF.  The previous two meetings have been hosted by the MPS directorate.  The purpose of the workshop is to bring together representatives of all NSF large facilities to discuss common issues and learn from each other's experience.  The emphasis is on facility operation rather than scientific research.  Specific goals include discussions of operating experiences, development of personal contacts between facilities, and education on current issues and concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Intellectual Merit: These efforts contribute to the advancement of knowledge and understanding of large facilities operations by facilitating dissemination of information regarding the efficient and safe management of facilities, which are important parts of the infrastructure that supports research, education, and training in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Broader impacts include enhancing operational capabilities of the shared use facilities to support a diverse group of participants, as well as sharing experiences to broaden the ability of the facilities to work efficiently and safely while serving the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
