<AbstractNarration>With NSF support, Dr. Tina Thurston and colleagues from the United States, Sweden, and Great Britain will conduct three and a half years of fieldwork on Sweden's Småland Plateau, seeking to understand how autonomous pastoral peoples are encapsulated by states and incorporated into state political and economic systems, often against their collective will. Local-state relations in Småland were "high-conflict" in nature: successive phases of independence, confederacy/hegemony, and forced "pacification" with varying impacts on ethnic identity, political cohesion, and economic strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between AD 600 and 1550, twelve Plateau polities were incorporated into the Svear (later Swedish) state. Sketchy ethnohistories concern activities of social and political elites, incorporating real people and events and politically embroidered legends supporting later Svear agendas and identity. Of the local, ethnically-distinct forest pastoralist population, virtually nothing is known, except that the early historic state recorded non-cooperation, tax evasion, and "illegitimate" treaties with Sweden's enemies, culminating in 16th century armed rebellion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cereal cultivation was impracticable on the marginal Plateau, though pastoralism was viable, as was exploitation of iron ore and wood, for charcoal used in smelting. To exploit the resources of this hostile region, beginning around AD 1100, state power was increased through sequential establishment of local state outposts, concurrent with rising taxation and labor demands. Did economic shifts accompany new demands? Was there intensification?  If so, was it broad-based or limited to areas near royal centers? Did animal production increase, were new species added, were cereals introduced? Did quality of life and livelihood change over time? The project will document conditions as the state brought pressures to bear, significant enough to foment violent conflict. Critical to questions about this largely prehistoric context is the timing and extent of agricultural expansion waves, recognizable through the establishment of pioneering hamlets and the opening of new forest pasturage, assessed through datable sites and clearance features. Pedestrian survey, soil chemical survey, and test excavations will establish dwelling, farming, and industry locales, AD 500 to 1550, within the former autonomous Småland kingdoms of Tveta and Vista, determining sites appropriate for further investigation. Extant and new faunal assemblages, microregional pollen profiles, macrobotanical analyses, and the survey and dating of iron production features will further chart economic change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate intellectual contribution is a case study of state-pastoralist relationships, as contemporary and historic pastoralists have played important roles in state politics and economies, but typically have contempt for central authority and are unafraid of the subsequent conflicts, due to strong ethnic identity and sociopolitical cohesion. Pastoral peoples can have significant power, and the sequence through independence, hegemony, encapsulation, and subsumption is neither inevitable nor unidirectional. Most "encapsulation sequences" occurred long before the social sciences developed, and while contemporary outcomes are much-studied, the process is largely undocumented. The Plateau, with its full sequence, is ideal for studying the relationships between successive generations of rulers and subjects. The broader impacts of continued archaeological training and research opportunities afforded a multinational student cohort will have a positive impact on general and region-specific material and theoretical understandings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  Any examination of conflicts in the modern world is sure to turn up a number of seemingly endless problems linked to relationships between governments of state societies and pastoralists: people whose economy stems from animal and animal products (dairy, textile), but who may have other economic activities, and who may be nomadic, semi-nomadic, or sedentary.              The contentious relationships between pastoralists and cereal agriculturalists are well known.  We have only to look at our own recent history of tension between farmers and ranchers in the American West - the so-called "range wars" - to understand the basic livelihood conflicts that create them.              Clashes also occur between state governments and pastoralists over tax evasion, scofflaw behavior, and sometimes armed violent conflicts, especially where colonialism required conquered people to conform to new obligations and expectations, ways of organizing and participating, often at odds with long-term traditions.  Historically, state authorities sought to crush resistance, not ease tension, resulting in mutual anger and outrage over mistreatment and mistrust.  Project Rationale  The 'pacification' of resistant pastoralists by state societies  often occurred in ancient state formation sequences, or in  16th-19th and early 20th century contexts, when events were not documented  systematically, today discussed only as post mortems of local cultures after a process called encapsulation,  in which autonomous or semi-autonomous groups are slowly surrounded by  the state, geographically and administratively, until their eventual  incorporation within the state's control apparatus.  In effect, the  state is built up and around them without their full realization, until  it has progressed to too far reject, ending with a subsumed society --  or a violent conflict.  Pastoralists and the State in Iron Age and Medieval Sweden uses the period of AD 500 - 1550 in Sweden as a case study investigating violent local-state conflicts centered around identity, autonomy, representation, and taxation. As autonomous  agropastoralists on the Sm&aring;land Plateau, a harsh, agriculturally impoverished region, were incorporated into the developing state, they were slow to comply with laws and taxation. A long history of conflict with authorities eventually culminated in a major armed rebellion. Better perspective on problems igniting conflict today is achieved by studying an entire milennium before, during and after encapsulation.  Research Strategies and Methods   Despite substantive prior archaeological and environmental work, local  scientists have never studied these issues in a systematic manner. Thus,  we and our local Swedish museum partners have mutual collaborative  goals. The just-concluded project assembled indicators of past climate and vegetation, established settlement locations, livelihood conditions, and economic activities at various times in the sequence. Work in four areas yielded insight on people living in closer and further proximity to state authority, contrasting highland and lowland, infertile and fertile, peri-urban and rural regions, with different production and taxpaying capacities, allowing evaluation of farming changes under increasing state demands, until hostilities became a viable alternative.  The four areas are  - Visings&ouml;, a flat, fertile Island where  the King of Sweden and powerful aristocrats resided during encapsulation.  - Olmstad/Sk&auml;rstad Valley,  close to Visings&ouml;, with both lower, fertile regions and high infertile  regions.  - Bredestad Valley, a much more distant highland valley.  - a peri-urban  highland south of the town of J&ouml;nk&ouml;ping where iron production and forestry activity was high.  Fieldwork   The project is a Phase I 'discovery', to be followed with a Phase II. Between 2009-12, we successfully completed archaeological survey and testing through geochemical sampling, surface artifac...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
