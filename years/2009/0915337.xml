<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: CSR:Small:Collaborative Research: Combining Static Analysis and&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic Run-time Optimization for Parallel Discrete Event&lt;br/&gt;Simulation in Many-Core Environments&lt;br/&gt;Institution: SUNY at Binghamton&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 07/06/09&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how a new processor paradigm (multi-core architectures)&lt;br/&gt;changes the way Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) is done. This topic is&lt;br/&gt;important given the wide use of simulation and the emergence of multi-core&lt;br/&gt;architectures. PDES is likely to play an increasingly important role in discrete event&lt;br/&gt;simulation as Moore?s Law is sharply curtailed and explicit parallelism becomes the&lt;br/&gt;major avenue for improving performance of sequential applications. Improving PDES&lt;br/&gt;performance translates to improved.&lt;br/&gt;Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is widely used for performance evaluation in many&lt;br/&gt;application domains. The fine grained nature of PDES causes its performance and&lt;br/&gt;scalability to be limited by communication latency. The emergence of multi-core&lt;br/&gt;architectures and their expected evolution into manycore systems offers potential relief&lt;br/&gt;to PDES and other fine grained parallel applications because the cost of communication&lt;br/&gt;within a chip is dramatically lower than conventional networked communication. Absent&lt;br/&gt;this dominant effect, PDES performance will be determined by issues such as load&lt;br/&gt;balancing, synchronization and optimism control, and the choice and configuration of&lt;br/&gt;various other algorithms and data structures of the simulator. Operation in a manycore&lt;br/&gt;environment introduces new system tradeoffs that must be effectively balanced by the&lt;br/&gt;system software. Primarily, the pressure on the memory system and resilience to load&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations will emerge as critical issues that we address in the proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the more predictable nature of communication cost in this environment (due in&lt;br/&gt;part to the more frequent synchronization possible between nearby cores) can be&lt;br/&gt;exploited, especially by static analysis, for effective simulation.&lt;br/&gt;As multi-cores become the default microprocessor architecture, applications that are&lt;br/&gt;performance constrained must evolve to use parallelism to take advantage of the&lt;br/&gt;resources available on the cores. This project?s new PDES can have a significant&lt;br/&gt;impact on a number of applications that rely on discrete event simulations. The PIs plan&lt;br/&gt;to incorporate the research results into a graduate level course on parallel simulation&lt;br/&gt;techniques and to involve undergraduate students in the project.</AbstractNarration>
