<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate the production of robust, versatile probes based on Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer to Quantum Dots (BRET-Qdot®) technology.  The main goal of this project is to develop a platform for target-directed in vivo imaging of tissue, such as whole tumors and organs, in animal models.  To accomplish this goal, biotinylated targeting agents for the detection of important biomarkers, in combination with BRET-Qdot® probes with streptavidin functionality, will be developed to provide one-step target detection.  The probes will represent the range of molecular sizes used for a majority of assays, from small molecules to antibodies, thus enabling detection of virtually any cell surface target molecule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a sensitive probe reagent that will be broadly applicable to a wide range of preclinical assays including in vivo imaging of tumors, organs and various anatomical structures. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other diseases, there is increasing interest in advancing from cell-based assays to in vivo imaging of disease states in small animal models. The targeted BRET-Qdot® platform will provide a cost effective,convenient and effective alternative to competing fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging probe technology.</AbstractNarration>
