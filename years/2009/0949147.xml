<AbstractNarration>Hidden diversity in parmelioid lichens (Ascomycota)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 1.5 million species of mushrooms are estimated to exist in nature. With approximately 100,000 described species, only a small fraction is currently known. A large group of mushrooms forms associations with algae and bacteria, and the resulting associations are called lichens. The delimitation of species in this group of mushrooms has been based on morphological characters. There is a growing body of evidence from molecular studies that the number of existing species in this group of mushrooms is underestimated. However, understanding the diversity of lichens is pivotal for our understanding of overall biodiversity. Lichens are important indicators for climate change, air pollution, forest health and potential sources of antibiotics and biocontrol agents. In this project the investigators will use molecular data: 1) to assess the diversity of species in a group of lichens common in North America and 2) to understand the evolution of this group of lichens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A postdoctoral researcher will be trained and undergraduate students will participate in summer-intern programs. The PI will also participate in public lecture series and assist in developing exhibits at the Field Museum of Natural History. High school visits are designed to bring modern research into the classrooms to attract the future generation of scientists. The international nature of these collaborations will foster initiatives to develop a worldwide network of researchers. Also, results of this project will be disseminated through web sites.</AbstractNarration>
