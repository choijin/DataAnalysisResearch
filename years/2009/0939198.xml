<AbstractNarration>Studies show that "distance matters" in the sense that geographic, temporal, and cultural differences lead to software engineering coordination and control problems that differ qualitatively and quantitatively from those in co-located development.  Nonetheless, while software development has become a global enterprise, computer science education so far remains largely parochial in course content and student experience.  This CPATH project is establishing a self-sustaining, international community of educators committed to teaching key computational thinking skills in the context of the human problems of communication, coordination, and interdisciplinary coordination in globally distributed software development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key premise of this project is that the challenges of globally distributed projects are an ideal context for students to develop and value computational thinking skills such as abstraction, modularization, and formalization.  The project will gather and develop a common collection of relevant pedagogic materials, and assemble the necessary infrastructure for software engineering project courses in which students work in globally distributed teams.  A set of community-building workshops will bring together parties from universities, industry, and professional organizations to foster collaboration, generate ideas, share experience, and improve common pedagogical assets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revitalizing computer science education to encompass globally distributed software development is necessary to prepare the U.S. workforce and maintain leadership in the future of software engineering. This includes fostering cultural understanding and sensitivity in the practical exercise of internationally collaborative work. In addition to developing pedagogical materials and infrastructure, this CPATH project also addresses systematic dissemination, formation of teaching partnerships, and other collaboration between academic institutions and industry. By lowering barriers to adoption and participation it will grow the teaching community, educate more students, and include universities in underserved communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Software development today is a global enterprise. Leadership in the future software industry requires learning to manage the technical, business, and social context of globally distributed software development (DSD) projects that span time zones, continents, and cultures. Traditional computer science pedagogy provides little opportunity for students to learn the necessary skills for software development in a global setting. Our goal is to build and sustain a community of educators who will co-teach courses in which student teams are geographically distributed among collaborating institutions.  We have brought together collaborators and like-minded software engineering researchers and educators from North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America to develop approaches, curriculum, and course materials for distributed software project courses, to share experiences, and to better understand how the substantial challenges of teaching internationally distributed project courses can be met.   These community-building efforts included a series of three successful workshops held in conjunction with the leading research conference in software engineering.  These workshops, attended by world leaders in research and education in global software development, produced a number of published experience reports and position papers as well as less formal compilations of discussion notes.  No single approach to internationally distributed project courses emerged as appropriate to all situations.  For example, approaches that work well for graduate students distributed around Europe, within only two time zones and connected by very high quality video conferencing, may not work so well for a mix of undergraduate and graduate students in Ames, Iowa and Jilin, China, separated by many time zones and connected by less dependable communications.  Nevertheless we have identified broad themes and principles apply to both, with variations to suit the situation.      With our collaborators, we have refined our approaches through several pilot offerings of courses teaming U.S. students with students in Asia and Latin America.  The curriculum and teaching materials we have developed are available on a project web site.  Moreover, the community of researchers and educators we brought together have consistently expressed their wish to continue to develop these approaches, share experience, and encourage more universities to collaborate in offering globally distributed software engineering project courses.
