<AbstractNarration>Dr. Donald Lamb of the University of Chicago will undertake a theoretical program to comprehensively and systematically validate current models of Type Ia supernovae, which are the explosions of white dwarf stars experiencing mass transfer from a nearby red giant.  He and his group will carry out hundreds of high-fidelity, three-dimensional, whole-star simulations that include a wide variety of input model parameters. They will also use an integrated simulation pipeline to construct high-quality model light curves and spectra. The proposed effort will leverage the emergence of the Flash Center as a leader in this field and the extensive experience of personnel in the Center in conducting large and complex simulations of Type Ia supernovae.  The FLASH code, developed by this group, is a highly capable, fully modular, extensible, community code that scales to 100K processors and has been used for a variety of problems by more than 300 scientists around the world.  Their Phoenix, SEDONA, and LANL radiation transport codes and accompanying data management software, which has also been developed by the Flash Center, monitors the execution of the simulations, automatically transfers the data generated by the simulations to mass storage, incorporates a scientific data analysis pipeline, and provides an interface that allows astrophysicists doing the simulations to keep track of and manipulate all the data generated by the simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations using Type Ia supernovae as "standard candles" revealed that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating and led to the discovery of dark energy. Understanding dark energy ranks among the most compelling problems in physical science. The goals of several large future projects, including the Dark Energy Survey the Joint Dark Energy Mission and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope are, in part, to determine the properties of dark energy. Most scientists in the field believe this goal will require a better understanding of the explosion mechanism, more accurate simulations of the explosions, and quantification of the uncertainties in the predictions made by these simulations. This group will also engage in several activities in education and public outreach.  They will collaborate with staff at Chicago's Adler Planetarium to create museum exhibits that help foster public education about supernova science, and will continue their cooperation with broadcast media production companies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project advanced our understanding of thermonuclear-powered supernovae, which involve the nuclear explosion of white dwarf stars and are among the most energetic explosions in the universe.  It did so by (1) establishing important properties of nuclear combustion, including the property that the rate of burning is independent of the flame speed if the energy released by the burning makes the fluid within the flame turbulent; (2) showing a particular model (the "gravitationally confined detonation model") could account for the full range of observed luminosities of these events; and (3) showing a variant of the model in which the white dwarf star fails to detonate could account for a newly discovered class of underluminous thermonnuclear-powered supernovae.   The project led to the creation of a beyond state-of-the-art computer code for calculating how radiation flows through the expanding white dwarf matter produced in the supernova explosion, and therefore how these events look to astronomers.  This code will be openly available to everyone, once it its fully tested.  The project also taught young researchers how to develop computer codes that can use the world's most powerful computers, to use these codes to model thermonuclear-powered supernovae using computer simulations, and to check whether the models can explain observed thermonuclear-powered supernova by comparing the results of the computer simulations with observations.
