<AbstractNarration>Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) proposes to support technical services on R/V Pelican, a 105? general purpose research vessel operated by the consortium as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  They request support only for basic services; they will provide one technician on each seagoing research project. In addition, the technical services group will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.</AbstractNarration>

This section functions within the Marine Operations Division at the Institution. The two Marine Technicians in this group report directly to the Marine Superintendent who in turn reports to the Executive Director.   Both Marine Technicians assume the major responsibilities for the management of this group. It is their duty to schedule the daily activities in this section, execute maintenance and calibration schedules for the various pieces of equipment in the pool of shared use equipment, and perform repairs and upgrades to the pool equipment. They are also responsible for recommending improvements to the marine technical capabilities of the ship. The Marine Technicians rotate on and off the ship and contend with the shore base duties as necessary. At sea, the Marine Tech is responsible for typical tech duties including maintenance and operation of scientific sampling gear, and providing aid and assistance to the science users of the vessel.   The R/V Pelican was designed and outfitted to conduct a variety of oceanographic research missions. The reliability, utility and seaworthiness of this vessel have been well demonstrated. The R/V Pelican successfully conducts scientific trawling, large box core sampling, thirty-foot piston cores, shallow seismic surveys, current meter array and benthic boundary array deployment and recovery. The R/V Pelican has also successfully conducted plankton sampling, hydrographic casts with CTD-rosette system and underway sampling with towed water sampling systems.   The R/V Pelican is operated as an Oceanographic Research Vessel as designated by the United States Coast Guard and is maintained as an American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Load Line vessel. The Consortium is a member UNOLS and the R/V Pelican is a designated UNOLS vessel. The vessel is available for legitimate research and education programs of Consortium members, state and federal agencies, other nonprofit groups, and oceanographic industries.
