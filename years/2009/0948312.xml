<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work would use onshore geologic evidence from the Nicoya Peninsula to address basic questions related to subduction along a 100-km-long part of the Middle America Trench. The work includes the following components: (1) Paleoseismology: This part of the project will investigate pre-historic earthquake size and recurrence using the stratigraphy and paleoecology of an estuary. (2) Paleogeodesy: As part of the paleoseismic investigation, the study would investigate relative sea level change on the Nicoya Peninsula to assess patterns of vertical ground motion during intervals between earthquakes.  (3) Morphotectonics and long-term uplift: The study will test the relationship of long-term deformation to earthquake generation.   All of these techniques will be combined to define the pre-historic rupture behavior along the subduction zone.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project includes the training of a Ph.D. student. Undergraduate students will participate in the field program.  There is a large component of international collaboration with colleagues in Costa Rica.  A workshop for students from the US and Costa Rica will be organized, and a field school for the students will be held at the research site.  The study is important for understanding seismic hazards in Costa Rica. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

During the past decade alone, more than a quarter-million people have lost their lives to great subduction earthquakes and tsunami in Sumatra (2004, M9.3), Chile (2010, M8.8), and Japan (2011, M9.0).

Geomorphic and stratigraphic analysis of these features is a powerful tool for unraveling the past earthquake history of convergent margin coastlines. Understanding how earthquake induced changes in land-level affect the long-term growth and decay of coastal topography is also a fundamental question in the field of tectonic geomorphology.  An excellent place to study these processes is the Nicoya Peninsula on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, Central America (Figs. 1-3). The Nicoya Peninsula is unique because it is one of the few landmasses along the Pacific Rim located directly above the seismogenic zone of a subduction megathrust fault.

Project Outcomes:  Geomorphic, paleo-geodetic, and paleoseismic studies conducted as part of this NSF-funded research project resulted in substantial improvements in our understanding of fore-arc deformation associated with the Nicoya seismogenic zone. This research reveals upper plate deformation patterns that provide important clues about seismogenic zone geometry and the periodicity of megathrust earthquakes. Our new model for margin segmentation and coastal uplift along the Nicoya Peninsula (Fig. 5) is consistent with a range of other independent observations from seismologic, geodetic, and geologic investigations.

These results are consistent with geophysical observations that indicate segmentation of the Nicoya seismogenic zone related to along-strike changes in the characteristics of the subducting plate. Variable upper-plate uplift along the Nicoya segment may reflect differences in subducting-plate roughness, thermal structure, fluid flow, and seismogenic-zone locking (up-dip/down-dip limits).
