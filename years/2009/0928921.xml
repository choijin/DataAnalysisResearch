<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The Texas Southern University project is developing an effective pedagogy for incorporating interactive virtual and remote laboratories into engineering and technology education at the undergraduate level. The full development of such a framework will ultimately have an impact across all STEM disciplines; a principal outcome being the enhancement of integration of research and education. A target goal of the project is its potential to effect increase in the recruitment, enrollment, retention and graduation of under-represented populations from engineering, information technology, computer science, and computing-related programs. The effort is expected to have a long-term impact through the establishment of a sustainable inter-institutional infrastructure to implement effective utilization of the developed remotely accessible laboratory frame. The successful development of a virtual and remotely accessible laboratory will set up a model for other departments, such as the Industrial Engineering Technology and Transportation Studies departments, as well as for other institutions.  Hands-on education in these virtual lab facilities will enhance the training students need to be prepared for the engineering and technology workforce and for graduate school.</AbstractNarration>
