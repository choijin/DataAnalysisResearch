<AbstractNarration>Trade Liberalization in a World of Heterogeneous Firms: Theoretical and Quantitative Results &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The applied general equilibrium models used to predict the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement on trade flows failed to capture the explosion of trade that occurred subsequently and the accompanying redistribution of trade across industrial sectors. The analysis of disaggregated trade flows between Canada, Mexico, and the United States shows that much of the increase in trade has been trade in goods not previously exported or exported very little - what is known as the extensive margin of trade. This proposal shows that mechanically incorporating this insight into crude projections of North American trade patterns would have produced significantly better predictions of the pattern of trade following the enactment of NAFTA than did multisectoral applied GE models. The data suggest that capturing the extensive margin of trade is important for understanding the impacts of trade policy, which implies that models that generate extensive margin growth are needed. The proposed research will use advances in the firm-level theory of trade to build models that are suitable for policy analysis. The initial aim of the project is to evaluate the properties of models based on two types of industrial structures: monopolistic competition with entry costs, as in Melitz (2003) and perfect competition, as in Eaton and Kortum (2002). Constructing models flexible enough to be estimated for policy analysis requires generalizing the standard theories. Based on Kehoe and Ruhl (2009b), the models are extended to include multiple dimensions of firm heterogeneity and generalized distributions over underlying productivity. A mapping scheme is developed to match the firm-level decisions in the model to the product-level and industry-level aggregates in the data. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;To inform the policy debate over free trade and protectionism, economists need to better understand the impact of trade on different industries. The proposed research develops models that transform the firm-level trade models popular in current research into models useful for policy analysis. Methodologically, these sorts of models will allow economists to analyze the impact of policy on the structures of industries. Currently, the United States is negotiating free trade agreements with several Latin American countries, and a free trade agreement with South Korea waits to be approved by the legislatures in each country. Successful trade negotiations require careful evaluation of the impact of trade policy on individual industrial sectors. Without an accurate understanding of the distributional impacts of trade policy, it is difficult to advise policy makers and to inform the public on the merits of such liberalization policies</AbstractNarration>

We find, for example, that 10 percent of trade growth in post-NAFTA North America is accounted for by countries trading goods which they had previously not traded, or traded very little.  In another example, these newly-traded goods account for 30 percent of the growth in U.S.-Korea trade.

The industries that gain from trade-creating policies will not always be industries that were important exporting industries before the change in policy.

We have also applied this method to an analysis of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement.  Our empirical research shows that different kinds of goods respond differently to changes in policy. In theoretical models, we associate a good with the firm that produces it.  Differences across firms---firm heterogeneity---then lead to differences in the response to policy that we observe in the data.  An important way in which firms differ is in their productivity: Some firms are better at producing than others.  As part of this project, we have developed a model of heterogeneous firm who must decide whether to enter a market, how much to produce, and when to exit a market.  In the model, a country grows (becomes richer) when less productive firms exit markets and are replaced by more productive firms.  We show that when the costs of starting a new business are high or when it is difficult to acquire a loan, this replacement of bad firms with good firms slows down, slowing growth in the country.  An implication of this research is that the two barriers to entry---explicit costs of entry and a lack of borrowing opportunities---reinforce each other: If starting a firm is costly, being able to borrow is even more important.  Understanding the ways heterogeneous firms are affected by different kinds of policy is important if we are to develop ways to reverse barriers to entry, and improve the growth rates of countries.  In a less technical report, co-PI Kehoe and I discuss these ideas while comparing a fast-growing country with a country whose growth has stagnated: China and Mexico.  My work on heterogeneous agent models as part of this project continued with an analysis of the impact of U.S. antidumping policies on imports.  The implementation of trade liberalization has left countries with few policy tools to restrict imports.  One policy that is still widely used is the antidumping duty.  Antidumping duties are essentially firm-level tariffs applied to firms who are selling goods into the United States at prices deemed to be unfair, which typically means prices that are very low.   Heterogeneous firms who differ in their productivity will face different levels of exposure to antidumping penalties.  The theoretical model shows how antidumping policy has a negligible impact on the small, relatively unproductive, firms that export to the United States, but has the greatest effect on the large, relatively productive, firms that charge low prices and export large quantities to the United States. This result implies that antidumping policy is n...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
