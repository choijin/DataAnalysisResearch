<AbstractNarration>In planning for ocean science beyond the next decade, the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology (JSOST) is evaluating the current status and future needs of the nation's research infrastructure. Given current struggles to maintain, operate, and upgrade major infrastructure elements while maintaining a robust research portfolio, a strategic plan is needed for future investments to ensure that new facilities provide the greatest value, least redundancy, and highest efficiency in terms of operation and flexibility to incorporate new technological advances. Infrastructure represents a major investment that requires thorough review and consideration to support the development of the most critical technologies. The ability of the U.S. to conduct ocean research in the future will depend on an insightful analysis of the major upcoming scientific and policy questions and assessment of the technology and facilities required to answer those questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Research Council will assemble an expert committee to provide advice and a perspective from the worldwide ocean community on the types of U.S. ocean infrastructure that will facilitate research in 2030, including advice as to what criteria may be most appropriate for setting priorities. The committee will identify major research questions anticipated to be at the forefront of ocean science in 2030 based on national and international assessments, input from the worldwide scientific community, and ongoing research planning activities. Next, the committee will define categories of infrastructure that should be included in planning for the nation's ocean research infrastructure of 2030 and that will be required to answer the major research questions of the future. In addition, the committee will recommend ways in which the federal agencies can maximize the value of investments in ocean infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
