<AbstractNarration>The "Alabama Alliance for Students with Disabilities in STEM" is a collaborative effort involving Auburn University, Tuskegee University, Alabama State University, and Auburn University at Montgomery, Central Alabama Community College, Southern Union Community College, the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind, and six school districts in East-Central Alabama: Lee, Chambers, Elmore, Montgomery, Macon, and Tallapoosa County school systems.  The Alliance has the following four major goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal 1: Increase the Quality of Students with Disabilities Completing Associate and Baccalaureate Degrees in STEM Disciplines;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal 2: Increase the Number of Students with Disabilities Completing Associate and Baccalaureate Degrees in STEM Disciplines and entering STEM graduate degrees or STEM workforce;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal 3: Increase the Number of Students with Disabilities Completing Graduate Degrees in STEM Disciplines; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal 4: Increase the number of high school students with disabilities going to college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique Alliance, which includes two Historically Black Universities, Tuskegee University and Alabama State University, builds upon established STEM bridge programs to include female and minority students with disabilities.  The Alabama Alliance has an internal evaluation team and an external evaluator who will lead the independent formative and summative project evaluations, Dr. Abbot Packard, from the University of West Georgia.</AbstractNarration>
