<AbstractNarration>Successful use of computing technologies has enhanced quality of life. In fact, it is hard to point to even one aspect of societal functioning that is not impacted positively by computer systems. The tremendous advances in computer system performance while simultaneously lowering the computing cost have been the primary reason for the success of computing. However, shrinking device sizes have recently lead to new challenges in system reliability. System reliability is an uncompromising concern and is the primary focus of this proposed research. Rather than addressing one single reliability concern, such as soft errors or process variations, this proposal takes a multi-dimensional approach to improve Mean-Time-To-Failure (MTTF). Reliability degrades extremely slowly over time and hence the solutions proposed in this research are also low cost solutions. In order to develop low cost solutions, the first step is to non-intrusively monitor the health of a processor to understand its aging process before taking proactive measures for detecting errors. When the error is detected, instead of employing expensive hardware solutions, this proposal uses low cost and flexible software mechanisms to correct the errors.  While any one approach will certainly extend MTTF, the true benefits of the proposed research will bear fruition when error monitoring, detection and correction are employed in a hierarchical framework based on reliability needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal are on two fronts. The proposed research is motivated by industrial concerns regarding system reliability. On the technology front, the low cost solutions developed will be transferred for industry adoption through close industry-academia interactions. Most of the proposed research ideas will be designed and implemented by the research team as research prototypes. These prototypes will be shared with industrial partners for further evaluations in an industrial setting. Woman and minority student recruitment will be one of the key driving force to encourage broader participation in the proposed research. This objective will be achieved through active participation and involvement of USC's Family of Schools in Los Angeles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The reliance on computing infrastructure for performing many critical functions is growing rapidly in our society. However, the reliability of computing fabric has been deteriorating as transistor device dimensions shrink. There is a considerable concern that critical computing infrastructure may fail to operate correctly under certain operations conditions, such as high temperature, high radition environments. To tackle this challenge a concerted effort must be made to improve reliability of computing fabric from devices all the way to the software stack.  This research proposal focused on improving reliability by developing the following  innovative architecture features that may be included in future CPU and GPU chips:  (1) This proposal developed an approach to monitor the operational correctness of circuit paths within a processor. Rather than monitor all the circuit paths, which may be very expensive to implement, the developed methodology uses application-driven profiles to identify only a few important circuit paths which provide the same coverage as monitoring the entire processor.  This work also resulted in the development of  new tool called WAT that enables users to do cross-layer design analysis to understand how applications can wearout different circuits at different rates.   (2) The proposal developed a new way to trigger exceptions to inform the higher layers of software whenever the computing fabric encounters a fault. This approach is similar to existing approaches that use exceptions to inform software of unwanted code execution behavior, such as a divide by zero. By piggybacking on these existing hardware-software exception handling paths a unified approach to handling various circuit failures was developed.  (3) The project designed a new analytical model to measure the reliability of caches protected by complex protection codes when they encounter multi-bit soft errors. Soft error is a particular type of error that affects memory cells in processors and is primarily caused by high energy particles (from solar radiation and other sources) that may hit the computers. Prior to this work most works assume that a single memory cell in a cache may be flipped due to soft error but this work showed how to accurately quantify the impact of a single particle strike that may generate multiple bit flips.  (4) The project also developed new methods to protect graphics processing units (GPUs) from soft error strikes. In particular, the project developed Warped-DMR, a technique that repurposes unused/under-used execution resources in GPUs to automatically perform redundant execution of vulnerable code without the need to provision significant amount of additional hardware.   (5) An  extension to Warped-DMR was developed, called Warped-Shield. It not only handled soft errors but also handled hard errors. Unlike soft-errors where the bit flip is only transient hard errors are permanent and they persist for the lifetime of the processor.  Warped-Shield exploits multiple execution lanes in GPUs  to re-route computations from faulty execution lanes to healthy but idle execution lanes to provide hard error tolerance with virtually zero additional hardware.   In addition to the intellectual contributions the project also supported about 10 graduate PhD students over multiple years.
