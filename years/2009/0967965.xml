<AbstractNarration>0967965&lt;br/&gt;Spiller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyanobacteriochromes are a cyanobacterial family of biliprotein photoreceptors. This bioengineering proposal promises a small, bright red reporter (about 160 amino acids). Compared to other red-fluorescent markers, biliprotein reporters will exhibit substantially improved resistance to photobleaching and low intracellular toxicity. They plan to optimize the DNA sequence of a mutant cyanobacteriochrome for mammalian expression, and then to fuse it to mammalian cytoskeleton proteins for transfection into living cells. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is that engineered bright red fluorescent proteins are tools for in vivo cellular imaging. The goal is to image a red fluorescent-tagged cytoskeleton during infection so that understanding the infection process will suggest therapeutic protocols. There are potentially many other uses for a bright red, small, non-toxic fluorescent tag. &lt;br/&gt;Among the broader impacts resulting from the activity is the training of undergraduate women in bioengineering. Mills College's small college atmosphere is an ideal environment for engaging young women in the excitement of scientific research. Twenty-eight young women and one man have participated in biophotonics research at Mills College supported by a sub award from NSF (CBST- UC Davis). All of these students have entered graduate schools or medical schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Development of Bioengineered Cyanobacteriochromes for in vivo Fluorescence Tagging for Enhanced Microscopy  Progress was made to engineer plasmids that tag actin and tubulin for in vivo microscopy of mammalian cells. The tagged actin plasmid was transfected into Lymphocytes and also into Human Embryonic Kidney cells. The concept of the project is to add a bright red fluorescence tag onto important molecules of the cytoskeleton so that cell biologists can visualize them in living cells. Five genes from Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP1 are the sources of the original DNA sequences. So far the sequence of one of the genes has been truncated, mutated, ligated to actin and optimized for mammalian expression. Our engineering produced a protein that is only about 180 AA in length. This short bioengineered sequence was built into an actin containing plasmid, and then it was transfected into mammalian cells. When the plasmid was expressed it caused the lymphocytes to incorporate red-tagged actin into their cytoskeleton. Red-tagged actin is visible on the photo clip from a time lapse of lymphocyte cells that is attached to this report. In the photo the tagged actin emits a red wavelength of fluorescent light that is longer than the emission wavelength of most available tags. It is hoped that this light could be seen at deeper tissue levels when viewed in the microscope.  The tag emits bright red light of approximately 660nm fluorescence. We are presently creating a similar plasmid that tags tubulin. Collaborations with microscopists at Lawrence Berkley Laboratories - Life Sciences, Potter Street, Berkeley CA &amp; The Center for Biophotonics Science and Technology, University of California, Davis CA are ongoing to test our tagged actin and tagged tubulin in living lymphocytes and in Human Embryonic Embryonic Kidney cells.
