<AbstractNarration>A research team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Northwestern University is combining experimental observations and shear band analysis in order to investigate the failure properties of high porosity rock. Shear band analysis is a mathematical description of the observed behavior of materials such as rocks by which their failure under applied stresses is concentrated in a narrow band rather than being uniformly distributed. True triaxial tests, in which test samples are subjected to three independent and typically unequal principal stresses simulating realistic field conditions, are being conducted on high-porosity compactive sandstones. The tests employ novel loading paths for each of the principal stresses. These paths, unprecedented in laboratory experiments, are designed to facilitate formulation of constitutive relations and comparison with the theoretical predictions of shear band analysis. The results of this research will provide the first systematic test of the applicability of shear band theory for the full range of stress conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of rock mechanical behavior and its relation to failure of compactive porous sandstones is essential for interpreting field observations and as input for numerical simulations of complex geomechanical and geophysical problems. These include earthquake mechanics, design of underground storage facilities, energy recovery and sequestration of carbon dioxide. Failure in these materials tends to occur in narrow bands and therefore can drastically alter the ability of the rock formation to trap or transmit fluids. These narrow zones of failure may reduce flow across them and interfere with fluid circulation in applications involving fluid injection (e.g. for carbon dioxide sequestration or liquid waste isolation) and fluid extraction (e.g. for oil field operations). These failure zones can also provide conduits for enhanced flow along them. Such flow can disrupt rock formations intended to trap fluids and prevent them from reaching the surface or interacting with shallow groundwater.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project experimentally and theoretically studied failure in porous sandstone. Failure typically occurs in localized, planar zones of compacted material that can form barriers to fluid flow in the subsurface. Such zones could adversely affect the injection and withdrawal of fluids for energy recovery and storage, waste disposal and sequestration of CO2 to mitigate deleterious effects on climate.  Investigations were based on so-called true triaxial experiments that apply stress to samples in three independent directions; this more realistically describes the stress state in the earth than the more common axisymmetric tests in which two of the stresses are equal. In particular, these tests made possible an investigation of the role of the intermediate principal stress. The stresses were applied both in the conventional way for such tests and in a new way that facilitated comparison with theoretical predictions and provided new insights to failure. These predictions were based on two approaches: one, an instability criterion, which predicts failure based on the idea that as a result of material behavior localized planar bands can suddenly develop and a second, phenomenological, approach that describes failure in terms of a particular combination of stress states.  The experimental results document the effect of the intermediate principal stress on both the onset of failure and its orientation, an effect that is not included in the most common criterion for brittle rocks. The effect on the onset of failure was, however, less pronounced than that observed in less porous rocks.  The theoretical predictions of the instability approach for the orientation of failure angle agreed qualitatively with the observations for the sequence of stress application.  The prediction of this approach did, however, disagree with the type of failure observed when the sum of the three applied stresses was low. The disagreement could be the result of limitations of the theoretical approach or of the characterization of the material behavior prior to failure.  The phenomenological approach agrees well with the observations except for the two limiting states that correspond to the conventional method of testing.  The stresses at the onset of failure were analyzed using a generalized version of a failure theory that has been used previously for rocks and soils. The parameters of the theory were determined using data from the novel tests; then the theory was used to predict the behavior for the conventional tests. Agreement was generally good, although significant discrepancies existed for some stress states.  These results provide the basis for more accurate modeling of the failure of porous sandstones for a variety of geomechanical applications, e.g., energy storage and recovery, CO2 sequestration, aquifer management and analysis of induced earthquakes.
