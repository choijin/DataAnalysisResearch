<AbstractNarration>The Georgia Institute of Technology in collaboration with Columbus State University proposes an extension to the "Georgia Computes!" Alliance. Georgia Computes! has made dramatic strides in improving computing education throughout the state, at all levels of the pipeline. Its efforts start at 4th grade with summer camps, and continue through middle school with camps and outreach with the Girl Scouts, YWCA, and Cool Girls, extend to high school with camps and teacher professional development, and end in undergraduate education with faculty workshops. Georgia Computes! successes include exponential growth in the number of Girl Scouts taking their computing workshops, the creation of eight new regional summer computing camps, a doubling of the number of institutions offering Advanced Placement Computer Science (APCS), a doubling of the number of Hispanic students taking the APCS exam, and change at a quarter of the computing programs in the University System of Georgia. With this Extension, they propose to scale, and broaden their alliance interventions. Georgia Computes! will grow its teacher education efforts to include two regional centers of expertise, at Columbus State and at Armstrong Atlantic State University. In order to offer inservice workshops throughout the state, it will develop on-line materials, including courses that provide on-line access to Georgia's new computer science teaching endorsement. Georgia Computes! will grow its already successful K-12 outreach efforts to help students to develop a broader definition of computing. It will use more diverse student mentors, including high school students and disabled undergraduate students. Most importantly, this Extension will create infrastructure for careful measurement of individual university computing programs in the state and to track individuals from workshops and camps, through high school classes, to university degrees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Extending Georgia Computes! expands the work done at Georgia Tech under the initial Georgia Computes! grant to several additional activities at Columbus State University. The mission of Georgia Computes! is focused on increasing the number and diversity of computing students in the state of Georgia by improving the computing education pipeline across the state of Georgia.  The most significant contribution from this grant is the development of one of two computer science teacher endorsement programs in Georgia and the first program to award an endorsement. This program is well documented including course materials for methods and practicum courses online at http://cs.columbusstate.edu/endorsement/.  We have also initiated several studies into methods for improving retention in introductory programming courses. Some preliminary results are:  Paired programming is more effective for student learning in a closed-lab environment. In an attempt to answer the question: Why students find computer programming hard? we found that:   "A correlation between problem solving and course success rates was not found" Students have a hard time separating the abstract problem solving needed to come up with a solution and the implementation of that solution into code. This practice of simply starting to write code without planning, is something that seems to be a common thread with the students. No correlation between video game usage and any of the factors of performance in the class was found.        We organized three workshops for teachers of Computer Science and related subjects during 2009-2010 and two workshops in 2010-2011 with 36 teachers in attendance.  The main objectives of the workshops were  Introduction of Computer Science as a discipline and an attractive career with its high relevance to current and future market demands Introduction to computer programming through the use of multimedia, animation and robotics.  Providing ideas and resources to teachers for use in lesson plans and classroom activities   The workshops were in general quite positively received by the participants, with many indicating interest in participating in similar future workshops. We plan to continue to offer a summer workshop for teachers and hope to secure funding to support. Teachers are requesting workshops for both "Computing in the Modern World" and "Beginning Programming."  Additional activities include:  Attract      girls into computing with activities in summer camps and after-school      programs through Girls, Inc. and Girls Scouts. Host the      annual regional First Lego League competition for the past three years Offer summer      camps to middle school and high school students. Provide      on-line access to Georgia's new computer science teaching endorsement for      in-service teachers.   Project results include the following:  Developed      and received approval to offer the Computer Science Teacher endorsement      program. Awarded the first Endorsed Computer Science Teacher in      Georgia who is now      teaching the first computer classes in his high school. Provided      Training &amp; Development of 36 K-12 teachers through three one-day and      two one-week workshops.  Conducted 12      summer computing camps in 2010 and 12 in 2011, attended by 277 K-12      students. 40% were from underrepresented minorities and 25% were female.      2012 will be the 7th year for these camps having already      impacted over 700 K-12 students. Hosted the      regional First Lego League competition for the      past two years with nearly 20 teams competing and nearly 500 people in      attendance. Over 20 teams are scheduled to compete in the third year      (2011). Published results      of our work in three proceedings at three different peer-reviewed      conferences in addition to student presentations at the ACM Midsoutheast      Conference.    Columbus State University has experienced an increase of the number of undergraduate computing m...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
