<AbstractNarration>Technological advances in positioning, sensor and monitoring&lt;br/&gt;technology drive data acquisition devices to generate massive streams&lt;br/&gt;of data.  The goal of this research is to develop a new class of&lt;br/&gt;high-performance stream data management systems capable of coping with&lt;br/&gt;scenarios with infinite data arriving in large volumes, and with&lt;br/&gt;near-real time response requirements.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed query processing paradigm, &lt;br/&gt;termed the multi-route query mesh model (QM), overcomes a&lt;br/&gt;major limitation in current query optimizers, both static and stream&lt;br/&gt;ones alike, namely the assignment of a single `best' query execution&lt;br/&gt;plan for all input data.  This approach, being based on the strong&lt;br/&gt;assumption of data uniformity, results in substandard performance for&lt;br/&gt;possibly all data items.  Instead, query mesh adopts a processing&lt;br/&gt;structure composed of a data classifier and a multiple route plan&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure.  Different learning models can be plugged as&lt;br/&gt;classifier logic into the QM model.  Given the complexity of the QM&lt;br/&gt;solution space, cost-based search heuristics are designed to&lt;br/&gt;efficiently find high-quality query meshes.  QM is adaptive supporting&lt;br/&gt;the detection and incremental modification of the QM classifier and&lt;br/&gt;its routes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the design, development and&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of a novel multi-route paradigm for stream query&lt;br/&gt;processing, -- a perfect middle ground between the two current&lt;br/&gt;extremes of single-plan versus route-less solutions.  Experimental&lt;br/&gt;studies compare query mesh to state-of-the-art solutions.  QM impacts&lt;br/&gt;society by facilitating a wide range of stream-centric applications,&lt;br/&gt;including medical out-patient monitoring, emergency management, and&lt;br/&gt;business intelligence processing, and by integrating project&lt;br/&gt;activities with education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on this project can be found at the project&lt;br/&gt;web page:  http://dsrgweb.cs.wpi.edu:8180/DSRG/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Every day we witness technological advances in positioning, sensor and monitoring technology, where data acquisition devices continuously generate massive streams  of data giving rise to new applications. Traditional database systems, which assume static datasets, are largely inapplicable in these scenarios, where data is infinite, arriving in large volumes, with unpredictable spikes in data, yet near-real time robust responsiveness is required.  To tackle this flood of data, this research developed a new class of high-performance stream data management systems with performance, adaptivity, and robustness as key features.  One key innovation of this project is the novel query processing paradigm, termed the multi-route query mesh model (QM), that overcomes the limitation in query optimizers, both static and stream ones alike, namely the assignment of a single best query execution plan for all input data. This approach, being based on the strong assumption of data uniformity, results in substandard performance for all data items. Instead, query mesh adopts a processing structure composed of a data classifier and a multiple route plan infrastructure. Different learning models are plugged in as classifier logic into the QM model. The core intellectual merit lies in the design, development and evaluation of this novel multi-route  paradigm for stream query processing, -- a perfect middle ground between the two extremes of single-plan versus route-less solutions. Experimental studies show that the query mesh technology is superior in performance to existing state-of-the-art solutions.  Second, the first practical multi-route optimizer has been engineered that by exploiting both intra- and inter-stream correlations of streams, produces effective partitions without having to undertake repeated expensive query plan generation.  The third major intellectural merit concerns the innovative approach towards supporting adaptivity.  By mapping the problem to a concept drift problem, the QM adaption methodology, based on monitoring and detection of concept drifts, discards insignificant adaptivity cases early, thus minimizing the adaptivity overhead. While drastic concept drift cases necessitating adaption are accomplished by a non-intrusive change of the classifier, without effecting the online execution.  Fourth, for distributed QM, technology for  assuring robustness of query processing even under extreme data fluctuations is achieved. The key invention is a load distribution strategy that leverages parametric query optimization principles to identify a multi-plan solution that minimizes the cases when load migration is necessary.  Broader  impact is achieved by the applicability of this stream processing technology to diverse monitoring applications -- much like the development of generic relational DBMS has changed the landscape of data-centric applications. QM impacts society by facilitating a wide range of real-time stream-centric applications from consuming streaming data, including but not limited to financial services, outpatient care monitoring, emergency response, and others.  Broader impact includes the integration of project activities with undergraduate and graduate teaching in line with the project-based spirit of education at WPI.  Students from undergraduates, MS to PhD students work collaboratively.  This exposes students at all levels to state-of-the-art technologies, research, and future career opportunities - contributing to STEM workforce development.  Undergraduate senior level projects led by Prof. Rundensteiner have won the best-project WPI President's project award.  Undergraduate students co-authored papers and participated in professional meetings. Active collaboration with researchers and practitioners from companies and labs provide opportunities for the students to engage in interesting internships.
