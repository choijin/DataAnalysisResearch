<AbstractNarration>This research seeks to develop new methods for interrogating experimental measurements of human gait in order to better understand how the neuromuscular system functions during this important process.  A new nonlinear system identification strategy will be studied that utilizes a model for the system that is appropriate for small deviations from a nominal periodic motion (or average stride cycle).  A frequency-domain output-only system identification method will be created to characterize the motion of the system about this periodic trajectory using linear time-periodic systems theory, and that will be used to find a mathematical model for the nonlinear system.  A video-based motion capture system will be used to record the motion of a few subjects as they walk on an instrumented treadmill, and the measurements will be used to identify a reduced model for their neuromuscular function during gait.  That model will then be incorporated into the computed muscle control forward dynamics algorithm in order to gain additional insights into the roles of individual muscles and the function of the neuromuscular system during gait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is expected to lead to improved treatments for gait disorders, potentially benefitting many of the thousands of people in the United States who currently suffer from these disorders.  Common gait disorders may stem from birth defects, residual effects of a disease, such as polio, or from injuries sustained in athletic activities, accidents or military combat, and although numerous treatments have been proposed for gait disorders, it is currently very difficult to predict how effective treatment will be.  This work is expected to increase our understanding of gait so that appropriate treatments can be chosen more reliably.  Also, the framework that will be used in this work is general, so the methods developed can also be used to study other nonlinear systems such as vehicles, wind turbines, machinery, etc?  A short course will be created based on the results of this research and it will be used to share these new methods with a broad audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the course of this project we have created and evaluated new methods for testing and interpreting measurements from systems modeled by time varying systems of differential equations.  These types of mathematical models are critical to modeling rotating machinery such as wind turbines and the gear trains that are found within automobiles, aircraft and industrial machinery.  Time varying models have particular significance to engineers because they provide important insights into the behavior of nonlinear systems such as a biomechanical model of an elderly adult walking at steady speed on a treadmill.  One of the key outcomes of this work was a new methodology for identifying mathematical models for linear time periodic systems in cases where the forces exciting the structure cannot be measured.  A wind turbine rotating at constant speed is an important example of a time periodic system, and they are driven by turbulence within the wind so that it is impossible to measure the pressure field that causes vibrations of the turbine blades and tower.  Vibration is one of the key factors that limits the life of a wind turbine.  AllenÆs research group addressed this issue, collaborating with researchers in Denmark who had instrumented an operating wind turbine with a small number of vibration sensors on the blades and tower.  The vibration of the turbine was measured over the course of several months and these measurements were then used to derive a mathematical model of the turbine including the effect of small differences between the three nominally identical blades.  The methodology developed in this work could eventually be used to design longer lasting wind turbines and to use vibration measurements to detect damage in a blade before it fails catastrophically.  Figure 1 shows a photograph of the wind turbine that was tested, a schematic showing where sensors (accelerometers) were located, and a sample measurement.  The methods developed in this work allow us to explain how the various frequencies present in the vibration signature shown to the right are related to variations in stiffness and mass between the three blades.  The mathematical concepts developed in this work were also used to create a new means of measuring the vibration of large structures such as wind turbines.  For example, wind turbines can be more than 100 meters tall and so to mount sensors it is necessary to hire climbers or use specialized cranes, making this an expensive and time consuming endeavor.  We developed an alternative which uses a laser Doppler vibrometer to measure the structureÆs motion.  A vibrometer is an instrument which measures the velocity at a point by reflecting a laser off of the structure and collecting some of the backscattered laser light.  To make this method practical for large structures whose oscillation frequencies are low, the laser was swept continuously along the length of a blade while measuring the vibration at the point where the laser was incident.  This is illustrated in Figure 2.  The measurement was then analyzed using the methods developed in this work in order to determine the deflection shape of the blade at various vibration frequencies.  This information is helpful when developing simulation models of wind turbine blades and could also reveal structural degradation or damage (for example, due to a lightning strike) within the blade that could compromise its performance.  The methods developed in this work were also applied to many other systems, for example nonlinear structures which behave in a complicated manner such as the human musculoskeletal system.  Simulations were carried out to seek to devise new means of understanding and modeling these systems, in an effort to better understand what factors increase oneÆs risk of suffering a fall while walking and how this can be mitigated.  A series of measurements of healthy young adults and older adults walking on an instrumented treadmill were provided by a c...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
