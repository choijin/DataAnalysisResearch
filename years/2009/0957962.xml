<AbstractNarration>SES-0957962&lt;br/&gt;Karen S. Cook&lt;br/&gt;David Grusky&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0957200&lt;br/&gt;Victor Nee&lt;br/&gt;Kim Weeden&lt;br/&gt;Cornell University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0957900&lt;br/&gt;Paul DiMaggio&lt;br/&gt;Princeton University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0957923&lt;br/&gt;Bruce Western&lt;br/&gt;Harvard University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0958093&lt;br/&gt;Neil Fligstein&lt;br/&gt;University of California-Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0956546&lt;br/&gt;Erik Wright&lt;br/&gt;Joel Rogers&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The United States and the world economy are currently experiencing the most extensive and intense downturn since the Great Depression. A six-university team hosted by Centers for the study of economic sociology and social inequality associated with the Sociology Departments at Cornell, University of California at Berkeley, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford and the University of Wisconsin that share outstanding reputations and strong track records in economic sociology and related specialties will complete research on the causes and consequences of this historic economic crisis. The recession itself presents a fundamental challenge to the economic sociology of efficient markets and to conventional understandings of concepts like risk and trust that are central to all of the social sciences. It is also likely to have important effects on social inequality -- not just inequality in income, but in economic behaviors like savings, job-hunting, and investments in education, as well as such outcomes as health and wellness, fertility and divorce, and criminal victimization.  The project will support twelve postdoctoral research fellows who will work with faculty at the six universities to complete independent research while receive training and mentoring, that will cast light on the causes of the crisis and its impact on social inequality and on U.S. institutions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The research will help to inform our understanding of the social consequences of the recession.  Specifically, the project will bring a sociological perspective to three pressing questions: (1) how did the financial crisis happen, (2) what are the social consequences of the recession, and how is its impacts distributed, and (3) what are the policy responses to the economic crisis and what are their consequences?  The project will also provide a career development opportunity for a diverse set of new Sociology Ph.D.s at a time of declining endowments in the private university sector and declining tax revenues in the states. By providing a footing for a  group of young scholars and enabling them to contribute to our understanding of the very crisis that has challenged the labor market into which they are moving, the investigators hope to prevent the loss of talent that the field has experienced in previous severe recessions, and to ensure that graduate-training institutions have a robust and consistent pipeline of new talent as faculty hired in the 1970s and 1980s move towards retirement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The following three broad goals, outlined in the original proposal, were realized with support from the NSF award.  1)    Provide a career lifeline to a diverse set of the most talented new Sociology Ph.D.s at a time when the job market for new Ph.D.s has been decimated by the "Great Recession" of 2008-2009.  Two postdoctoral scholars were supported at Stanford as a result of the grant.  An additional 10 postdoctoral scholars were supported at the five other collaborating institutions.  The experience and success of the full cohort provided the basis for the American Sociological Association?s evaluation, outlined below and appended in full with the final NSF report for this award.  As but one example, the first postdoctoral scholar at Stanford wrote that the new research agenda he pursued with support of the NSF grant "proved gainful on the job market, as [he] was invited to interview for urban policy positions at Harvard Business School and Harvard Kennedy School, the Sociology Department at the University of Michigan, and he received a tenure-track offer from Brown University (for a joint appointment in Sociology and Urban Studies). This is significantly better than he did on the job market last time, and he credits the success to this NSF award."  2)    Contribute to our understanding of the causes and consequences of the economic crisis.  Research findings by the two cohorts of postdocs were presented at the ASA?s annual meetings.  A sampling of the research areas covered are:  Macro Impacts  Institutionalized Exuberance: Risk and Return and Systemic Financial Crisis (Abby Larson) The City as Fiscal Derivative: Tax Increment Financing, Economic Development Professionals and the Financialization of Urban Politics (Josh Pacewicz) Avoiding Debt, Tolerating Debt: The Sources of Stances Towards Educational Loans Among Low-Income Students (Jeremy Markham Schulz)   Micro Impacts  Trapped: How Risk and Uncertainty are Endangering the Futures of Americans (Jennifer M. Silva) Unequal Disadvantage: The Influence of Economic Recession on Gender and Ethnic Biases in Entrepreneurial Investment Markets (Sarah Thebaud) The Culture of Class Power: How Employers Reorganize Markets and Shift Risk to Workers (Stephen Viscelli)   Additionally the first Stanford postdoc, Josh Pacewicz, started or completed the work for the following publications while he was supported by the grant.  Partisans and Partners: The Politics of the Post-Keynesian Society (2016) The University of Chicago Press.   "Playing the neoliberal game: why community leaders left  party politics to partisan activists" (2015) American Journal of Sociology 121(3): 826-881.  "Tax increment financing, economic development professionals, and the financialization of urban politics." (2013) Socio-Economic Review 11(3): 413-440.   "Regulatory rescaling in neoliberal markets." (2013) Social Problems 60(4): 433-456.  Pacewicz also published an op-ed on effective ways to regulate the practice of cities that financed various activities by securitizing projected increases in property tax revenue and selling these projections on the bond market.   3)    Complete the study and submit a report on the role of postdoctoral scholars in Sociology.    "Evaluation of the 2010-2014 ASA/NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, co-authored by Roberta Spalter-Roth and Jean H. Shin of the American Sociological Association, was submitted as part of the NSF final report.  The conclusions are described below.  "Based on several sets of data, [the authors] suggest that postdoctoral programs have a positive long-run impact on sociology career trajectories.
