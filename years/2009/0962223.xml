<AbstractNarration>Graduate student Emily K. Brunson (University of Washington), under the guidance of Dr. Bettina Shell-Duncan, will examine the role that social networks play when parents decide whether or not to vaccinate their children.  In some parts of the United States, vaccination rates have fallen dramatically. This research is designed to determine the proximal causes of the decline. Brunson's own previous qualitative investigation revealed that parents vary in the extent to which they do research and what kind of research they do before making their decisions. Some parents may consult books or internet sites, while others may not; some parents may consult other people, and others may not. The current project is designed to look at whether egocentric (personal) networks predict parental decision making about both traditional childhood vaccinations and crisis response vaccinations such as that for H1N1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in King County, Washington, one of the locales where vaccination rates have declined. Brunson will employ a quantitative survey to elicit parental social networks and to test how social networks influence the type of vaccination decisions parents make. Typically, social network analysis focuses almost exclusively on inter-personal connections. In contrast, Brunson has developed an innovative approach that combines person-to-person network connections with person-to-non-human-information source connections in a single network analytic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is timely and important. When vaccination rates fall below 80 percent, vaccination may become less effective even for those who are vaccinated. Thus understanding how parents reach decisions about vaccinating children has important public health policy implications particularly at a time when the threat of global pandemics, such as H1N1, is increasing. The research also will contribute to the development of social network theory by examining the role of multi-sourced social networks in knowledge transmission and decision-making. Finally, funding this research supports the education of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Vaccine acceptance is a critical public health issue.  Vaccination not only provides immunity to individuals receiving vaccines, but the widespread acceptance of vaccination resulting in herd immunity offers protection to entire populations.  This type of protection is of vital importance; it is the primary mechanism whereby most vaccine-preventable diseases are controlled and kept at low levels.  In many areas of the world, however, including some areas of the United States, acceptance of vaccination is waning.  This is a concern because low vaccine acceptance can lead to the loss of herd immunity, which in turn can lead to disease outbreaks and even death.     As the majority of vaccines are given to children under the age of 5, parents play a key role in vaccine acceptance.  More than any other persons, they are responsible for deciding whether or not their children will receive the recommended vaccinations.  Because of this, parents and their vaccination decision-making have been extensively studied.  Previous research has examined the relationship between parentsÆ vaccination decisions and their demographic characteristics as well as their perceptions of vaccines, vaccine-preventable diseases and other related topics.  What is generally not considered in the existing literature, however, is the role that parentsÆ social networks play in their acceptance or rejection of vaccination.     When making decisions about vaccination, parents rarely reach conclusions on their own.  Rather they rely on others&mdash;family members, friends, health care providers and so on&mdash;for information, advice and direction.  In the U.S. and other developed countries, most parents also have the option to obtain additional information and advice directly, through non-human sources&mdash;the internet, newspapers, magazine articles, books and so forth.  Thus, instead of deciding to accept or reject vaccination on their own, parents make vaccination decisions in concert with their social networks, broadly defined as including the people they interact with and the non-human sources of information they consult.      The formal study of social networks is referred to as social network analysis (SNA).  SNA is a broad and flexible research methodology, which includes examinations of the networks of single individuals within populations.  This specific SNA approach is referred to as ego-centric network analysis.  Ego-centric network analysis has been used to study a variety of health-related topics including health care utilization, needle-sharing, and contraceptive use.  Ego-centric network analysis has also been used to examine parentsÆ decision-making in relation to breastfeeding, complimentary feeding and childrenÆs access to health care.  In each of these studies, parentsÆ networks were determined to have significant influences on parentsÆ decisions.      Building on this literature, the purpose of this NSF-sponsored research was to examine the role that social networks play in parentsÆ decision-making about their childrenÆs vaccinations.  Specifically this project sought to: 1) provide descriptions of typical social networks related to parentsÆ decision-making about their childrenÆs vaccinations; 2) test how networks influence parentsÆ vaccination decisions; and 3) examine how social networks consisting of only people (people-centered networks) compare to networks consisting of only non-human sources (source-centered networks).  An additional component of this research also sought to compare how social networks predict parentsÆ decision-making about traditional childhood vaccinations and parentsÆ decision-making about crisis response vaccinations like the H1N1 (swine flu) vaccine.     From a practical perspective, this research provided important information about childhood vaccination, a topic vital to public health.  To date, findings of this research have suggested that parentsÆ social networks, particularly the vaccination advice of the peo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
