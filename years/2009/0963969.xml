<AbstractNarration>Radio-enabled tracking tags have dramatically enhanced our knowledge of wildlife behavior over the last 3 decades, and new types of tags are being developed which capture and transmit dramatically more information about their behavior. Advances in microelectronics have also reduced the size and increased the lifetime of tags, increasing the number of species that can be tagged.  Unfortunately these various tags use a wide variety of frequencies, coding schemes, and communication protocols, requiring an entirely new base station for each new tag. This makes new deployments more expensive, disallows sharing of monitoring stations between overlapping studies, and requires that that biologists in the field carry a base station for every tag type in use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a general-purpose radio transceiver for behavioral ecologists and others that can be easily configured to communicate with any existing wildlife tracking tag, as well as with foreseeable future designs. Our approach is based on software defined radios, where most of the parameters of the radio are configured in software, allowing a single piece of hardware to cover multiple types of tags.  In this project we will develop working prototypes able to cover at least 3 different existing avian tags, and show them working in the field.  We will also develop a mode where signals can be captured, but not decoded, to allow tag signals from different researchers to be captured by the same physical basestation, and then distributed to the various researchers to be decoded.  Finally, we will ensure that the resulting outputs are in a format that allows smooth upload of captured signals to databases such as MOVEBANK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To ensure that our 'universal base stations' are available to other researchers, we will post on the internet all board designs, parts lists and software we develop, as well as documentation of all designs and software.  Our goal is that UBS designs be accessible not only to researchers, but also to amateur birders and other 'citizen scientists', allowing them to contribute to research, as well as enhancing their birding experience (or example, by allowing them, after detecting a tagged bird, to look up 'their bird' in a database and learn more about it's particular behavior and movement.  To further this goal, we will attempt to develop a smart-phone interface to our UBS, to allow birders in the field to capture and upload data from tags they encounter via their phones.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this work will provide a valuable tool for biologists, both professional and amateur, it will also provide valuable educational experience for engineering students.  Parts of this project will be incorporated into class projects, and much of the design work required will be completed by undergraduate and Masters of Engineering students completing as design projects required for graduation.  Because this project requires teamwork, has specific concrete goals and specifications, and clear end-customers (field biologist who are collaborating on this project), this project will provide invaluable experience in preparing students planning on working in industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more details, see: http://molnargroup.ece.cornell.edu/research.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Although birds are part of our everyday life, there is still much we donÆt know about them, and this lack of knowledge is in part a technological problem.  Birds move long distances in their annual life cycles, and to track the movements of birds from nesting through migration and back to the breeding grounds again, multiple generations of radio-frequency (RF) tracking tags have been developed.  Historically, each tag has been co-developed with a receiver to track the tag, and in this project, a collaboration between electrical engineers and ornithologists, we applied and developed techniques from modern software-defined radio technology to improve receiver design while co-developing new classes of tags to take advantage of this new flexibility.
