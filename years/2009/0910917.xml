<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This project, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program and conducted in the laboratory of Professor F. Fleming Crim at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, is  a coordinated study of chemical dynamics in liquids and gases in order to identify and understand the important similarities and acute differences between the two. The key aspect is comparing the influence of vibrational excitation on bimolecular reactions in the two settings and using vibrational excitation to control the course of the reactions. These experiments follow reactions both within vibrationally excited complexes and between vibrationally excited solute molecules and complexes. Single collision studies of the same reactions in a molecular beam provide a point of comparison by observing the influence of vibrational excitation without the complication of the surrounding solvent. Such observations delineate the requirements for control of chemical reactions and test theoretical descriptions incisively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental science in this project gives undergraduates and graduate students the experience and skills required to contribute to the scientific and technical enterprise in industry, government, and academe, as proven by the history of past students. New opportunities designed to integrate research, teaching, and learning more completely at the University of Wisconsin - Madison make it likely that this research project will inspire beginning scientists and carry advanced students toward a variety of professional goals even more effectively. The principal investigator on this project also works with both education and policy related groups nationally, a participation facilitated and enhanced by his continuing research activities.</AbstractNarration>
