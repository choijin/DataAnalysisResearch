<AbstractNarration>Gene expression is achieved through transcription of DNA into RNA transcripts, known as messenger RNAs (mRNAs).  Establishing the proper level of cellular transcripts is achieved by balancing the activity of production and degradation of mRNAs.  Gene silencing is a process that regulates this balance both by repressing production (transcriptional gene silencing) and by promoting degradation (post-transcriptional gene silencing) of target transcripts.  Some of the central components of the gene silencing machinery are small double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and proteins that bind to cellular dsRNAs.  The gene silencing machinery of plants has both universal components and components only found in the plant kingdom.  Some of the unique components have been implicated not only in normal plant growth and development but also in resistance to stress.  This project will determine the role of carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase-like 1, CPL1, a unique plant protein phosphatase in the gene silencing pathway.  CPL1 is a repressor of multiple target genes.  Preliminary data suggest that CPL1 can function both in transcriptional silencing and post-transcriptional silencing, however, the mechanism for this observation has not been elucidated.  This study will use multiple approaches such as genetic, molecular, and biochemical analyses to dissect novel components of gene silencing in plants.  The scientific discovery anticipated from this project will provide deeper insight of gene expression mechanisms relevant not only in the plant biology but also in broader biological science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will train post-doctoral associates and one graduate student.  The collaborative nature of this project provides the participants multidisciplinary expertise in molecular genetics and biochemistry as well as teaching opportunities through the lab course described below. To train future scientists from diverse backgrounds, a graduate-level laboratory module for the course Physiological and Molecular Basis of Plant Stress Responses in which students will have hands-on experience, will be established.  Teaching materials will be shared between collaborating institutions, and research materials generated in the project will be used in the classroom/lab as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  This project investigated the role of Arabidopsis carboxyl terminal phosphatase-like 1 (CPL1) and its homologs in gene expression and silencing.  CPL1 protein has unique structure containing both acid phosphatase domain and two double-stranded RNA binding motifs (DRMs).  We have determined that the phosphatase domain and the 1st DRM (DRM1) were essential for in vivo function of CPL1.  Interestingly, DRM1 did not bind to dsRNA, however, we have discovered a DRM1-interacting protein, RCF3, which is K-homology containing RNA-binding protein.  RCF3 specifically binds to single-strand poly-C but not to poly-U RNA.  Together with RNA-seq data reported by Chen et al (2013), CPL1-RCF3 complex is involved in RNA splicing in plants, where the complex formation is essential for targeting CPL1 for nuclear bodies.   Gene expression profiling of cpl1-2 mutant revealed that CPL1 has only minimum changes in small RNA profile, however, fidelity of small RNA processing was affected.  Interestingly, cpl1 showed enhanced expression of Fe-deficiency responsive transcripts and an altered metal accumulation profile, accumulating more Fe in roots but less Fe in shoots.  This indicated that although CPL1 is a part of general transcription machinery, it affect gene expression of specific subsets of transcripts.  Additional functional analysis and gene expression profiling of CPL3 and CPL4 further supported this hypothesis.  CPL3 specifically affected plant immuneity, whereas CPL4 affected xenobiotic stress/herbicide response pathways.     Broader impact  The project trained 3 postdocs and 2 graduate students over its duration.  In addition, 4 undergraduate students, two of them were REU participants, were supported by this project.  Results from this study have been disseminated to presentations in the scientific meetings and total 14 refereed publications.  Research accomplishments have been implemented to the PIÆs teaching activity via newly developed lab section for the graduate course "Physiological and Molecular Basis for Plant Stress Responses".
