<AbstractNarration>The college is recruiting two cohorts of six students in the mathematical and physical sciences from the disciplines of chemistry, computer science, environmental science, mathematics, physical science and physics and offering them full scholarships for four years. The goal is to support each of these students through completion of a baccalaureate degree in a mathematical or physical science discipline so they can enter the science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) workforce.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The program, based on the research literature on recruitment and retention of students, includes six elements: financial, academic and psycho-social support, mentoring, professional development for students, and faculty development. These components build upon ongoing activities within the college. Each element is being assessed through data regularly monitored by the college, and through instruments developed by a faculty learning community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The college expects the program to lead to better experiences and better retention among all science students at the college. Since many institutions share the need to improve retention of students in STEM disciplines, the program is having a broader impact through dissemination of findings via publications and presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project include improved recruitment and retention of students in the mathematical and physical sciences. We recruited two cohorts of six scholars each, one starting in August 2010 and the second in August 2011.  Our grant supported each scholar at a rate of $10,000 per year for four years.  In order to retain the scholarship, students were required to  Enroll in at least one course from among the following disciplines in each of their first four semesters: Chemistry, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Mathematics and Physics.  Complete a SIMS First Year Seminar and a Colloquium by the end of their fourth semester.  Declare a major in Chemistry, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Mathematics, Physical Science or Physics by the end of their fourth semester. Maintain a 3.00 GPA by the end of the third year and thereafter.  Pass two courses in Chemistry, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Mathematics and Physics by the end of the first year, 5 courses by the end of the second year and 8 courses by the end of the third year.   Our project included five elements to support the students in their STEM classes and retain them through graduation.  Financial Aid:   The grant supported twelve students at a rate of $10,000 per year for four years.  Academic Support:                                                  The main components of academic support for the scholars included an individual advising appointment with the PI at June advising, a pre-orientation program with academic and social focus, and access to peer Learning Assistants in introductory science and mathematics courses through workshops and office hours.  Psychosocial Support:  SIMS Scholars came to campus for the fall semester three days before the rest of the first year class in order to participate in a pre-orientation program with social and academic components.  Mentoring:    In the fall of their first year the scholars enrolled in the first-year seminar Studying Problems/Creating Solutions. The instructor modeled his course on the cornerstone courses offered by engineering schools. The seminar helped students transition from high school to college both academically and socially.  The Colloquium is a two-semester, half unit course featuring presentations by speakers from our faculty, local industry and national laboratories supplemented by ongoing readings.  The culminating experience in this course is writing an application for an internship or Research Experience for Undergraduate program (REU). At the time of major declaration, each student was assigned a faculty member in their discipline as an academic advisor.   Professional Development:   Our program supported the scholarsÆ professional development in several ways. The SIMS Colloquium exposed them to scientists who followed a variety of career paths. The practice internship/REU application gave each student the opportunity to reflect on his or her own interests and career goals, seek out a research or internship opportunity of interest and write an application essay making connections between their career goals and the research/internship experience. In addition, each of the twelve students who graduated in the program took at least one semester of independent research. Some did more, with one student researching for five semesters. Four students did summer research at Brookhaven National Laboratory while two others  did chemistry research at Muhlenberg.  Four students participated in REUs and three completed internships.  Our program retained twelve talented students through graduation in STEM fields. All final GPAs for the first cohort are 3.5 or higher, with an average GPA of 3.71 for the group.  In the second cohort, GPAs are all above 3.0 with a group average of 3.67.  Six graduates are entering STEM jobs or are continuing with graduate education in a STEM field.  The remaining graduates are pursuing opportunities in education, medicine and management.            ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
