<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the dynamics of chiral particles and chiral organisms in shear flows, using a combination of microfluidic experiments and mathematical modeling. Chiral particles are particles with shapes that cannot be superimposed upon their mirror images, and are of broad interest for both basic science and technology. Chiral particles are ubiquitous in biology: for example, amino acids are chiral molecules. Since the intermolecular reactions involved in life processes depend on the geometry of participating molecules, di&amp;#64256;erent enantiomers of chiral drugs, pheromones, pesticides, and odorants have di&amp;#64256;erent biological e&amp;#64256;ects. As a consequence, there is much interest in devising ways to separate pure enantiomeric samples out of a mixture of both enantiomers. Furthermore, in biology chirality occurs not only at the molecular scale, but also at the cellular scale. Many swimming microorganisms have chiral helical structures, such as the propulsion-generating &amp;#64258;agella of most bacteria. At the same time, the watery environments of microbes are constantly subject to &amp;#64258;uid &amp;#64258;ow, and hence shear, such as in the oceans, groundwater, industrial pipe &amp;#64258;ow, and catheters. This project has two specific aims: (i) exploiting the chirality-dependent motion of particles in shear &amp;#64258;ows to separate a mixture of enantiomers by handedness in a micro&amp;#64258;uidic channel, and (ii) understanding how chiral morphologies of microbes a&amp;#64256;ect their swimming and foraging. These aims are uni&amp;#64257;ed by the ultimate goal of better understanding the behavior of chiral particles in shear &amp;#64258;ows, and hence amenable to the same experimental and theoretical research tools. The proposed research has the potential to (i) transform our technological capability to separate a racemic mixture into component enantiomers, by developing a simpler and less expensive separation strategy than those currently available, and (ii) improve our understanding of microbial motility, with applications ranging from the recycling of limiting elements in natural systems to the spreading of disease and bio&amp;#64257;lm formation.</AbstractNarration>

Finally, the fact that rigid bacterial flagella are chiral has led researchers to construct artificial microswimming robots that also employ chirality in order to generate propulsive flows.      There are five major outcomes from the award that address intellectual merit.  1)  The PIs published a paper (Marcos, Fu H.C., Powers T.R. and Stocker R., 2009, "Separation of microscale chiral object by shear flow", Phys. Rev. Lett., 102, 158103) describing the preferential drift of chiral objects in shear flows.  This paper proposed that the drift could be used to separate chiral objects in microfluidic devices.  2)  The PIs published a paper (Marcos, Fu H.C., Powers T.R. and Stocker R., 2012, "Bacterial rheotaxis", PNAS, 109, 4780-4785) describing a bias in swimming direction caused by the interaction of ambient shear flows with chiral flagella of swimming bacteria.   3)  The PIs published a paper (Hyon Y., Marcos, Powers T.R., Stocker R. and Fu H.C., 2012b, "The fluid mechanics of wobbling bacterial trajectories", J.

There are seven major outcomes which address broader impacts.  1)  The award has led to ongoing work  developing a simpler and less expensive chiral separation strategy than those currently available.  2)  The research supported by the award has improved our understanding of microbial motility, with applications ranging from the recycling of limiting elements in natural systems to the spreading of disease and bio?lm formation.  3)  The award has supported the training of two graduate students at the University of Nevada, Reno.  4)  The award has supported the training and mentorship of one postdoctoral research associate at MIT and one postdoctoral research associate at the University of Nevada, Reno....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
