    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, build and test a prototype wireless weigh-in-motion or W-WIM system. The proposed W-WIM system comprises an array of up to eight 3in cubes embedded in the pavement. Each cube contains a MeMS accelerometer, a microprocessor,&lt;br/&gt;and a radio that sends the accelerometer measurements to an access point on the side of the road. Each cube is powered by a battery, with a 10-year lifetime. The access point processes the accelerometer measurements&lt;br/&gt;to estimate the axle load, and transmits the estimates via GPRS to the traffic control center. The 3in cubes take up no space and can be installed in minutes, so W-WIM systems can be deployed anywhere. By contrast, today?s WIM systems use decades-old bending plate, piezoelectric or load cell sensors to measure axle load. These sensors take up a lot of space, and installing them requires shutting the lane to traffic for a long time. WIM systems need continuous calibration to maintain accuracy. They are expensive to build and&lt;br/&gt;operate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commerical potential of this project is high. Transportation agencies must prevent accelerated highway deterioration with diminishing funds for maintenance: costs have so escalated that $42&lt;br/&gt;billion provided in SAFETEA-LU for 2009 Federal aid to highways will only be worth between $16.8 billion and $26.6 billion in 2005 dollars. One WIM station today costs $600,000 (plus support cost). The high cost and difficulty of installation limits WIM deployment. W-WIM systems will be priced at $60,000 per unit; since they are easy to install, they could be widely employed for comprehensive enforcement and data collection. W-WIM could be used on arterial streets to regulate trucks on city roads, where WIM systems cannot be used. W-WIM could be a component in a truck weight-based enforcement and toll system. WWIM could thus create a new market both within and outside the US that will employ people with diverse skills in the design, manufacturing, sales, and deployment of W-WIM systems.</AbstractNarration>
