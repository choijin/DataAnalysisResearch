<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Over the last several years, Greenblatt has been working on resolution of singularities, and &lt;br/&gt;he recently has proved an n-dimensional local resolution of singularities algorithm for real-analytic&lt;br/&gt;functions. This method is explicit, elementary, and done in coordinates. In his subsequent research,&lt;br/&gt;he will apply his methods, using additional ideas when appropriate, to prove theorems involving &lt;br/&gt;oscillatory integrals, Radon transforms, and other subjects in which he has done research. In addition &lt;br/&gt;to these areas, he will branch out into several other of the diverse areas that relate to &lt;br/&gt;resolution of singularities. For example, he intends to work on multilinear generalizations of &lt;br/&gt;oscillatory integral operators, problems related to the stability of integrals, and associated &lt;br/&gt;problems in algebraic geometry such as those involving multiplier sheaves. In addition, intriguing &lt;br/&gt;algorithmic and computational questions arose during the development of [G1], and he plans to &lt;br/&gt;investigate such issues in computational algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oscillatory integral operators are a part of Fourier analysis, a field with wide application in&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering, such as in signal processing, cryptography, and statistics. As a result,&lt;br/&gt;improved understanding of oscillatory integral operators resulting from this research has the &lt;br/&gt;potential to help in the development of scientific applications that use Fourier analytic methods. In &lt;br/&gt;addition, Radon transforms are fundamental to MRI and other medical imaging applications, and also find &lt;br/&gt;uses in diverse fields ranging from oil exploration to homeland security. As a result, improved &lt;br/&gt;theoretical knowledge of Radon transforms resulting from this research may lead to advances in such &lt;br/&gt;fields.</AbstractNarration>
