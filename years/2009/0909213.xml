<AbstractNarration>De Pillis&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0909213&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The principal investigator and her colleagues organize a&lt;br/&gt;workshop for industrial math problems.  The format follows one&lt;br/&gt;introduced by Oxford University applied mathematicians in 1968,&lt;br/&gt;which has been replicated frequently in the UK, Canada, Europe,&lt;br/&gt;and in various other countries (there are 8-10 such workshops&lt;br/&gt;each year).  The format consists of an initial presentation of a&lt;br/&gt;number of problems by industrial scientists/engineers.  The&lt;br/&gt;audience is then organized into small groups to work separately&lt;br/&gt;on each problem for 3-4 days.  An oral reporting session&lt;br/&gt;concludes the week, followed by a written report on each problem&lt;br/&gt;some weeks later.  The participants in the workshop consist of&lt;br/&gt;from 30-40 graduate students and about 30 faculty, and with an&lt;br/&gt;expectation of at least 6 problems from industry this means that&lt;br/&gt;each problem is worked on by 10 applied mathematicians.  The&lt;br/&gt;workshop is preceded by a student modeling camp which follows a&lt;br/&gt;similar format except each problem is presented by a faculty&lt;br/&gt;member.  Some of these problems may have been partially addressed&lt;br/&gt;by the faculty presenter, others not, and the aim of the camp is&lt;br/&gt;to bring the student participants into the culture of intensive&lt;br/&gt;group work, and to give them confidence in starting the week when&lt;br/&gt;ALL the participants start on NEW, practically-important problems&lt;br/&gt;knowing that their experience and hard work will prove fruitful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Apart from a substantial record of success in providing&lt;br/&gt;answers to the problems (this is catalogued at a web-site where&lt;br/&gt;e-prints for 250 individual reports from recent workshops are&lt;br/&gt;available in many, quite diverse, application areas), there are&lt;br/&gt;multiple goals for the event: establishment of closer connections&lt;br/&gt;between industrial and academic scientists; education of students&lt;br/&gt;and faculty about the requirements of industry in the use of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics; training of students in group participation projects&lt;br/&gt;(the norm in industry), and the experience of working alongside&lt;br/&gt;faculty and joining in the ups and downs of intensive work where&lt;br/&gt;progress is measured by an industrialist in need of a result. &lt;br/&gt;Problems committed to the workshop include one from a&lt;br/&gt;semiconductor company for modeling current flow in a new design&lt;br/&gt;nanoscale transistor, and two from bio-tech companies, one&lt;br/&gt;relating to a medical device that has unwanted internal&lt;br/&gt;vibrations and the other needing statistical modeling for&lt;br/&gt;micro-array analysis.</AbstractNarration>
