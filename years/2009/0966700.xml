<AbstractNarration>0966700&lt;br/&gt;Linic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed work is to explore the potential of shaped Ag nano-particles as heterogeneous catalysts for the epoxidation of propylene to form propylene oxide and for the asymmetric epoxidation of larger olefins (i.e., styrene) to form chiral epoxides. The studies build on earlier work by Linic at the University of Michigan to produce ethylene oxide. Heterogeneous Ag catalysts are almost exclusively used for this reaction commercially. EO is a critical chemical used in the synthesis of ethylene glycol (antifreeze), ethanolamines, and detergents. Computations by Linic suggested that particular faces of Ag would offer higher selectivity to desired products. Novel synthetic strategies were then developed for the synthesis of the shape-specific Ag nano-structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the demonstration that well-defined Ag nano-structures can be highly selective catalysts for partial oxidation of ethylene, the challenge of propylene partial oxidation to propylene oxide is a logical extension. There are no selective heterogeneous catalysts for this important, large scale chemical process. The PI has shown that there exists a critical link between the shape of catalytic metallic Ag particles and their performance, and that the main factor affecting the performance is the shape-specific surface termination of the particles. The PI hypothesizes that Ag nano-cube and nano-wire catalysts, terminated specifically by the Ag(100) facet, will be significantly more selective in direct epoxidation of propylene than conventional spherical Ag particles, which are terminated by the (111) facet.  The PI hypothesizes that specific metallic Ag nanostructures,  enhanced with chiral modifiers, will be promising heterogeneous catalysts for asymmetric epoxidation of larger olefins (for example styrene) to form chiral epoxides. Currently, complex and expensive homogeneous catalysts are used for chiral oxidation reactions as they offer greater regio- and stereo-selectivity than conventional heterogeneous solid state catalysts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research project attempts to constructively integrate the fields of nanoscience and heterogeneous catalysis by taking advantage of recent advances in the controlled synthesis of metallic nano-particles of different shapes and different surface terminations to design highly selective inorganic catalysts. The transformative nature to the successful outcome of this study is quite apparent. A new heterogeneously-catalyzed route to propylene oxide has large scale commercial implications. Furthermore, developing viable heterogeneous catalysts for chiral olefin epoxidation reactions would offer significant advantages with respect to their homogeneous counterparts including easy product separation, longer catalyst lifetime, easier catalyst regeneration, and possible utilization of cheaper and environmentally friendlier oxidizing agents such as oxygen.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Selective addition of oxygen across a carbon-carbon double bond to form an epoxide function embodies a class of chemical transformations of great importance, not only in the production of industrial organic chemicals, but in organic synthesis as well.  Currently, complex and expensive homogeneous catalysts (the 2001 Nobel Prize recognized seminal advances in homogeneous catalysis of chiral oxidations, including epoxidation) are used for these reactions as they offer greater selectivity, including regio- and stereo-selectivity than conventional heterogeneous solid state catalysts.  Developing viable heterogeneous catalysts for olefin epoxidation reactions would offer significant advantages with respect to their homogeneous counterparts including easy product separation, longer catalyst lifetime, easier catalyst regeneration, and possible utilization of cheaper and environmentally friendlier oxidizing agents (i.e., oxygen), and would move the field heterogeneous catalysis forward.  The limited selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts in general, and epoxidation catalysts in particular, is related to a number of issues, including the lack of predictive theories that guide the discovery of the optimal catalytic site and the dearth of strategies to synthesize the targeted sites. An important consequence of these limitations is that conventional heterogeneous metal catalysts, usually synthesized using wet impregnation strategies, are almost always spherical particles mainly terminated by low energy surface facets, such as the (111) surface for fcc crystals and the (0001) surface for hcp crystals. Recent advances in the field of chemical synthesis of inorganic nanostructures are allowing us for the first time to synthesize uniform metallic nano-particles of different shapes (for examples, nano-wires or nano-cubes) that are terminated with different surface facets. By controlling the particle shape and the surface facet exposed to reactants, we can start affecting the chemical transformations taking place on the metal particles and changing the outcome of a catalytic process.   The central objective of the project was to explore the performance of nobel particles of different shapes in epoxidation reactions.   Major outcomes:  Over the course of the grant we have demonstrated the impact of the shape of Ag nanoparticle catalysts on the outcome of catalytic ethylene epoxidation reactions (ethylene + &frac12; O2 &agrave; EO). We note that Ag is the commercial catalyst for this epoxidation process.  We showed that shaped Ag nano-particles (nanocubes and nanowires), terminated by the Ag(100) facet and synthesized using polyol methods where organic stabilizer molecules direct the growth of a nano-structure in a particular direction, were significantly more selective in the formation of EO compared to conventional spherical Ag particles, terminated by the Ag(111) surface facet.  We also started to explore the long term stability of these materials under reaction conditions. The unique chemical activity of shaped metal nano-particles is derived from their quasi-stable geometry, and there is a thermodynamic driving force for metal nanocubes or nanowires to collapse to the lowest energy quasi-spherical shapes.

Fairly recently we showed that the shaped Ag nanostructure can be stabilized under reaction conditions by adsorbing very small amount of atomic Sulfur.
