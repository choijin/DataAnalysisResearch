<AbstractNarration>0904349&lt;br/&gt;N. Trayanova&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support Gordon Research Conference on Cardiac Arrhythmia Mechanisms, to be held February 15-20, 2008 at Il Ciocco, Braga, Italy. This is the fourth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Cardiac Arrhythmia Mechanisms. The conference is held every other year.  The proposed 2009 Gordon Research Conference on Cardiac Arrhythmia Mechanisms will focus on both basic science and clinically relevant key scientific topics. The meeting will allow opportunities to bring together groups of outstanding investigators, experts in various relevant fields, including molecular biology, molecular genetics, cellular electrophysiology, biophysics, imaging, biomedical engineering, mathematics, and clinical cardiology to interact and share ideas about the underlying mechanisms of complex life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Leading experts and young promising investigators in this field will present and discuss the most exciting new contributions to the understanding of the mechanisms of cardiac rhythm disturbances. The overall conference format is very interactive and collaborative and allows time for quality discussions. The Gordon Conference format, with carefully selected presentations and ample time for discussion, will promote the informal exchange of information and foster the development of strong long-lasting relationships among scientist with different backgrounds but common interest in cardiac arrhythmia research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will draw participation from every aspect of our community, from graduate students and postdoctoral fellows through to senior faculty, with participation both national and international, and from academia and industry, to uncover the major mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis. At the meeting, engineers, physical scientists and life scientists will interact and share ideas about the underlying mechanisms of complex life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias; and in the long-term better treatments for the life-threatening arrhythmias can be developed. The conference will target to increase the participation of women and minorities. For the first time, there is a female Chair of the conference; the organizing committee has two female members; and the program has already 6 women speakers and discussion leaders, twice the number at the previous conference.  The conference will also provide an environment for students and junior scientists to  be mentored by the leaders in the field during the sessions, and meals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funds will be used to support students and postdoctoral fellows toward conference registration and/or travel support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
