<AbstractNarration>0948863&lt;br/&gt;Bevis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports upgrade of the computer facilities used by the Geodesy and Geodynamics group in the School of Earth Sciences (SES) at Ohio State University.  Modern computational platforms will immediately serve NSF funded crustal motion geodetic research in South America, Greenland and Antarctica, PI analysis of the global vertical velocity field in support of studies of sea level change, and work in GPS meteorology and kinematic positioning.  Specific equipment to be acquired includes five dual Intel-based quadcore Macintosh compute systems each with 16 Gb RAM and a 640 Gb hard drive.  The compute facility will serve four graduate students and two professional staff scientists in PI Mike Bevis?s research group as well as students in Professor Terry Wilson's research group at OSU.  The PIs have ported the geodetic processing package GAMIT/GLOBK to enable it to run on a Macintosh Xgrid system.  This modified version of GAMIT/GLOBK would be available to any MIT licensed user.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><br />Crustal motion geodesy - i.e. precise measurement of the motion and the deformation of the surface of the solid earth - is now widely used in the geosciences to study processes as diverse as plate tectonics, mountain building, earthquakes and climate change. The Geodesy and Geodynamics Group at Ohio State University (OSU) processes very large quantities of GPS data from many hundreds of geodetic GPS stations distributed all around the world, including the stations of several regional GPS networks that we at OSU have helped to build in order to solve specific regional problems in geodynamics and earth system science. Until recently, the routine geodetic analysis of all this GPS data was the productivity 'bottleneck' for almost every project in which we were engaged. We were 'compute limited'. We performed routine geodetic analysis of our GPS data using a cluster of forty Intel-based computers running the LINUX operating system.

Each physical core is associated with a virtual core that allows two jobs to run simultaneously (though one is slightly slower than the other). Benchmark tests established that in effect the new cluster can process 91 GAMIT jobs simultaneously.

Densification of the global polyhedron using regional GPS networks also improved. A task which used to take us 124 days on the LINUX&nbsp; cluster takes can be completed in 19 days on the Mac Pro cluster. Not only is the new cluster much faster than the old one, it had a lower total cost, and it is smaller and easier to manage. The major increase in computational throughput provided by the new processing cluster has allowed us the luxury of processing many large data sets over and over, thereby driving a 'continuous improvement' cycle which has greatly benefitted the quality of our geodetic solutions.
