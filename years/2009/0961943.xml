<AbstractNarration>This project studies how changes in the body that occurred during human evolution affect the ability to throw well. Humans are unique among primates in being able to throw objects with both great precision and speed. This ability may have helped our ancestors hunt and defend themselves.  To better understand the evolution and biomechanical bases for human throwing capabilities, this study investigates how changes in the shape of the bones in the arms, shoulders and back affect throwing performance. The researchers are collecting data on how the body moves during a throw using a high speed, 3D camera system. They will then use a custom written computer program to break down and examine the individual motions of each body part during that throw. These data will be collected from a large sample of individuals who vary in the anatomy of their arms, shoulders and back. In addition, restrictive braces will be used to alter the throwing motion in controlled ways. These manipulations will allow us to assess how different components of the trunk and arms contribute to speed and accuracy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses an interdisciplinary approach combining aspects of anthropology, biology, physics and sports medicine to address how different aspects of human anatomy relate to throwing performance. A better understanding of this relationship will improve not only our understanding of human evolution, but will also contribute to our knowledge of how injury occurs in throwing athletes. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
