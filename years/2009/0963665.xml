<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the Division of Chemistry (CHE)and the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) and Metals programs of the Division of Materials research (DMR) will support the "2010 Noble Metal Nanoparticles: Preparation, Modeling And Applications" Gordon research Conference to be held in Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA on June 20-25, 2010. This new Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Noble Metal Nanoparticles will define the frontiers of science associated with metal nanostructures. The conference will bring together leading scientists in three often separated but interrelated roles: makers, modelers, and measurers to discuss topics ranging from Advances in Synthesizing Metal Nanoparticles to Applications in Biomedicine, Catalysis, Energy, and the Environment to New Nanoscale Tools to Probe Structure and Nonlinear Properties. NSF funds will be used primarily to support the participation of junior researchers in the conference.</AbstractNarration>
