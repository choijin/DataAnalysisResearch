<AbstractNarration>There have been recent advances in understanding various ways of imbedding our universe in the 10 dimensional space where a consistent unified theory of particles which have extension (rather than being point-like) exists. The time is  thus now ripe for bringing systematic methods to bear on the construction and analysis of compactifications of string theory as models of realistic particle physics. The String Vacuum Project aims to pursue a systematic study of the space of string compactifications leading to four-dimensional physics. The PIs  will accomplish this with a two pronged approach. Using a bottom-up strategy the members of the collaboration will search for patches of string vacua which are as close as possible to low energy, phenomenologically acceptable theories. These can hopefully be tested at the Large Hadron Collider . On the other hand, using a top-down strategy the collaboration will pursue a general search of the string landscape of vacua in search of more general correlations. In order to accomplish their  goals the PIs  are proposing a String Vacuum Project (SVP) network with eight geographic nodes. They are asking for funds to support students who will work in the proposed area and funds to support travel to bi-annual network workshops.  This project has many broader implications. The explicit work on interpreting LHC data and on approaches to finding a theory underlying the signals will help realize the full potential of LHC, a project strongly supported by U.S. physics goals. This project is strongly interdisciplinary, involving particle physics, astrophysics, cosmology, string theory, mathematics, and information frontier analysis. The results will be disseminated via publication at all possible levels. There will be significant training of graduate students and postdocs, and the project will involve female and minority scientists to provide role model. The Pis anticipate that the results of this project will stimulate significant public interest, and they will systematically communicate results through public talks and articles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This grant is for the sole purpose  of funding the so-called 'String Vacuum Project' (SVP) --- a large  multi-institution, multi-disciplinary collaboration centered on eight  different research "nodes" across the US --- through the awarding of SVP  Fellowships to graduate students, and the holding of regular SVP  meetings to discuss and disseminate our results.   The primary goal of the String Vacuum Project is to advance and  coordinate research in string phenomenology. Broadly speaking, string  phenomenology concerns the new phenomenological insights and  implications that string theory provides for traditional particle  physics. In recent years, this interplay between string theory and  traditional particle physics has had a dramatic effect in reshaping our  understanding of the theoretical (and indeed the experimental)  possibilities for physics beyond the Standard Model, and has led to a  flowering of previously unimagined ideas. Such new ideas span the range  of energies from the TeV-scale all the way to the Planck scale, and  include the possibility of large extra spacetime dimensions, new  approaches to the gauge hierarchy problem, possible alternatives to  weak-scale supersymmetry, and new insights that come from recent  advances in non-perturbative string theory and D-branes. Research in  string phenomenology is crucial not only for shedding light on the  extent to which string theory is capable of describing the physical  world, but also for uncovering the generic lessons that string theory  provides in guiding low-energy model-building for physics beyond the  Standard Model. Thus, such research occupies a central position,  connecting formal string theory and low-energy phenomenology, and  thereby provides a useful bridge which enables low-energy model-builders  to take into account the ideas and constraints from string theory when  addressing physics at higher energy scales.  Through the duration of this multi-year grant, this grant provided fellowship support for four graduate students at the University of Michigan, four graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania, two graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and two graduate students at the University of Wisconsin.   This grant also supported several international  meetings of leading researchers working in this topic, so that they could learn of each other's research results and exchange ideas, forming new collaborations for the future.
