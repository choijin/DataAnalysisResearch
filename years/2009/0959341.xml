<AbstractNarration>0959341&lt;br/&gt;Heyman&lt;br/&gt;Macalester College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI-R2: Acquisition of a High-Power Femtosecond Ti:Sapphire Laser Oscillator for Time-Resolved Terahertz Spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;It is increasingly important to understand carrier transport phenomena in electronic materials on picosecond and femtosecond time-scales. We propose to acquire a high-power femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser oscillator to support characterization of electronic materials at Macalester College.  Time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy offers a sub-picosecond probe of conductivity and charge carrier mobility in materials.  This application requires a laser producing highly stable, powerful femtosecond laser pulses, and the system requested will provide an ideal balance of laser-power, repetition rate and stability for this purpose.  The system will initially be used to study carrier transport in graphene and ultrathin graphite.  Graphene, a novel carbon material consisting of a single sheet of carbon atoms, shows exceptional promise as an electronic material. The properties of few-layer graphite are tunable with thickness. The new laser system will also be used to study other electronic materials including semiconductors and semiconductor heterostructures.  Our research program will provide education and research training opportunities for advanced undergraduate students in Photonics and experimental Condensed Matter Physics.   The PI's research lab has trained 35 advanced undergraduates during the last 15 years.  More than two thirds of these students have pursued graduate degrees in Science, Math or Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;As the clock speeds of computers and transistors are pushed ever higher, it becomes increasingly important to understand how electric charge moves in the materials they are made from on ultra short time scales.   Time resolved terahertz spectroscopy can track the motion of electric charge over times as short as 1/100th of a trillionth of a second, a ten-thousandth of the interval between computer clock tics.  We can map out in time the processes which occur in transistors and photo-switches when they are switched from "off" to "on" with a pulse of light.  We propose to acquire a high-power femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser oscillator to support characterization of novel electronic materials and research training at Macalester College.  The system we are requesting will provide an ideal balance of laser-power, repetition rate and stability for time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy.   This system will initially be used to study graphene, a novel material consisting of single sheets of carbon atoms which shows exceptional promise as a material for ultra high-speed, nanometer-scale  transistors. Our research program will provide education and research training opportunities for advanced undergraduate students in Photonics and experimental Condensed Matter Physics.   The PI's research lab has trained 35 advanced undergraduates during the last 15 years.  More than two thirds of these students have pursued graduate degrees in Science, Math or Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this project is to characterize novel electronic materials, principally graphene, using sub-picosecond time-resolved photoconductivity measurements.  These measurements directly probe how electrical conductivity works in a material and how rapidly it changes in response to a disturbance, like a short pulse of light.  This in turn helps determine the maximum speed for fast electronic switches (transistors) made from these materials.  This grant allowed the principal investigator (PI) to obtain a femtosecond laser system which is well suited to these measurements and to setup the time-resolved photoconductivity system. The grant also allowed the PI to integrate a high-field magnet into this system to enable a novel time-resolved magneto-conductivity measurement.  Using the equipment obtained with this grant, we are performing time-resolved photoconductivity measurements in graphene.   We find that the conductivity change introduced by light persists for approximately 5 picoseconds following short pulse excitation, which is favorable for technological applications in high-speed electro-optics.  We are now studying a light-induced increase in the electron scattering rate which occurs over the same time interval.  We have also vetted our novel time-resolved magneto-conductivity measurement with test samples.  We plan to disseminate our results to the scientific community in several publications.  This grant also supports research training for undergraduate physics students. Two students were directly involved in setting up this state-of-the-art femtosecond laser system, and four other undergraduates had used the system for research by Summer, 2012.  We expect the equipment acquired with this grant to continue to support undergraduate research and research training in Physics for many years.   In addition, the system is used for demonstrations on non-linear optics and femtosecond optics in our classes.       Last Modified: 07/19/2012       Submitted by: James N Heyman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
