<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on advanced modeling of landslide and debris flows with an emphasis on determining the static and dynamic loads induced on protective structures arising from such events.   The work is based on numerical techniques utilizing the material point method (MPM) capable of modeling a broad range of landslide and debris flow phenomena, including transitions between solid and fluid-like flow behaviors.  The objective of the work is to extend the understanding of loading effects in general pertaining to natural and man made geomorphological and structural boundary conditions, as present in natural landscapes, highway systems, and protective structures. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research will advance knowledge and understanding by shedding new light on landslide and debris flow-induced loading.  The PIs are well-qualified to carry out the work, having demonstrated expertise in the required aspects of geotechnical engineering, constitutive modeling, numerical analysis, and computational modeling in general, and in developing a landslide modeling prototype, in particular. The proposed work is complementary to current and existing techniques and approaches, but it is fundamentally orthogonal to existing work in its conception and scope.  The work has been organized, budgeted, and linked to available facilities and personnel such that the objectives can be achieved within the proposed time frame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will demonstrate the possibility of a unified modeling framework capable of tracking the entire sequence of moisture-induced landslides and debris flow events, starting from an initial stable state, continuing through to the onset and manifestation of large scale flow, and ending with a return to a stable configuration, all while allowing the observation and quantification of key engineering phenomena and effects.  These kinds of capabilities can dramatically impact how infrastructure can be designed for such events in regards to both prevention and mitigation measures.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research will have broader impact on several fronts:&lt;br/&gt;(1) improved analysis capabilities can help mitigate the economic and social costs associated with infrastructure protection against landslides and debris-flows, which cause hundreds of billions of dollars of damage annually in the US alone;&lt;br/&gt;(2) enhanced modeling capabilities for geotechnical and related engineering applications will help extend the computational infrastructure available to engineers, researchers, and students;&lt;br/&gt;(3) visualization capabilities and materials specifically designed for educational use will broaden the contexts in which landslides and debris-flow related phenomena can be studied and understood, both at the undergraduate and graduate level.  We also will leverage the capabilities of the Engineering Advising &amp; Diversity Center in the College of Engineering at the University of Washington, to involve undergraduates from diverse backgrounds into this research project. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
