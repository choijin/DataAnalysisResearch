<AbstractNarration>This work aims to control quantum mechanical waves of electrons in space and time. Quantum mechanics is one the major discoveries of the last century and is now in the process of being developed into many areas of industry. Applications range from lasers and the global positioning system to nanotechnology. The technology the group is developing is aimed at constructing the largest electron interferometer in the world and the fastest electron switches ever made, which will give control of electron quantum mechanical waves. This control deepens our understanding of Quantum mechanics, and allows for the development of new applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A training ground for graduate and undergraduate students will continue to be provided in an area of national need. High school students are reached by the distribution of a Â½ hour movie on quantum waves (distribution exceeds 10,000 copies).  Electromagnetic field sensing (with the interferometer) and ultrafast time resolved electron microscopy (with fast electron switches) are explored and have potential for industrial application.</AbstractNarration>
