<AbstractNarration>Jones, DMS-0940363&lt;br/&gt;Camp, DMS-0940267&lt;br/&gt;Danforth, DMS-0940271&lt;br/&gt;Fung, DMS-0940272&lt;br/&gt;Golden, DMS-0940249&lt;br/&gt;Holland, DMS-0940241&lt;br/&gt;Kostelich, DMS-0940314&lt;br/&gt;McGehee, DMS-0940366&lt;br/&gt;Pierrehumbert, DMS-0940261&lt;br/&gt;Silber, DMS-0940262&lt;br/&gt;Tung, DMS-0940342&lt;br/&gt;Zeeman, DMS-0940243&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigators form a "Mathematics and Climate Research&lt;br/&gt;Network."  This is a framework for an intensive effort aimed at&lt;br/&gt;bringing to bear the full power of modern applied mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;statistics on the prediction and understanding of the Earth's&lt;br/&gt;climate.  The investigators focus on three key themes: (1)&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics of Climate, (2) Climate Process Modeling, and (3) Data&lt;br/&gt;Analysis and Data Assimilation.  Dynamics of Climate addresses&lt;br/&gt;critical climate processes and their interactions.  Climate&lt;br/&gt;Process Modeling undertakes the modeling of climate components&lt;br/&gt;that have been underrepresented in extant climate models, such as&lt;br/&gt;the multi-scale material structure of sea ice.  Data Analysis and&lt;br/&gt;Data Assimilation develops mathematical tools for analyzing&lt;br/&gt;climate data and assimilating them in current climate models. &lt;br/&gt;The Research Network aims to be a national resource, with&lt;br/&gt;participants at thirteen U.S. universities.  The investigators&lt;br/&gt;work together as a virtual community that holds regular weekly&lt;br/&gt;"webinars" and working meetings over the Internet.  This&lt;br/&gt;multi-year effort is expected to help in defining a research area&lt;br/&gt;of "climate mathematics" and in educating a new generation of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical researchers to meet the scientific challenges&lt;br/&gt;associated with a changing climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This project is driven by the need to better understand the&lt;br/&gt;Earth's climate system.  Climate is the result of many&lt;br/&gt;geophysical and chemical processes in the Earth's atmosphere,&lt;br/&gt;oceans and biosphere.  These processes evolve in time over many&lt;br/&gt;scales, ranging from minutes to centuries, and interact in&lt;br/&gt;multiple ways, most often nonlinearly.  Feedback mechanisms, many&lt;br/&gt;of which are poorly understood, further complicate the picture. &lt;br/&gt;Because there is only one Earth, climate cannot be studied by&lt;br/&gt;systematic experimentation; the only approach available to&lt;br/&gt;climate researchers is through computational experiments.  These&lt;br/&gt;experiments are based on mathematical models, which must be&lt;br/&gt;simple enough not to exceed the capabilities of today's advanced&lt;br/&gt;computer architectures, while still incorporating the physical&lt;br/&gt;and chemical processes that are essential for realistic climate&lt;br/&gt;outcomes.  The expertise of mathematical scientists in designing,&lt;br/&gt;assessing and interpreting these models is critical.  This&lt;br/&gt;"Mathematics and Climate Research Network" helps engage the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences community to address the mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;statistical issues of our changing climate.  The Research Network&lt;br/&gt;takes full advantage of current information technology;&lt;br/&gt;communication and collaboration among the participants takes&lt;br/&gt;place mostly remotely over the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

Cal Poly, a primarily undergraduate institution, is one of original nodes of the MCRN. The primary goal of the Cal Poly node has been to introduce and support undergraduate students in research in  applied mathematics and climate science.

They have also presented results from our work at regional and national conferences and workshops. The support provided by this grant allowed the students to participate in ongoing research in a richer environment than would normally be available to them at a primarily undergraduate university.  The scientific focus of the Cal Poly node has had the following components:  the development and implementation of advanced time series analysis techniques for extracting useful information from climatic records - particularly paleoclimate records; the interaction between conceptual climate models and analyses of climate data to improve model formulation, parameter estimation and model validation; the use of such improved model validation in model intercomparison studies to identify families of conceptual models which are more likely to represent the fundamental processes underlying observed climate behavior; the identification of features in the output of conceptual climates models which could distinguish the underlying mathematical structure of the models and therefore act as fingerprints in the data records for classes of model likely to be consistent with the observations.   The primary test case for the above goals has been the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) -- a change in the character of global glacial cycles which occurred approximately 1 million years ago (Mya). Due to sparse data records, the timing and character of the MPT is poorly understood. Furthermore, there are many competing hypotheses for the observed behavior and therefore a large number of competing conceptual models attempting to test which underlying processes are responsible for the observed behavior. As such, the MPT has proved to be a rich test bed for the development of time series analysis techniques and their use in improving the the modeling process. The issues of sparse data and multiple competing models are not unique to climate systems. The development of techniques for improving the use of data in intermodel comparisons can benefit any study of systems where models are being used to test hypotheses about underlying process for those systems.  Using modern time series analyses,  we can often provide new insight into the structure of the observations which, in turn, can help inspire and test hypotheses for the underlying processes. Eg., Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is a data-adaptive, local, nonlinear technique which provides a sparse decomposition of an empirical record sorted by time scale. In particular, for the MPT test case, we have been able to improve the understanding of the MPT and character of the glacial cycles of the Late Pleistocene. The observed records can be characterized primarily by the emergence of a dominant slow oscillation (100-kyr time-scale) at 1.25 Mya which grows to dominant a persistent fast oscillation (41-kyr time-scale). This analysis allows the subdominant fast oscillation during the late-Pleistocene (post-MPT) to be clearly isolated from the dominant slow oscillation.  For many climate systems, there exist a wide variety of conceptual models attempting to explain the observed behavior. These models are generally based on distinct combinations of physical processes and often have distinct mathematical structures. The use of modern time series analysis techniques can provide subtler ways to compare models against data and thereby improve both parameter estimation and model validation. This, in turn, can allow researchers to eliminate some of the contending models and focus attention on those which show more promise in providing an understanding of the underlying processes of the systems being studied. For the MPT test case, we compared the analyses of conceptual models of Pleistocene glacial cycles to the analysis of the empirical record. For each model, we were able to identify features in the model output which were inconsistent with the the observed behavior. By modifying the model (eg., replacing the insolation forcing function) or simply retuning the model parameters, we were able to improve the match of each model?s output to the observed record.  Using independent information reserved for model validation (eg., the behavior of the subdominant 41-kyr cycle in the late Pleistocene), we were able to perform a model intercomparison study and identify models which are substantially more consistent with the observed record.
