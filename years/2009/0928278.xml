<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research is to explore the fracture and fatigue mechanisms of nano ceramic films on polymer substrates under monotonic and cyclic loadings. Functional nano ceramic films on polymer substrates are emerging as key building blocks to enable promising technologies, such as flexible electronics and next generation bioactive implants. The huge mechanical mismatch and large mechanical loads lead to complex and rich fracture behaviors of thin ceramic films on polymer substrates, which are far from well understood. In particular, recent experiments showed fatigue damage of indium tin oxide films on polymer substrates under cyclic loads, a phenomenon that cannot be explained by conventional fatigue mechanisms. The future success of abovementioned promising technologies is contingent to the mechanistic understanding of the fracture and fatigue of nano ceramic films on polymer substrates. In this project, a collaborative research framework (from analytic modeling, simulations to in situ experiments) will be built to investigate the yet-unexplored mechanisms that govern the mechanical reliability of nano ceramic films on polymer substrates. &lt;br/&gt;The potential consequence of failure in functional nano ceramic films on polymer substrates is significant in flexible electronics and bioactive implants. The proposed research will offer fundamental insights into the yet-unexplored mechanisms that govern the reliability of flexible devices and bioactive implants, and enable more robust nanomanufacturing strategies of these emerging technologies. By leveraging cyberinfrastructure, the new knowledge from the project will be disseminated to reach much broader audience, and a new generation of students will be equipped with interdisciplinary perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
