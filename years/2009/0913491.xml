    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is awarded using funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs) are special Voronoi tessellations having the property&lt;br/&gt;that the generators of the Voronoi tessellations are also the centroids, with respect to a &lt;br/&gt;given density function, of the corresponding Voronoi cells. In this project, we will continue &lt;br/&gt;to investigate algorithms for computing CVTs and CVT-based applications for scientific &lt;br/&gt;and engineering problems. Topics of the proposed project include: study of single limit-point &lt;br/&gt;convergence analysis for the Lloyd's algorithm; development and analysis of nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;conjugate gradient methods for computing CVTs; study and implementation of parallel CVT/CVDT &lt;br/&gt;mesh generation on the distributed systems; improving existing CCVT-based techniques for &lt;br/&gt;surface meshing; incorporating these meshing schemes in adaptive solutions of partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations, especially for the convection-dominated problems; and further &lt;br/&gt;investigation and improvement of the edge-weighted CVT model and corresponding algorithms for &lt;br/&gt;image segmentation that combines the intensity information in the color space of the image &lt;br/&gt;and the local edge information in the physical space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CVT-based methodologies have been proven to be very useful in diverse applications in the past &lt;br/&gt;decade, including but not limited to, image processing, vector quantization and data &lt;br/&gt;analysis, resource optimization, optimal placement of sensors and actuators for control, cell &lt;br/&gt;biology and territorial behavior of animals, high-quality point sampling, mesh generation and &lt;br/&gt;optimization, numerical partial differential equations, climate and atmospheric science, &lt;br/&gt;model reduction, computer graphics and vision, mobile sensing networks, logistics system &lt;br/&gt;design, and etc. The application list is still growing. The proposed project has a &lt;br/&gt;comprehensive coverage of algorithm design and analysis, implementation and applications of &lt;br/&gt;CVTs to diverse problems in science and engineering. Mathematical tools are used to analyze &lt;br/&gt;these techniques to give guidelines for their applicability; practical considerations &lt;br/&gt;including parallel implementation issues are addressed to make the algorithms competitive in &lt;br/&gt;real applications and large scale computations. The proposed investigation will offer new &lt;br/&gt;insight into the understanding of the elegant Lloyd's algorithm and it will also lead to &lt;br/&gt;exploration of transformative concepts and renovation of computational algorithms for many &lt;br/&gt;important applications involving mesh optimization, adaptive algorithms, energy minimization&lt;br/&gt;and image processing based on the CVT methodologies. In addition, this project will also offer &lt;br/&gt;a unique educational opportunity for graduate students with interests in computational and &lt;br/&gt;applied mathematics, engineering and information technology by having them participate in an &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary research program.</AbstractNarration>
