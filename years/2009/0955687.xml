<AbstractNarration>This project aims to establish rigorous qualitative behavior of problems arising in nonlinear partial differential equations and comprises three parts. The first part consists of a family of problems arising in the study of phase transition equations, including those that model superconductivity and superfluidity. When a certain parameter becomes asymptotically large, these materials form vortices, which are regions of high energy and spin. This part of the project studies the dynamical behavior of asymptotically large numbers of vortices, each of which contain an asymptotically large amount of energy. The second part of the project analyzes the nucleation and dynamical behavior of vortices in models for thin micromagnetic materials. Such problems arise in magnetic information storage devices. The analytical methods used in the first and second part of the project come from geometric measure theory and the calculus of variations. The third part of the research project entails an analysis of water waves over variable topographies. The analytical methods employed will include bifurcation theory, harmonic analysis, and spectral theory, along with numerical experiments. Tied to the three research areas are several educational projects that aim to train undergraduate and graduate students in analysis, along with the goal of raising interest in applied mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fluid dynamics and materials science, vorticity roughly measures the local rotation of either a fluid or a phase function. In many important physical contexts, vorticity is a crucial component, and in many cases understanding the vorticity leads to understanding of the entire physical problem. The first two parts of the project study the qualitative behavior of vorticity in two physics problems of importance to materials science, superconductors and thin micromagnetic films. These materials are of increasing use in applications, such as in powerful magnets and information storage devices. The third part of the proposal centers on understanding the behavior of ideal fluids with free boundaries, which arise in the study of waves on the surface of the ocean or fast-moving streams. The equations that model these problems are complicated; however, since these problems arise with great frequency, their analysis is important. Educational and training objectives are clearly and closely tied to the research projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Superconductors, superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates are unusual states of matter in which electrical resistance in superconductors and internal friction in superfluids disappear.  One very general feature of these condensed states are the presence of vortices, which are localized eddies that arise from a complex interplay between magnetic fields or stirring and the condensed matter.    One main objective of this research project was to try to understand what happens when there are huge numbers of these vortices in the equations that govern superconductors and superfluids.  Understanding the behavior of large numbers of vortices in superconductors is very important as typical Type II superconductors have enormous numbers of vortices per square centimeter.  The results from this project provided a rigorous connection between the underlying equations and the effective equations that describe the average behavior of all of the vortices.    A second main objective of the project was rooted in the study of micromagnetic vortices.  Micromagnetic vortices arise in ultrathin magnetic materials, used widely in hard drives.  These micromagnetic vortices are interesting from a pratical point of view as they could potentially encode information by the description of the defect.  Effective equations for these defects in micromagnetic materials have been used widely, but this project provided a rigorous explanation for the expected dynamical equations.  The tools proved flexible enough to be used in other contexts, including in the equations for superconductivity.    There have been additional results during the course of the project including understanding the complex behavior of vortices in Bose-Einstein condensates that interact with magnetic traps and other vortices,  studying of some problems that arise in water waves, and studying very efficient numerical schemes that are used in nonlinear optics.
