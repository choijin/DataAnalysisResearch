<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the development of an interdisciplinary, cellular to societal, graduate training program in Aging Sciences at Oregon State University (OSU). The program capitalizes on synergies among scientists at OSU's Center for Healthy Aging Research in the following multidisciplinary research cores: 1) Diet, Genes, and Aging; 2) Musculoskeletal Aging; 3) Psychosocial Aging, and 4) Gerontechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Dramatic increases in longevity have altered the nature of work, family relationships, retirement, health care, and the economy. Maintenance of independence and physical, cognitive, and psychological health in later life depends on understanding and advances in nutrition, exercise, sociocultural factors, assistive technology, and the built environment. Broader Impacts: The IGERT in Aging Sciences trains a new generation of U.S. researchers in cross disciplinary work using state-of-the-art equipment and methods to discover mechanisms that moderate the rate of aging and affect quality of life. Student recruitment from underrepresented groups, attention to diversity, and global education enhance all training aspects. The newly developed Aging Sciences minor will produce effective communicators who can leverage their comprehensive knowledge of aging and foster interdisciplinary collaborations. Structured activities include: participation in research apprenticeships with faculty from two research cores; weekly forums addressing professional development issues and a problem-based yearlong project; participation in the annual LIFE (Linking Individuals, Families, and Environments) Academy, external internships, and opportunities to build mentoring and teaching skills. These programmatic activities position students to make contributions to knowledge of optimal aging through research and to develop innovative products, services, and policies for an aging society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[For the first time in history, the number of adults in the world age 65 and over outnumbers children under age five.  The historically unprecedented number of older adults alive today presents great opportunities for societies because many people in old age are vibrant and productive members of their communities. However, this productive capacity of older adults hinges on a critical factor &ndash; good health.  While a long life is desirable, a long life in good health, or increased "healthspan" to complement our increased lifespan, is even more valuable.  Yet this ideal is still elusive, as studies have shown that few older adults are maintaining exceptionally good health.  An understanding of how and why some people age optimally opens possibilities for intervening in ways that would allow more people to thrive in later life.  How do we explain the large differences in health between individuals, with some people being quite compromised by midlife yet others able to run marathons as octogenarians?  Arguably the most basic fact in aging research is this increased heterogeneity in later life.  In our training program it was essential for students to understand what we currently know, and what we still need to learn, about risk and resilience factors, along with strategies for positive interventions that improve quality of life when illness or frailty make independent living a challenge.  Thus, a vision for our training program was to catalyze the science of optimal aging, and importantly, to give students the conceptual frameworks and methodological tools to address critical questions about aging from the molecular to the societal levels.  In order to address the healthspan ideal of living relatively free from debilitating diseases and functional impairments in later life, research at the intersections between disciplinary sciences is necessary. Faculty associated with this IGERT were from four research cores: diet and genetics, musculoskeletal, psychosocial and gerontechnology.  This IGERT Training program: LIFE* (*Linking Individuals, Families, and Environments) in an Aging Society, was predicated on two broad overarching themes:  1) Rate of Aging &ndash; which referred to efforts aimed at understanding basic mechanisms of aging, which may either accelerate or slow the rate of aging; and 2) Engineering Aging &ndash;  which referred to our mission to improve quality of life by using basic knowledge to devise and test interventions across cellular to societal levels of the human-environment system. Proactive interventions, such as dietary adjustment of micronutri&shy;ents, fitness programs, or tools for personal management of environmental exposure to stress could lessen the risk of disease development and functional impairment.  Intellectual Merit:  Over the 5-year history of this IGERT doctoral training grant, IGERT faculty and trainees have made valuable research contributions to the multidisciplinary field of aging sciences that have resulted in 157 journal articles in refereed publications, 2 books, 26 book chapters, and 186 conference presentations throughout our IGERT grant?s funding period. Among the many research accomplishments, specific achievements stand out as pioneering projects that have advanced the aging sciences in interdisciplinary ways that may never have happened without the training grant. Key findings include: new ways of maintaining health and social goals using a web-based platform; an innovative sensor created to simultaneously study movement, respiration, and heart-rate information non-invasively; the beneficial role micronutrients like alpha-lipoic acid can play in improving health in older adults; novel estimates of hip and spinal loading during exercise, with application to prevention osteoporotic fractures; and the relationship between long-term patterns of stress and mortality.    Broad Impact:  The training program and funding significantly enhanced the graduate experience of 27 students who were IGERT trainees.  These students were supported by enriched interdisciplinary networks of faculty and students from disciplines that supplemented their doctoral major.  All students had the opportunity to earn a Minor in Aging Sciences, created as part of this IGERT.  They took interdisciplinary graduate courses created for the minor, had extended research experiences, worked together on a major project related to an aging issue, had professional development seminars, and participated in a national conference on aging.  In addition to giving people information they can use to improve their own healthspan, we also emphasized the importance of designing appropriate environments that afford opportunities for meaningful engagement in life, including physical, mental, and social activities.   The trainees will have broad impact by leveraging their interdisciplinary knowledge and networks in their future careers.  The IGERT framework has made these pioneering studies and strong education in aging possible through its integrative structure, interdisciplinary training, and consistent funding. As our world continues to face family, medical, and policy issues associated with population aging, the science of aging needs to address ways in which we can optimize aging. The IGERT in Aging Sciences united researchers and trained students from distinct fields of aging to discover and explore novel solutions for our aging nation and world.
