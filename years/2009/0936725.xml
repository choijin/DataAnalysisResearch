<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This is a three-year collaborative research project between Old Dominion University and Norfolk State University examining gender issues in professional identity development among engineering (ENG) and computer science (CS) students. Developing professional identity can help engender a sense of belonging in the STEM field that ultimately contributes to undergraduate retention. Grounded in social cognitive career theory (SCCT), this project investigates the mechanisms by which professional identity is developed when students capitalize on self-development opportunities available outside of the classroom. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project applies SCCT, a well established theoretical framework, to capitalization, a new area of research.  Investigating capitalization using SCCT contributes to understanding gender differences in STEM and to the broader social psychology and capitalization literatures. Multiple research methods are used, including qualitative critical incident interviews, quantitative longitudinal surveys, and quasi-experimental design to test utility of capitalization training. The proposal includes several benchmarks and an experienced evaluator to oversee all assessment and statistical aspects of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research contributes to the development of human capital by identifying mechanisms for intervention in the effort to increase gender equity in STEM. The training experiment is expected to yield evidenced-based methods for improving capitalization antecedents and capitalization; and, as a result, contribute to the development of professional identity, thereby leveling the playing field for women. Since capitalization is a self-development skill known to yield positive benefits in the workforce, skills developed at the undergraduate level will contribute to the development and retention of STEM professionals as well. Examining a Historically Black University and a Predominantly White University broadens the understanding of capitalization across contexts. Expanding the knowledge base regarding supports and barriers at each university type provides the opportunity to derive a common set of ?best practices? with wide applicability. Research findings will be shared via an interactive website; international, national and regional conferences and journal publications; and brochures and email campaigns targeted to relevant departments and professional societies nationally.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project, which came to be known as CAPSTONE (CAPitalizing on Science &amp; Technology Opportunities iN Education), was a collaborative research initiative between Old Dominion University and Norfolk State University.  BACKGROUND: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields have become increasingly important to U.S. economic growth and competitiveness. Yet, retention in STEM remains a persistent problem. It is a national priority to identify ways to anchor students to their STEM majors through to degree completion in preparation for workforce participation. One avenue for ensuring the vitality of the STEM workforce is helping students develop a sense of professional identity with their field while in college.  RESEARCH STUDY PURPOSE: This project focused on developing professional identity among college students in STEM; professional identify relates to a personÆs ability to see him or herself being successful and thriving in a given profession. In our research, we were particularly interested in exploring how voluntary professional development activities available outside of the STEM classroom (such as joining science clubs, participating in internship opportunities, and identifying mentors) impacted professional identity for students interested in obtaining BachelorÆs degrees (and beyond) in STEM. Further, we wanted to know if developing professional identity created a greater sense of belonging in STEM and ultimately contributed to keeping students in STEM.  We explored these ideas from three angles, discussed here in question-form: (1) What factors impact whether students choose to participate in professional development activities, and do students who participate develop a positive professional identity? (2) If students are encouraged or discouraged by people (family members, educators, peers) or circumstances (e.g., lack of time) do they increase, decrease, or maintain a level amount of participation in professional development over time? (3) Do students choose more professional development activities and form a more positive professional identity if they are taught about STEM opportunities to explore outside of the classroom soon after they start college?  To answer these questions we surveyed 1,202 college students from Computer Science and Engineering majors at two universities. Some received training on ways to learn about and gain access to extra-curricular, professional development activities and some were simply asked about the activities in which they participated.  RESEARCH FINDINGS: HereÆs what we learned: (1) Students who engaged in professional development first become interested in doing so, which spurred an intention or goal to participate in professional development. (2) Students who received encouragement from people or circumstances were more likely to feel empowered/have higher self-efficacy for participating in professional development activities, while a perceived lack of time and discouragement had the opposite effect. (3) Students encountered a varied level of support and discouragement from people and circumstances as they continued in their STEM majors. Students with high levels of support did more professional development; students with low levels of support did less over time. (4) StudentsÆ interests in professional development were more likely to develop when they had high self-efficacy and expected good things to result from professional development. (5) Training students to participate in professional development equipped them to know what to expect and to develop professional identity based on what they learned.  (6) Students who took advantage of professional development activities were more committed to their STEM majors, were more likely to identify as a STEM professional, and were more likely to intend to persist in STEM. (7) Finally, these findings applied across gender, race, and major field of study.  IMPLICATIONS: Professional development and the support neces...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
