    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will develop and employ an innovative signal amplification methodology to create highly sensitive polymer sensors that can detect mold in residential and workplace settings. One method is to detect the airborne microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOC) released by growing mold. However, to be valuable any technology needs to be highly sensitive to the MVOC compounds, provide real time results, portable and inexpensive. The results of the proposed research will lead to highly sensitive sensors that can be incorporated into a handheld instrument which will regularly screen suspect areas to provide early detection and point of source mold detection in areas where mold may be present but not seen, create building histories, provide understanding of the relationship between mold and health, and promote standards relating to the levels of MVOC in workplaces and other buildings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently mold is primarily detected through human observation - sight and smell ? however, by the time mold is detected through human observation, it has already been growing for some time in hidden or inaccessible areas, and may have caused adverse health problems and significant property damage. The proposed research will enhance the science of polymer based sensors through developing and proving a new signal amplification strategy. This same strategy can be used across many different polymer types and detection problems to enable trace detection of compounds in other applications such as security explosives) and industrial safety (toxic industrial chemicals).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
