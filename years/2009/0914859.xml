<AbstractNarration>The Mathematics Department of the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) has had five years of very productive experience in mathematics with the Summer Program in Research and Learning (SPIRAL). SPIRAL is the recipient of an award from the American Mathematical Society (Programs That Make a Difference, April, 2008) and plays an important role in increasing the inclusion of underrepresented groups into the mathematics profession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from NSF and NSA we have formed a partnership with a group of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to bring undergraduate students to UMCP for a six week program of instruction, research and enrichment. We provide instruction in advanced mathematics, we engage in research that can be, and has been, extended significantly beyond the six week program, and we have visits and presentations with agencies that employ significant mathematics in their work. Examples of the latter would be the National Security Agency (NSA) and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). We provide the students with detailed information about graduate programs and discussions with our current graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have an active mentoring program during this six week session. The mentors are graduate students in our mathematics department, which includes SPIRAL participants from previous years. This mentoring is particularly important and well-received by the participants. Additionally, the Mathematics Department at UMCP has been supporting, on a volunteer basis, tutoring and outreach to area middle schools serving minorities. We are expanding this program through the SPIRAL grant.</AbstractNarration>
