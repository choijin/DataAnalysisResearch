<AbstractNarration>Professor Barbara Buttenfield in the Department of Geography at the University of Colorado Boulder and Nicholas Nagle in the Department of Geography at the University of Tennessee will develop methods that situate public use census microdata in space at finer resolutions than are currently available in the public domain. The methods they will use impute a set of sample weights (probabilities) that allocate microdata records to census tracts with the addition of ancillary data, even to sub-tract levels. These sample weights respect publicly available census tract statistics, as well as correlations between census data and ancillary landuse and land cover. Importantly, the methodology is derived using statistical methods of empirical likelihood, and allows for quantification of uncertainty and simulations of small area populations, thus offering a significant advance over existing methodologies. While the method depends entirely on publicly available data, validation will utilize confidential census records held at the Census Research Data Centers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables from this research include methods, tools and usage guidelines that allow efficient construction of sample weights. Workshops will make these tools available to urban geographers, landuse planners, transportation specialists, demographers and educators. A website will disseminate the methods as Matlab, Python and R scripts, as a contribution to cyberinfrastructure, so that others may utilize tools. This website will be evaluated through a three-week short-course at the University of Colorado, by a planning workshop at Tennessee (an EPSCOR state) as well as by workshops at geography, urban planning and statistics national conventions. The project will provide specific recommendations to the US Census Bureau so that they may improve the relevance of public data for small area research, estimation and policy analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Social scientists and policy researchers often require detailed data about households in order to conduct their research, however these data could be potentially sensitive to individuals.  Public Use Microdata are one vitally important solution to this problem.  Public Use Microdata provide household level data that are anonymized using many techniques, making it impossible to link to a record in the data to the household in real life.  These Public Use Microdata, however, have very little geographic information.  This is a weakness because social science and policy research often requires information about households and their neighborhoods; Public Use Microdata are currently unable to help in this research.    This research developed statistical techniques for predicting the possible neighborhoods that a household in the Public Use Microdata might live in.  This does not identify the true, unique neighborhood, rather it generates the probability that each census tract contains a household like the one in the Public Use Microdata.  This research has the potential to greatly expand the types of research that can be conducted with Public Use Microdata.  Research questions involving neighborhood and geographic context that could previously be addressed only with confidential data might now be addressed with Public Use Microdata, thereby reducing the demand for access to the confidential records and increasing the protection of those data.  This research project has developed collaboration with researchers at a Department of Energy national laboratory.  We have developed an algorithm for simulating households within every census block in the United States.  This algorithm has been used generate a realistic model of every household in New York City, which has now been used to generate analysis of travel behavior between home and work by car, public transit, bicycle, and walking. The algorithm has also been used to develop geographically detailed estimates of energy demand, and to forecast household demand for alternative energy sources. This algorithm is now being automated so that synthetic populations can be developed on demand, and large-scale dataset is being developed that would contain a model of the United States population at the household and neighborhood level. It should be emphasized that this model does not compromise that anonymity of individuals, but that this model is realistic in that neighborhoods contain the same types of households that they might contain in real life.  This research has also developed collaboration with the NSF-funded Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS). IPUMS is a user-friendly repository of Public Use Microdata in the United States.  Before now, geography has not been available in the IPUMS. In collaboration with IPUMS, this research has produced simulated neighborhoods (census tracts) for every IPUMS record in the United States.  Collaborative work is now validating these simulated neighborhoods.  If successful, these simulations will be added to IPUMS for all researchers to request and use in their research.  Statistically, the methods that have been developed are similar to other methods that are used by survey researchers to "weight" surveys in order to correct for over- and under-sampling.  Existing approaches have developed the weights so that the survey exactly reproduce population statistics such as totals and averages.  This approach can become unreliable when the population statistics are imperfect. This research expanded that approach by allowing the survey to approximately, rather than exactly match population statistics.

This method makes the weighting procedure much more robust and increase the mean square error of estimates.  In the current research, we used this method match microdata samples to neighborhood-level population statistics, however the method is significantly more general in it range of applications.
