<AbstractNarration>The objective of this GOALI proposal is the fabrication of high mobility, ZnO nanowire field-effect transistor, with both n-type and p-type doing, on polymer or glass substrate for transparent and flexible electronics applications.  The approach is to: 1) Synthesize single crystal n- and p-type ZnO nanowires during high temperature deposition on a growth substrate, 2) Perform systematic analysis of the defects in ZnO nanowires, and understand the dopant compensation mechanisms, 3) Characterize and simulate transport properties of parallel aligned nanowire arrays through field effect transistor, and 4) Explore mass integration of parallel-aligned ZnO nanowire arrays onto transparent glass or plastic substrates at low temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit lies in the transformative concepts and approaches that will greatly increase the performance, especially device speed, of transparent electronics.  Through a collaborative effort between Arizona State University and Structured Materials Industries, Inc., integration of robust and reliable ZnO NW devices onto polymer substrates will be pursued, beginning with designed synthesis process to understanding their solid state chemistry, and then scaling up for subsequent device integration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed activity is the low temperature integration of high mobility materials (synthesized at high temperatures) onto transparent substrates. The educational aspect will have far reaching consequences; for example, the program will train personnel (including student from a rich pool of underrepresented minorities in Arizona) in a technologically important and futuristic area, so that they can apply their science and engineering skills in the US industries and research laboratories upon completion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
