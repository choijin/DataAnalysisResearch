<AbstractNarration>This proposal focuses on mathematical models for the selection of experimental or observational units in sample surveys, traffic studies, ecological surveys and clinical trials. The PI studies the concept of auto-generation of units, a marked point process for the occurrence of events, interpreted as observational units, the mark incorporating all relevant quantitative information. This is intended as a probabilistic model for situations such as marketing studies and animal behaviour surveys, where each sampling unit is a event having a random type or mark, including both covariate and response. Since the number of units and the covariate configuration are both random, care must be taken in calculating the response distribution because different schemes for sampling the point process yield different sampling distributions. The sampling scheme may be biased in the sense that it favours larger values of the response. Less obvious biases may occur in samples drawn from binary random-effects models. For example, there may be interference from the covariate value for other events. Moreover, the response distribution for a unit taken by quota sample from a fixed covariate stratum need not be the same as the conditional distribution for an autogenerated unit having the same covariate value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the traditional statistical formulation taken from field trials, the set of units is regarded as fixed in advance, and treatment is assigned at random to those fixed units. In survey work, the sample units are selected from the population by an objective randomization mechanism independent of the response.&lt;br/&gt;By contrast, in animal behaviour studies, each behaviour event is a unit, and neither the number nor the configuration of units is pre-specified. In clinical trials, the patients are not fixed in advance, nor are they selected by random sampling. Instead, they are volunteers, to some extent self-selected, and frequently subject to pre-screening to improve compliance rates. The aim of this work is to develop probabilistic schemes tailored to biased-sampling schemes of this sort, where the response distribution among sampled units may be different from the response distribution in the broader population.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is concerned to a large extent with partition models and their application in scientific and commercial work related to classification of objects based on observed features.   For the past several years, the PI has been investigating the possibiity of using Boson, or permanental, point processes for classification purposes.  These processes are particularly suited for applications in which the underlying index space is a metric space on which a Gaussian process may be defined.  The permanental classification scheme uses only local information, but potentially in a highly non-linear way.   At one extreme, it is comparable with Fisher's linear discriminant;  at the other extreme it is comparable with nearest neighbour classification.   Unfortunately, the permanent of a large matrix, which arises as the probability density of a Boson process, and is needed for classification, is notoriously difficult to compute.  This has been a stumbling block for many years.  In a paper written jointly with Jie Yang and K. Miescke, we examine the possibility of using a recursive cyclic approximation, not for the permanent directly, but for the classification function, which is a permanent ratio.  The first-order recursive approximation is a natural kernel function, an additive function of the neighbouring points;  the second-order approximation is an additive function of pairs of neighbours, and so on, progressively taking account of non-linearity.  Our experience is that a second or third-order cyclic approximation is adequate and results in good performance for classification.  A second paper published in the Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation aims to approximate the permanent of a doubly stochastic matrix. Unlike previous attempts using Monte Carlo methods on a fixed matrix, this approach is analytic and asymptotic, and claims to achieve decreasing relative error for large n for a suitable sequence of doubly stochastic matrices.   The derivation is straightforward, series expansion followed by aggregation of terms not by degree, but by asymptotic magnitude in n.  This procedure gives rise to a determinantal approximation with relative error decreasing in n.  A third paper reviews some of the combinatorics of cumulants and partition lattices, and points to connections with free cumulants.
