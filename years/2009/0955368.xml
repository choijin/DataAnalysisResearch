<AbstractNarration>Dr. Kannappan proposes to lead and carry out a project that will advance our understanding of cosmology by investigating the 'missing baryons' problem, so named since most of the normal baryonic matter predicted from early-universe cosmology is not seen at the present epoch. She will investigate this problem by conducting the RESOLVE (Resolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE) survey. RESOLVE will produce 2-D optical and radio spectroscopy of a carefully selected sample of approximately 1500 galaxies in the nearby cosmic web. When the survey is completed it will be the first to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Directly determine the fundamental distribution of internal velocities within the sample, i.e. the 'velocity function' of the sample&lt;br/&gt;- Perform an analysis of disk growth and survival in relation to merging and cosmic structure&lt;br/&gt;- Put a new type of constraint on the distribution of missing baryons through a self-consistent mass census which will be analyzed in conjunction with star formation patterns and numerical simulations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Kannappan will use the data from RESOLVE to train a new generation of scientists in multiple areas of astronomy including: spectroscopy, radio astronomy, and survey data handling. RESOLVE data will be made available on the web where it will be used in data-driven activities that are geared toward projects for high school and undergraduate students. Additionally, Dr. Kannappan will develop an astronomy curriculum that is aligned to the North Carolina science standards. This work is in collaboration with current teachers and is based on her experience in the Teach for America program, a program that typically targets minority and/or low-income communities.</AbstractNarration>
