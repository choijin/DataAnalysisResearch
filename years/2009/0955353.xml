<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This project supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in DMR  studies chemical factors that influence magnetic behavior of solid state materials. The first part of the project focuses on investigation of magnetostructural correlations and anomalous magnetic behaviors in rare-earth transition metal phosphides and arsenides with the ThCr2Si2-type structure. The overall goal is to understand how chemical modifications impact the structural and magnetic properties of these phases, which exhibit dramatically different magnetic behavior depending on the nature of the rare-earth and transition metals. The targeted materials are closely related to the isostructural FeAs-based superconductors, and it is expected that findings from this part of the project will also provide knowledge that is relevant to other important classes of materials.  The second part of the project uses exploratory synthesis for discovery of lanthanide-rich magnetic phases in Ln-T-X systems (Ln = rare-earth metal; T = transition metal; X = P, As, Ge, Sn). Very few phases have been reported in the rare-earth rich part of such ternary diagrams, and the extensive exploration of compositions with &gt; 40% content of Ln may uncover new materials with prominent magnetic properties. The study of correlations between structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of these materials will contribute to our understanding of complex interactions between the localized f-electrons and itinerant d-band magnetism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in DMR supports the search for magnetic solids with improved performance which requires fundamental understanding of correlations between the crystal structure and magnetic behavior. The proposed research is directed at the exploration of this relationship and preparation of new materials with potentially promising magnetic properties. These goals will be achieved through chemical modification of materials to control their magnetic behavior and the use of innovative synthetic approaches for the discovery of new magnets. The project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of solid state chemistry, crystallography, and magnetism. The research objectives are intertwined with the development of an innovative curriculum in materials chemistry. As a part of the project, a series of visual materials will be implemented to provide an introduction to instrumental methods in materials research for both undergraduate and high-school students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project, funded by the NSF CAREER program, was devoted to the establishment of the research and educational programs by Prof. Michael Shatruk at Florida State University (FSU).  Intellectual Merit.  Research. Project activities have led to implementation of an active and productive research program in the area of itinerant magnets. Such materials play central role in a number of modern technological applications, including permanent magnets for electric motors and wind turbines and soft magnets for magnetic refrigeration. Research activities carried out by the Shatruk group have shed light on fundamental aspects of interactions between 4f and 3d magnetic moments in ternary rare-earth transition metal intermetallics. In addition, new synthetic approaches were developed that allowed the synthesis and crystal growth of a number of important magnetic materials in phase-pure form. Specific research outcomes include:  The discovery of strong dependence of magnetic transitions in RCo2P2 materials on the nature of the rare-earth metal R. In particular, we discovered that a cascade of magnetic phase transitions can be induced in the mixed phosphide La0.75Pr0.25Co2P2, while the behavior of pure LaCo2P2 and PrCo2P2 is much simpler. The modification of the magnetic properties was traced to the strong mutual influence of the 4f and 3d magnetic moments. The use of chemical pressure effect to induce ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of 3d moments in Pr0.8Eu0.2Co2P2, in contrast to their antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering in PrCo2P2. We demonstrated that the constriction of the Eu site introduced into the PrCo2P2 lattice induced mixed valence of Eu, which in turn led to the electron transfer from the Eu 4f to Co 3d orbitals, causing the FM ordering in the Co sublattice. We successfully synthesized phase-pure samples and grew single crystals of RCo2As2, using reactions between elements in molten Bi. This synthetic discovery enabled, for the first time, the study of magnetic properties for these materials. In contrast to earlier studied RCo2P2 analogs, of which all but La-containing compound exhibit AFM ordering of Co moments, all RCo2P2 materials show FM ordering of Co moments. A series of intermetallics with giant unit cells, such as Sm117Co52Sn112, were synthesized, and their crystal structures were described in terms of concentric multishell polyhedra. We also reported magnetic behavior of these fascinating materials. We discovered a large magnetocaloric effect near room temperature in an itinerant magnet, AlFe2B2. This materials shows soft ferromagnetism with very small energy losses. AlFe2B2 also is composed of light-weight and earth-abundant elements. All these properties make it a promising material for magnetic refrigeration, a quickly emerging technology that is poised to displace the conventional gas expansion-compression refrigeration in various appliances in the near future.   Education. The main focus of the PI's educational effort was the establishment of the curriculum in chemistry of materials on both graduate and undergraduate levels.  A series of graduate courses was built using a modular structure, according to which each one-semester course consisted of three modules taught by three different faculty members. This approached allowed better diversification of topics and tailoring the graduate coursework individually for each student. The modular curriculum was approved by FSU and implemented in the graduate program in Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry. As part of the new graduate curriculum, the PI developed two new graduate courses, Advanced Inorganic Chemistry and Topics in Materials Chemistry. The PI was recognized by the FSU Graduate Teaching Award for the efforts to establish the graduate curriculum in materials chemistry.   Broader Impacts.  Research.  The project activiites have significantly advanced our understanding of itinerant magnets, providing a crucial link between the chemistry and physics of these fascinating mater...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
