<AbstractNarration>The PI requests funding to develop and test a new kind of "float" called the ?Bottom Drifter?. It is like an Argo-like profiling float but with a small ADCP that can operate in bottom track mode. With the float close to the bottom the PI?s can record velocity and thus track it without an acoustic network. . The Bottom Drifter is expected to be of use for boundary currents, topographically enhanced flow, deep mid-ocean ridge circulation, and circulation in coastal regions. In the near-shore environment applications to water quality studies in lakes and estuaries is possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bottom Drifter will provide a new view of bottom-intensified processes thought to be important for a variety of ocean problems. It will bring together scientists in several disciplines to match sensors to the type of application desired. Graduate students from three disciplines (biology, chemistry, and physical oceanography) will be involved in testing and using the instruments proposed here.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Near bottom biological processes, especially oxygen minimum zone processes, and lateral mixing controls on hypoxic zones.  In addition to the circulation estimates such a drifter will allow one to investigate the lateral advection of key biochemical parameters, a good example being oxygen, along the bottom.
