<AbstractNarration>The Program for Women and Mathematics is an annual two-week program organized at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), co-sponsored by Princeton University.  The program takes place each spring and is organized by senior women in mathematics; it centers around a mathematical theme that changes from year-to-year.  The participants span different levels; they include undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and senior women. The goals of the program are to enhance the mathematics education of talented women mathematicians through a rigorous and intense academic program, and to retain these women in the field by providing mentoring and by establishing an extensive network of women mathematicians. Program activities include an undergraduate-to-beginning-graduate course in an area related to the research subject of the year, an advanced graduate course, usually divided into two separate short courses, intended to be an introduction to state-of- the-art research in that year's chosen field of mathematics; research seminars in which reports from postdoctoral level participants; problem and review sessions; and women-in-science seminars that include interviews with senior women in the field, panel discussions on topics of interest and organized discussions on subjects which range from how to set up a Noetherian Ring to interviewing for a job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Program for Women and Mathematics has been running for more than 15 years.  It consistently receives rave reviews.  The program is not only praised for its intense scientific curriculum, it is also unique in representing different mathematical professional paths and different stages in such a path.  Participants establish strong professional relationships that far outlast the ten-day academic program.  The establishment of a network of women at various levels, who can (and do!) support and mentor one another through difficult transition points, has been a well-cultivated outcome of the program, and is something that expands and becomes stronger as the program continues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Program for Women and Mathematics  Outcomes Report   The Women and Mathematics Program (WAM) at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) is an annual two Program for Women and Mathematics -week program with the mission to recruit and retain more women in mathematics.  WAM aims to counter the initial imbalance in the numbers of men and women entering mathematics training as well as the higher attrition rate of female mathematicians compared to their male counterparts at every critical transition stage in mathematical careers.  WAM encourages female mathematicians to form collaborative research relationships and to become active in a vertical mentoring network spanning a continuum from undergraduates to emerita professors, which provides support and reduces the sense of isolation experienced by many women in mathematics.  While there are a number of women's programs targeted solely at undergraduates, or graduate students, or postdocs, very few programs provide the depth and breadth that come from simultaneously including features tailored for undergraduate students, graduate students, and researchers from a broad spectrum of US institutions, all in one united community of scholars, as WAM does.   Since 1994,  the Women and Mathematics program has hosted 1099 individuals, including undergraduate,  graduate, and postdoctoral participants, as well as lecturers, colloquia speakers, panelists, and organizers.   Many alumnae have returned to the program in different roles.  A WAM alumnae database is established to track alumnae career progress and offer network support to women mathematicians.     Of the 342 undergraduate participants, 179 (52%)  have remained in academia, 89 (26%) have received PhD so far. Of the 466 graduate participants, 347 (75%) have remained in academia, 302 (65%) have received PhD so far.     Of the 177 postdoc participants, 149 (84%) have remained in academia.  For comparison, the 10-year completion rate for a mathematics PhD is 51% for both genders.    Some WAM alum distinctions include (data on male winners is included to highlight the need to broaden participation):  12 out of 32 Alice Schafer Prize Winners. 6 out of 13 Elizabeth Lowell Putnam Award Winners. 53 out of 299 female NSF graduate fellows; 674 male fellows. 14 out of 45 female National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate fellows; 128 male fellows. 26 out of 99 female NSF postdoctoral fellows; 429 male fellows. 20 out of 67 female Sloan fellows; 372 male fellows. 27 out of 114 female ICM invited speakers since 1990; 1193 male speakers. 6 out of 11 female ICM plenary speakers; 122 male speakers. 9 out of 16 female American Academy of Arts and Sciences members; 204 male members. 5 out of 7 female National Academy of Science members; 130 male members.
