<AbstractNarration>Information systems that handle personal information must adhere to&lt;br/&gt;legal regulations, corporate privacy policies, and contractual&lt;br/&gt;agreements designed to protect personal privacy.  Relying exclusively&lt;br/&gt;on application designers and developers for such assurances is&lt;br/&gt;unrealistic.  There is a need for methods and tools that can identify&lt;br/&gt;errors in the handing of personal data and provide formal assurances&lt;br/&gt;that personal information is handled appropriately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a software development framework that uses&lt;br/&gt;novel language-based techniques to ensure that software enforces&lt;br/&gt;privacy policies.  Privacy policies (based on legal and regulatory&lt;br/&gt;requirements) are formally specified in temporal logic, and identify&lt;br/&gt;circumstances under which information can be shared (based on criteria&lt;br/&gt;such as the roles of individuals involved, prior events, and whether&lt;br/&gt;the data has been aggregated) and future obligations that are incurred&lt;br/&gt;as a result of the information sharing.  The framework consists of&lt;br/&gt;policy analysis tools, a programming language, program analysis tools&lt;br/&gt;that verify both privacy and declassification policies are enforced,&lt;br/&gt;and a runtime environment.  Used in concert, these components produce&lt;br/&gt;distributed information systems that verifiably handle personal&lt;br/&gt;information appropriately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The framework being developed by this project will address problems&lt;br/&gt;faced by many information systems.  However, the project will focus&lt;br/&gt;especially on the needs of the medical industry, both with respect to&lt;br/&gt;patient records and clinical trials.  As medical practice transitions&lt;br/&gt;to electronic medical records, the need for high-assurance systems&lt;br/&gt;becomes increasingly acute.  This project will develop the&lt;br/&gt;capabilities needed to verify that electronic medical records&lt;br/&gt;systems comply with applicable privacy policies.</AbstractNarration>
