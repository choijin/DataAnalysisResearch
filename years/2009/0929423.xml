<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit.  RNA editing modifies specific cytidines in angiosperm chloroplast transcripts to uridine. C-to-U editing is thought to function to correct detrimental T-to-C mutations in the chloroplast genome.  Evolutionary processes have shaped the occurrence and molecular mechanism of RNA editing in chloroplasts since the phenomenon arose in an ancestor to extant seed plants.  Genomic information available from Arabidopsis thaliana will provide a foundation for a phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast targets of editing and the members of the large nuclear-encoded pentatricopeptide motif-containing protein family that are required for editing site conversion.  Additional editing factors will be identified in A. thaliana to gain a more comprehensive picture of the nuclear-encoded machinery devoted to chloroplast RNA editing.  C-to-U editing events in members of the Brassicaceae will be identified for comparison to those occurring in A. thaliana.  The loss and acquisition of C targets as well as nucleotide changes in the sequences surrounding them will be traced within the Brassicaceae.  Sequences of three editing trans-factors will be analyzed in detail to understand how the rapidly evolving nuclear genes coevolve with the more slowly evolving chloroplast genes.  Knowledge of nucleotide diversity in both the RNA editing targets and the corresponding trans-acting proteins will be used for functional tests of the consequences of evolutionary change in nuclear proteins and editing of chloroplast RNAs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Efficient capture of solar energy by chloroplasts is essential for optimal plant growth to provide biomass and other agricultural products.  The project will provide fundamental information about an important molecular mechanism that corrects defects in the chloroplast genome that would otherwise impair photosynthetic activity. The project will provide multidisciplinary training for postdoctoral associates and a graduate student and 10-12 undergraduates at both Cornell University and University of California-Irvine (UCI).  Topics related to project content will be developed by the co-P.I. and NSF GK-12 graduate student participants at UCI.  Materials will be developed that K-12 classroom teachers will be able to implement in grade 7, 9 or AP biology classrooms and will be available through the UCI GK-12 web site  (http://port.bio.uci.edu/NSF-GK-12/default.htm).  The P.I. will assist the Cornell Institute for Biology Teachers in incorporating these materials into the comparable workshops that are periodically held at Cornell for K-12 teacher training.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ RNA editing in plants is a remarkable type of RNA processing in which RNAs are altered post-transcriptionally, resulting in changes in the amino acids encoded from ones predicted from DNA sequences.  RNA editing also sometimes creates start and stop codons, thus resulting in translation of a protein or changing the length of a protein.  In plants, RNA editing occurs in chloroplasts and mitochondria, organelles which contain their own genomes.  RNA editing results in changing of specific Cs (cytidines) to Us (uridines) in plant organelles. RNA editing often restores the conserved codon in plant organelle transcripts from a non-conserved codon in an organelle gene that has acquired a T to C mutation.     Indiscriminate changes of Cs to Us in organelle genomes would be detrimental to production of functional proteins.  Plants have evolved a family of nuclear-encoded proteins termed PPR (pentatricopeptide repeat) proteins that bind to cis-elements on the RNA upstream of the C target of editing.  We investigated these cis-elements by examining their sequences in basal angiosperms, gymnosperms, eudicots, and monocots.  Comparison of sequences in the model plant Arabidopsis and its relatives in the family Brassicaceae were particularly useful.  We discovered that chloroplast genome evolution is constrained by the requirement to maintain cis-elements for recognition by PPR proteins.  In turn, changes in the chloroplast genome affects evolution of the nuclear PPR genes that encode PPR proteins that bind to RNA editing recognition cis-elements.  If a C to U editing event becomes unnecessary because a C to T mutation results in genomic encoding of the U, then a PPR gene sometimes accumulate mutations or rearrangements that render it non-functional.  However, we have also observed that PPR gene structure is sometimes maintained even though a particular C no longer needs to be edited to U.  Such PPR genes are likely to carry out functions other than RNA editing.     Not all of the PPR proteins required for editing of particular Cs in chloroplasts and mitochondria have yet been identified.  We developed a method for mapping editing factors and discovered the genes encoding several chloroplast and mitochondrial PPR proteins required for editing of one or more Cs.  We determined which C targets exhibited impaired editing when these PPR genes were mutated and also examined how lack of editing affected the function of the organelle and/or growth of the plants carrying the mutations.     The conversion of C to U in plant RNA editing is thought to occur by deamination of cytidine within the transcript.  Some PPR proteins required for RNA editing of particular sites carry a C-terminal domain exhibiting motifs characteristic of deaminase enzymes.  We discovered that editing activity was lost when we produced PPR genes with mutations in these conserved deaminase motifs.  Thus, it is likely that the C-terminal domain of some PPR proteins provides the enzymatic activity for RNA editing.      RNA editing is carried out by a small protein complex termed the editosome, whose composition has not yet been fully characterized.  In addition to the family of PPR proteins that provide specific RNA site recognition and enzymatic activity, other proteins are required to produce the editing machinery.  We have identified three additional protein families that are essential for editing of specific Cs in chloroplasts and/or mitochondria.  We have discovered that the picture of RNA editing in organelles is more complex than previously thought, as not only are different PPR proteins required for editing of different Cs in the same organelle, editosomes vary in composition of other editing factor families between different C targets.      We have gained major insights into the means by which plants process organelle transcripts to produce functional proteins, with potential future applications in biotechnology and agriculture.
