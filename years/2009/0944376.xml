<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to methodologies and systems that extract deep tissue physiological images utilizing novel optical illumination and capture technology.  The problem addressed is the challenge of effective and timely analysis of deep tissue physiological processes and their corresponding impact upon human health, wound formation and healing.  The opportunity is to provide an affordable and accessible means of identifying critical tissue characteristics in a quantitative fashion thus leading to better clinical guidance and more informed care decisions. The research will identify a set of digital illumination conditions, define model-based transfer functions, and then combine these to construct depth resolved physiological image maps.  Illumination patterns will be modeled and evaluated representing a variety of combinations of pattern density, symmetry, geometry and coverage cycles.  The resulting image maps and use cases will be compared with established clinical metrics for validation.  The project shall lead to a definitive means for extracting depth resolved physiological images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to establish affordable and accessible point of use diagnostic tools utilizing a novel non-contact, optical illumination and imaging modality to gain insights into otherwise non-accessible physiological processes.  The innovation will enhance the scientific and technological understanding of the inter-relationships between underlying physiology, hemodynamics, diffuse tissue optics, signal processing, clinical understanding and care. Products to be enabled by variable tissue depth physiological imaging include tools for the effective diagnosis and treatment of the millions of Americans that are impacted annually by debilitating skin conditions caused by cancers, burns, pressure sores or skin transfers.  At the same time care providers will realize reduced labor costs and liabilities through more effective identification of wounds.  The project's technology advances in real-time, non-invasive optical imaging systems will provide particular benefits to elderly and economically disadvantaged patients who would otherwise suffer from reduced access to adequate diagnosis. Resulting products shall provide greater accessibility to all segments of society to better clinical information that can be used to prevent debilitating wounds and enable more effective wound healing.</AbstractNarration>
