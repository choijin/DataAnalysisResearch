<AbstractNarration>The centerpiece of this project is the design, development, and evaluation of computational representations and algorithms for making software agents that are organizationally adept. An organizationally-adept agent is not only aware of its role(s) in an organization, but can also monitor how well it is fulfilling its organizational responsibilities and can proactively adapt its behaviors to meet organizational needs better. Organizationally adept agents evaluate their behaviors based not on their (agent-centric) self-interests but rather on their (organization-centric) responsibilities to each other, and autonomously adapt to achieve organizational objectives emergently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elaboration and adaptation by organizationally adept agents means that the ultimate organization design is formed by a combination of top-down design (to produce a "ballpark" organization) and emergent refinement processes. Further, this combination can be iterative and ongoing, where organizationally adept agents can detect tension between top-down and emergent influences, and inform the design processes of runtime interaction patterns and environmental tendencies that suggest useful top-down organization restructurings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual problems being pursued are central to practical issues in scaling multi-agent systems to help solve complex, long-term, global problems. Many critical challenges facing society including climate change, health care, and sustainable energy|require a prolonged commitment to monitoring and managing distributed activities. Networked computer systems populated by software agents, which can be constantly measuring, comparing, and interpreting information to understand and respond to wide-scale phenomena, promise to address such challenges, but need the kinds of innovations proposed in this project. Second, while the project is specifically looking at organizations for computational agents, our results will inform, and be informed by, research on human organizations. To stimulate sharing insights and results, the investigators will organize a multi-disciplinary symposium on organization-centric reasoning, and will train an inter-disciplinary cohort of graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Human organizations have inspired a variety of approaches for coordinating networked computational agents that need to work together as a cohesive group to achieve their usersÃ† goals.  Computational approaches to organization have largely taken a problem-driven view, where an organizational designer starts with a complex problem to solve, and decomposes the problem into a set of roles (e.g., marketing, manufacturing) and defines relationships among those.  Numerous specification languages have thus been developed for expressing concepts from human organizations into a computational form.     In contrast, this project has explored an agent-driven view of organization.  Because computational agents are quite different from people, organizational constructs that matter to people, such as incentives and titles, might be mismatched with the needs of computational agents.  An agent-driven approach begins by considering the decision processes of the agents that will populate the organization, and identifies the levers an organization can have for influencing those decisions.  Further, the approach assumes that the purpose of the organization is to streamline cooperation among the agents that without guidance could interfere with each other or spend considerable effort on coordination rather than on getting useful work done.     One important outcome of this project has been the creation of foundational principles for defining agent-driven organizations.  The project has demonstrated, empirically and analytically, the effectiveness of using the decision machinery of the agents being organized, rather than the constructs of an organization modeling language, to constrain the dimensions of design for an organization.  As an example, the project investigated organizing decision-theoretic agents, and showed that the systematic ways in which such agents could be influenced can provide rigorous definitions of concepts that were previously understood only informally in the literature.  Not only do such results advance the immediate research community by guiding attention to only the space of organizational designs worth exploring, but they also can inform broader disciplines such as the social and management sciences about the ties between organizational specifications and the decision processes of an organization's inhabitants.     Another important outcome of the project has been the implementation of an automated organizational design process.  Past work in the field has developed languages that people could use to define organizational designs for computational agents, but using such languages can be tedious and error-prone, as computational agents might need more and different details than people think of when designing organizations for other people.  The automated process this project has developed works instead with a specification of the multiagent problem (in a decision-theoretic form), and extracts useful patterns of interaction from running internal simulations over a number of problem episodes.  A fundamental insight gained from this work in deciding whether to include a pattern in the designed organization is that organizational influences affect not just the decisions agents make but also their reasoning processes in making those decisions.  The project has developed a formula for weighing these factors against each other, in contrast to prior work on organizational design that had not factored the impact on agent reasoning into design decisions. A broader contribution of this work has thus been to raise awareness between the organizational design, the decision-theoretic architecture, and the metareasoning (reasoning about reasoning) communities concerning the cross-cutting nature of organizational design.     Abstraction plays a key role in both the articulation of an organizational structure and in the search process for designing such a structure.  Increasing abstraction over organizational influences allows fewer, broadly...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
