<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Elizabeth J. Reitz, Carol Colaninno will examine fish remains from the earliest known archaeological sites on the Georgia coast (U.S.A.), for evidence of overfishing and environmental variations. The remains were excavated from four Late Archaic shell rings, occupied by early Native Americans between 3000-1000 B.C: the Marsh and West Rings sites on St. Simons Island, and the St. Catherines and McQueen Rings on St. Catherines Island. Late Archaic shell rings consist of densely packed shell and animal bones encircling relatively shell-free interiors. Archaeological investigations at these and other sites document the complexity of the social and political systems among these fisher-hunter-gatherers. Previous works also demonstrate that fish comprised a large portion of the inhabitants' diet. It is unclear, however, if human populations impacted fish populations or rather if early environmental fluctuations, unrelated to human activity, altered them. This project will clarify this question by pursuing three research objectives; 1) documenting Late Archaic fishing practices off the Georgia coast, 2) examining fish remains for evidence of overexploitation by people, and 3) analyzing fish remains to estimate environmental conditions and fluctuations during this time period. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standard zooarchaeological methods will be used to identify unknown archaeological fish remains to determine the fish and fishing practices used by these Archaic people. To assess whether fish populations represented in these shell rings experienced overfishing, incremental growth bands of fish ear bones (otoliths), which are similar to tree rings, will be examined for changes in growth rates. Ecological theory predicts that fish in overfished populations achieve larger sizes at younger ages. Natural environmental fluctuations, in addition to human fishing pressures, can influence fish growth rates. Before it is possible to determine if overfishing occurred, environmental fluctuations must be eliminated as potential factors affecting fish growth. Geochemical analysis (stable oxygen isotopic profiles) of fish ear bones will be used to establish Mid-Holocene temperatures. The resulting temperatures and growth rates will clarify the relationship between human use and other environmental impacts on fish populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent assessments of fisheries suggest twentieth-century changes in fish populations and growth patterns. It is urgent to establish preindustrial comparisons to which the effect of modern fisheries can be compared and to establish historical changes associated with fishing activities. The use of environmental data in conjunction with fish growth rates is an important step towards determining the causes that influence the health of fisheries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will assist in graduate student training in addition to instructing undergraduates in archaeological and museum procedures associated with this project. The results will be presented to a broader audience through the Education and Outreach Program of the Georgia Museum of Natural History.</AbstractNarration>
