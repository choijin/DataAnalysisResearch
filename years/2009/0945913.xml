<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a phage technology to remediate and control the foam-causing microorganisms at wastewater treatment plants.  The research will include isolation of problematic foaming Nocardia species, isolation of phage capable of killing foaming Nocardia, and evaluation of phage clearing of Nocardia in batch culture test systems. This is an important issue in wastewater treatment and the concept of using phage for foam control in waste water systems is innovative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be the potential applications of the proposed technology.  Activated sludge wastewater treatment processes are common.  Problematic foaming caused by excessive microbial growth occurs if the operation conditions are not optimized.  The project will allow development of an innovative solution and if successful, should have significant commercial value.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Phage Control of Filamentous Bacteria &ndash; A novel focused antimicrobial approach to counter microbial problems in municipal wastewater systems   National Science Foundation Award Number: IIP-0945913           The aim of this work was to assess the commercial promise of using phage preparations to counter disruptive bulking and foaming in wastewater treatment plants caused by filamentous bacteria. Bulking and foaming are common problems and result in elevated costs and operational inefficiencies.   Bacterial filaments cause foaming by entrapping air bubbles, and cause bulking by connecting floc particles which interrupts settling. Phage are the natural and highly specific predators of bacteria and are currently being used in medicine and on foodstuffs in order to control bacterial populations. Phage are natural life forms that are generally regarded as safe to humans and the environment because they do not interact with human, animal or plant cells, only their matching host target bacteria. As a result, phage preparations have the potential to be the ideal industry bactericide.  We successfully completed the Phase I objectives of isolating the common filamentous foaming bacteria Gordonia and finding Gordonia phages from foam samples obtained at a municipal wastewater treatment plant. We demonstrated that applying phage reduced the levels of filamentous bacterial and associated foaming in laboratory scale experiments.  Further we successfully completed Phase IB objectives in which larger scale (3-4 gallon) phage efficacy tests were conducted.  Additionally, it was demonstrated that phage application resulted in a decrease in filamentous bacterial levels in samples from a functional municipal wastewater treatment plant aeration basin.  This finding is particularly important as phage preparations have to be able to show a positive effect in a mixed microbial sample.  Finally, we determined that it is feasible to scale up phage production and purification.  Like in nature, we found that phage treatment did not result in a complete eradication of their target bacteria.  Instead, bacterial numbers were reduced down to a level where they will most likely not cause problems in industrial processes. This is particularly important for wastewater treatment facilities.  While filamentous bacteria cause problems at very high numbers, low levels of filamentous bacteria are required for the normal operation of the plant.  Furthermore, wastewater treatment is a process that requires a large number of varied types of microorganisms.  Unlike chemical or antibiotic treatments, phage are very specific for only the target bacteria and do not have any impact on other types of bacteria.   Phage were found to inhibit bacterial growth for as long as experiments were continued, even though only a single application was applied. A phage based foaming control can be easily incorporated into current waste treatment protocols, is non-toxic, affects only the target microorganism whilst leaving non-target species intact and importantly, is environmentally benign and economical.  This phage based antimicrobial approach is commercially feasible and can be broadly applied in any industrial setting, including those where biocide chemical or antibiotic usage is ineffectual or limited by environmental concerns. Mixtures of phage or "cocktails" may be used instead of environmentally harmful chemicals, and valued antibiotics to avoid developing resistant bacterial populations. Furthermore, unlike chemical and antibiotic treatments that indiscriminately kill all microorganisms, the extreme host specificity of phage can be exploited under conditions were it is required to combat only a few select bacterial types in a sample.  Phage biocontrol holds immense promise as a "green" solution to counter bacterial fouling in all industries.       Last Modified: 04/19/2011       Submitted by: Neil Summer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
