    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposed research is to gain fundamental understanding of how gaseous surface passivation molecules interact with nanowire arrays in an atomic layer deposition system. Specifically, the goal will be accomplished by: (1) understanding how the passivation molecules diffuse among ZnO nanowires with different densities; (2) determining the passivation ability of the chosen passivation precursor with respect to the sticking coefficient of the precursors; (3) correlating the surface selective accuracy to the reactivity of the precursors. In addition, integrated vertical NW FETs will be fabricated characterized to optimize the deposition condition for the best dielectric layer quality and device performance. The final outcome of this project is expected to realize a ?smart? thin film deposition technique that can ?self-choosing? deposition area. &lt;br/&gt;This research would lead to a general, simple and low-cost fabrication technique for large-scale integrating semiconductor nanowires into three dimensional nanoelectronic systems. Understandings established in this research would pave the path to a novel technique for selectively functionalizing nanowire surfaces in large scale by vapor deposition methods. The research discovery will be integrated in the PI?s graduate course about Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology. This research will provide an excellent opportunity for training graduate and undergraduate students with fabrication and characterization technologies in the frontier of nanoscience. The advanced atomic layer deposition facility and techniques established in this research will be shared with PI?s colleagues to enhance the infrastructure for advanced materials and nanotechnology research and education. A partnership will be established between the PI?s group and K-12 school teachers and students through this research program.</AbstractNarration>
