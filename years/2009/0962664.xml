<AbstractNarration>The team will study commonly-observed signatures of solar eruptions known as "coronal dimmings," in order to increase our understanding of the origins and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Coronal dimming observations provide timing and location information for CMEs, and can help provide insight concerning the energy budgets and evolving magnetic connectivity in CMEs. Dimming motions offer a dynamic view of CME magnetic footpoint evolution, and can aid in the determination of the length of time that strong magnetic connections between a CME and the solar surface can persist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the team will determine how dimming detectability relates to CME energetics and magnetic field morphology. They will also characterize the openness of CME magnetic fields by comparing remote dimming measurements with in situ observations of suprathermal bidirectional electrons (BDEs), and test whether a subset of CMEs actually evolve rooted externally to their source region, as is currently predicted. The Principal Investigator (PI) expects that this research will ultimately improve our ability to predict the heliospheric structure and impacts of CMEs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team includes several female researchers who will be role models for students, and in particular, for young women interested in the physical sciences and engineering. The participants will present their results from this investigation at community workshops and meetings. Since the PI has access to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in Boulder, Colorado, this research will have a direct impact on operational space weather forecasting. She will work with NOAA forecasters at SWPC to implement advancements in CME predictions as they become available during the project. A postdoctoral researcher based at SWPC will collaborate with the proposing team and with scientists from NCAR's High Altitude Observatory (NCAR/HAO).</AbstractNarration>

This algorithm allowed us to generate a subjective, precise database of the dimming properties. Using this database we investigated the statistical properties of dimmings to learn more about the general characteristics of on-disk dimmings.  We also linked the catalogued dimmings to flares (from the NOAA/NGDC GOES X-ray catalogue) and CMEs (from the CDAW cataloge). Our goal was to determine if there was a direct correlation between the dimming properties (e.g. area, intensity, magnetic field strength, lifetime, ascend and descend duration of the area growth), the flare properties (duration, X-ray flux), and the CME properties (velocity, accelerationmass,angular width, kinetic energy). Ultimately we wanted to investigate if the dimming properties can be used in any way to predict the magnitude of corresponding flares and CMEs.   We list our major findings below:  -The mean magnetic field strength in dimmings if typically below 10 Gauss.  -The lifetime of dimmings is typically less than a day.  -The ascend time of dimmings is typically less than 5 hrs.  -The descend time of dimmings is typically less than 20 hrs.  -The area of dimmings is typically less than 5*10^3 Mm^2.  -We found that dimmings that have a longer ascend time (the time it takes the dimming area to reach its maximum from the time of appearance) are more likely to have a longer descend time (the time it takes the dimming area to disappear from the time of the maximum area).  -Darker dimmings appear to be longer lived.  -The darkest parts of the dimmings appear to coincide with the magnetic filed concentrations (strong magnetic fields).  -It appears that dimmings with stronger mean magnetic fields have higher CME velocities.  -Dimmings with stronger mean magnetic fields are associated with CMEs with larger angular width...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
