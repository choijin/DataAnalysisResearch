<AbstractNarration>DMS-0600919&lt;br/&gt;Brian Conrad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to work on some geometric questions that arise in &lt;br/&gt;number-theoretic questions over global function fields and p-adic fields.  In the theory of overconvergent classical modular forms,  the canonical subgroup of Lubin and Katz (for a p-adic analytic family of elliptic curves) has been an important tool. The recent interest in p-adic modular forms beyond the classical case has motivated several different constructions of canonical subgroups for abelian varieties,&lt;br/&gt;and recent work of the PI has led to another higher-dimensional theory &lt;br/&gt;that, at least in its geometric aspects, has a wider range of applicability than the other approaches. The PI proposes to use deformation-theoretic methods to make explicit certain abstract estimates in the theory, and to draw &lt;br/&gt;arithmetic consequences for p-adic families of automorphic forms.&lt;br/&gt;In another direction,  the PI and co-workers have used methods from &lt;br/&gt;deformation theory and rigid-analytic geometry to develop a theory of a &lt;br/&gt;new global parity obstruction to randomness properties of prime &lt;br/&gt;specialization of inseparable irreducible polynomials over&lt;br/&gt;certain coordinate rings of curves over finite fields.  This has given &lt;br/&gt;rise to families of elliptic curves with unexpected rank behavior&lt;br/&gt;over global function fields (under some standard conjectures) and seems &lt;br/&gt;likely to have further Diophantine applications&lt;br/&gt;to Mordell--Weil ranks for families of abelian varieties over global &lt;br/&gt;function fields. The PI proposes to develop a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of this basic arithmetic phenomenon and to work out some &lt;br/&gt;further consequences for ranks in families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is among the oldest subjects in mathematics, since it is &lt;br/&gt;ultimately concerned with the relatively concrete&lt;br/&gt;problem of studying properties of whole numbers.  Such problems can &lt;br/&gt;take on the form of finding whole number solutions&lt;br/&gt;to systems of equations in many variables, or problems relating to &lt;br/&gt;properties of primes, and so on. Typically one has to bring in some deeper structural information (provided by geometric, algebraic, or analytic ideas) to make progress on such questions, and in the last several decades a very wide range of sophisticated geometric techniques have been developed to attack these problems.  Moreover, though the initial motivation comes from within pure mathematics, security of&lt;br/&gt;electronic telecommunications has come to be related in an essential way to many of these number-theoretic problems (such as&lt;br/&gt;prime factorization and studying points on curves over finite fields) &lt;br/&gt;and the geometric concepts used to attack them.  This proposal focuses&lt;br/&gt;on both geometric and prime factorization questions that arise in &lt;br/&gt;several number-theoretic settings, aiming to develop some&lt;br/&gt;new theoretical methods and to apply them to specific problems.  In &lt;br/&gt;addition, the PI proposes to continue his long-standing tradition of supervising high-level number theory research by talented high school students and giving talks to larger groups of students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.  He will also complete two books that, together with assorted freely available notes already posted on his web site, will provide useful references for graduate students who wish to learn about some fundamental topics in arithmetic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My scientific work focused on questions at the interface of number theory (the study of whole number solutions to systems of equations in several unknowns) and algebraic geometry (the study of geometric structures arising out of algebraic constructions, extending the ideas of coordinate geometry with graphs of functions as taught in high school).  More specifically, in recent years there have been a variety of geometric notions that have shown themselves to be useful in the investigations of number-theoretic problems, and with collaborators I proved the existence of these geometric structures on a wider scale.  I also classified the "symmetries" that govern certain number-theoretic problems, in a manner that goes beyond what had previously been known (due to work of Armand Borel and his collaborators).  This led to some new finiteness theorems, such as saying that the ways in which "local" obstructions may fail to account for all obstructions to solving a given system of equations is essentially finite in nature.    I wrote two books (and some journal articles) which summarized the results obtained, and also included surveys of background concepts that are widely used but not always written up in an accessible way in the modern literature.   In addition to mentoring PhD student, I gave many lectures to high school students and undergraduates, and arranged public lectures by distinguished mathematicians to disseminate to a wider public audience the ways in which mathematics is a creative and lively subject, as well as useful in ways that deserve to be better-known.  Experience shows that the ways in which mathematical ideas turn out to have practical value often escapes the notice of those who invented the ideas in the first place (and may well not be found until long after the ideas are initially created and developed for theoretical purposes).
