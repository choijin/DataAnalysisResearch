<AbstractNarration>The design of computational systems that support group decisions, allocate resources to distributed tasks, or mediate social interactions is fundamentally different from the corresponding design problem serving individual or centralized users.  When multiple parties, or agents, are involved, the designer's objectives are complicated by the fact that the interests of these parties are rarely, if ever, perfectly aligned. The field of mechanism design offers a theoretical framework that directly addresses the issue of incentives as it relates to the design of multiagent systems.  However, this purely analytical approach carries with it inherent practical limitations. The investigators introduce a new approach, empirical mechanism design (EMD), whose premise is to extend the basic foundation of mechanism design with empirical methods such as simulation and statistical analysis. These extensions promise to dramatically expand the scope of mechanism design beyond the small-scale, stylized, or idealized domains to which it has been predominantly limited to date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate several concrete EMD problems, within the general theme of market design. Improved market design has significant implications for the public and private sectors.  In public policy, market-based approaches are likely to play a major role in, for example, instituting measures to cope with climate change, banking reform and regulation, and adoption of new energy sources.  In the commercial domain, new markets for advertising placement, computational services, and other goods will also entail significant mechanism design efforts.  Regardless of the sector, design outcomes bear on important social objectives including efficiency, transparency, and stability (e.g., of financial relationships). An empirical basis for evaluating candidate mechanisms will complement existing theoretical perspectives, enriching the tools available to designers and other stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The problem of mechanism design is to set up the rules for multiple interacting decision makers so that they produce desirable outcomes while acting in their self interest.  The empirical approach to mechanism design investigated in this project employs simulation to construct models of candidate mechanisms.  This collaborative project produced a variety of technical and methodological advances in empirical mechanism design, through investigation of several applications.  This report highlights two of them.   The first application area is sponsored search advertising, which has developed over the last decade or so into a major industry.  Advertising funds most content of the Internet, and ads in search engines are a major component.  To study strategic issues in sponsored search advertising, we developed a research competition based on an search advertising bidding scenario.  The Trading Agent Competition (TAC) Ad Auctions (AA) game incorporated many novel features compared to previous models of sponsored search bidding.  International TAC/AA tournaments were held annually from 2009-2013, yielding numerous advances and facilitating cross-fertilization of bidding strategy ideas across researchers.  The TAC/AA software is freely available, and has been employed in class projects at several universities.   The second highlighted outcome is a major advance in strategies for bidding in simultaneous auctions.  Dealing with simultaneous markets is a central problem in automated trading (e.g., in finance or e-commerce), which comes up whenever the buyer or seller's value for a good depends on other goods traded.  Despite the simplicity and generic form of the simultaneous-auction mechanism, auction theory to date has made little progress on it.  Research on this project led to a general description of optimal strategies, as well as concrete algorithms for approximating these in complex settings, validated through an extensive simulation-based study.
