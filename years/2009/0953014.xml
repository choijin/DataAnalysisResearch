<AbstractNarration>Computer systems security is an arms race between defenders and&lt;br/&gt;attackers that has mainly been confined to software&lt;br/&gt;technologies. Increases in the complexity of hardware and the rising&lt;br/&gt;number of transistors per chip have created opportunities for&lt;br/&gt;hardware-based security threats. Among the most pernicious are&lt;br/&gt;malicious hardware footholds inserted at design time, which an&lt;br/&gt;attacker can use as the basis of a computer system attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores of the feasibility of foothold attacks and a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental design-time methodology for defending against them.&lt;br/&gt;First, this project looks at techniques for highlighting potentially&lt;br/&gt;malicious circuits in a design automatically.  The basic algorithm,&lt;br/&gt;called dead circuit identification (DCI), analyzes hardware&lt;br/&gt;description language source code and dynamic execution traces of&lt;br/&gt;design verification tests to identify suspicious circuitry whose&lt;br/&gt;results do not impact the computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second aspect of this project is a system for removing suspicious&lt;br/&gt;circuits from a design automatically.  The dead circuit elimination&lt;br/&gt;(DCE) tool removes suspicious circuits from a design by pushing&lt;br/&gt;potentially malicious logic up to a higher layer where it can be&lt;br/&gt;analyzed in more detail at runtime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third aspect of this project is a new technique for generating&lt;br/&gt;test cases and perturbing existing test cases to search specifically&lt;br/&gt;for potentially malicious circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a pathway to detection and defense against&lt;br/&gt;security risks from hardware comprising attacks, making the enormous&lt;br/&gt;disruptions possible with such attacks far more difficult than today.</AbstractNarration>
