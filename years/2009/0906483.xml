<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0906483&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Jean-Francois R. Lafont&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to work on a series of&lt;br/&gt;projects that incorporate techniques from geometry and topology,&lt;br/&gt;with a view to applications to both of these fields. A major&lt;br/&gt;component of this proposal focuses on making use of geometric&lt;br/&gt;arguments to shed light on the algebraic K-theory of (integral&lt;br/&gt;group rings of ) various classes of groups. The PI's previous&lt;br/&gt;work with Ortiz provided a complete algorithm to determind the&lt;br/&gt;lower algebraic K-theory for lattices in the isometry group of&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic 3-space. The PI intends to further develop techniques&lt;br/&gt;for computing the lower algebraic K-theory of various other&lt;br/&gt;geometrically significant classes of groups. The importance of&lt;br/&gt;such explicit computations is twofold. First of all, it provides&lt;br/&gt;a testing ground for conjectures, and a possible source of new&lt;br/&gt;conjectures. Secondly, because of the close relationship between&lt;br/&gt;algebraic K-theory and high-dimensional topology, we expect our&lt;br/&gt;computations to shed light on the topology of high-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. The PI is also interested in better understanding how&lt;br/&gt;various metric properties constrain the topology of the&lt;br/&gt;underlying space. There is a lot of freedom here, depending on&lt;br/&gt;what one means by a metric property, and what aspect of the&lt;br/&gt;topology we choose to study. For instance, one can consider how&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian curvature influences the bounded cohomology of a&lt;br/&gt;space. Or one can try to study how metric properties (e.g. the&lt;br/&gt;G-space axioms) can influence the local topology of a&lt;br/&gt;space. Alternatively, one can try to study, within a fixed class&lt;br/&gt;of topological spaces (e.g. closed smooth manifolds), those&lt;br/&gt;supporting various types of metric properties (e.g. Riemannian&lt;br/&gt;metrics of non-positive curvature, as compared to locally CAT(0)&lt;br/&gt;metrics). The PI intends to work on questions related to this&lt;br/&gt;circle of ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometry is the study of properties of spaces equipped with some&lt;br/&gt;additional structure, usually of a metric nature (i.e. allowing&lt;br/&gt;one to measure distances in the space). In the field of topology,&lt;br/&gt;one forgets about the precise underlying distance, and only&lt;br/&gt;retain the notion of points in the space being "close&lt;br/&gt;together". As such, topology is often referred to as "rubber&lt;br/&gt;geometry": one can stretch and deform spaces without changing&lt;br/&gt;their underlying topology. In topology, manifolds are the spaces&lt;br/&gt;of most interest. These are spaces which, on the small scale,&lt;br/&gt;look like Euclidean space, but on the large scale, can be&lt;br/&gt;curved. A basic question lies in finding ways to detect when two&lt;br/&gt;manifolds are different from each other. This is usually done by&lt;br/&gt;associating certain invariants to manifolds: if the invariants&lt;br/&gt;are different, then the manifolds are different. One family of&lt;br/&gt;invariants which is particularly useful in high-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology are the algebraic K-theory invariants. In general, these&lt;br/&gt;invariants are quite hard to compute. The PI plans to develop&lt;br/&gt;methods for computing these invariants, in the special case where&lt;br/&gt;the manifold has some nice underlying geometry. More generally,&lt;br/&gt;the PI plans on studying how the presence of a geometric&lt;br/&gt;structure constrains various topological properties (and vice&lt;br/&gt;versa).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
