<AbstractNarration>Abstract: Using the STEM Dimensions of Bioenergy Sustainability&lt;br/&gt;                to Bring Leading-edge Graduate Research to K-12 Learning Settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual focus of this new GK-12 project at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) is on the ecological dimensions of bioenergy sustainability.  Graduate students in Michigan State University?s Ecology, Evolutionary Biology &amp; Behavior and Environmental Science &amp; Public Policy programs who are engaged in STEM research at KBS will partner with teachers in the KBS K-12 Partnership for Science Literacy, the new Department of Energy Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC), and the NSF Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project on the Ecology of Agricultural Landscapes.  Project activities include establishing schoolyard science research plots in K-12 Partner districts that mimic aspects of GLBRC research plots and serve as the foundation for a schoolyard research network.  Fellows will work collaboratively with each other, their advisors, and project partners to incorporate their own research into K-12 research and inquiry activities that address Michigan and national science education standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fellows will improve their ability to place their research in its broader societal and global contexts, to collaborate across disciplines, to integrate their research and teaching, and to communicate their research to professional, K-12 and public audiences. The opportunity to work collaboratively with fellows on authentic research related to pressing national needs will enhance the professional development of the K-12 partner teachers and enrich the education of K-12 students.  This project will also enhance ongoing efforts at KBS to recruit a greater number and diversity of young people into STEM science disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Support and enhance the training of a more diverse group of STEM graduate fellows, while increasing fellows&rsquo; confidence and competence to work collaboratively across disciplines, place their research in broader societal and global contexts and explain it effectively to professional peers, college and K-12 students, and non-technical audiences.&nbsp;</p> <p>2. Enrich the professional development of our K-12 teacher partners by providing them with a variety of real research experiences that help them understand what science is all about.</p> <p>3. Give K-12 students the opportunity to work with young practicing scientists who differ from conventional stereotypes, and who serve as attractive role models by communicating not only the excitement of engaging in research that addresses national needs.&nbsp;</p> <p>4. Improve the culture of graduate training at the university level.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We achieved these objectives by:</p> <p>1. Creating partnerships where 30 GK-12 Fellows, supported over 48 fellow-years, worked 10-12 hours per week with 31 K-12 science teachers in 39 schools in 30 districts in rural Southwest Michigan. Fellows co-taught and helped teachers introduce inquiry-based activities related to ecological literacy, the Fellow&rsquo;s research, and other science topics.</p> <p>2. Organizing and hosting annual Summer Institutes for Fellows, K-12 teachers, and MSU scientists that focused on providing inquiry-based approaches to learning for understanding and educational leadership.</p> <p>3. Organizing and hosting 2-4 school-year workshops per year, where Fellows, K-12 teachers and STEM education experts designed activities to support classroom efforts that incorporate inquiry-based learning.</p> <p>4. Establishing a network of &ldquo;BEST&rdquo; (BioEnergy SusTainability) schoolyard research plots (<a href="http://kbsgk12project.kbs.msu.edu/best-research-network/">http://kbsgk12project.kbs.msu.edu/best-research-network/</a> ), which included over 300 plots at 22 schools in 11 school districts that served as field experiments and learning laboratories for fellows, partner teachers and K-12 students.</p> <p>5. Holding weekly planning, analysis and professional development meetings for Fellows. These meetings not only functioned as a network of Fellows processing common experiences, learning from each other, and collaborating, but also included in-depth career development and science communication training.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Final Project Evaluation Report, prepared by Science and Mathematics Program Improvement (SAMPI), Mallinson Institute for Science Education, Western Michigan University (submitted to NSF in 2015) highlights the following outcomes:</p> <p>1. It is clear that the program enhanced the communication skills of the graduate student Fellows, particularly to non-technical audiences. Fellows also received valuable career-preparation and life skills through professional development and other opportunities provided through the project.</p> <p>2. The program provided important benefits to participating teachers including increased science knowledge, new classroom lessons based on their Fellow&rsquo;s knowledge and experiences, research exposure, mentoring, and collaboration with others in the KBS partnership. Their students showed increased curiosity about and excitement for science and science research and were exposed to possible science careers. Fellows served as role models to the students and countered many of their stereotypes.</p> <p>3. GK-12 Fellows were provided with a diversity of experiences that are not typically part of graduate training, including exposure to people outside the academic environment and activities aimed at increasing their communication skills to general audiences. The enhanced training increased Fellows&rsquo; self-confidence and their ability to work in teams.</p> <p>4. Common strengths identified from interviews with Fellows, partner teachers, Fellow&rsquo;s faculty advisors, and the leadership team included:</p> <p>a. K-12 teachers collaborated with practicing scientists</p> <p>b. Real science was brought into classrooms</p> <p>c. Students were exposed to female scientists</p> <p>d.
