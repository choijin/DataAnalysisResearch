<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a novel microfiltration system which uses cross-flow filtration, swirl flow patterns, oscillated and periodically interrupted flow, periodic back-flush, and particle recuperation to deal with the treatment of paint sludges generated from spray paint booths.  It is aimed primarily at the automotive industry, but could be equally successfully applied to any large spray painting operation such as train carriages, planes, etc.  The project will explore various membranes, and test module configurations and operational parameters in order to optimize the system.  The project will test synthetic paint mixtures as well as real paint sludges on the most promising configuration, and they will use CFD simulations and modeling to improve the design and to predict Phase II performance. The combination of original reactor configurations and particular choices of membrane has not previously been tested with paint sludges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will include a reduction in the release of paints and paint sludges into the environment, reduction in the energy needed to achieve this in comparison with existing technologies, and the possibility of recycling the paint itself.  There are 75 million pounds of paint sludges generated annually in the U.S. by the automotive industry alone.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[NSF SBIR PHASE I/IB Project Outcomes Report         Project:    Paint   Sludge Separation using Enhanced Cross-flow Filtration      Contractor:    Dynaflow,   Inc.      Principal Investigator:    Dr. Jin-Keun Choi      Contract Number:    IIP-0945508         In this research, we investigated the feasibility of a high efficiency paint sludge filtration system based on a combination of micro-filtration, flow manipulation, and oscillations that can separate paint solids from wastewater. In Phase I, we studied the feasibility and performance of separating paint booth operation overspray paint from captured water wash. We also demonstrated the feasibility of a paint particle separation and recovery from the paint removed from ship hulls using cavitating jets.  Tests with scrap paint particles, detackified paint particles, and paint particles collected from an industrial paint booth were conducted in a DynaPerm&reg; test unit. The test unit geometry and operation evolved during this period with improvements such as increased tangential injection slot width to prevent clogging, improved collection chamber at the bottom of the unit for better settlement of paint particles and more efficient collection. The number of tubes in the tube bundle was also increased to enhance the permeate flux rates. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were conducted with our 3DynaFS&copy;, to understand the particle laden flow in the DynaPerm&reg; filtration units. Porous boundaries were used to represent the filter tubes, and flow solutions and particle motions provided insights to improve chamber design and operating conditions. The following results were obtained:  Paint particle separation of up to 85% of the initial feed was achieved. Dewatering performance by reducing the wastewater liquid volume to 40% of its initial volume in 20 minutes (raising paint particle concentration by 2.4 times) was demonstrated. The energy consumption in the above filtration tests was very small.   Concerning separation and recovery of the paint removed from ship hulls using cavitating jets, we designed and tested a system capable of combined operation: paint removal and collection using a collection chamber, which was able to capture major portion of the removed paint particles.  The research indicated that the technology would enable economic recovery of paint particles from paint wastewater using low-energy, low maintenance equipment. This technology will reduce the emission of hazardous substances to the environment, while producing recyclable paint solids and reducing wastewater. The technology has commercial potential in many areas including wastewater treatments, pretreatment, pollution remediation, and in environmental processes requiring sludge separation.
