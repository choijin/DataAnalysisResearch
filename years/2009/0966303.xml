<AbstractNarration>This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented but financially-disadvantaged graduate students pursuing interdisciplinary research in the Departments of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Physics at Rice University.  The scholarships are supporting 26 students through the first two years of study, at which point students are transitioning to faculty research funding.  Recruiting efforts are targeting women and underrepresented minorities.  Students are recruited at conferences sponsored by the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science, the National Society of Black Engineers, the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, as well as at the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students.  Support structures include strong faculty mentoring for students in their first two years of graduate study, the use of senior graduate student ambassadors to mentor entering students, and seminar courses on communication and on interdisciplinary research for each cohort of eight to nine students.  The goals of the program include increasing the proportion of minorities and women enrolled in the four graduate departments, supporting students through their first two years of graduate study, and building students' confidence in their research abilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Interdisciplinary Research in Science and Engineering (IRISE) program at Rice University was built to provide resources, incentive, encouragement, and guidance for graduate students who desire to take the extra academic risks required for acquiring the breadth and depth of scientific knowledge necessary to engage in interdisciplinary research. The IRISE program was designed to support students, especially women and underrepresented minorities, earning Ph.D. degrees focused on interdisciplinary research at the interface of the four participating graduate programs:  Biochemistry and Cell Biology (BCB), Chemistry (CHEM), Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CHBE), and Physics and Astronomy (PHYA).   Exposure to interdisciplinary research was provided through seminars and courses while providing a combination of mentorship from distinguished faculty members and fellow graduate students.  Unique aspects about IRISE included: mentorship from established faculty leaders in the departments; assignment of a senior departmental graduate student ambassador; stipend support during the initial two years, which alleviated some of the inherent pressures against spending extra time to explore new disciplines; and a requirement to attend interdisciplinary seminars.  Interdisciplinary advising was provided for participants by engaging co-advisers from other STEM departments and students were encouraged to use an IRISE travel award to present their research at conferences.  According to student surveys, the exposure provided by mandatory interdisciplinary seminars was the most valuable program component.  Mentorship by peers and faculty contributed to student success by providing a sounding board and guidance as students navigated the graduate school processes.  In addition, the experience of serving as a mentor to the new class of first year IRISE students proved to be beneficial to the second year fellows.  Lastly, fundability was an important result of participation in the program; a high rate of fellows received research grants and fellowships in their second and third years of graduate school.  One of the IRISE goals was to increase the acceptance rates of minority students in the participating STEM departments from 6% to 9%.  We saw an increase to 8.1% minority enrollment in the four combined departments, falling short of this goal, although we did see improvement.  Additionally, we wanted to increase female graduate student enrollment in the participating departments. The increase was greatest in Chemistry and BCB, and there was an overall increase in the ratio of female matriculants (with respect to total matriculants) of about 10% across all the departments.  The administrators and faculty participants on the IRISE steering committee are committed to continuing this trend.   We have achieved the critical mass required in our current student body to attract and mentor additional students from these under-represented populations.  All surveyed IRISE participants exhibited an increased confidence in their ability to conduct interdisciplinary research and succeed in graduate school, and a better understanding of the importance of interdisciplinary research.  Additionally, the IRISE Program has promoted collaboration among the departments at Rice University through the interdisciplinary co-advisors who have interacted with our IRISE fellows.  Finally, we hired an external assessment professional to conduct the final year survey of the students and to write a white paper for the Rice University Office of Graduate Studies, important for the best practices established in the training program to be perpetuated by other departments as well.
