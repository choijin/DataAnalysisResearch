<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: The effect of intense lasers on atoms and molecules will be investigated using innovative computational methods. The emphasis will be on the way these lasers remove electrons from matter, and how these processes can be controlled by using parameters of the laser (such as intensity and polarization) as control knobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The use of intense lasers in the physical and biological sciences has opened up new frontiers for research and applications. The research described here will have an impact on all disciplines which rely on using current or projected laser sources. Students will be trained in the use of new computational procedures, which are applicable across disciplines also.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Can an ionized electron be driven back to the core by an ultrastrong laser pulse? This is a high-stakes issue in laser physics since the returning electron, by carrying back the energy it absorbed from the laser, can act as the agent of many key processes in intense laser physics, including the structural analysis of macromolecules and the design of new light sources through generation of ultrahigh harmonics.  When the laser is linearly polarized, the "recollision", "rescattering" or  "three-step" model, consisting of "ionization / travel in the laser field / return to the core" (all along the direction of polarization) has been immensely successful in both interpreting current experiments and devising new ones. The picture is much less clear when the laser polarization is not linear. For example, conventional wisdom decrees that returns must be suppressed in circularly polarized laser pulses because ionized electrons tend to spiral away from the core. In contrast, during this grant period  we found that electrons can return to the core in circularly polarized laser fields and that they do so along specific families of periodic orbits which conduct ionized electrons towards and away from the core.  Our findings open up to experimental scrutiny the hitherto neglected realm of other-than-linear polarizations (like elliptically polarized light) where the ellipticity can act as a control knob for the resulting physics.  Remarkably,  although this process takes place in the deep quantum regime, the mentioned result  was obtained using classical mechanics, and is yet another illustration of classical mechanics describing some important aspects of strong-field physics accurately ( the prime example being the recollision model mentioned above). In fact classical mechanics is the only way we could have researched ionization in this regime since fully quantal calculations are impossibly big  ( and will remain so for a long time).  During the grant period, we also uncovered various overlooked aspects of the recollison model. For example, our dynamical model shows that on average it takes three recollisions with the core to ionize another electron. Since each recollision requires half a laser cycle, we predict that very short pulses will not lead to as much double ionization as pulses of more than one laser cycle.  We also connected double ionization in laser fields to Transition State Theory, which is key in computing chemical reaction rates. In this resaerch we had to develop the mathematical framework for a more complicated saddle then the one encountered in chemical reactions, where saddles are generally ridges with one up direction and a transverse down direction.  We expect that our findings in recollisions will prompt physicists to look for recollisions and multiple ionization in polarization regimes where they were not suspected. Our findings on higher-rank saddles will help chemists to understand reactions that place by concerted changes in the molecules and which cannot be described by the simplest saddles.  The discovery that some cutting-edge strong-field physics problems can be addressed using classical mechanics makes these problems into the perfect physics education and training tool, since even advanced  undergraduates can  ( and did) participate in meaningful research. In addition, the use of advanced methods of classical mechanics were incorporated into the training of physics graduate students, whose curriculum usually does not include such a subject.
