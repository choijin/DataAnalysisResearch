<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to study discretizations of &lt;br/&gt;mechanical systems with constraints. This study is motivated by the &lt;br/&gt;facts that such discretizations may be used for numerical simulations &lt;br/&gt;of mechanical systems and that problems of studying periodic motions &lt;br/&gt;in mechanics and control are intrinsically discrete. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;research is aimed at two areas:&lt;br/&gt;(i) Structurally-stable and structure-preserving discretizations of &lt;br/&gt;systems with velocity constraints. The dynamics of systems with &lt;br/&gt;velocity constraints is remarkably diverse. The goal is the &lt;br/&gt;development of discrete dynamical systems that adequately represent &lt;br/&gt;the continuous-time constrained dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;(ii) The use of such discretizations in stabilization of periodic &lt;br/&gt;orbits of mechanical systems. It is anticipated that such control &lt;br/&gt;techniques will be especially useful in cases when the period is long &lt;br/&gt;and/or intrinsic structure of controlled systems should be preserved &lt;br/&gt;during numerical simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamics of systems with constraints is important in various &lt;br/&gt;industrial and scientific applications. Such constraints include &lt;br/&gt;rolling and sliding constraints, chained rigid links, and various &lt;br/&gt;constraints found in thermodynamics and electromechanical systems. &lt;br/&gt;There are numerous instances in industry, engineering and science &lt;br/&gt;where such constraints arise: robotics, the dynamics of wheeled &lt;br/&gt;vehicles, and the motion of satellites in space are examples. In &lt;br/&gt;applications, stabilization of periodic motions may be desirable--for &lt;br/&gt;example in achieving a desired robotic or autonomous vehicle motion. &lt;br/&gt;Our methods should be helpful in analyzing and prescribing motions of &lt;br/&gt;constrained systems, such as robotic and autonomous vehicles.</AbstractNarration>
