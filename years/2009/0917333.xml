<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The significant progress made by database research on &lt;br/&gt;schema mapping (e.g., omposition, invertibility), data exchange, &lt;br/&gt;and query rewriting, can provide breakthrough solutions for the Database &lt;br/&gt;Schema Evolution problem.  But as of today, information systems are &lt;br/&gt;sorely lacking the methods and tools needed to cope with the&lt;br/&gt;problem, and to reduce the cost of data migration, rework of queries, &lt;br/&gt;application rewriting, and downtime created by schema changes. &lt;br/&gt;In fact, this old problem has been made worse by the success of &lt;br/&gt;scientific databases (e.g., Ensembl) and web information&lt;br/&gt;systems (e.g., Wikipedia)---where the fast evolution of applications &lt;br/&gt;and requirements characterizing the web and the scientific discovery &lt;br/&gt;process is exacerbated by the number and diversity of users and &lt;br/&gt;organizations cooperating on these endeavors.. Fortunately, the openness of&lt;br/&gt;these public-domain information systems (vs. corporate ones), and the &lt;br/&gt;abundance of their interesting evolution histories make it possible to&lt;br/&gt;built a comprehensive testbed to determine the strengths, limitations, &lt;br/&gt;and potentials of candidate methods and tools proposed for the problem.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Thus, this project is building: (i) an open-source curated repository &lt;br/&gt;containing evolution histories from key information systems, &lt;br/&gt;(ii) benchmarks for a comprehensive set of tools tested therein, &lt;br/&gt;and (iii) instruments to collect and analyze evolution histories.&lt;br/&gt;These are then used to (a) compare and evaluate existing approaches, &lt;br/&gt;methods and tools, and (b) entice researchers to evaluate and improve &lt;br/&gt;their techniques and add their test cases to the benchmark.&lt;br/&gt;A transformative impact can be expected upon schema mapping&lt;br/&gt;research and applications, inasmuch as theoretical solutions &lt;br/&gt;are now validated and improved on real-life case-studies. &lt;br/&gt;These in turn are expected to transform and improve significantly &lt;br/&gt;scientific databases and web information systems.
