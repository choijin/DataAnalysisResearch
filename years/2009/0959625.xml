<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research and Instrumentation (MRI) program, Erich S. Uffelman and colleagues Alison Bell, Ronald Fuchs, Peter Grover and Patricia Hobbs of Washington &amp; Lee (W&amp;L) University will acquire a portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, a digital infrared camera, and a boom-mounted research-quality stereomicroscope.  These instruments will be employed in the nondestructive technical analysis of W&amp;L's extensive holdings of art and historical objects by students and faculty in the Departments of Chemistry, Anthropology, and Museum Studies. Research projects to be undertaken include analysis of several historically important paintings of George Washington, an assessment of the technique of the minor turn-of-the-century master Louise Herreshoff, studies of W&amp;L's ceramics and porcelain, and analysis of objects discovered at Thomas Jefferson's home of Monticello.  These projects, which will apply techniques of analytical, physical and inorganic chemistry to problems in art history, archaeology and anthropology will engage students and faculty in research at the interface of science and the humanities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy is used for nondestructive elemental analysis of elements heavier than Mg in a variety of objects including paintings and ceramics.  An infrared camera forms an image using infrared radiation.  Since many pigments are semi-transparent to infrared light, the camera can reveal objects under layers of paint. A stereomicroscope produces a three-dimensional image and will be used to facilitate taking microsamples (when ethically appropriate) for other methods of analysis.  The instrumentation made available by this award will provide a broad range of students critical hands-on experience in several courses and expose the public to applications of chemistry in art history investigations.</AbstractNarration>

Gijsbert Gillisz dÆHondecoeterÆs (1604-1653) panel painting, Cock and Hens in a Landscape (inv. no. 405), recently underwent complete treatment and technical examination at The Royal Picture Gallery Mauritshuis, The Hague, The Netherlands.

The Indianapolis Museum of Art graciously hosted a W&amp;L faculty member for four weeks to collaborate with IMA on the analyses of several paintings.  The various analytical tools of IMA (e.g., SEM-EDS and PLM) and W&amp;LÆs instrumentation were used to conduct several studies.  The North Carolina Museum of Art hosted two Washington and Lee University undergraduate students and a faculty member so that pXRF digital InGaAs IR camera data could be collected at NCMA to help with a collaboration between NCMA, University of Amsterdam, and Duke University.
