    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty-Second Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bela Csaba&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An international research conference, the Twenty-Second Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing will be held from May 21-23, 2009 at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The Cumberland Conference is an annual conference held to bring together combinatorial mathematicians and computer scientists from the southern and southeastern regions of the United States. It has been held every year since 1988, with the venue changing from year to year, moving around between universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on two active areas of research: extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, and complexity theory. These areas have applications in the natural and social sciences, and form the theoretical foundation of modern information infrastructure. Combinatorial methods are used in problems of computer science, ecology, statistical physics, chemistry, logistics, applied for the reliability of transportation and communication networks such as the Internet, scheduling, and many optimization problems. Computational complexity theory is a branch of computer science which investigates the problems related to the amounts of resources required for the execution of algorithms, and in many cases uses combinatorial tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is expected to have about 100 participants, and about 60 contributed talks, arranged in two or three parallel sessions. There will be five principal speakers who will give one-hour presentations. Vitaly Bergelson (Ohio State University), Ralph Faudree (University of Memphis), Alexandr Kostochka (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Benny Sudakov (University of California at Los Angeles), and Mario Szegedy (Rutgers University) have accepted our invitations to be principal speakers. The conference is organized by a committee of six people from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Western Kentucky University, the chair of the committee is Bela Csaba.</AbstractNarration>
