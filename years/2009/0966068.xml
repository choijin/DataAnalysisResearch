<AbstractNarration>The College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) at California State University-Fullerton (CSUF) is an accredited and federally-designated Hispanic-serving institution.  The plan is to establish a scholarship program, the Academic Catalyst for Excellence (ACE), by which ECS hopes to reverse its historical legacy of high student attrition.  &lt;br/&gt;Over the 5 years of the program, scholarships will be awarded to 54 students.  A well established network of student services will support cohorts of ACE scholars majoring in civil, environmental, electrical, mechanical, and computer engineering and computer science.  The guiding principle as supported by research into best practices is to provide 4 years of continuous financial support, to the maximum number of incoming freshmen and sophomores.  &lt;br/&gt;The program targets academically promising but economically disadvantaged students with special emphasis on first-generation college students and those underrepresented in STEM fields.  Scholars will be housed at the ACE Center an office in the engineering building devoted exclusively for such purposes.  Sustainability beyond the term of NSF funding is built into the model.  Dissemination will occur at meetings of organizations such as the American Society of Engineering Education, the National Association of Multicultural Engineering Program Advocates, and Frontiers in Education, in the hope that other institutions may adopt and adapt the model.</AbstractNarration>

With its results disseminated at major conferences and meetings, the program is a model for other institutions seeking to reverse student attrition in engineering and computer science.  Project Outcomes:  The ECS ACE program, which leveraged well established network of ECS and University student services, awarded scholarships to 62 ECS students over a period of 12 semesters.  In addition, 94% of the ACE scholars meet the target time?to-degree of five years, 87% of the ACE scholars in sophomore year continued in ECS majors, and ACE scholars in all departments had higher average GPAs compared to average GPA in their respective departments.
