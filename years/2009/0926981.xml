<AbstractNarration>The objective of the US GEOTRACES program, a newly initiated international oceanographic program, is to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the oceans and to establish an understanding of the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions.  Neodymium (Nd), a rare earth element, is supplied to the ocean via continental weathering, and its isotopes have been identified as an important ocean tracer that could potentially improve our understanding of water mass pathways, as well as identify sources and sinks of trace elements in modern and past oceans.  Scientists from Columbia University, the University of South Carolina, and the University of Hawaii will be conducting a rigorous survey of the distribution of dissolved seawater Nd isotopes and concentrations along the 2010 GEOTRACES North Atlantic zonal section.  Results from this study will determine how well Nd isotopes track advected water masses in marginal and open ocean settings, estimate the Nd contribution from submarine groundwater discharge, and determine atmospheric Nd input and fluxes into and out of marine sediments. This research will aid scientists in determining the oceanic distribution of Nd isotopes on a global scale. The educational impacts of this research include support for a graduate and postdoctoral student, as well as training opportunities for an undergraduate student. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Neodymium (Nd) isotopes are a powerful tool used to reconstruct patterns of ocean circulation in the past. Circulation of water masses in the ocean redistribute heat, nutrients, and carbon dioxide around the globe on time scales on the same magnitude of human civilization. The importance of ocean circulation to global climate cannot be overstated, particularly the air-sea exchange and deep water production occurring in the North Atlantic. These processes exert a powerful control on heat released to the atmosphere in the North Atlantic, influencing Europe and having global consequences for climate.     In this project we measured the Nd isotopic composition of seawater samples collected as part of the US GEOTRACES North Atlantic section, which intersected water masses produced in the North Atlantic by the processes above. In addition samples collected on a southward transect from the Iberian Peninsula captured Mediterranean overflow water, as well as seawater under the influence of the Saharan dust plume. These measurements have provided crucial constraints on the cycling of Nd in the oceans which in turn allow more accurate interpretation of Nd isotope records of past ocean circulation.  This study has greatly increased the volume of Nd isotope measurements from the North Atlantic (Fig 1).     In this study we have constrained the flow of Labrador Seawater from its source in the Labrador Sea and constrain the proportion of this distinct water mass across the Atlantic. Moreover, the concentrations of Nd underneath the Saharan dust plume show surface maxima that decrease with distance from the margin. A subsurface minimum in concentrations suggests scavenging of Nd from the water column. These variations are associated with subtle changes in the isotopic composition of Nd, though deep water Nd isotopes are consistent with water mass mixing.     One of the key outcomes of this study is an understanding of particle-seawater interactions and how it affects the Nd isotope distribution. The large input of particles along the transect underneath the Saharan dust plume show strong Nd dissolved concentration gradients. These gradients are being interpreted with particulate Nd concentration and isotope data.          Last Modified: 02/11/2014       Submitted by: Howard Scher]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
