<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award is to create a fundamental understanding of the Magnetic Pulsed Welding (MPW) process through a collaboration with an industrial partner Magneform and UNH faculty members from Mechanical Engineering, Physics, and Materials Science. While MPW has been used as a process for decades, the process is typically implemented based on experience and trial and error experimentation. The tasks of the proposed research are to experimentally investigate axisymmetric MPW joints including measurement of the deformation; to conduct materials testing of both the interface of the weld and the mechanical properties of the final joint; to model the process with respect to the electromagnetics, thermomechanical effects (which will allow for phase transformation), and wave formation at the interface of the weld; and to optimize the process parameters based on the experimental and modeling efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will benefit society at large through reduced weight of structures as dissimilar metals will be effectively welded and thus lower weight components will be located in non-strength critical areas. In addition, this research will add significantly to the modeling and materials characterization during high rate deformation and impact conditions, such as electromagnetic forming, ballistic impact, etc. Collaborating with Magneform offers several advantages including the broad dissemination of the results to industry. Graduate students will benefit from the interdisciplinary nature of the research and incorporation of results into several courses. Finally, Research Experience for Teachers participants will be involved in the research and will create modules for high school classrooms based on the Physics and magnetism aspects of the project. This high rate deformation process will capture the attention and imagination of high school students and potentially attract individuals from underrepresented groups to the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Materials Processing &amp; Manufacturing (MPM) Program, of the Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) Division,the Thermal Transport Processes (TTP) Program, of the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division and, the Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) Program, of the Industrical Innovation and Partnerships (IIP)Divison, all within the Directorate for Engineering (ENG).</AbstractNarration>
