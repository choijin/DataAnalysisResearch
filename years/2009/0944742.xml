<AbstractNarration>This SBIR project proposes to develop a system for detoxifying contaminated groundwater using in-situ anaerobic bioremediation.  The focus of the project will be the ability of multi-functional nano-powders to produce groundwater that supports effective in-situ anaerobic bioremediation.  This improved method would use organic bio-amendments applied with anaerobic microbes to contaminated groundwater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be to treat contaminated groundwater in a more cost-effective manner.  Halogenated hydrocarbons, perchlorate, and other toxic substances contaminate groundwater and threaten public water supplies. The slow natural attenuation of TCE and other toxic chemicals makes effective in-situ treatment that much more important.  In-situ methods, where the contaminants are consumed underground, is lower cost than pump and treat options and is a more complete remediation solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
