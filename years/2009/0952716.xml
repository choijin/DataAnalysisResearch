<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;The anisotropy of physical properties is a key distinguishing feature of crystalline systems, is central to the nature of fundamental interactions and their resultant phases, and is known to play a key role in stabilizing many exotic phases of matter such as high-temperature superconductivity. Motivated by the recent discovery of a new family of iron-based superconductors with intriguing fundamental properties and much promise for technological applications, this Faculty Early Career Award supports a program with a goal of developing an experimental platform capable of probing the symmetry and anisotropic nature of quantum materials by measuring heat capacity and other thermal properties in large fully rotatable magnetic fields and at temperatures approaching absolute zero. By providing a new experimental tool previously unavailable to the U.S. condensed matter physics community, several fundamental questions regarding the nature of high-temperature superconductivity and other exotic states of matter can now be addressed. This provides an opportunity for investigation of a wide range of materials of interest to both fundamental and applied research in physics, chemistry, materials science and other disciplines, and with promise for applications in energy and health-related fields. An important component of this CAREER research program is the integration of an extended education program that will include the participation of both undergraduate students through co-operative work-study programs and local-area high school students through Science Magnet Programs. Also, an international junior researcher short-visit exchange program will be organized to enhance the experience of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars working on collaborative projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Award supports a project seeking to elucidate the fundamental nature of unconventional superconductivity and the ground state properties of quantum critical systems via experimentally accessible methods of quantum tuning. The key approach is to develop an experimental platform capable of probing the symmetry and anisotropic nature of quantum materials by performing thermal transport and thermodynamic measurements down to milliKelvin temperatures in a rotatable vector magnetic field environment. With precise angular control of large, directional magnetic fields at low temperatures, specific heat and thermal conductivity probes will be used to a) map the symmetry of superconducting order parameters in iron-based and heavy-fermion superconductors, and b) investigate the role of anisotropy in quantum critical systems by measuring straightforward, interpretation-independent quantities to test the basic nature of particle excitations. An important component of this research program is the integration of an extended education program that will include the participation of both undergraduate students through co-operative work-study programs and local-area high school students through Science Magnet Programs. Also, an international junior researcher short-visit exchange program will be organized to enhance the experience of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars working on collaborative projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The main focus of this project was to develop an ultra-low-temperature experimental probe for the exploration of exotic materials including high-temperature superconductors and exotic metals called "quantum critical materials".  This involved setting up an operational experiment to measure the specific heat of small crystalline specimens at low temperatures with high precision. This includes experimental platform design and construction, electronics purchase and setup, software development and development of techniques and expertise in running the experiment at milliKelvin temperatures.

We have used this probe to explore the relationship between high-temperature superconductivity and quantum criticality by studying the low-temperature physical properties of the so-called "electron-doped cuprate" superconductors. This led to several significant publications of our findings in the journals Nature and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. We are currently studying other electron-doped systems to explore how universal our previous findings are, which may have implications for understanding the most technologically important materials of the 21st century.  In addition, we have developed a strong infrastructure for synthesis of new high-quality crystalline specimens of superconducting, strongly correlated and topological materials.In the Maryland Center for Nanophysics and Advanced Materials, we synthesize crystals of many exotic materials, including iron-based superconductors, so-called "heavy-electron" compounds and topological insulators. In the latter materials, we have made significant progress in synthesizing and studying the properties of high-quality single-crystal specimens of the "Kondo insulator" material samarium hexaboride, which have resulted in several significant publications and news highlights.     Broader Impact   We have become strongly involved with the organization GRADMAP (Graduate Resources Advancing Diversity with Maryland Astronomy and Physics), which held it's second Winter Workshop this past winter.  The workshop accepted 10 undergraduate students from various colleges and universities in DC, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.  At the workshop, students attended seminars giving them information on what life in graduate school is like, summer research opportunities they can apply for as undergraduates, and an introduction to computer programming.   Another fundamental part of the workshop was for each student to undertake a small research project to conduct over the course of 4 days.   Three students chose to do research projects with our research group, supervised by my student Paul Syers.  Joshua Samuel, a sophomore from Prince George's Community College, chose the project of preparing growths of Bismuth Selenide.  Mikel Tucker, from Morgan State University, chose to learn how to prepare and measure samples.  Noura Jaber, a sophomore from Bryn Mawr College, chose to learn how to analyze some recent resistivity data. At the end of the workshop, all the students presented the results of their research projects and discussed what they had learned.  All three students showed that they had learned a great deal from the project, acquiring no only new skills for experimental research, but also learning new concepts in physics, like Fermi surfaces, quantum oscillations, energy band structure diagrams, topological insulators, and Fourier transforms.
