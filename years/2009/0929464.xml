<AbstractNarration>This travel grant provides partial support for young researchers and students to participate in MobiHoc 2009 Symposium in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA and partial support for a workshop entitled, ?The First Wireless of the Students, by the Students, for the Students Workshop? to be held in conjunction with ACM Mobihoc 2009 created by the students, for the students. The intellectual merit of the student workshop is to pursue a unique format that will develop leadership, early-career development and encourage participation in the research community. The student panels will be an early experience with bold, visionary thinking. Moreover, ACM MobiHoc is the premier international symposium dedicated to addressing challenges emerging from wireless ad hoc networking and computing.  The broader impact is fostering an environment of technical discussions and debates among the communities of mobile computing and wireless systems. In addition, the event targets to encourage participation by young scientists and researchers and features a ?Networking Networking Women? meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
