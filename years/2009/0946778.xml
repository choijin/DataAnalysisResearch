    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education award to San Diego State University will develop innovative articulation and credit transfer methods among community colleges, military training and four year colleges. This will assist in streamlining the transition of veteran students from the military to completion of undergraduate degrees in engineering. The engineering degree pathways will be customized to the needs and strengths of veterans. The results will be disseminated widely and also will be presented on the web, at technical conferences and published in professional journals. The project is expected to assist veterans' transition to civilian life and to enhance the number of students who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs or start new high tech businesses.</AbstractNarration>
