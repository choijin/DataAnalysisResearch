<AbstractNarration>AST-0926815/0926641/0928636&lt;br/&gt;Gebhardt/Schneider/DePoy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solution to the problem of dark energy will require a fundamental shift in our understanding of the Universe, and acceptance of any model will require significant corroboration by observations.  The Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) Dark Energy Experiment, HETDEX, offers a technically clean and observationally robust approach to measuring the effects of dark energy.  HETDEX includes an upgrade of the HET for a wider field of view, deployment of the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS), and completion of a wide field survey which will use 1400 hours of observation to obtain nearly a million redshifts of Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies.  Significant parts of the project are already underway with support from a variety of sources, including substantial private donations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survey will determine the local Hubble expansion at redshift 2.4 and measure the angular diameter distance out to that redshift, both to an accuracy of 0.8%, and determine the growth of structure to 2%.  Nearly all other dark energy surveys target lower redshifts, while HETDEX was designed to provide high-redshift information on the evolution of dark energy, as well as being sufficiently powerful to measure dark energy effects even at late times.  HETDEX further will measure the curvature of the Universe to about 0.1%, an order of magnitude better than current projects, and a strong complement to other current and planned studies.  Although HETDEX is optimized for measures of the expansion history, there is significant ancillary science from the survey, such as a collection of spectra of a quarter of a million stars and 1.4 million other galaxies.  Given its capabilities, VIRUS will remain a, if not the, primary instrument for HET for many years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significant insights on dark energy, the large database with substantial ancillary science, and the unique and powerful integral field spectrograph on the HET will have a broad impact throughout the astronomical community.  The attraction of the dark energy enigma enables HETDEX to include significant public outreach involving the McDonald Observatory Visitors Center and Stardate radio, including an interactive display for visitors and the involvement of K-12 teachers, as well as a popular webpage at http://www.hetdex.org.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The three year Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) will look 10 billion years back in time, identify close to a million of the epoch's star-forming galaxies (specifically, Ly&alpha; emitting objects), and use the distribution of these galaxies to measure the evolution of the mysterious Dark Energy component to the universe.  To prepare for this survey, we have conducted a number of studies of the galaxies of the epoch, measuring their stellar masses, star formation rates, sizes, chemical abundances, emission-line strengths, escape probability of Ly&alpha; photons, and dust properties.  These data, which have directly informed the HETDEX observing strategy, have resulted in over two dozen refereed publications (with a half-dozen more currently in the refereeing process).  Major results include the discovery that Ly&alpha; emitters are not special low-mass systems in the act formation, but are instead representative of (almost) the entire population of distant, star-forming galaxies.  We have also shown that the dust obscuration law which affects the observed properties of these star-forming galaxies depends on the galaxy's mass, and the fraction of Ly&alpha; photons which escape the distant universe is only 4.4%.  One limitation of the HETDEX survey is that, in the absense of additional information, foreground galaxies may be confused with the distant objects targeted in the survey.  Thus, another goal of the project was to conduct a deep imaging survey of the HETDEX field, and to the develop the procedures needed to use these data to discriminate the Ly&alpha; emitters from foreground contaminants. During the course of this program, we have imaged enough of the HETDEX region to carry us through the first two years of the survey, we have measured the distribution of galaxies properties needed to perform this discrimination, and we have proto-typed the requisite software.  Finally, in performing this project, we have trained one postdoctoral researcher, four graduate students, and five undergraduates.  Three of these students are women, which are under represented in physics and astronomy.  All of the project participants have been active in outreach events, including Astro Fest, which attracts over 2000 visitors per year, Astro Night, which involves another 300 visitors, and our department's astronomy open houses.  The investigators of this project have also given a number of public lectures on the galaxies of the distant universe and HETDEX.
