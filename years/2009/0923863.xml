<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will use readily available plant protein and innovative, environmentally friendly processes to develop bio-based plastic prototypes such as packaging products. The resulting formulation and production processes for each prototype will meet the needs of large manufacturing companies and consumers who seek biobased and biodegradable products. The prototypes will be designed to meet production requirements, product characteristics and costs that compete with incumbent petroleum-based plastics. Phase II goals are to refine the formulations and processes from Phase I to produce acceptable prototypes for our potential customers, particularly in the packaging industry. The results of a defined formulation and process for each product will enable R&amp;D Green Materials to develop, in Phase III, a scalable pilot process to produce the bio-based products and show that economic implementation can be achieved by our industrial partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in unique processes and technologies to produce biobased, biodegradable plastic products that are functionally equivalent to nonbiodegradable petroleum-based plastics. R&amp;D Green Materials will develop environmentally friendly, cost-effective alternatives to plastic products through technologies that utilize plant-based materials that remain non-toxic from manufacture to disposal. The results will allow industrial partners the freedom to utilize bio-based plastic products without the current problems of high cost and inappropriate characteristics of the process and/or product. As use of the biobased plastics becomes widespread, the general environmental benefits and reduction of plastic pollution is likely to exert a positive effect on human health through reduced exposure to carcinogens and endocrine disruptors. Compared with synthetic polymers, the unique biobased polymers used in the Phase II prototypes can reduce environmental impact, minimize pollution, and conserve resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Green Materials, LLC has developed green material technologies that will enable sustainable short-duration-of-use disposables (e.g. utensils, caps, lids, closures) to be manufactured inexpensively and in high volume for large markets.  The company is addressing a pressing environmental problem that has the attention of commercial interests because of growing awareness and consumer preferences.  There is an increasing desire to have more and more articles made from toxin-free materials rather than from synthetic materials.  During this Phase II SBIR project, Green MaterialsÆ scientists have focused on the development of new and cost-effective manufacturing methods and on the production of alternatives to traditional plastics and composites.      Bio-based materials, such as corn gluten meal or canola meal, are not traditionally regarded as being suitable for injection molding in their present form.  Research performed under this grant showed that, under the right conditions, such bio-based materials behave like solid thermosets, and methodologies for molding articles from these materials were developed. Unlike thermoplastics, which are reversibly melt-processable and usually of high molecular weight, or liquid thermosets, which are irreversibly formed from low molecular-weight precursors (monomers), these bio-based materials have their own unique characteristics and therefore cannot be processed like conventional plastics.  Injection-compression molding or "coining" was found to be most suitable for molding these articles, and standard injection molding machines have been adapted to achieve this goal (see photos below).  Green Materials, LLC is now working in partnership with Boy Machines, Inc. to develop prototypes for prospective partners and major distributors in a variety of industries.
