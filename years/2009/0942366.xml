<AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to integrate a GIS-enabled design approach across a sequence of six required civil engineering courses. A collaborative development model is ensuring that curricular links between the courses are explicit and that a clear path for student skills progression in terms of technical competency, data synthesis and analysis, and problem solving is articulated in the developed materials. Through the use of these materials, students are developing an improved ability to analyze engineering problems in multiple contexts using a GIS platform. Furthermore, the project is leading to a new curriculum infusion model for critical cross-disciplinary topics and a sustainable curriculum transformation.  It is also contributing to the body of knowledge on improving student understanding of core content and engineering decision-making abilities through the use of visualization software as the platform for a completely integrated and project-based, collaborative approach to learning.  It is identifying best practices in terms of curriculum transformation to achieve the goal of enhanced student skill level not only in technical content, but also in societal and global context.  The project is building on an existing program (Girls Experiencing Engineering) to engage K-12 teachers and middle and high school students.  Other dissemination efforts include conference and journal papers and faculty workshops.  Project evaluation, under the direction of a independent campus center, is using competency assessments and questionnaires to monitor the impact of the new material on the students knowledge, skills, and beliefs.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the instructional material, the faculty workshops, and the outreach to female K-12 students and teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The role of Civil Engineers is evolving beyond that of a technical professional with recognition that Civil Engineers play a critical role in the planning, management, and development of the infrastructure of a community. One critical element of Civil Engineering, as demonstrated by recent reports developed by the American Society of Civil Engineers and the National Academy of Engineering is the ability to visualize the impact that design decisions will have not only on the technical aspects but also on a broad body of factors, including economic, social, environmental, and political consequences.  Geographic information systems (GIS) enable users to visualize some of these factors and to relate different types of data (e.g., socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental), and as such are becoming a critical tool for the Civil Engineering design professional.   In recognition of this trend, University of Memphis (UM) Civil Engineering faculty implemented a collaborative, three-year curriculum transformation project to integrate a GIS-enabled design approach across a sequence of six required Civil Engineering courses at the freshmen, sophomore and junior levels.

Project evaluations, conducted by project personnel in collaboration with the Center for Research in Educational Policy at the UM, have shown that the redesigned curriculum has resulted in a number of key student outcomes.  - Students recognize the value of GIS-based courses in acquiring skills and knowledge needed for the Civil Engineering workforce. Focus groups conducted with teaching faculty indicate that students are aware GIS-based courses offer real world experience regarding how to design community projects.  - Students have gained valuable knowledge about GIS. Data from comprehension tests show that the majority of students from each group experiencing the redesigned courses answer GIS-related questions correctly.  - Students are more likely to identify a broad body of factors associated with engineering designs after exposure to the redesigned curriculum. Data from a student activity centered on a bridge building scenario indicate that after completing the sequence of redesigned courses, students are better able to identify a range of pertinent factors (e.g., environmental, social and economic concerns) to designing community projects.

The redesigned courses and GIS-based curriculum materials were developed in a way that they can be implemented by faculty in other UM departments and external institutions.
