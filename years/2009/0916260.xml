<AbstractNarration>Software developers rely on reusing source code snippets from existing libraries or applications to develop software features on time and within budget. The reality is such that most previously implemented features are embedded in billions of lines of scattered source code. State-of-the-art code search engines provide no guarantee that retrieved code snippets implement these features. Even if relevant code fragments are located, developers face rather complex task of selecting and moving these fragments into their applications. Finally, synthesizing new functionality by composing selected code fragments requires sophisticated reasoning about the behavior of these fragments and the consequent code. The result of this process is an overwhelming complexity, a steep learning curve, and a significant cost of building customized software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program proposes an integrated model for addressing fundamental problems of searching, selecting, and synthesizing (S3) source code. The S3 model relies on integrating program analysis and information retrieval to produce transformative models to automatically search, select, and synthesize relevant source code fragments. The S3 model will directly support new methodologies for software change and automated tools that assist programmers with various development, reuse and maintenance activities. Among the broader impacts the project includes collaboration with industry to transfer technology.</AbstractNarration>
