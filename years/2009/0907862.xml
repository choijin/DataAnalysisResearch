<AbstractNarration>The most widely accepted definition of a "species" is a group of organisms that cannot successfully breed with other groups.  When researchers want to study how species are formed, they study breeding barriers.  In marine animals that reproduce by broadcast spawning, sperm and eggs are released into the water, where fertilization occurs.  For these species the most common breeding barriers occur when a sperm tries to penetrate an egg: if the proteins on the surface of the sperm don't match the proteins on the surface of the egg, the sperm cannot fertilize the egg.  This project identifies the sperm proteins important in fertilization in a marine invertebrate.  In addition, the researchers will compare these proteins in two species that have breeding barriers between them, to learn how the differences in the proteins contribute to the breeding barriers. This research will provide fundamental information about the fertilization process.&lt;br/&gt; The researchers will participate in a collaboration between the Harrison laboratory and the Museum of the Earth at the Paleontological Research Institution (PRI) beginning in Summer 2009.  This project includes developing an exhibit and brochure at the Museum of the Earth, a docent training program, professional development for K-12 teachers, and public lectures at the Museum.  The themes to be presented, reproductive isolation and species formation, are integral to the work outlined above. The researchers will share their findings in a public lecture, exhibit materials and professional development as a part of this collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
