    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant for a Regional Cyber Education Center is focusing on the 150 mile region surrounding Bossier City, Louisiana. The project is lead by the Cyber Innovation Center (CIC) of Bossier City and Bossier Parish Community College (BPCC) and is supported by a consortium of community colleges, 4-year universities, a local high school, industry, and government from northwest Louisiana and east Texas. The goals include expanding partnerships with regional academic institutions, industry and government; forging pathways for students from high schools through community colleges to 4-year institutions; and developing degree programs to align with professional certifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multidisciplinary team is working with academic institutions, private industry, and existing ATE Centers to foster a diverse technological workforce in the Arkansas-Louisiana-Texas region. The PIs are using innovative approaches to technician education with substantial involvement of industry and with open dialogue among community stakeholders. One of the immediate outcomes of this stage of the project is a new Cyber Security course developed in collaboration with existing ATE Centers that is responsive to industry needs and approved by a multidisciplinary 12 person Advisory Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing a recruitment and retention plan that addresses methods of supporting diversity of applicants enrolling in technological education and the participation of minority and under served populations in programming. The PIs are collaborating with industry representatives and develop a plan for internship programs for secondary and post-secondary school students pursuing STEM related disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
