<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  "Geo is deep earth." While scientists can image deep space and the formation of stars, at present tools do not exist to image even tens of meters into the earth.  What is needed is a Hubble telescope into, not away from, the earth - a tool for high resolution imaging of the Earth's interior.  Through this award, the Subsurface Imaging and Sensing team will develop, combine, and refine the science necessary to image the earth at the many scales required for the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) facility at the Homestake Mine in South Dakota, to use these abilities to gain understanding of rock and rock mass, and to leverage these discoveries into engineering tools.  All the earth interrogation methods used by the team rely heavily on inversion methods because the data collected do not directly measure the physical quantity of interest.  The proposed suite of experiments combines the power of many methodologies to provide strong constraints on the necessary inversions, and to bring images into sharper focus.  The Homestake Mine provides the unique facility which allows this multi-scale and multi-physics campaign to happen. Prior to research commencing, the project team will develop a detailed design for the needed infrastructure and safety procedures.  Infrastructure is only one small piece of the massive DUSEL undertaking, and requires a complete a work breakdown structure document.  Several workshops will be held, two in order to broaden participation in the project team and involve more of the community in the DUSEL undertaking, and three workshops/design meets at the Homestake mine in Lead to provide real detail and certitude for the overall design process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The Subsurface Imaging and Sensing experiments will have two types of impact - societal and technical.  Building on the initial contacts made by the PI for his ongoing NSF-supported project at DUSEL, "Towards a Transparent Earth," the observatory, through the Sanford Science and Education Center, will provide a lifelong learning experience for all stakeholders - K-12 students and teachers, the hundreds of thousands of visitors passing through the Black Hills annually, underrepresented groups in higher education, and the general student population.  Outreach through the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, the SDSTA, and near-by tribal colleges, is becoming deep and substantive.  Local citizens will have a special role.  There exists in the Lead area a body of knowledge about the Homestake mine that will never be equaled, i.e., the many people who have spent a good part of their lives working in the mine.  A team of retired Homestake miners will be a key part of the project, to help make the design and planning optimal, realistic and safe. There are many technical implications of the observatory beyond direct imaging of rock behavior, such as: (1) Underground and Mine Safety - more quantitative methods to quickly locate potential dynamic rock failure within the mine will be an immediate benefit, (2) Homeland Security of Underground Facilities - use reciprocity to derive methods to detect and characterize underground structures and activity, and study explosions associated with coal mining activity in Wyoming as contribution to nuclear monitoring, and (3) Global Seismology - take advantage of location and depth of array to assess maximum frequency content of teleseismic phases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We undertook a series of seismological investigations for this DUSEL S-4 project.  DUSEL was the deep underground science and engineering laboratory being built in the Homestake gold mine in Lead, SD.  The facility was for advanced physics research on topics such as neutrino behavior and double beta decay.  We were to install a seismic network to monitor blasting and other construction effects on safety as well as larger, induced, microearthquakes.  We installed a small array of strong motion accelerometers and tilt meters on the 2550 and 4200 levels.  The array is still in place and operating.  We were able to observe a number of interesting events during their operation including teleseismic signals from the Tohoku-Oki earthquake and earth tides.  Another important signal that we observed was the response of the rock to the dewatering efforts at DUSEL.  In conjunction with a group conducting hydrologic research, we developed a simplified analytic groundwater model and used it to estimate the bulk conductivity of local rockmass.  When the DUSEL project was put on hold we studied stress wave propagation methods for finding underground openings, which can be used when DUSEL is restarted in the future.  We developed a methodology for modeling stress wave propagation in heterogeneous earth material for understanding field tests.  This is important since the earth is a heterogeneous rock mass.  We found that fractal statistics are a powerful tool for modeling heterogeneity using a few easy to estimate parameters.  In addition, we found that randomly generated models are particularly useful.  We were able to explain the problem of shear wave generation due to heterogeneity near the earthÆs surface, publishing our results in the journal Geophysics.  Due to its flexibility, power, and to recent advances in inexpensive computing we chose to focus on numerical simulations.  We use the finite difference code E3D, a powerful computer program used to simulate a wide range of phenomena by many different groups; it is challenging to work with and has no user interface.  We developed an elegant open-source graphical user interface for Python and Matlab in order to increase the speed and efficiency of our work, and to assist other researchers using E3D.  We have found that the surface wave backscattering and attenuation tomography techniques are very effective in locating buried tunnels, even in heterogeneous geological media.  Using these methods, we expect to locate a tunnel at a depth of the dominant wavelength in the survey.  Interestingly, we found that for a moderate level of heterogeneity the resolution of the methods increases.  The method worked well with three field data sets.  We worked with a group of low-income and minority high school students sponsored by the Summer Math and Science Honors (SMASH) Academy at UC Berkeley.  The goal of this project was to teach the students how research works at a university level and to develop their interests in science and math.  The students worked to evaluate the safety of a seismic sensor we will put in tunnel that runs through the Hayward fault.
