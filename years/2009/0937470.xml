    <AbstractNarration>This award supports students attending the Frontier in Optics Conference to be held in San Jose, CA, October 11-15, 2009. Frontiers in Optics is the longest standing meeting in optics and photonics. Presenting over 150 sessions and nearly 800 technical presentations, Frontiers in Optics hones some of the most innovative research in the field. The 2009 conference will offer a number of Short Courses designed to increase knowledge on specific subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One broader impact is the opportunity for young students to attend a national meeting and experience the excitement of the field of Optics. They will also learn about this field by attending the sessions, or by taking some of the short courses. A secondary benefit arises because collaborations among students are often formed at these meetings. In addition, they can meet some of the established researchers in the field, who could help them get established in their careers.</AbstractNarration>
