    <AbstractNarration>2009 EAPSI Fellowship - NEW ZEALAND &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a U.S. graduate student to conduct an individual research project at one of seven locations in East Asia and the Pacific region. The research project will provide the student with a first-hand mentored research experience, an introduction to science and science policy infrastructure, and an orientation to the culture and language of the location. The primary goals of the East Asia Summer Institute program are to expose students to science and engineering in the context of a research laboratory, and to initiate early-career professional relationships that will foster research collaborations with foreign counterparts in the future.</AbstractNarration>
