<AbstractNarration>The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) and Michigan State University are conducting a research and development project based on the hypothesis that learners must have access to the real work of scientists if they are to learn both about the nature of science and to do inquiry themselves. It explores the question "How can informal science education institutions best design resources to support teachers, school administrators, and families in the teaching and learning of students to conduct scientific investigations and better understand the nature of science?" The project is a middle school science initiative involving informal science education institutions that provide professional development for teachers and hands-on learning for students. The major science topic is the invasion of the Hudson River system by zebra mussels using data sets provided by the Cary Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project goals are to: (1) Refine a model that uses an informal education institution to generate a productive overlap of leaning opportunities for students, parents, teachers, and administrators; (2) Develop and field test complementary resources that use teaching cases for exploring secondary research and data analysis as vehicles for providing different audiences opportunities to do inquiry and to lean about scientific inquiry, the impact of invasive species on fresh water ecosystems, and the work of scientists; (3) Study the model to extract more general knowledge and design principles that allow others to pursue similar approaches; (4) Disseminate the model, resources, and research to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the following research questions: (1) How do professional development opportunities shape teacher and administrator understanding of scientific work and inquiry and freshwater ecosystems?; (2) How do teachers, parents, and administrators use resources to further their own learning and that of students?; and (3) How do informal institutions' resources and methods support teachers' practices and student learning? Researchers from Michigan State University will carry out the research using both qualitative and quantitative methods to gather data in a parallel/simultaneous mixed methods design. There is also a comparison group of 30 middle school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project partners are the American Museum of Natural History, Michigan State University, the Cary Institute, and The Academy for Educational Development. Participants are middle school teachers, middle school students and their families, and school administrators. Professional development workshops for teachers and administrators will be held at AMNH. Students and their families will take field trips to the Hudson River with AMNH and Cary Institute scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deliverables will be four case studies for teachers, students, parents, and administrators; curriculum on the zebra mussel invasion of the Hudson River; and research results on the educational model. Outputs will be: 150 teachers participate in 58 hours of professional development; 100 middle school administrators experience leadership workshops to learn about the project; and 300 families participate in day-long family outreach events to the Hudson River ecosystem. Through this research and the education resources developed, this project has the potential to improve science education in many other large urban areas. It also explores the effect of participants in secondary research as they analyze large data sets developed by the Cary Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formative evaluation is carried out during the first three years by AMNH staff. Summative evaluation is executed by an external evaluator, The Academy for Educational Development. The summative evaluation explores the extent to which the collaboration meets the project goals, the quality of the teachers' use of the project resources, the impact of the project on student learning, and the response of parents and administrators to the project resources.</AbstractNarration>
