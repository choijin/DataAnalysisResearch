<AbstractNarration>The PI requests funding to continue to provide information technology infrastructure support and maintenance of an existing research vessel ship condition and specifications database (Ship Condition Form) for the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). The Ocean Information Center (OCEANIC) at the University of Delaware?s College of Marine Studies serves as a centralized location for the UNOLS information technology infrastructure, web server, mail servers, file repository and backend relational databases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UNOLS fleet is well into its fourth decade of service to our nation's ongoing effort to study the seven eights of our planet that is covered by ocean. In a time of intense budgetary constraints and competing pressures on scarce federal resources, this fleet must stress cost-effectiveness, efficiency and wise utilization of the taxpayer's dollars. Our educational and scientific mission must be accessible to educators, policy makers and the public, and the maintenance of the UNOLS IT infrastructure directly contributes to this mission.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
