    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the use of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) as a method of applying hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings onto next-generation titanium alloy implantable biocompatible materials. PECVD is attractive as a method to address key drawbacks of conventional coatings and application methods. The hydroxyapatite coatings will be analyzed to determine key physical properties: adhesion strength, topography, composition, and crystallinity. A suite of biological evaluations will also be performed to demonstrate osseo-integrative behavior. It is anticipated that hydroxyapatite coatings with excellent adhesion strength and crystallinity, ideal for long term implant fixation, will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project, if successful, is the availability of new coating methods and materials that would improve load-bearing orthopaedic implant effectiveness and longevity. In general, longer-term implant components are needed as patients receiving implants are younger and living longer. The expected outcomes of this research are improved materials and processing methods that will reduce the frequency of, or the need for, revision surgeries that can be painful, costly, and less effective with repetition.</AbstractNarration>
