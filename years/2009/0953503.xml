<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to design algorithms that allow teams of simple mobile robots to complete a wide range of tasks reliably.  The key insight is that effective planning is possible for such teams, even in spite of significant uncertainty stemming from both sensing and motion.  This approach builds upon existing work on minimalism for single robots, but must also overcome substantial complications that arise from coordination and communication between the robots.  A distinguishing feature of this work is that the problems are complex and nontrivial at multiple scales:  Planning for the multi-robot teams cannot be fully decoupled from the planning and control issues for individual robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project combines three related research endeavors.  First, it investigates techniques for representing each robot's uncertainty about its own state, and about the state and knowledge of the other robots.  Second, it develops energy-efficient and robust strategies for communication between robots.  Third, it applies these techniques in specialized planning algorithms to allow robot teams to complete their tasks in a decentralized manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will result in a collection of new algorithms that will allow teams of simple robots to manage uncertainty, communication, and planning in order to complete broad classes of tasks.  These algorithms will enable simpler, more autonomous teams of robots to be deployed with less expense.  Such robots will have significant positive impact on many sectors of our society, including transportation, space exploration, and agriculture.  Broader impact will include development and distribution of "covertly educational" game software for middle school students, and training of undergraduate and graduate student researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed algorithmic tools for controlling teams of simple robots.  The results help to enable robot designers to overcome the limitations of limited or unreliable robot hardware via judicious use of strong algorithms.  Discoveries include new techniques for robot navigation, tracking, and localization applications.  For robot navigation, the project showed how to use the shapes of the environment to plan motions that decrease the robot's uncertainty about its own position without additional sensing.  For robotic tracking, the project showed how to use robots to systematically search and environment for unpredictable targets, and introduced new algorithms for computing persistent pursuit-evasion strategies, which enable searching robots to robustly search their environments for evaders in spite of sensor errors.  These results are applicable for both single robots and cooperative robot teams.  For robot localization, the project showed how a robot can keep track of its own position in spite of the presence of crowds of dynamic obstacles, possibly including nearby humans.  The project also included research at the theoretical foundations of robotics, exploring which parts of the process of designing a robotic system have the possibility to be automated, and providing efficient heuristic algorithms that perform well on these problems in practice.
