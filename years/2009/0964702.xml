<AbstractNarration>JavaScript is the lingua franca of modern Internet computing.  Unlike traditional code, JavaScript is highly dynamic and malleable.  While JavaScript is increasingly used in security-critical applications that manipulate sensitive information like banking information and social security numbers, Web browsers' sandboxing mechanism for JavaScript (the "same-origin policy") is too coarse to adequately secure "mashups" that combine code at runtime from mutually distrusting origins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides tools to secure JavaScript applications from buggy or malicious code by enforcing security policies, written by developers and users, that specify what code should be trusted and what data must be protected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faced with dynamic applications like mashups, traditional enforcement mechanisms call for either one incomplete initial analysis or expensive from-scratch re-analysis whenever code is added.  This project instead introduces staged program analysis.  At each stage, as much analysis as possible is performed as possible given the known code; the remainder of the analysis computation is deferred until more code becomes available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system, implemented in a browser and evaluated on real Web sites, must be scalable enough to use with complex, popular sites; precise enough to produce few false positives; efficient enough to run on end users' browsers without noticeable performance degradation; and user-friendly in minimizing user intervention and providing a faithful rendition of protected sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For users, the project will make Web 2.0 applications safer and more reliable, without degrading the browsing experience.  For developers, it will provide early error detection and the guarantee of safe execution for dynamic Web 2.0 applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Javascript is a programming language that is central to all large applications running in the web browser, for example Google Maps, GMail, Facebook, Twitter, Banking applications and many others. Although Javascript has enabled the modern web as we know it today, with complex interactive applications running inside the browser, it has also brought many problems in terms of security of privacy. The goal of this project was to better understand what these problems are, and to develop techniques for mitigating these problems.  More specifically, this project has achieved two primary intellectual outcomes :  (1) Through systematic experimentation, this project has allowed us to better understand the security and privacy issues with Javascript. Most notably, this project funded a study of "history sniffing" in the wild. History sniffing is a technique by which Javascript can be used to steal a user's browsing history without their permission. The study showed how prevalent history sniffing was, what sites used it, and how they used it.  (2) This project developed better techniques for mitigating the security problems with Javascript, and more broadly security problems in the browser. Using advanced techniques like information flow, dependent types, and run-time monitoring, this project has developed novel techniques for strengthening the security guarantees provided by the browser.  In addition to the above two intellectual outcomes, this project has also achieved three outcomes that have broader impact:  (1) The history sniffing study funded under this project led to interest from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and was mentioned in a speech by David Vladeck, Director of the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection. The study was also covered in many media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the BBC, Forbes, and many other web sites. Shortly after the study was published, all browser vendors published fixes to prevent history sniffing.  (2) By developing techniques to make browsers safer to use, this project has provided a safer browsing experience for all users of the web.   (3) This project trained PhD students with the skills required to enter the high-tech workforce of tomorrow, both in the industrial sector and in the academic sector. PhD students funded under this award have graduated and gone on to work at prominent institutions like Google, Apple, University of Washington (as tenure-track professor) and University of Chicago (as tenure-track professor)       Last Modified: 07/16/2015       Submitted by: Sorin Lerner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
