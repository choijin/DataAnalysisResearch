<AbstractNarration>NSF Proposal ECCS-0925716 and ECCS-0925586&lt;br/&gt;Proposal title: "Collaborative Research: High Temperature Acoustic Wave Sensors Based on the Oxyborate Crystals"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0925716, PI: Qing-Ming Wang, qmwang@engr.pitt.edu&lt;br/&gt;University Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ECCS- 0925586, PIs: Shujun Zhang and Thomas R. Shrout&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is the development of acoustic wave sensors based on a high temperature piezoelectric crystal for in situ measurement of temperature, heat-flux, and pressure in severe environments. The increasing demand to enhance the performance and reliability of microsensors, particularly for those operating at high temperatures and harsh environments, results in an urgent need for advanced materials that can outperform silicon. The project includes 1) design, fabrication and characterization of high temperature surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators and thickness shear bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators; 2) high temperature characterization of SAW and BAW sensors; 3) design, fabrication, and characterization of SAW sensors based heat flux sensor, and BAW sensor based pressure sensor; 4) sensor performance and stability study at high temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The current acoustic wave sensors are limited to applications from room temperature to 300oC. This research project aims to develop robust ultrahigh-temperature (~1000oC) acoustic wave sensors for intelligent control of advanced power generation systems. Two types of sensors will be fabricated and tested based on high temperature piezoelectric crystal SAW and BAW resonators with desirable thermal, electrical and electromechanical properties at high temperature and harsh environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Development of sensor system for high temperature and harsh environments has attracted extensive research activities in the past few years but with limited success. The proposed research will advance the sensor technologies for applications in harsh and ultrahigh temperature environments by providing novel high temperature acoustic wave temperature and pressure sensors. The project will provide research and training opportunity to two graduate students and up to three undergraduate students. Emphasis will be given on recruiting minorities and women engineering students. Class lectures will be prepared based on the research activities and results of this project, and included in the existing graduate courses. Hands-on research training opportunities will be developed and provided for some talented high school students each summer through an on-going program at the University of Pittsburgh, the Pitt Engineering Career Access Program (PECAP).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project studied the high temperature electromechanical properties of a novel piezoelectric crystal with chemical formulae of YCa4O(BO3)3, or abbreviated, YCOB. This crystal has superior high temperature properties and is considered as a material candidate for harsh environment sensor technology development.  The complex dielectric permittivity, elastic coefficients, and piezoelectric coefficients as well as the thermo-physical properties have been characterized in a wide temperature range. The nonlinear electromechanical behavior was also investigated. Based on these fundamental studies, bulk acoustic wave and surface acoustic wave sensors, including the prototypes of acoustic wave temperature sensor, heat flux sensor, pressure sensor, flow sensor, and mass sensor have been designed and demonstrated. The results indicate that acoustic wave sensors based on various crystalline cuts of YCOB single crystal are very promising for advanced sensor technology developments to meet the needs of some critical industrial applications, particularly, for accurate monitoring and in-line measurements of operational parameters of power generation systems.  The important outcomes from this project include:  - Surface acoustic wave mass sensor for thermogravimetric analysis: high temperature crystal resonator microbalance makes it possible to detect micro- and even nano- scale mass changes due to chemical reactions or thin film deposition up to 800oC in monitoring industrial processing conditions.  - High temperatures in reaction chambers and gas exhaust in power generation and automotive industries can be read by antenna transmission acoustic resonance using high temperature acoustic wave resonators developed in this project.  - Excellent performance of YCOB resonators have been demonstrated in high vacuum conditions that would lead to sensors for use in aerospace industry.  - The stable high temperature piezoelectric properties of YCOB crystal make it possible to develop accelerometers, vibration sensors, and gyro sensors for high temperature and harsh environment applications.  - The excellent thermal stability, effective electromechanical coupling property and low dielectric loss at high temperatures would lead to novel heat flux sensor development for the diagnoses of combustion systems operations.  - Surface acoustic wave flow sensor is also demonstrated in this project.  - A review paper on High Temperature Piezoelectric Crystals for Acoustic Wave Sensor Applications has been published, which provides the most recent development in the acoustic wave sensor technology for researchers in the scientific community.  - More Broad investigation on the elasto-acoustic properties of ReCa4O(BO3)3 (Re=La, Pr, Nd, Y, Gd) piezoelectric crystals further demonstrate the technological importance of these crystals, which would lead to more active research activities in this area, and some advanced technology development can be expected.  - Pressure sensor based on YCOB crystal at specific cuts would provide technology for oil-gas drilling industry, power generation industry, ad automotive industry.
