<AbstractNarration>0967050&lt;br/&gt;Chun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Carolyn B. Chun to work with Drs. Geoff Whittle and Dillon Mayhew at Victoria University in New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A matroid is a structure that characterizes certain notions of independence in different fields in mathematics.  Matroid theory abstracts these notions from linear algebra and graph theory to yield a more general combinatorial object.  Matroid theory can also be seen as a study of the combinatorial properties of collections of points in space and has deep geometric and topological implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most famous matroid conjecture that has not yet been solved concerns the matroids that can be represented by matrices with entries over a finite field, where a field is a set of numbers where arithmetic behaves as normal.  The conjecture by Gian-Carlo Rota states that there are only finitely many minimal obstructions, known as excluded minors, to the class of matroids that may be represented by matrices with entries in any given finite field.  Rota?s conjecture has been proved only in the cases when the fields have size two, three, or four.  With Geoff Whittle and Dillon Mayhew, Carolyn Chun is making significant advances towards explicitly characterizing the excluded minors for representability over the five-element field.  This work takes place in Wellington, New Zealand at Victoria University, which is widely regarded as one of the world's top centers for matroid research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Graphs Minors Project of Neil Robertson and Paul Seymour is a set of ground-breaking results published as a series of papers beginning in 1983.  This project is widely regarded as the most important work ever done in graph theory, and one of the most beautiful mathematical results of the 20th century.  It highlights the deep connections between graph theory and topology.  My research is in the field of matroid theory.  Matroids generalize linear independence in matrices and a kind of independence that exists in graphs.  Every graph represents a matroid, and every matrix over its field represents a matroid.  Matroids are a more general type of object&mdash;not every matroid is a graph or a matrix.  There is a mutually enriching relationship between matroids and each of these small classes of matroids.  Fundamentally, matroids are comprised of points in space and relationships between these points.  It is a beautifully simple construction, and a very general object that is related to several other well-studied objects.  Besides graph theory and linear algebra, matroid theory is intimately connected with coding theory, geometry, and optimization, to name a few fields.  Graph theory has often led matroid theory in the right direction.  The Graphs Minors Project paved the way for the Matroid Minors Project, which Jim Geelen, Bert Gerards, and Geoff Whittle are working on.  This project has resolved the most important open question in matroid theory, namely RotaÆs Conjecture.  In the Graph Minors Project, Robertson and Seymour showed that, for each topological surface, there is a finite set of "minimal" graphs that cannot be embedded (drawn on the surface without any pair of edges crossing) in that surface. For a given finite field, Gian-Carlo Rota posited that there are a finite number of "minimal" matroids that cannot be represented by matrices over that field.  Although this claim has recently been proved to be true, the work is theoretical, and does not actually identify these "minimal" matroids, which we call "excluded minors."  In 1958, Tutte characterized the class of matroids representable over the two-element field by finding its unique excluded minor.  James Reid announced an excluded-minor characterization of the matroids representable over the three-element field in 1971.  The proof was published independently by Bixby and Seymour.  The proof for the matroids representable over the four-element field was published in 2000, by Geelen, Gerards, and Kapoor.  The fact that many years separate these results indicates their difficulty.  In my project, Geoff Whittle, Dillon Mayhew, Stefan van Zwam and I set our sights on the five-element field.  The important questions in matroid theory increasingly necessitate strong collaboration in order to make real progress.  We knew that the questions that we were interested in were likely to be barely within the scope of possibility.  In order to address our long-term goal of characterizing the excluded minors for representability over the five-element field, we studied a specific class of "fragile" matroids in order to develop techniques that we could generalize to our problem.  A matroid is "fragile" if it is just outside of a class (so excluded minors are fragile), but it does not have to be "minimal."  We learned lots of important techniques by looking at certain classes of fragile matroids.  Ultimately, the difficultly of this fragility problem forced us to study the structure of the matroids that we are interested in, to reduce complexity there, before applying the fragility techniques that we developed.  Our short-term goals shifted in light of these findings.  We had hoped that fragility would impose a condition on the matroids that we were considering, and that this condition would make the matroids be well-behaved.  It is quite evident that the class of fragile matroids that we are interested in considering is not at all well-behaved.  The work has been on-going since the ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
