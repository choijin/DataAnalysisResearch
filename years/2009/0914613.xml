<AbstractNarration>GeoPREP is a multi-track program serving high school students from high-needs school districts on Long Island, underrepresented minority undergraduates at SUNY Stony Brook, and in-service and pre-service Earth science teachers in the region. This Track 2 OEDG project addresses the lack of scholastic follow-up opportunities for students in New York State whose interest in the geosciences has been whetted by 8th or 9th grade Earth Science. It expands on successful program models created during a Track 1 OEDG project. These models include an intensive summer residential geoscience research program for high school students, a series of in-service teacher training workshops to develop new interdisciplinary geoscience curricula, and, through partnership with Brookhaven National Laboratory, webcasts from the National Synchrotron Light Source and further development of the Open Space Stewardship Program. New components include the introduction of an academic-year university laboratory visitation program for high school students that provides for expanded hands-on geoscience learning activities, scholarship support for undergraduates in the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP), and a longitudinal study of attitudes and possible biases regarding the geosciences by underrepresented minority students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
