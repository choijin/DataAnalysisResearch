<AbstractNarration>This study to be conducted under the auspices of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) undertakes a national investigation of Calculus I to identify the factors that contribute to student success, to understand how these factors are leveraged within successful programs and to use the publications, committees, and public fora of the MAA to disseminate the information and help mathematics departments build on its insights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study uses both quantitative and qualitative methods.  During the study's first phase, a large-scale national survey of Calculus I instruction will be conducted through mathematics departments.  The study builds on the Conference Board on the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) studies to link the survey data with student success.  Using the epidemiological model developed by Sadler and Tai, the PIs will examine factors such as instructor attributes, departmental focus, classroom variables, and out of class expectations as likely explanatory factors.  A web-based student survey will also be conducted. Data will be studied through HLM analyses and institutions, course-level characteristics, and student characteristics will all be examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase II of the project will develop a preliminary theoretical framework for institutional models that produce successful calculus students.  This informs the selection of eight cases to be conducted in different kinds of institutions.  The cases will be analyzed using the approaches of pattern matching, explanation building, and cross-case syntheses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is significant because the number of calculus students has been steadily decreasing in spite of the fact that more high school students are taking higher level mathematics courses.  The PIs state that many students leave STEM fields as undergraduates because of poor calculus instruction.  Identifying what works in college calculus instruction and why it works and widely disseminating the information will improve student success in calculus courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of Characteristics of Successful Programs in College Calculus were  To improve our understanding of the demographics of students who enroll in calculus, To measure the impact of the various characteristics of calculus classes that are believed to influence student success, To conduct explanatory case study analysis of exemplary programs in order to identify why and how these programs succeed, To develop a theoretical framework that articulates the factors under which students are likely to succeed in calculus, and To use the results of these studies and the influence of the MAA to leverage improvements in calculus instruction across the United States.    This project undertook a national survey of Calculus I instruction at 213 colleges and universities with responses from over 14,000 students to improve our understanding of the demographics of students who enroll in calculus and to identify the factors that most influence student self-confidence, enjoyment of mathematics, and intention to continue the study of mathematics. This was followed by multi-day case study visits to 20 colleges and universities with interesting and, in most cases, successful calculus programs. We found that mainstream Calculus I as currently taught at most of our colleges and universities decreases student desire to continue the study of mathematics, decreases their enjoyment of mathematics, and strongly decreases self-confidence in their mathematical abilities. We found that, as a result of this course, approximately 15% of the students who entered with the intention of pursuing the study of mathematics beyond Calculus I had changed their mind by the end of the course. This was particularly true of women, who were found to be 50% more likely than men to make this change of intention.  A summary of the lessons learned from this study and the factors found to promote student success has been published by the Mathematical Association of America as Insights and Recommendations from the MAA National Study of College Calculus. Among the insights gained from this study are recognition of the importance of and identification of best practices in:  Proper placement procedures, Use of local data to monitor program effectiveness, Support for active learning, Coordination of courses, Regular meetings of course instructors, Solid training of graduate teaching assistant, Strong student support service, and Rigorous courses.   The results of this project have been disseminated through many research papers and reports, dozens of presentations, and through two national conferences that brought the results of this study to department chairs and undergraduate coordinators, helping them to understand how the findings from this project could be used to improve the undergraduate mathematics program at their institutions.  Links to research articles that came out of this project and further information about the study itself and its findings can be found on the project website: maa.org/cspcc.
