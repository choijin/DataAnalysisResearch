<AbstractNarration>Almost all of the visible mass that we see in the universe is contained in the atomic nucleus.  It is of vital importance to gain experimental data about how nuclei are constructed to explain the early history of the universe, the abundances of the chemical elements in our solar system and even the distribution of these elements in our galaxy.  An excellent nucleus to study for this purpose is the common isotope of helium, He-4.  This nucleus will be a subject of study at Jefferson Lab by measuring the probability of knocking out protons with different energies using the high-energy electron beam.  Another method of gaining insight into how nuclei are constructed is by placing short lived particles called hyperons in nuclei and observing the energy levels of these hypernuclei.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These experiments will provide vital training for graduate students and undergraduate students in nuclear and particle physics.  The activities of these students will include helping set up the experiments, making the experimental measurements, analyzing the data and learning sophisticated simulation techniques.  There is a desperate need for well trained physicists in the near future.  The training the students receive has been shown to be transferable to other fields besides physics that benefit from the keen analytical skills they learn.</AbstractNarration>

This state of affairs is rather distressing since protons and neutrons are the two principal components of the nucleus at low energies. The proton distribution has been accurately mapped out over many years thanks to the electromagnetic interaction which couples the beam electrons to the charged protons. With the advent of high quality electron beams at Jefferson Lab it is now possible to exploit the preferential coupling of the Z0 boson to the neutrons in the nucleus.

The best nucleus to test the theories is 208Pb where the shell model is the most applicable. Along with our Jefferson Lab collaborators we assisted in the first measurement of the neutron distribution in an atomic nucleus using the  Z0 boson as a probe. The frontiers of Physics must be probed to find where our current understanding of nature fails. The scattering of electrons from electrons, as planned by the precision M&oslash;ller experiment, will extend our knowledge of fundamental physics to an energy comparable to 47 TeV and test for electron substructure to a level of about 10-21 m, approximately ten times smaller than the current limit for electron substructure.

One background event comes from the creation of hyperons which decay in a manner dependent on the spin state of the electron. For this experiment we created the necessary software to be used in a computer simulation to estimate the size of this contamination. We completed a measurement of the nuclear reaction 4He + e &rarr; e + p +3H at high momentum transfer. 4He is an important nucleus and fundamental to our understanding of nuclear structure. 25% of the visible mass of the universe is contained in helium. We are able to compare our experimental cross sections for this reaction with theoretical models of nuclear structure. An example of the experimental results and a theoretical relativistic dynamics calculations is shown in the figure.Broader Impacts Many students from California State University, Los Angeles both at the graduate and undergraduate levels were significant contributors to these results. The graduate student whose MS thesis is based on the 4He experiment(E08009) came to the Physics and Astronomy Department with an undergraduate degree in sociology and transitioned to an MS degree in physics. She is now seeking a teaching credential. Her broaden experience will be an important asset to her students.  Another graduate student was interested in medical applications of nuclear physics. He developed a Monte Carlo simulation to generate low energy neutrons from proton accelerators found at hospitals. The aim is to have a ready supply of neutrons for neutron capture therapy for cancer treatments. The present practice of Boron Neutron Capture therapy requires moving the patient to nuclear reactors. Some results from his analysis are shown in the figures for the 50 MeV and 200 MeV simulations he made.  Our research group included two students who were dual majors in physics and mechanical engineering. Both these students gained valuable transferable training at Jefferson Lab which they can exploit when they enter the work force or continue into graduate school.  One of our students graduated and went on to the PhD physics ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
