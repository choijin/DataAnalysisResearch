<AbstractNarration>A Cyber-infrastructure and Communication-Based Model to Foster Innovation that Broadens Participation in STEM Fields through Institutional Integration brings together NSF/EHR awards from the ADVANCE, AGEP, CCLI, GK-12, LSAMP, REU, and S-STEM programs, as well as other work, around the I3 integrative theme(s) of broadening participation and the integration of research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Cyber-infrastructure and Communication-Based Model to Foster Innovation that Broadens Participation in STEM Fields through Institutional Integration will transcend departmental silos and hierarchical administrative structures to transform the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) into an institution in which faculty are committed to sharing resources, collaboration is supported through recognition and rewards, and effective practices emanating from NSF-funded awards at UTEP focused on broadening participation are extended across the university. The discussions among diverse faculty members and administrators facilitated by the model are expected to stimulate innovation in preparation of students for undergraduate and graduate education in STEM areas and result in proactive strategies that provide effective avenues for sustainability.  The unique mechanisms for obtaining this institutional collaborative culture are the development of the Cyber-Infrastructure (CI) and communication structures (Provost-led STEM Council and Special Interest Groups) that can drive innovation and extend and sustain the impact of efficacious broadening participation initiatives.  In the context of this proposal, CI refers to the technical infrastructure, organizational practices, and social interactions that support data and resource sharing, as well as efforts that cross boundaries within or outside the organization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anchor for this I3 project is the NSF CREST-funded Cyber-ShARE Center, which has expertise in CI and cross-disciplinary collaborations. The Cyber-ShARE Center (using Cyber-Infrastructure to Share resources to Advance Research and Education) brings the experiences and base to serve as the foundation for this effort, which will integrate its work and initially that of projects that have demonstrated effectiveness in broadening participation at all levels of the academic continuum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CI will be developed to support the project in the following ways: 1) semantically annotated websites; 2) accessible databases that can be used to inform faculty, staff, and administrators on matters relevant to research projects and data relevant to broadening participation; 3) Web portal that supports networking, collaborations, and shared activities centered on Special Interest Groups (SIGs) on broadening participation; and 4) intra-campus communications facilitated by the Provost-Led STEM (ProSTEM) Council.  Initially, NSF-funded projects contribute data to the CI and other UTEP faculty members make use of this information in developing their own future endeavors.  Over time, information from efforts funded by sources other than NSF provide information to the CI as collaboration among faculty and administrators becomes the new norm in this culture of collaboration.  This institutional transformation involves defining practices, procedures, and policies on campus that support linkages among projects, cross-fertilization of practices, and identification of new research directions.  By engaging faculty across disciplines, projects benefit from discussions that analyze common threads from multiple perspectives. The CI will improve the efficacy of the University's programmatic and evaluation frameworks for monitoring activities and measuring student progress. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I3 endeavor allows UTEP to take a more proactive approach to creating a culture of collaboration by establishing the CI and communication structures to enable the study and understanding of professional organizational relationships. The integration of STEM interests at UTEP provides value-added in a minimum of three organizational CI domains.   It is expected that: 1) the number and extent of reciprocal relationships among STEM interest groups will be much larger than the number and extent of non-reciprocal relationships (degree of hierarchy); 2) the lateral, peer-to-peer networks will see heavy interaction and activity, indicating dispersed global activity rather than activity with a few focal points in the local community (degree of centralization); and 3) there will be fewer hierarchical levels for access to problem solutions, and information for solving problems, than a traditional STEM educational and research enterprise structure (hierarchical levels in the emergent portal).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Innovation through Institutional Integration (I3) project, A Cyberinfrastructure and Communication-Based Model to Foster Innovation that Broadens Participation in STEM Fields through Institutional Integration, has been instrumental in providing a strong, sustainable foundation to advance interdisciplinary research and education at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).  Through the grant and other leveraged funding, UTEP has developed the cyberinfrastructure, facilities, human infrastructure, and administrative support that has stimulated interdisciplinary research and education, increased research productivity, and accelerate efforts at the university to promote high impact practices centered on student success.  A significant outcome of the I3 project was the launch of the Expertise Connector (EC) online tool (http://expertise.utep.edu) that allows people to discover expertise, research centers, and interests on campus.  EC publishes individual profiles, research center profiles, university research stories, and communities of practice (CoPs).  CoPs allow a group of researchers with various levels of expertise to organize around a particular topic, share information about their related efforts, and the resources that they have. Through face-to-face meetings, members of the Global Reach CoP, for example, share experiences on establishing partnerships with foreign institutions and act on reform of institutional practices that are barriers to student global experiences. The CoP portal allows people to discover others with similar interests.  Another NSF-project in collaboration with the I3 project provided the seed funding to collaborate with Virginia Tech to develop the Accelerating, Connecting, and Evaluating Student Success (ACCESS) Tool, a student-success information management system. The tool supports:  registration of student success initiatives and activities on campus; discovery of student-success initiatives and activities; sharing of evaluation instruments and results; and impact analysis of an activity or collection of disparate activities on student success.  The ACCESS Tool was launched in fall 2017.  Through the I3 project, UTEP has created a culture shift through strategic programming aimed at spurring dialogue and building interdisciplinary research and education connections. Over the last five years, internal mechanisms have funded teams and individuals to start, formalize, or expand interdisciplinary projects. Examples include the UTEP Annual Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) Symposium, Engagement Encounters, and special events. The mainstay has been the Interdisciplinary Research Enhancement (IDRE) program.  Since 2012, this program has granted thirty-two awards to teams and individuals through a competitive process in seven rounds of funding.  A total of $1,722,906 in external funding was secured by teams funded through the IDRE program in the first two years of the program.  Over the period of the I3 grant, there was a 31% increase in the number of interdisciplinary grants and an increase of 41.6% in the total awards portfolio.  On the other hand, the total award amounts of interdisciplinary grants ($112 M in 2016) increased by 167%.    In 2016 with UT System funding secured by co-I Gates, the university established the Collaboration Hub, a work space to advance interdisciplinary collaborative projects.  In addition, the university broke ground in 2017 for the new Interdisciplinary Research Building, the first building to be solely dedicated to interdisciplinary research on the UTEP campus.      Through I3 and related projects, UTEP has implemented approaches to interdisciplinary research and strategies for promoting student success that have led to outcomes in the growth of interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty with impact on student professional development and opportunities (e.g., competitions, recognitions, new courses).  An example of success is the increased number of successful applications by students to major fellowship competitions, such as the NSF GRFP.  UTEP continues to see impacts of its efforts to promote success in broadening participation that was started by the I3 project.  The campus has seen growth in enrollment and degrees awarded at the baccalaureate and doctoral levels in the College of Engineering and the College of Science.  While these increases cannot be attributed to I3 alone, the project?s evaluation documented the evidence of a shift in perspectives of faculty and staff since the beginning of the project on awareness, understanding, and use of strategies that directly impact students (e.g., mentoring, research, and workshop opportunities). UTEP?s I3 project was recognized for its accomplishments by the NSF I3 evaluation team led by Frechtling, Merlino, and Stephenson.  Many I3 efforts are being sustained through the Office of Research and Sponsored Projects, the Graduate School, and UTEP?s Edge initiative that was formally launched across campus in 2017 to promote and support student success efforts and activities using an asset-based approach. The university has also institutionalized three professional staff positions that support the efforts started by the I3 project.
