<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this program is to demonstrate new nanoscale photodetectors with high sensitivity and bandwidth for nanophotonic integrated circuits. The approach exploits self-assembly or solution-process of nanocrystal quantum dots in nanogap electrodes to achieve high fabrication integratability with varieties of nanophotonic components. Incorporation of plasmonic effects and new fabrication processes to reduce tunneling barriers are explored to enhance sensitivity and bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This research will demonstrate new design and fabrication of nanoscale quantum dot photodetectors that can be readily incorporated into nanophotonic device integration. The device structure utilizes concentrated high electric field for enhanced efficiency and charge transport. The research on optimizing chemistry and conditions for quantum dot deposition will offer a route to increased speed, a major challenge for quantum dot devices. The utility of plasmonics to concentrate optical field and enhance quantum efficiency will help addressing the prevailing question of optical coupling in nanophotonics.  If successful, the research will provide a first solution to fully integratable nanophotonic photodetection. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The growing field of Nanophotonics has increased the demand for faster, smaller, and more sensitive on-chip photodetection. Given the divergence in materials and fabrication processes in nanophotonics, a nanoscale photodetector with full fabrication integratability has yet to be demonstrated. Success of this research could have a transformative impact in nanophotonic integrated circuits and broader fields of optical computing, communications and sensing. This research will also provide exciting multidisciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and lead to broader impact to the society through diversity development, education and outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
