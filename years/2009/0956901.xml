<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research team will study plasma physics processes occuring in the solar corona, and the investigators are motivated by the fact that the  corona provides physical regimes which are inaccessible to laboratory experiments. The researchers will concentrate on making remote sensing measurements of the corona and inner solar wind using the Very Large Array (VLA) radiotelescope, as well as its upgrades (collectively called the Expanded Very Large Array, or EVLA), and interpreting those observations in terms of coronal plasma physics. The team's primary observational technique will be the measurement of Faraday Rotation of background radio sources that are occulted by the solar corona. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will make Faraday Rotation measurements using the EVLA that will be deeper in the corona than previously obtained, at altitudes of 2 to 5 solar radii. This approach will yield information on the properties of the coronal magnetic field and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in this inner region. The team will then use MHD models of the corona to create synthetic Faraday Rotation measures for the same line-of-sight paths measured with the VLA and EVLA, in order to compare results and test of the accuracy of their models against actual observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lead Principal Investigator (PI) in Iowa will mentor University of Iowa undergraduate and graduate students participating in this project, and the Co-PI in Boston will offer research experiences for these students at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The lead PI will also engage in public outreach through the Eastern Iowa Observatory and Learning Center (EIOLC) and collaborations with amateur astronomy groups, particularly the Cedar Amateur Astronomers of Cedar Rapids and the Astronomy Club of the Quad Cities, both in Iowa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this research program was to better understand the Sun's outer atmosphere, which we call the corona.  The only time the corona is visible to a casual astronomer is during a total eclipse of the Sun, but it can be seen anytime with images of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft.  There are many things we don't understand about the corona, and would like to know.  Probably the principal question is why it is so hot.  The disk of the Sun that we see has a temperature of about 10000 degrees Fahrenheit.  That is very hot by terrestrial standards, but the corona is between 2 and 4 million degrees Fahrenheit.   This heating occurs in a very narrow range in the solar atmosphere, over a distance of a couple of thousand miles.  Although we do not understand in detail how this happens, most scientists think that the solar magnetic field is the principal player.  The Sun has figured out a way of converting magnetic energy into heat energy of the outer atmosphere.   To evaluate the theories that posit conversion from magnetic energy to heat energy, we need measurements of the nature of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere.  We need to know its strength and how it changes strength and direction in the solar atmosphere.  Obviously, we cannot make direct measurements like we can in the Earth's atmosphere.  The research program just finished emphasized a technique for measuring the coronal magnetic field called Faraday rotation. When radio waves pass through a hot gas with a magnetic field, the polarization of the radio waves is changed.  If we measure this change in polarization, we can infer properties of the magnetic field in the gas, even though we have never made any direct measurements.  This is the activity in which effort was concentrated during the prior grant period.   The way the measurement was carried out was very neat.  The sources of polarized radio waves are extragalactic radio sources.  These are very distant galaxies, and objects called quasars that emit polarized radio waves.  We would observe several of these when the Sun was close to them on the sky, so a line from the radio source to Earth passed through the corona.  The receiver of the radio waves was also impressive in its own right.  It was the Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope in New Mexico.  The VLA was upgraded in the last 5 years or so.   It always has been an excellent instrument for measuring Faraday rotation, but is now even better (to a large extent).   The results of our Faraday rotation observations were very successful, and we obtained new insights into the coronal magnetic field.  As just one example, in one of our studies we made a comparison between our measurements of Faraday rotation, and a realistic, state-of-the-art computer model of the corona.  The agreement between observations and model was really remarkably good, even if not perfect.  The agreement was important because it tends to corroborate these models.  That is important, because these models are used to predict the effect of the Sun on Earth.  The differences between the models and observations are interesting because they show that we still have much to learn.   In addition to the scientific results, this project also helped in the training of young people in science and technology.  A total of 5 University of Iowa students, 2 Ph.D. students and 3 undergraduate students, worked on this research project.  One of the Ph.D. students is carrying out his Ph.D. thesis in the area covered by this grant.  The undergraduates got a chance to be involved in real research, and be listed as coauthors of articles in scientific journals.
