<AbstractNarration>One of the most compelling indications for new physics beyond the Standard Model is the apparent existence of dark matter. Unfortunately, however, very little is known about the nature of dark matter.  One important way of possibly detecting dark matter is through neutrino signals coming from the Sun and the Earth.  However, it was recently pointed out by the PI and collaborators that the presence of non-trivial structure in the distribution of dark matter can result in elevated neutrino signals.  In this project, Professor Koushiappas aims to establish a research program that will more fully assess the implications of granularity of the phase space distribution function of dark matter on the energetic neutrino signal from the Sun and the Earth. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to determine how structure in the distribution of dark matter and its velocity acts on the expected neutrino signal.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have several broader impacts. Beyond the intellectual aspects of increasing our understanding of dark matter, the graduate student participating in this research will acquire unique skills and a breadth of experience that will prepare her/him well for a future research career. The products of this research will also be incorporated into the regular outreach activities at Brown University and Ladd Observatory.</AbstractNarration>
