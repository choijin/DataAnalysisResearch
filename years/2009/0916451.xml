<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to turn existing wireless mesh networks (WMNs) into productive and reliable computing platforms, made possible innovatively by reliability enhancement via adaptive checkpointing (REACT) to yield wireless Grids (WiGs).  WiGs can expand immensely the wired Grid in support of rapidly growing cloud applications, besides serving as their original role of ubiquitous communications.  It is extremely challenging and yet interesting to realize effective checkpointing in WiGs, due to their unique characteristics.  This REACT project deals with three technical challenges, which together constitute the basis of our Checkpoint Manager, able to render WMNs into productive WiGs for enhancing and complementing wired Grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project holds great promise to advance technical understanding and scientific frontiers of effective checkpointing in WiGs.  It will also improve the research and educational activities on Grid computing and wireless systems strongly in the University of Louisiana, with the testbed established under this project deemed a valuable asset. New research findings and technologies for effective checkpointing and wireless communication performance enhancement will be incorporated into relevant courses, helping to integrate research and education for enriched teaching, training, and learning experience and to educate quality future scientists critical to the NSF mission.  Underrepresented students will be recruited aggressively to participate in this project, taking advantage of the established REACT testbed and working collaboratively with funded graduate research assistants to stimulate their research interest.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research deals with reliability enhancement via adaptive checkpointing (REACT), investigating into various approaches to effective reliability enhancement for wireless Grids and for networked multi-core systems (including Cloud service providers under the least expensive pricing with no resource guarantee).  Given globally optimum checkpointing arrangement in wireless mobile Grids is NP-complete, REACT follows efficient checkpointing arrangement developed for highly successful recovery probabilities when each wireless mobile host sends its checkpointed file to, and receives the checkpointed file from, exactly one neighboring node.  Such a heuristic arrangement outperforms significantly random checkpointing arrangement.  In addition, REACT has developed and evaluated adaptive incremental checkpointing (AIC) for networked multi-core systems, with checkpointing overhead reduced and thereby the expected job turnaround time shortened.  AIC has been implemented in BLCR (Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart) to validate its effectiveness on job execution speedups and on checkpointing overhead reduction.  It is shown using a testbed to achieve substantial reduction in the expected job turnaround time (by up to 41%) and to yield dramatic shrinkage in the aggregate file size (by up to 1,000x), when compared with its recent multi-level checkpointing counterpart reported.  REACT can also benefit Cloud users in executing their multithreaded applications under relatively inexpensive services (like spot instance pricing offered by Amazon) where resource availability is not guaranteed, subject to spot instance (SI) revocation.  With enhanced AIC which determines the most appropriate checkpointing times during application runs in the Cloud systems by taking both hardware failures and SI revocation events into account, REACT is shown to lower the application turnaround time and thus the monetary cost markedly (by some 58%), attaining nearly the best possible cost reduction.     INTELLECTURAL MERIT  This project has arrived at multi-fold intellectural merit on checkpointing in both wireless networked computer systems and wired networked computer systems.  It develops and evaluates innovative solutions for checkpointing with the objectives of either maximizing fault recovery, minimizing overhead under multi-level checkpointing, or lowering the monetary cost as much as possible using Cloud services.  Specifically, the project has demonstrated the following solution approaches:  an efficient heuristic checkpointing arrangement in mobile Grids for highly successful recovery, adaptive incremental checkpointing (AIC) for networked multi-core computer systems, with checkpointing overhead minimized while substantially reducing job turnaround times enhanced AIC for application execution in Cloud systems under spot instance pricing, able to lower the Cloud resource leasing cost by up to 58% (close to the best possible cost lower bound).       BROADER IMPACTS  Besides deriving technical innovations, this project has made broader impacts in education and human resource development.  The two simulation tools developed respectively for evaluating mobile Grids and for assessing AIC in networked multi-core systems are available for students in computer architecture and mobile computing classes to help conduct their course term projects on related topics.  The testbed for multi-level checkpointing evaluation in networked computer systems can be easily adopted by students in an aid to their term projects and research pursuit.  A few undergraduate students have been recruited to  participate in different research activities in the course of this project, engaging them in research during their sophomore and junior years.  Two research assistants for this project have graduated with solid and broad technical knowledge and skill sets, embarking on successful careers in academia (as an tenure-track assistant professor) and in industry (as a software system engineer)....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
