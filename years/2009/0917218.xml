<AbstractNarration>Computer systems are commonly coupled with human operators who add&lt;br/&gt;hands, eyes, and judgment to the computer programming and its sensors&lt;br/&gt;and actuators.  The operators can be viewed as programming platforms&lt;br/&gt;in their own right, where manuals, training, and system feedback&lt;br/&gt;provide the programming.  However, operators have unique platform&lt;br/&gt;characteristics compared to computers, including, in particular, the&lt;br/&gt;likelihood of making numerous and diverse errors. Hence systems that&lt;br/&gt;rely on operators require a protection envelope representing an&lt;br/&gt;engineered collection of system behaviors that prevent important types&lt;br/&gt;of operator errors from leading to losses.  Having a well chosen&lt;br/&gt;protection envelope is crucial to the robustness of a system that&lt;br/&gt;relies on human operators. This project formalizes operator task&lt;br/&gt;analysis based on models, languages, and techniques created for the&lt;br/&gt;formal analysis of concurrent processes and use this formalization to&lt;br/&gt;specify and automatically prove properties of the protection envelopes&lt;br/&gt;of systems that rely on human operators for their safe and secure&lt;br/&gt;execution in specified environments.  The project uses concurrent game&lt;br/&gt;structures to provide a technical foundation for reasoning about&lt;br/&gt;protection envelopes specified using alternating-time temporal logic.&lt;br/&gt;Progress is validated with case studies for airport screening and&lt;br/&gt;veterinary tagging protocols.  Interest in this type of contribution&lt;br/&gt;will extend beyond specialized areas like jet pilots and nuclear plant&lt;br/&gt;operators to roles like: customers in ecommerce transactions or&lt;br/&gt;automated retail checkouts, drivers in automobiles with new types of&lt;br/&gt;computer control, managers of smart warehouses, factory floors, and&lt;br/&gt;office buildings, and first responders in emergencies.</AbstractNarration>
