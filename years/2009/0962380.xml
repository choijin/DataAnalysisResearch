<AbstractNarration>PI: Barrett, Steven F.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0962380&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the University of Wyoming, College of Engineering and Applied Science (CE&amp;AS) engineering curriculum, students are required to complete a meaningful undergraduate design experience. On the other hand, there are over 73,000 individuals with disabilities in the state of Wyoming with diverse needs. This program will provide a vital link between the University's talented students and individuals with assistive technology (AT) needs. Students will create and provide prototype, custom designed assistive devices which will enhance the quality of life for the individual. Also, this program will educate new design engineers on the special needs of community members with disabilities. Furthermore, we believe this program will continue to attract additional female engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;We will launch the following new initiatives in the next increment of the program:&lt;br/&gt;- Establish a review panel of assistive technology professionals, engineers, and project users to insure project meets the user?s needs. The panel will meet several times during project development.&lt;br/&gt;-Expand the project base regionally to include project requests from adjoining states.&lt;br/&gt;- Assess engineering students grasp of concepts after the AT instructional module.&lt;br/&gt;- Provide a web-based project submission site to ease the project request process.&lt;br/&gt;- Advertise program via websites, WIND publications, and presentations to appropriate groups.&lt;br/&gt;- Expand project technologies to enhance recipients' independence (e.g. personal area networks, web-based safety monitoring, autonomous wheelchairs, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;- Develop measurable set of program metrics to assess program success annually.&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish program objectives the College of Engineering and Applied Science has partnered with the Wyoming INstitute for Disabilities (WIND). The PI Dr. Steven Barrett, Ph.D., P.E. will serve as the coordinator for the College of Engineering and Applied Science to identify the appropriate student expertise to accomplish a specific project. WIND has been a part of the University of Wyoming (UW), College of Health Sciences since 1994. As a member of the national network of University Centers of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research and Service (UCEDD), WIND provides teaching, research, information, and community services to both the University and Wyoming at large.  WIND Associate Director, Sandy Root-Elledge, M.A., will serve to identify specific AT projects for undergraduate engineering students to design, build, test, and deliver to individuals with disabilities as well as provide assistive technology and disability awareness training to all engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity:&lt;br/&gt;- The proposed activities will allow the continued construction of projects for individuals with disabilities in the area of developmental disabilities through the Research to Aid Persons with Disabilities (RAPD) program at the NSF. This project has a dramatic need throughout the state and the region.&lt;br/&gt;- These projects will allow students to complete the required two-semester senior design project in an interdisciplinary team approach. The team includes mechanical and electrical engineering students, assistive technology professionals, caregivers, and the intended users and family members where appropriate. This is highly encouraged by the ABET, Inc. accreditation body.&lt;br/&gt;- The proposed projects will educate new engineers on the special needs of community members with disabilities early in their careers including those not participating in the NSF sponsored projects.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity:&lt;br/&gt;- The proposed design projects should contribute to the quality of life for disabled individuals. Special emphasis will be placed on independent living technologies.&lt;br/&gt;- Encourage students toward graduate school and employment in AT related fields.&lt;br/&gt;- Encourage more participation by under-represented student groups (e.g. women in engineering).&lt;br/&gt;- Provide engineering students with awareness about disabilities and assistive technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[PI: Steven F. Barrett, Ph.D., P.E.,  University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82070 e-mail: steveb@uwyo.edu     The purpose of this program is to provide a meaningful design experience for students that will directly aid individuals with disabilities.    Objectives  Provide students multi-disciplinary, meaningful, community service design projects. Provide persons with disabilities assistive devices to empower them to achieve maximum individual growth, development and independence to afford them the opportunity to participate in all aspects of life as they choose. Provide engineering students education and awareness on the special needs and challenges of persons with disabilities.   AY14/15  Collaboration with Imagine! Smart Home continued (https://www.imaginecolorado.org/smarthomes).  A design project want list is updated annually.   An Imagine! Smart Home project, "Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arm," was completed in May 2014.  Team members improved the design and delivered the project July 15, 2015.  Student co-authors reported on project progress at the 51st and 52nd Rocky Mountain Bioengineering Symposium Conferences. Student design team completed, "Wrist/Arm Support to Assist in Fine Motor Control for Essential Tremor Patients," that was delivered May 2014.  Other sponsored projects completed:    A team completed a microcontroller-based "Penmanship Trainer."  The project provides automated "coaching" on improving one?s penmanship.   A team of five students developed an entry controlled lunchbox for a client with cerebral palsy.  As described by the design team:  "Due to an inability to properly gauge spans of time, the client has run into issues at work by eating meals at inappropriate times.  The design team developed a good first prototype of the project.  In consisted of a "timed, locked lunchbox to prevent the client from eating meals at inappropriate times, help him acquire relative time scales, and house an appropriate amount of food throughout the day."    A student developed a "Painting Robotic Arm."   As described by the student: "The Artistic Robotic Arm is a project that was conceived for the use of persons that do not have the cognitive function or ability to grip artistic utensils such as a paint brush. This project is designed to make the issues of gripping artistic utensils a non-factor. The idea of the Artistic Robotic Arm is to allow for cognitively inhibited persons to participate in art class. By taking a robotic arm, such as the OWI Robotic Arm Edge [www.owirobots.com], and modifying the controller, an arm can be created that will allow for the gripping of utensils such as a paint brush."  The student completed a first prototype.  He is now refining the design based on lessons learned. Another student developed an "Automatic Dispensing Pill Box."   As described by the student, "This product has been designed to change the way medication is delivered to the consumer within their own homes. Through its simple yet effective design, the pill box will have the ability to dispense multiple medications, of different sizes, to the consumer at various times during the day. This pill box will consistently help the user by ensuring they are always taking their medication. When the medication is dispensed, it will be delivered into a tray where the consumer can easily retrieve them. If the medication is not retrieved from the tray, where an electronic weight sensor is present, after a set amount of time, an alarm will sound to notify the user that their medication is waiting for them. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) will be used as a notification to the user when a certain medication needs to be refilled. By integrating a keypad and a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) into the design, the consumer will have full control on when and how they want their medication dispensed."  A first prototype of the project has been completed.     AY15/16  The PI mentored an independent study for a ME senior student to explore low cost assistive artificial hands [http://makezine.com/magazine/make-43/how-made-my-250-robotic-arm/] for use by a recovering stroke patient.  The student made considerable progress on the project.  Results will be presented at the upcoming Rocky Mountain Bioengineering Symposium in April 2017, Denver, CO&gt; Another "Life is a Switch" workshop was conducted for 16 graduate students at the University of Wyoming in July 2016. A team of mechanical engineering students designed and fabricated a trailer with a lift to assist hunters with disabilities.  The trailer is awaiting delivery.
