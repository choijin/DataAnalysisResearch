<AbstractNarration>The collaborative team develops and implements computationally of a Bayesian&lt;br/&gt;formulation of syndromic surveillance targeted at early detection of disease&lt;br/&gt;outbreaks. The research spans statistical theory and methodology, as well as&lt;br/&gt;issues of algorithms and computational science. Conditional autoregressive&lt;br/&gt;models, or CAR models, form the basis of the formulation, in order to&lt;br/&gt;accommodate spatial as well as temporal effects. The principal challenges are&lt;br/&gt;scalability (7,500 major U.S. hospitals are linked into the reporting&lt;br/&gt;network), multivariate reports, complex dependence structure in the data, low&lt;br/&gt;data quality, and incorporation of regional and other covariates. The unifying&lt;br/&gt;theme is principled calculation of uncertainties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is framed by an application of national significance. There is&lt;br/&gt;enormous social and economic benefit from early discovery of disease. The&lt;br/&gt;stakes are immense: the US Office of Technology Assessment estimates that a&lt;br/&gt;release of 100 KG of anthrax spores upwind of Washington, DC would, if not&lt;br/&gt;detected rapidly, lead to as many as three million deaths and a trillion&lt;br/&gt;dollars of economic losses. The research produces actionable, easily&lt;br/&gt;interpretable information that supports decision makers: a clear statement of&lt;br/&gt;the probability that a particular disease is present somewhere in the US, or&lt;br/&gt;present in a particular city, together with the associated uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;False alarm rates are controlled, making them commensurate with resources&lt;br/&gt;available for post-signal investigation and taking into account&lt;br/&gt;consequences such as the psychological and financial impacts of a false alarm.</AbstractNarration>
