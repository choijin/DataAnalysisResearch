<AbstractNarration>Compact object binaries, consisting of neutron stars and black holes, represent one of the most likely sources of gravitational waves to be detected by LIGO and future gravitational wave observatories.  This project will design computer models to study gravitational radiation from compact object binaries.  This will include studying how the internal structure of neutron stars affects the gravitational radiation emitted in a binary merger.  Additional work will investigate opportunities for multiple messenger astronomy, in which data from several types of observations are combined to obtain a more complete picture.  In particular, this project will study possible emission of electromagnetic radiation and neutrinos from the merger of neutron stars and black holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is of broad interest reaching beyond physicists to astrophysicists, mathematicians, and the general public (for whom movies will be posted to the web).  The connection of gravitational, electromagnetic and neutrino data from black hole and neutron star mergers will significantly advance our understanding of some of the most intriguing processes in the universe.  This work will provide valuable candidate waveforms for gravitational wave observatories, including LIGO.  As part of a multinational effort to compare such waveforms, this work will be especially valuable to the gravitational wave community in their efforts to detect this radiation.  Information that comes from these gravitational waves will lead to a better understanding of the internal structure of neutron stars and matter at nuclear densities.  The activities described here will provide educational and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from underrepresented groups.  This work uses the HAD computational infrastructure, and thus supports this broadly useful, publicly available software for scientific computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Black holes and neutron stars are very compact celestial objects and when they occur in binary systems, represent a very likely observable source of gravitational waves by LIGO, a NSF-sponsored observatory. We study the mergers of compact objects numerically, computing the expected gravitational wave signature both to help detect any potential signals among lots of noise and also to help extract the scientific understanding of what is being observed. To that latter end, detecting signals in other bands (such as electromagnetic or neutrino bands) provides an exciting possibility of a huge scientific payoff from the combined information in what is called multi-messenger astronomy.  In this project, we made significant process in modeling the merger of compact objects in realistic, magnetized environments and studied possible electromagnetic signals. We found the merger of two supermassive black holes within an ambient magnetic field (as might be produced by a circumbinary disk) would produce electromagnetic radiation via a generalized from of the Blandford-Znajek effect, which was found for isolated, spinning black holes in 1977. We modeled the merger of a magnetized neutron star with a black hole, studying how much matter became unbound in the merger. This study helps shed light on the possibility of such a mixed binary driving a short gamma ray burst. We developed a scheme in which we could study the merger of magnetized neutron stars with a surrounding magnetosphere. This scheme required the development of a resistive MHD scheme which allowed for an appropriate merger of two different physical regimes: the ideal MHD inside the stars and the force-free environment outside them. With this scheme, we study the time-dependence and strength of the resulting electromagnetic radiation that might accompany the merger of magnetized neutron stars.  We also took the first steps towards adding neutrino effects by implementing a neutrino leakage scheme to complement our code. In so doing, we can now model both the electromagnetic and neutrino effects in mergers with realistic equations of state.
