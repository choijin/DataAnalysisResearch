<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of dye-sensitized solar cells represents one of the most exciting new areas of solar energy science. Composed of light-absorbing molecules coupled to an inexpensive semiconductor, these devices offer the promise of high efficiency at low cost relative to more conventional alternatives such as silicon. However, dye-sensitized solar cells have yet to realize their perceived potential, due in part to the myriad of chemical and physical processes that must be optimized. In addition, it is widely viewed that such a device must ultimately come in the form of a solid-state material in order to enhance the longevity of the device itself while at the same time lowering the cost of manufacture. In order to address the many challenges this problem presents, this research project combines the efforts of scientists with expertise in chemistry, materials science, and mathematics, with the goal of developing efficient, solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. The program is based on a synergistic collaboration in which mathematical modeling will be coupled with the synthesis and characterization of novel polymer-based substrates for ion conduction, a key aspect of photovoltaic conversion in the solid state. Solar cells will be created based on these new materials and examined by a variety of methods in order to characterize their optoelectric properties; this information will then provide the feedback necessary to continue fine-tuning the solar cell in terms of both its performance and ease of fabrication. These efforts will result in the development of a new class of photovoltaics that will achieve high efficiency at low cost for use in solar electricity applications or in the creation of devices for the synthesis of solar fuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warming of the Earth?s climate has dramatically heightened interest in the development of carbon-neutral sources of energy. Although all options for renewable energy -- solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, nuclear, and biomass -- can be part of an overall energy strategy, solar energy is the only source with total power sufficient to meet global energy needs. A central problem with solar energy remains one of economics: in the area of electricity production, for example, solar power is presently about ten times more expensive than power from fossil-fuel sources such as coal. Cost reductions in solar energy derived from current technologies will no doubt continue as their production becomes more widespread, but truly significant breakthroughs in solar energy conversion schemes will require new science that has yet to be discovered. This project -- the development of a high-efficiency, solid-state photovoltaic cells based on inexpensive materials -- is an example of the kind of basic research that promises to lead to new solar energy technologies.</AbstractNarration>
