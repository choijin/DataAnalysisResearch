<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to enable operation of synthetic and&lt;br/&gt;cyborg insects in complicated environments, such as outdoors or in a&lt;br/&gt;collapsed building.  As the mobile platforms and environment have&lt;br/&gt;significant uncertainty, learning and adaptation capabilities are&lt;br/&gt;critical.  The approach consists of three main thrusts to enable the&lt;br/&gt;desired learning and adaptation: (i) Development of algorithms to&lt;br/&gt;efficiently learn optimal control policies and dynamics models through&lt;br/&gt;sharing the learning and adaptation between various instantiations of&lt;br/&gt;platforms and environments.  (ii) Creation of control learning&lt;br/&gt;algorithms which can be run on low-cost, low-power mobile platforms.&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Development of algorithms for online improvement of policy&lt;br/&gt;performance in a minimal number of real-world trials.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance learning and adaptation&lt;br/&gt;capabilities of practical cyberphysical systems.  The proposed&lt;br/&gt;approach will be generally applicable and lead to a new class of&lt;br/&gt;learning and adapting systems that are able to leverage shared&lt;br/&gt;properties between multiple tasks to significantly speed up&lt;br/&gt;learning and adaptation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Success in this research project will bring society closer to solving&lt;br/&gt;the grand challenge of teams of mobile, disposable, search and rescue&lt;br/&gt;robots which can robustly locomote through uncertain and novel&lt;br/&gt;environments, finding survivors in disaster situations, while removing&lt;br/&gt;risk from rescuers.  This project will provide interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;training through research and classwork for undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;students in creating systems which intimately couple the cyber and&lt;br/&gt;physical aspects in robotic and living mobile platforms.  Through the&lt;br/&gt;SUPERB summer program, under-represented students in engineering will&lt;br/&gt;experience research in learning and robotics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project targeted advancing the capabilities of synthetic and cyborg insects in complicated environments, such as outdoors or in a collapsed building.  Research under this project consisted of three main thrusts: (i) Learning and adaptation for control to handle the significant uncertainty in these systems and their operating environments; (ii) Creation of synthetic, biomimetic insect-like robots; (iii) Investigation of bio-electrical interfaces in the context of cyborg insects. This project advanced the state of the art in learning and adaptation for control along two main directions: First, a new algorithm was developed to tackle the problem of planning in uncertain environments when risk aversion is desired --- i.e., when one doesnÆt want to optimize the expected/average outcome, but rather optimize for the majority of the time the outcome being at least of a certain quality.  Second, the problem of learning to control a system with (a priori) unknown dynamics was considered --- where the system is supposed to learn to control itself through experimentation.  Two main challenges were studied, and addressed: How to perform this exploration safely, which is an important problem as exploration tends to pull the system towards the unknown, but moving into the unknown is often unsafe.  How to extend existing exploration approaches that work well for (relatively small) discrete state space systems to continuous non-linear dynamical systems.      This project advanced the state of the art in design methodology, rapid (and relatively cheap) fabrication techniques, and control of biomimetic milli-robots.  We investigated the performance of a legged robot as it traversed three distinct rough terrains: tile, carpet, and gravel. Furthermore, we developed an accurate, robust, low-lag, and efficient algorithm for terrain classification that uses vibration data from the on-board inertial measurement unit and motor control data.  We also developed a new ornithopter micro aerial vehicle, the  13 gram H2Bird.

Most flying insects utilize two distinct visual subsystems during flight. The first is based on compound eyes. A second subsystem is comprised of three low resolution light sensors called ocelli. The ocelli are usually found on the insect face;  differential changes in light flux falling on ocelli caused by attitude changes with respect to the horizon allow the insect to quickly compute pitch, roll and yaw. We have designed, built and tested ultra-miniature ocelli stimulators on dragonflies and locusts (Figure Y). The devices provide differential stimulation to ocelli in a package weighing less than 250 mg. Providing synthetic differentials in incident flux, either via absolute intensity control or pulse width modulation, between ocelli produces pronounced neck motions.
