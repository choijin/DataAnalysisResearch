<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop high performance analog/mixed-signal integrated circuits that are crucial to the advancement of wireless communication, sensor network, health, and biotech applications. The approach is to use signal processing algorithms implemented in digital logic to subtly modify the statistical properties of the analog signals such that inevitable transistor nonlinearity and manufacturing process variability do not degrade circuit performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is that it is a promising, fundamentally different approach that does not depend on brute circuit optimization but instead applies elegant signal processing principles to improve circuit performance. It trades off algorithmic complexity for relaxed analog circuit design thereby reducing power consumption, die area, design time, and offering higher performance and fabrication yields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project are three fold. It will help perpetuate California's position as a technology leader in the wireless communication, sensor network, and consumer electronics industries. Second, it will encourage students from underrepresented groups to take up advanced engineering careers by providing graduate students and summer interns recruited specifically from such groups to work on the proposed project. Third, the educational activity addresses the need for a change in the philosophy of circuit design education. By training future circuit designers in the fundamental interplay between circuit design practice and signal processing theory, it will better prepare them to face the immediate challenges of integrated circuit design, and to adapt to its impending evolution from microelectronics into newer technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project developed a clas of digital signal conditioning/processing techniques to improve the performance of analog integrated circuits (ICs). Specifically, four techniques were developed addressing critical IC blocks viz,  data converters and frequency/phase synthesizers. The functionality and the utility of the techniques were theoretically established and furthermore, three prototype ICs were designed, had fabricated, and successfully tested demonstrating best-in-class performance.  The first technique employed intentionally added noise to linearizes a popular analog-to-digital converter. The technique enabled one of the best figures-of-merit among this popular class of data converters. Two other techniques employed digital conditioning and calibration to compensate for circuit errors thereby enabling wide bandwidth phase modulators. Phase modulators are critical blocks in a variety of new applications such as phased array systems.  Overall, the intellectual merit of these project outcomes is that the developed techniques represent a radically different approach to IC design - one that employs algorithmic mitigation of inevitable circuit errors. In contrast, traditional IC design relies on designer experience and painstaking optimization to achieve desired performance resulting in long design cycles and low IC yields. The developed algorithmic approach is very reliable, yields robust designs, and more importantly, benefits from the scaling of fabrication processes viz., smaller die area and lower power consumption.
