<AbstractNarration>AST-0908378&lt;br/&gt;Johnson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetospheric and solar wind ions and electrons, UV photons, X-rays and cosmic ray ions alter materials in the solar system as well as in other astrophysical environments.  The chemistry induced by photons (photolysis) and by charged particles (radiolysis) relates to the production of gas-phase species (called desorption or sputtering).  Incident radiation contributes to the ambient gas observed in giant planet magnetospheres, in regions of the interstellar medium, and around young stellar objects.  Observations of neutrals and ions can therefore give information on the materials present in environments such as the oxygen atmosphere over Saturn's main rings and grains in Saturn's magnetosphere, and the surfaces and atmospheres of Europa and Ganymede.  The possibility of a sub-surface ocean on Europa makes it all the more important to describe the radiolytic production of oxidants in its relatively young surface.  This project will build practical models using the latest computational tools in materials science, so as to use gas or plasma observations to determine the composition of materials embedded in a radiation environment.  Work will focus on the commonality of the physical and chemical processes occurring in a number of space environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will impact the physics and chemistry of the radiation-induced processing of materials, and affects the teaching of introductory materials science.  The cross-disciplinary program also has interactions with neighboring undergraduate institutions and high schools that primarily serve minority populations.</AbstractNarration>

This project supported a graduate student in Material Science to work with Professor R. Johnson to simulate the radiation-induced alteration of icy satellite surfaces. The processing of surfaces by energetic ions and electrons, called radiolysis, and the processing by short wavelength photons, called photolysis, has been found to occur on many of the icy moons of the giant planets and the icy bodies in the Kuiper belt.   A flux of cosmic-ray ions, magnetospheric plasma ions and electrons, and energetic solar ions, as well as extreme-ultraviolet and ultraviolet photons, can change the volatility, porosity, and chemical composition of an icy surface. This in turn affects the reflectance and thermal properties. Therefore, we developed a method to simulate the physical and chemical evolution of the surfaces of a number of icy solar system bodies.  Particularly exciting was our description of the surpring lens-like features observed telescopically and by the Cassini spacecraft on MImas and Tethys, icy moons of Saturn. We showed these features are produced by a flux of electrons with energies greater than about 1 MeV. Remarkably, this flux also changed the thermal properties of these lens-shaped regions. In addition we showed that  the lower energy plasma in Saturn's magnetosphere produced tenuous atmosphere over the icy moons Dione and Rhea.
