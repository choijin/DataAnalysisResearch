<AbstractNarration>The principal goal of this research program is the discovery of new, unconventional reagents and their development as tools for chemical synthesis. This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to the development of new catalytic reactions using organosilicon compounds.  Acylsilanes are silicon-containing small molecules that have been investigated for over 30 years due to their unusual reactivity (e.g., acyl anions), yet there remains many opportunities to exploit and utilize these unique compounds in chemical synthesis.  &lt;br/&gt;Silyloxyallenes are versatile compounds with significant potential in cycloadditions, tandem bond-forming sequences and group transfer reactions. By integrating the reactivity of these unique enolsilanes with tandem or subsequent reactions, the PI will be able to access important compound classes with high efficiency and minimal waste.  The complementary mechanistic and target-oriented approaches driving this work allows for studies that are unique among current investigations in organosilicon and catalysis research.  The group is developing sophisticated and highly versatile methods for the convergent construction of new small molecules that have broad utility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The investigation of the research goals of this proposal will simultaneously provide the undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and visiting scholars working on these projects with essential experience and scientific knowledge. They will learn synthesis techniques, instrumentation analysis, organometallic chemistry, purification science, and problem solving strategies.  In addition to acquiring laboratory skills, the Scheidt team has regular weekly full group meetings and daily sub-group gatherings to discuss prior results and chart new research directions. Weekly meetings include research presentations, short discussions on recent high-impact publications, and chemical problems for pedagogical growth. Overall, the individual training in the laboratory combined with small, medium and large group formats for presenting and discussing chemical topics provides for a rich, vibrant and dynamic learning environment. Additionally, there is strong participation by underrepresented groups in the laboratory which engenders a professional, dynamic and multi-ethnic work environment. Professor Scheidt will continue to organize and host the annual Chicago Organic Symposium as well as strengthen ties with institutions such as Western Michigan University and Chicago State University. This outreach component is centered on creating an interchange of ideas throughout the Department of Chemistry and between academic and industrial personnel from a variety of backgrounds and is expected to have a unique and significant impact on society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The supported project facilitated the discovery of new chemical transformations based on organosilicon compounds. In a major advance, we have uncovered that a-silyl alcohols are selective and unusual reagents in chemical reactions that access unconventional reactivity.  This work will allow for the rapid preparation of privileged compounds called 1,2-amino alcohols.   These compounds are used in the preparation of bioactive molecules as well as ligands for transition metal complexes.   To date, there are few convergent methods to prepare these compounds from non amino acid sources.  This work is an important advance since it captures d1 synthon type reactivity with very easy to access starting materials. The treatment of easily prepared a-silyl alcohols with base promotes a transfer of silicon from carbon to oxygen, called a Brook rearrangement.  This migration then facilitates a new carbon-carbon bond forming process.     In addition to the pharmaceutical compounds that can now be prepared through this method, we are investigating new applications of 1,2-amino alcohols in different material preparations.  The d1 synthon approach using a-silyl alcohols can also be applied to different electrophiles in order to access many popular structural classes.  Studies to extend this work beyond the 1,2-amino alcohol products and to understand the underlying principles of stereoselectivity are ongoing.
