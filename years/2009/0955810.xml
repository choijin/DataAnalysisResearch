<AbstractNarration>In the last several years large observational programs have produced results that have led to a basic understanding of how star formation in galaxies has evolved over cosmic time. However, an understanding of why star formation varies as it does has remained elusive. This is primarily due to a lack of information about the dense reservoirs of gas that serve as the fuel of star formation in these galaxies. In this proposal Dr. Baker outlines a program to characterize the masses, distributions, and physical conditions of the dense gas in a range of star-forming galaxies. The core strategy of the program is to target distant (high-redshift) galaxies that have been gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxy clusters. This proposal will use the NSF-funded ALMA array to make critical observations for the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will support one graduate and one undergraduate for the duration of the grant. The undergraduates will be participate in the Research in Science and Engineering (RISE) program at Rutgers University, a program specially aimed at underrepresented groups and/or first-generation college students. Additional educational activities, such as the inclusion of modern astronomy topics in physics classes, will take place as part of an existing collaboration between Dr. Baker and Xavier University in New Orleans and a majority-minority high school in Newark, New Jersey. The materials developed through this grant will also be incorporated into the Rutgers Future Scholars program.</AbstractNarration>

During the course of the project, the massive galaxy clusters that initially served only as signposts for finding lensed high-redshift galaxies also emerged as objects worthy of detailed study in their own right. The 20 refereed papers published as part of this project have reported results that include the following:  High-redshift galaxies are forming stars from their interstellar gas reservoirs more efficiently (per unit area) than spiral galaxies in the local universe (Sharon et al. 2013; Sharon et al. 2019).   Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs)-- an important category of galaxies so thoroughly enshrouded by interstellar dust that they can be nearly invisible at optical wavelengths-- can be found out to very high redshifts and very early cosmic times (Su et al. 2017; Aguirre et al. 2018). Detailed studies of the gas in individual DSFGs for this project have revealed evidence for galaxy merging (Sharon et al. 2015), outflows driven by central supermassive black holes (Roberts-Borsani et al. 2017), and unusual physical conditions (Rivera et al. 2019) within the population.   Robust models for the effects of gravitational lensing that reconstruct how "delensed" sources would look in the absence of lensing can be strongly (Sharon et al. 2019) or entirely (Rivera et al. 2019) informed by maps of the emission from a galaxy's interstellar gas at different line-of-sight velocities (i.e., slightly different observed frequencies). The images provided with this report, from Rivera et al. (2019), use color-coding to represent gas moving at different line-of-sight velocities within the DSFG ACT-S J020941+001557. (The name of this galaxy reflects its discovery by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and its location on the sky.)
