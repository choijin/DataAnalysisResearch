<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to characterize and investigate the use of tailored three dimensional fabrics as part of a composite structure to improve the through-thickness thermal properties. Initial predictions suggest that one can improve through-thickness thermal conductivity of composites by two to three orders of magnitude with high z-fiber content. This would be equivalent to thermal properties of metallic baseline materials.  These preliminary results have motivated this research which will investigate and characterize (i) the thermal transport mechanisms when highly conductive z-fibers are integrated in 3-D composites, (ii) their arrangement for optimal performance and (iii) manufacturing issues associated with this class of composites.  Validation of the developed fundamental understanding using well-designed model experiments is also planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research requires knowledge of textile and composites modeling, composite design, manufacturing and testing.  The US Co-PIs will work together with the Institute for Textile Technology at the University of Aachen/Germany (ITA). ITA is an internationally renowned center with complimentary equipment and expertise necessary to fabricate the three dimensional fabric structures. US students will have the opportunity to conduct part of their research at ITA gaining valuable expertise in textile technology.  The activity will develop the general framework to address heat transport mechanisms in multi phase heterogeneous porous media containing a highly conductive phase. Once this is well understood one can fabricate composites with tailored thermal conductivities fulfilling their potential in a range of applications from housing to large-scale structures that need to be electrically and thermally conductive.</AbstractNarration>
