<AbstractNarration>0933653&lt;br/&gt;Zhang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the Biosensing /CBET program supports work by Professor Zhang at Boston University to pursue biological/biochemical sensing at cellular and even finer levels by converting a biological response to an electrical signal using micro/nanosystems and further implementing an impedance-based real-time assay system for high-throughput screening (HTS).  The objective of this research is to design and test a multidisciplinary micro/nanosystem for positioning individual cells into an analyzing matrix for real-time monitoring cell viability and response with a miniaturized HTS system. In the proposed micro/nanosystem, existing electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) techniques will be modified for single cell monitoring.  In order to broaden range of usable cell types, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) will be employed to characterize cell electrical properties and a cell-free system. To precisely position individual cells to correctly sized working electrodes, alternating current electrokinetics (ac EK) will be exploited and integrated into the proposed micro/nanosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of highly sensitive, yet simple and robust impedance-based biosensors, integrated into a miniaturized system will enable real-time high-throughput study of single cells, best monitoring living cells to observe, characterize, and model functional behavior at the cellular and even finer levels so as to explore biosensor specificity and flexibility for distinct responses to different combinations of stimuli, making an impact on fields ranging from biosenisng/bioinstrumentation to micro/nanosystems with applications to the biomedical, environmental, and security needs.  Educationally, this program will impact a diverse student population through merging biosensing and engineering education research to train the next generation of scientific/engineering leaders.</AbstractNarration>
