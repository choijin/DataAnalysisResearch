<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Humans, rats and other vertebrates, relying on their advanced nervous systems, are far superior at dealing with the uncertainties of the world than are artificial systems. Thus, a machine, whose behavior is guided by a neurobiologically inspired system, might demonstrate the flexible, autonomous behavior normally attributed to biological organisms. Biological organisms have the ability to respond quickly to an ever-changing world. Because this adaptability is so critical for survival, all vertebrates have sub-cortical structures, which comprise the neuromodulatory systems, to handle uncertainty and change in the environment. Attention, which is influenced by neuromodulation, plays a significant role in animal's ability to respond to such changes. Different neuromodulatory systems are thought to play important and distinct roles in attention. A collaborative approach, which compares rodent experiments with robots having simulated nervous systems, will examine these attentional systems. These experiments will lead to a better understanding of how animals cope with uncertainty in the environment, and will lead to the design of a robot capable of flexible and complex behavior. This work has the potential of being paradigm-shifting technology that could find its way in many practical applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an interdisciplinary approach, a robotic system, whose design is based on the vertebrate neuromodulatory system and its effect on attention, will be constructed and tested under similar experimental conditions to the rat, and then in a more practical application. This approach, which combines computational modeling and robotics with rodent behavioral and electrophysiological experiments, will lead to a better understanding of how areas of the brain allocate attentional resources and cause the organism to respond rapidly to essential events and objects. Two of these neuromodulatory systems, the cholinergic and noradrenergic, are thought to play important and distinct roles in attention. Expected uncertainty, the known degree of unreliability of predictive relationships in the environment, drives activity within the cholinergic system. Unexpected uncertainty, large changes in the environment that violate prior expectations, drives activity within the noradrenergic system. These systems modulate activity in brain areas to properly allocate the attention to stimuli in the environment necessary for adequate learning to occur and fluid behavior to be maintained. This knowledge will be used to construct a robust, intelligent robotic system whose capability to adapt to change, and behave effectively in a noisy, complex environment will rival that of a biological system. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
