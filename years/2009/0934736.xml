<AbstractNarration>This project will provide both analysis and functioning open-source&lt;br/&gt;software to evaluate the utility and applicability of the Extended&lt;br/&gt;Finite Element Method (XFEM) to the problem of dynamic Earthquake&lt;br/&gt;rupture on complex non-planar faults.  While standard finite element&lt;br/&gt;methods are applicable to many earthquake physics problems, the&lt;br/&gt;requirement that the mesh be conformal to a complex, non-volume&lt;br/&gt;forming network of faults is a fundamental difficulty, particularly in&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensions.  The XFEM, provides a potentially powerful alternative&lt;br/&gt;by encoding discontinuous basis functions into the approximation space&lt;br/&gt;without requiring faults to coincide with mesh edges, an approach that&lt;br/&gt;naturally fits the earthquake rupture problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary work, however, demonstrates several complications that&lt;br/&gt;arise in this application.  Standard techniques for frictional failure&lt;br/&gt;do not work with the XFEM, so new weak formulations of failure must be&lt;br/&gt;developed.  In addition, discrete singularities, which are effectively&lt;br/&gt;removed in quasi-static engineering rupture problems, become crucial&lt;br/&gt;in dynamic repeated rupture.  These discrete problems can&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally affect event statistics, and must be avoided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will address these complications via analysis,&lt;br/&gt;computation, and physical intuition.  Specifically, they propose two&lt;br/&gt;possibilities for weak failure criteria, and plan to test them with a&lt;br/&gt;series of benchmark problems.  Additionally, they propose analysis of&lt;br/&gt;numerical accuracy of the weak frictional criteria, with the goal of&lt;br/&gt;better understanding error in rupture propagation in these discrete&lt;br/&gt;systems.  In a second component, they plan to derive bounds for the&lt;br/&gt;existence of mesh-fault interaction artifacts.  Using these bounds, they&lt;br/&gt;will either determine enrichment schemes that eliminate the artifacts&lt;br/&gt;or develop meshing schemes to avoid them.  Finally, the above work&lt;br/&gt;will culminate in a proof of concept for the XFEM in repeated rupture&lt;br/&gt;problems, and they will work to better understand event complexity in&lt;br/&gt;complex fault systems.  These problems provide an excellent&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for collaboration between computational and applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and earthquake physicists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance: &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the dynamics and probability of&lt;br/&gt;Earthquakes on realistically complex fault networks is a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering problem that has direct consequences for&lt;br/&gt;improved estimates of Earthquake hazards.  Advanced computational&lt;br/&gt;models, combined with observations, provide an important tool for&lt;br/&gt;exploring and understanding these systems.  A critical component of&lt;br/&gt;such models, however is the geometric description and accurate&lt;br/&gt;modeling of failure on non-planar faults which poses significant&lt;br/&gt;challenges for traditional finite-element methods.  This project will&lt;br/&gt;investigate an alternative method that allows the description of the&lt;br/&gt;fault network to be only loosely coupled to the computational mesh.&lt;br/&gt;If this method is successful, it promises to significantly increase&lt;br/&gt;the ease of describing and composing these problems and is better&lt;br/&gt;suited to exploring the dynamics of fault networks, particularly under&lt;br/&gt;the uncertainty of fault location.  The proposed research will also&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the computational infrastructure for modeling the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of brittle systems and earthquake genesis. The resulting open&lt;br/&gt;source software will be distributed through the Computational&lt;br/&gt;Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG: www.geodynamics.org), and be&lt;br/&gt;accessible to a broad community of researchers with impact beyond the&lt;br/&gt;immediate realm of Earthquake physics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
