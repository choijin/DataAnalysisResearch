<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ecological research on biodiversity has typically focused on the effects of species diversity, yet a growing body of evidence points to the importance of diversity within species, i.e., genetic variation, for population, community, and ecosystem level processes.  This project examines the relationship between plant genetic diversity and associated species in the ecologically and economically valuable salt marsh ecosystem along the Gulf Coast of the United States.  These salt marshes are dominated by a single plant species, Spartina alterniflora, but plants differ genetically in ecologically-important traits such as growth rate, morphology, and competitive ability, and several faunal species closely associated with Spartina can have strong impacts on plant biomass and productivity.  This project will quantify the degree of morphological variation among Spartina genotypes grown in a common environment, and investigate the consequences of this diversity to other species at multiple spatial scales in marshes along the Gulf Coast of Florida.  Field experiments will be conducted to examine the relationship between individual Spartina genotypes and key associated species, and to experimentally investigate the interactive effects of Spartina genetic diversity and associated species presence on marsh productivity.  This project will provide critical information on the ecological role of genetic diversity in an important marine foundation species, and will advance our general understanding of the interaction between genetic diversity in plants and the faunal communities that depend on them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salt marshes and other coastal ecosystems are increasingly impacted by development, fishing, and other human activities, and have experienced significant declines in some areas.  Genetic diversity can be an important component of transplant success of marine vegetation as well as the productivity and diversity of the associated community.  Thus, this project will have implications for salt marsh restoration, currently the focus of significant effort along the Gulf Coast.  In addition, outreach efforts through public events hosted in partnership with the St. Joseph Bay Aquatic Preserve will educate the public about salt marshes and environmental science in general.  This project will also provide research training in ecology and molecular techniques for graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
