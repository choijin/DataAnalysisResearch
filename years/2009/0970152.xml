<AbstractNarration>This award supports research to explore how future gravitational wave observations from ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO and pulsar timing arrays can be used to characterize populations of astronomical gravitational-wave sources. First, analysis techniques will be developed to identify the source of a particular class of events without full parameter searches, particularly eccentric binaries. Further work will explore how a catalog of detections at high frequencies constrains the plausible progenitor models that gave rise to the sources observed by LIGO. A second thrust of the project is to consider the extension of interferometric analysis techniques to pulsar timing analysis including the development of a sensitivity algorithm analogous to those used by interferometric detectors, and the development of the null stream pointing technique for pulsar timing arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravitational wave astronomy is an emergent discipline that has recently entered an era where the primary activity is true astrophysical observation. The LIGO observatory is the first detector with the real capability for sensing gravitational radiation of astrophysical origin, and has propelled the field from one dominated by theoretical computations into a rich research discipline that encompasses the acquisition of data and analysis of experimental results. Pulsar timing is emerging as a prominent technique for detecting very-low frequency gravitational waves, and is drawing from a rich background of analysis techniques and world-wide pulsar monitoring efforts in the radio astronomy community. In addition, the PI will leverage an existing public outreach program at Utah State University known as Science Unwrapped, a synergistic combination of public presentations by active researchers with direct hands-on science experiences. Three events for the Science Unwrapped related to gravitational wave physics, including the hands-on science experiences, will be developed as will a companion Spanish language component to reach out to the Hispanic communities in northern Utah.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award considered how to best use gravitational wave astronomy to understand distant astrophysical phenomena in the Comsos.  There were several major threads that were explored:     (1) How can traditional astronomy (with telescopes) be used in tandem with gravitational waves to understand the systems emitting the gravitational waves, and to understand the fundamental nature of gravity.  (2) How can we improve the way we look at gravitational wave data to identify when we have a source in the data, and also how to point to a source with certain detection methods.  (3) How can we take catalogs of gravitational wave observatories and use that data to understand the origins of the sources in the catalog. Alternatively, we can ask how different phenomena in the Cosmos change the content of our catalogs.  The scientific results that are covered by these three thrusts were summarized in 8 scientific papers which were presented at national meetings for astronomers and physicists, as well as submitted to the appropriate scientific journals for publication.     The award helped fund two graduate students, who worked on a significant fraction of the results produced by this award, as well as helped pay for more than half a dozen undergraduates (more than half of which were young women, and two who were awarded Goldwater Scholarships).     An important interface with the public this project helped fund were speakers for a program called "Science Unwrapped". Three speakers each gave a public presentation (featuring some of our largest crowds ever at Science Unwrapped, totalling 430, 600 and 350 people respectively), had breakfast with a small group of students, met with one of our student organizations on campus (typically Women in Science and Engineering, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and the Society of Physics Students), and also were interviewed on Utah Public Radio.  Our speakers included: Gabriela Gonzalez (LSU/LIGO), Pablo Laguna (Georgia Tech), and Lucianne Walkowicz (Princeton).
