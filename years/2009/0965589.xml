<AbstractNarration>Tall fescue is one the most important grassland species in the US; it withstands drought, disease and herbivory, exhibits an unusually long growing season, and has adapted to a broad range of environmental conditions. Many of these characteristics derive from a mutualism between tall fescue and a fungal endophyte that was first discovered in the mid-1970s. This project will synthesize the abundant research on tall fescue that has occurred since the fungal mutualism was discovered. The resulting monograph will be produced digitally, as a web book, will be available worldwide to a very broad audience, and can be updated easily as new findings become available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monograph will serve as an important research, teaching, and extension resource, providing information for plant geneticists, physiologists, pathobiologists, extension specialists, genetic engineers, animal geneticists, nutritionists, toxicologists, agricultural economists, and veterinarians. Synthesis of the past 30 years of research and the opportunity for continuous updating of the latest developments make this project important to tens of thousands of potential users.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Description  Funding from this award was used to design and implement an online version of the monograph entitled Tall Fescue for the Twenty-first Century.  The initial page of the online monograph is found at this URL: (http://forages.oregonstate.edu/tallfescuemonograph/).  Editors and Developers  Editors of the printed version (Henry A. Fribourg, David B. Hannaway, and Charles P. West) provided leadership for developing the online version. In addition, a graduate student (Daniel James) and computer system analyst (Curtis Onstott) provided technical assistance for developing and transferring text and graphics to the web-based monograph. The completed project is now part of the web-based Forage Information System (http://forages.oregonstate.edu/).  International Linkages  Authors and users of the online monograph come from many countries, predominantly representing areas of use for the cool-season grass tall fescue (US, Canada, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand).   Outreach Mechanisms  The tall fescue online monograph is now available as part of the Forage Information System (FIS), making it available to anyone, anywhere, any time. The product and process were described to forage and livestock system scientists, extension agents, and industry leaders at the 2010 annual meeting of the American Forage &amp; Grassland Council. An abstract of the project is contained in the annual proceedings.  Impact  A counter has been added to the system and to each chapter to compile statistics of contacts to the monograph. Contacts to the FIS have averaged over 50,000 per year since its inception in 1994.  Continuing Efforts  Future plans include periodic updating to ensure state-of-the-science information on tall fescue.
