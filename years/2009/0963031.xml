<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided to renovate the Molecular and Cell Biology research facility Purchase College, State University of New York. Established in 1967, Purchase College is a four-year undergraduate institution with a record of research, undergraduate student research training, and receipt of federal grants to fund these efforts dating back to the mid-1970s. The lab facility is used for faculty research and undergraduate research training. All undergraduate students are required to carry out an eight-credit capstone experience involving original research. Many students also do summer research in the College's labs, and/or take independent research courses during the academic year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will permit: (1) Redesigning part of the Microscopy room by moving some nonstructural walls, allowing for more efficient student research training in the use of Electron Microscopes. (2) Reconfiguring the preparatory room: half of it will become a facility for the analysis of digital microscopy images, DNA sequence data and electrophoretic gel data. The other half will remain a preparatory area. (3) The Molecular/Cell Biology area will contain a new bench configuration, with numerous research stations and areas to properly contain research equipment. All of the benches will be wired for networked computer workstations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The renovations will support ongoing fundamental research on macrophages, thermophilic bacteria, marine invertebrate cellular defenses and environmental responses, and cellular processes.  The renovations will increase the research efficiency and productivity. The renovation will enhance already productive collaborative student/faculty research, as well as continue the undergraduate research training being conducted by Purchase College. It will have a positive impact on the local community colleges that send their students to Purchase College for 5 weeks of intensive, independent research in Molecular and Cellular Biology.  The renovation will enable Purchase College's Biology faculty to continue what has become a 30-year tradition of a research-based curriculum for undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
