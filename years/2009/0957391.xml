<AbstractNarration>This research program targets the study of unprecedented diastereo- and enantiospecific photodimerization reactions in bimolecular crystals.  Families of homochiral, racemic, and quasiracemic cinnamoylsulfonamides will be developed, and their crystal packing tendencies and photochemical crystal reactions explored.  These studies provide student participants with broad experience in organic synthesis, crystal engineering, materials design, X-ray crystallography, and issues in chirality, crystal cohesion, chemical reactivity and nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of this award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program, Professor Wheeler, of the Department of Chemistry at Eastern Illinois University, will fine-tune solid-state reactivity via molecular engineering of constituent building blocks.  This research program promises to delineate the relationship between molecular structure and the reactivity of the bulk solid with results leading to transformative developments in the areas of solid-state reactions and materials research.  Findings from this program will be especially useful in future work for rationally designed multi-component solid-state reactions, where managing the spatial orientation of reactive components is often by chance rather than a well-defined preconceived approach to molecular assembly.  This project also targets a number of other developments regarding recruitment and training in the chemical sciences through enhancing the research relevance of laboratory courses, devising novel approaches for incorporating advanced structure determination techniques in the undergraduate curriculum, and fostering career paths of students in the chemical and related fields.  This project will have an important impact on society because of the current technological need for next generation methods for fabricating functional materials (e.g., optical materials and therapeutic agents).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It comes as no surprise that many recent innovations utilize crystalline materials to explore and prepare engineered materials with functional properties.  Why?  Because the organizational power of crystals and the fixed positions of their components provide an attractive setting to conduct and develop theories and experiments that expand current technology.  Chemical reactivity in molecular solids is one area of current technological interest that has benefited from the use of crystalline frameworks.  The research team at Eastern Illinois University directed by Prof. Kraig Wheeler developed a family of next generation compounds that selectively assembled in crystals for the purpose of unique chemical processes. The design strategy of the program exploited molecular frameworks that effectively align pairs of crystal components that use molecular shape, handedness, and well-placed hydrogen-bonding groups.  Component selection targeted sulfonamidecinnamic acid frameworks prepared via straightforward two-step syntheses from readily available amino acid and sulfonyl chloride precursors.  This portion of the project showed that components engineered to promote flexible frameworks, æfish hookÆ shapes, and crystal cohesion allowed access to robust crystalline dimer motifs.  Assessment of these materials by X-ray crystallography showed that the observed pairwise patterns persist regardless of variations in the handedness (i.e., racemic, quasiracemic, and single-component homochiral forms) and size of the attached R groups.   Though the approach of this program offered an effective tool to design predetermined crystalline motifs, the greater utility of these materials rests with the alignment of C=C groups for chemical transformations.  These systems underwent remarkable dimerization reactions in solvent-free environments when exposed to UV-light.  Applications of the original design strategy also made use of the tendency of these materials to form symmetry and near symmetry patterns that related pairs of neighboring reaction groups.  Because many of these systems included components with only one handedness, the results underscore the value of the design method for preparing new asymmetric functional materials.  This program extends the current crystal reaction technology to include the formation of robust molecular dimers that underwent asymmetric light-initiated reactions.  Noted progress in this area has been realized by a team of researchers &ndash; undergraduate and graduate students, technicians, and high school teachers &ndash; all actively engaged in the design and development of a wide range of photoactive materials.  In addition to the educational training relevant to the research program, the program also supported the 21st Midwest Organic Solid-State Chemistry Symposium held at the PIÆs institution from June 10-11, 2011.  This meeting provided a platform for emerging research scientists (undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows) working in solid-state chemistry the opportunity to showcase their work and benefit from other research advances in related fields.
