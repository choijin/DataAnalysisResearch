<AbstractNarration>0934364 University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC); Milton Halem &lt;br/&gt;0934114 Georgia Tech; David Bader&lt;br/&gt;0934422 University of California, San Diego; Sheldon Brown&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research (CHMPR)" with a focus on hybrid multicore computing and research on parallel processing algorithms as well as technology-driven research questions. The lead of the proposed Center is UMBC with site locations at Georgia Tech (GT) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center plans to develop, test, and optimize prototypes of computationally intensive applications. A key contribution of the Center will be the implementation of prototype applications on new architectures and comparative performance analysis. This Center is needed to advance knowledge both in high-performance computing as well as computer architecture communities. The PIs are well qualified and the access to resources is excellent. The combined computing facilities at UMBC and GT, respectively, are the largest most advanced Cell Broadband Engine based multicore university systems available today.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will address the future needs of the computer industry as this new hybrid multicore processor technology evolves.  The proposed Center will provide faculty and students the unique opportunity to gain hands-on expertise to address a wide variety of practical, hybrid multicore applications in areas of climate prediction, defense, biomedical informatics, 3-D graphic environments, finance and social computing.  The Center has described efforts to increase participation of underrepresented groups, and there are plans to publish the results of research and education projects within an online Hybrid Multicore Knowledge Repository. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CHMPR and its affiliated Industry and Government partnersÆ vision is to become recognized globally as a preeminent cooperative research consortium addressing the productivity, performance and scalability issues in meeting the insatiable computational demands of its sponsorsÆ applications through the continuous evolution of hybrid multicore architectures and open source tools.  During the initial phase in 2009, CHMPR started out as a 3-university site I/UCRC (here at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Georgia Tech and University of San Diego, California) and for the last two years was a 2-university site Center (UMBC and UCSD).  These separate research institutions together form the Center for Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research, with research focused on addressing productivity, performance, and scalability issues in meeting the insatiable computational demands of our membersÆ applications through the continuous evolution of multicore architectures and open source tools.  CHMPR offers a unique opportunity for graduate students to collaborate and intern with industrial partners on applications of relevance to these partners, who represent a suite of potential future employers for the graduate students.  Over 50 research projects supported by CHMPR members including NASA, NOAA, NIST, FDA, NSA/LPS, NSA/LTS, NSA, IBM, Northrop Grumman, LexisNexis, Lockheed Martin, Innovim, Deloitte have provided research opportunities for staff and students.  From these proposed research projects, 54 data products (in Health IT, Climate Change, Big Data, Tools, Analytics, Datasets, Scheduling, Social Media, Prototypes, Software Assurance, Diagnostic, and Computer Systems) resulted from CHMPR research.  UMBC offered 12 related courses with 772 students.  CHMPR at UMBC also is proud to have helped with obtaining 18 Student internships, 5 fellowships (NASA, IBM, NIST, and FDA).  In the past 5 years, 43 publications in conference proceedings, referenced journals and books, along with 27 presentations at professional conferences were also a result of research findings.  Additionally, 5 undergraduates have been funded through NSF REUs, 4 of which are Meyerhof scholars have worked on research projects with CHMPR.  From having experience funded by NSF, students have been able to further their research experience to careers as Mariana Barr-Dallas was employed by the NSA, Pat Carrinton is completing his PhD in the information system department along with being employed in the Lockheed Martin, Frank Harris worked on a CHMPR project for NASA doing airs satellite data processing and went on to get his degree in Physics, Shiloh Jordan was in charge of web maintenance and upkeep and went on to work at a company being their web developer.  We have obtained NSF funding for 1 REV undergraduate veteran who has successfully been trained as the system administrator and computer technician on our IBM based Bluegrit cluster.  In this capacity he supports approximately 20 researchers and several classes who use this computer system. We have broadened the student participation of underrepresented groups by working with the Meyerhof Scholars Program to recruit and engage talented undergraduate students in our research.

Ten of our students have received their PhD from UMBC through the research done with resources available through CHMPR.  All of our graduating students have also successfully found job placements/ gone on to pursue a Post-Doctorate.  We have been able to create a hybrid multicore forum for active engagements between industry and academia with 10 IAB sponsored Meetings and planning 2 more for Year 6. After a successful completion of Phase 1, CHMPR is very proud to have been successfully awarded a Phase 2 grant.
