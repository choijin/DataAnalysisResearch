<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation Support, Dr. John O'Shea and a team of colleagues from the University of Michigan will conduct three seasons of archaeological field work on the Alpena-Amberley Ridge, beneath the waters of modern Lake Huron in the Great Lakes.  The team brings together specialists in the use of remote operated vehicles (ROV) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), underwater archaeology, and computer science in an effort to identify archaeological sites associated with early hunting groups that once inhabited the Alpena-Amberley Ridge area during the Lake Stanley low water stage.  At this time, some nine thousand years ago, the ridge existed as a corridor of dry land extending from Presque Isle in Michigan to the Point Clarke region of southern Ontario.  The research builds on a prior National Science Foundation supported study that identified a series of stone structures which bear a strong resemblance to hunting structured used historically in the Arctic in the pursuit of caribou.  The goal of the current research effort is to confirm the human origin of these structures and to begin the process of identifying and describing the ancient human sites and associated artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;The Alpena-Amberley ridge holds a potential treasure trove of information relating to the early occupation of the Great Lakes.  Unlike anywhere else in the region, the ancient landscape remains much as the original occupants left it.  There has been no development, land clearance or farming to destroy sites, and no looting to remove important or attractive artifacts.  Not only does it provide the opportunity to identify sites from a time period that is poorly known on land, it also offers the potential for the preservation of intact sites, stone constructions, and plant and animal remains that rarely are preserved in the Great Lakes region. It also will provide a laboratory in which to investigate the life ways of the early inhabitants to the Great Lakes, and particularly the transition from Paleo-Indian to Archaic patterns systems.  The preserved layout and distribution of inundated sites may also provide insights into the culture and organization of these early hunters of a kind that is only rarely preserved on land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart for the extraordinary anthropological potential of the work, the research promises a number of broader benefits.  The work will provide a detailed view of the Lake Stanley era terrain and the Lake Huron lake bottom, and will yield important geological, environmental, botanical and faunal evidence from this important time period.  It will also provide data on the current conditions of the mid-Lake environment, and particularly the impact of invasive species.  Finally, the work brings together researchers and students from a wide range of departments and institutions, such as the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering and the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Michigan, Computer Science at Wayne State University, and archaeologists and educators from the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary.  The research effort represents the creative combination of existing equipment, capabilities, and expertise to address a novel new range of problems.  The "cross-training" benefits of the research are shared not only among the senior investigators, but by the interdisciplinary group of graduate and undergraduate students that participate in the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             It is difficult to consider the earliest human occupation of the Great Lakes without reference to the grudging withdrawal of the continental ice sheet, and the subsequent rises and drops in the waters of the Great Lakes that accompanied the regionÆs gradual transition to its modern appearance.  Archaeologists have investigated sites associated with high lake levels, but sites associated with the periods of low water are very rare, and most are presumed lost forever beneath the Great Lakes.  Our research considered the earliest low water stand in the Lake Huron basin, Lake Stanley, with a focus on the Alpena-Amberley Ridge (AAR) a submerged landform that was once a dry land corridor linking Michigan with Ontario.  The goal of the research was to determine whether traces of early human settlement were preserved on the ridge, and to begin the process of documenting these sites and the ancient landscape in which they once existed.     The research began by modeling of the ancient land surface using high resolution bathymetry and computer simulation to identify areas that would have been conducive to use by ancient hunters.  These areas were then mapped in detail using side scan and multibeam sonar.  Promising areas were visually examined and mapped using a remote operated vehicle (ROV), and locations with potential cultural features were directly examined by SCUBA trained archaeologists.  The research was also directed at reconstructing the ancient environment of the AAR.  This was done by sampling lake bottom deposits for environmental evidence, such as pollen, testate amoeba, and preserved wood and charcoal.     Environmental Results:     The analysis of paleo-environmental evidence revealed a sub-arctic environment consisting of sphagnum moss, tamarack larch and spruce trees, with small lakes, rivers and wetlands.  Radiocarbon dates on preserved spruce, including one still rooted tree, yielded dates from 8,900 to 8,640 cal BP, while charcoal recovered from the middle of a small hearth yielded a date of 9,020 cal BP.  These environmental results indicate that the AAR remained a relatively cold and barren place, and provided a cold climate refugium that would have been particularly attractive to cold adapted species such as caribou and to hunting technologies adapted to exploit them.     Archaeological Results:                  More than 70 probable stone constructions on the AAR have been identified and visually examined.  Most of the features appear to be hunting related, although other kinds of structures have been recorded.  These include small rectangular features which may be meat caches or temporary dwellings, small rings which were used as hearths, cairns and upright standing stones which may have functioned as both territorial markers and as components in drive lanes.                 The majority of the hunting structures appear to be simple hunting blinds that were located to take advantage of natural features in the landscape that would have influenced the pattern of caribou movement.  Two more complex hunting structures have also been identified.  These are modular combinations of simpler elements, and typically include one or more stone lines, multiple hunting blinds, cairns, and upright stones.  In addition to the stone constructions, other culturally modified materials have been recovered in a number of locations.  These include a thumbnail-size scraper, along with numerous chert flakes associated with the repair and resharpening of stone tools.  Other recovered materials of archaeological significance include worked wood, and the fragment of a Cervid tooth.                 The finds from the Alpena-Amberley ridge provide a unique view of the early occupation of the Great Lakes.  Our investigations have proven that early sites are preserved beneath Lake Huron.  Not only do these sites provide information on a time period that is very poorly known on land, the layout and distribution of sites provides u...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
