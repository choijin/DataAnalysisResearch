<AbstractNarration>This is a three-part proposal. In the first part, the limit order book of an electronic exchange will be modeled as a queueing system, evolving as a measure-valued process, where the measure in question is the set of order sizes located on the price axis. Like many queueing systems, the evolution of the order book at the level of discrete orders is prohibitively complex. Therefore, the theory of heavy traffic limits for queueing systems will be used to obtain continuous approximations to the discrete systems. In the second part of the proposal, models for asset price volatility will be developed. Local volatility models currently in use describe volatility as a function of time and the underlying asset price. We propose to extend this concept to models in which volatility is a function of time, the underlying asset price, and one or more factors that determine the payoff of derivative securities written on the underlying asset. The third part of the proposal continues work on optimal investment and consumption in the presence of transaction costs. These problems are well understood and there are closed-form solutions in cases where transaction costs are zero, but there are no closed-form solutions in the more realistic case when transaction costs are positive.&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to develop asymptotic expansions in the small transaction cost parameter of the unknown solution around the zero-transaction-cost known solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In overview, it is proposed to build mathematical models designed to reduce risk and increase efficiency in financial markets. Innovations in the financial markets have changed their structure, and analysis needs to keep pace. In particular, the advent of order-driven electronic exchanges has spawned the growth of algorithmic trading, whereby firms trade large quantities of assets quickly. Does this make markets liquid? Does it dampen or amplify volatility? It is difficult to answer these questions because we do not have good mathematical models for these exchanges. Neither can we predict with any accuracy how various order-matching protocols on these exchanges will affect volatility, bid-ask spreads, and general market efficiency. A major part of this proposal is the development of mathematical models for electronic exchanges. A second aspect of this proposal is to improve mathematical models for asset price volatility. The celebrated Black-Scholes model assumes that volatility is constant, but departures from this assumption in financial markets are too significant to ignore. The third part of this proposal is to better understand the effect of transaction costs on problems of optimal investment and consumption. This problem is at the heart of equilibrium analysis of financial markets, but most studies to date make the unrealistic assumption that transaction costs are zero.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research supported by this grant focussed on trading of financial securities.  Two outcomes are described here. The first concerns a quantification of the effect of escrowing the performance bonuses of traders.  The second is the development of a mathematical model for trading on electronic exchanges.  Before the 2008 financial crisis, major investment banks routinely paid their traders a year-end performance bonus that was sometimes more than half their compensation for the year. This bonus was to some degree based on the amount of income the trader had earned for his or her employer during that year.  Since the financial crisis, firms that employ traders have reduced the size of these bonuses.  They have also placed significant fractions of the bonus in escrow, and the trader can withdraw this money only after additional years pass and his or her performance continues to be meritorious.  It is believed that this aligns the traders incentives more closely with those of the firm.  An outcome of the research supported by this grant was to show that the practice of escrowing bonuses might or might  not align the trader's incentives more closely with those  of the firm.  The key factor is the patience of the firm.  If  the firm cares more about showing its stakeholders  a quick return on investment, then escrowing bonuses makes the trader too conservative and works against this goal. In contrast, a firm that wants to show steady profits over the long term should escrow bonuses so that the trader also adopts a longer term view of profitability.  The precise trade-offs can be quantified in terms of the risk aversion of the trader and the degree to which the firm values present profits over future profits.  The second outcome of the research is a better understanding of the evolution of limit-order books that govern trading on electronic exchanges.  Over the past 25 years trading of stocks and many other securities  has moved from open outcry exchanges to electronic exchanges, where orders are matched by computer. Market orders are executed immediately at the best price available.  Limit orders specify a price at which the agent submitting the order wants the order to execute, and since there is usually no one immediately willing to take the other side of these trades at the specified prices, these orders are queued for later execution or cancellation.  The limit-order book is the collection of queued orders.  These are characterized by direction (buy or sell), time of arrival, desired price, and size of order.  For liquidly traded assets, changes in the limit-order book occur every few milliseconds.  Under the open outcry system for trading securities, "specialists" held seats on the exchange and were charged to "make the market liquid" in whatever asset they were assigned.  They received orders, matched buyers and sellers, and sometimes bought or sold for their own accounts in order to facilitate trading. Because they could see the order flow, they could often detect upward or downward pressure on prices and could trade their own accounts to benefit from that.  For this reason, seats on the exchange were highly prized.  There are no seats on electronic exchanges.  The specialists have been replaced to some extent by high frequency traders, agents who submit and often cancel orders within fractions of seconds.  These traders argue that they provide liquidity.  Other traders on the exchange are not so sure that high frequency traders offer a net benefit.  Because electronic exchanges are a recent phenomenon, the construction of mathematical models to describe their behavior is in its infancy.  Consequently, it is difficult to pose and answer precise questions about the effect of different trading protocols.  Do the high frequency traders provide a net benefit to others trading on an exchange?  Would a transaction tax, which would dampen high frquency trading, create better prices for everyone else?  The difficulty to overcome in the construction of mathematical models for the inherently complex evolution of limit-order books is to capture essential features without creating a model that is too large and intricate to analyze. A second outcome of this research was to develop a proto-type model using ideas from the theory of queueing systems, originally developed for telephone traffic and later adapted to computer networks, that demonstrates the feasibility of constructing tractable yet realistic models of limit-order book dynamics.
