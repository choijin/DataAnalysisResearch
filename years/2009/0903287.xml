    <AbstractNarration>Information Science and Systems (33) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a revision of the existing curriculum at the El Paso Community College to meet current standards, creates a virtual reality site, and designs a local cyber-defense competition for students. The project goal is to improve the ITS Security Option program to assure that students enter employment in the Information Security field with enhanced technical competencies and soft skills such as team work, critical thinking and problem-solving. The project includes creation of a site in Second Life, a virtual 3-dimensional, synchronous, multi-user world, which provides students with opportunities to investigate real-life scenarios for Information Security skills development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curriculum is improved and enhanced to include more than technical skills development. By increasing activities that focus on problem solving, creative thinking, real-world experiences, team work, and communication, students are more prepared for the workplace. The project emphasizes soft skills that are necessary in today's rapidly changing knowledge-based economy. In addition, by using innovative virtual teaching strategies, the project engages different types of learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed improvements in the curriculum lead to additional opportunities for articulation with four-year institutions such as the University of Texas at El Paso and with K-12 schools. In addition, by increasing students' opportunity to develop problem-solving, analytical and creative skills, EPCC becomes a model for other technology programs. As a Hispanic Serving Institution located in the border region, EPCC is uniquely positioned to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM career paths.</AbstractNarration>
