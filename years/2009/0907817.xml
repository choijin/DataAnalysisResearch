<AbstractNarration>This is an ambitious project that has the potential to fill in important gaps in the overall picture of orogenesis in the central Andes, and of convergent-margin tectonism in general. The project is constructed around a well defined basic-science question, did the Andes rise in a rapid pulse, or did they rise gradually? Producing elevations and crustal thicknesses of the magnitude found in this study area remains a key problem in continental tectonics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This question provides a foundation from which the PIs develop a variety of linked projects, including: 3-D structural analysis of fold-thrust belt shortening in the Andes, testing of new methods of paleo-elevation analysis, use of seismic studies to characterize the roots of the range (both in the deep crust and in the underlying mantle), creative use of petrologic and isotopic data to constrain thickened crust at times in the past. The project has the potential to address 3-D mass balance issues during orogeny, as well as the impact of a rising mountain belt on continent-scale weather systems. Of note, to put the analysis of orographic weather studies in context, the PIs will also undertake a broader paleo-climate study. All of the questions to be studied are current and important, and are of interest across traditional disciplinary boundaries and, the research strategy as outlined has a high potential to answer the questions that it poses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As geographic barriers, mountains have shaped the history of climate and life on earth. The influence of mountains may not be more significant anywhere on Earth than in South America. The uplift of the Andes during the Cenozoic has been linked to continental-scale climate change, the reorganization of river drainage patterns and sediment deposition to create the modern-day Amazon system, and the development of Amazonian landscapes and ecosystems.     The details of the surface uplift history of the Andes that led to these changes are notoriously difficult to decipher. Though mountain building leaves a deep impression on the geological record, there exist only proxy (indirect) measures for determining the height of the mountains through time. As a result, the elevation history and its consequences on the surrounding continents are imprecise. The goal of this NSF-funded project was twofold&mdash;to evaluate the proxy measures for ancient elevations and to determine the response of the climate system to Andean uplift.     Today in the Andes, the isotopic composition (&delta;18O) of rain and stream waters decreases with elevation. Ancient rainwater isotopic compositions are preserved in nodules found in ancient soils.  Geologists have used the isotopic composition of these ancient soils and this relationship between modern &delta;18O and elevation to infer past Andean elevations including a very abrupt rise of 2.5 kilometers during the late Miocene. This history of rapid rise is very much dependent on the modern isotope-elevation relationship. Our work included both field sampling and climate modeling to investigate this relationship and the controls on rain and stream water isotopic compositions in the central Andes.     From a multi-year sampling campaign of natural waters, we documented the &delta;18O of rain and stream waters across the Bolivian Andes.  While &delta;18O does generally decrease with elevation, on interannual timescales &delta;18O variations are tied to changes in continental-scale climate dynamics with upwind precipitation anomalies having the largest effect. Furthermore, on the Bolivian plateau itself, monthly &delta;18O variability in precipitation among Altiplano stations can exceed 10&permil; and cannot be explained by elevation or source variability, indicating a nontrivial role for local scale effects on short timescales. Finally, stream water &delta;18O on the plateau possess low values not observed in precipitation, which signals enrichment through surface evaporation. Our climate modeling indicates that evaporative conditions have persisted across the plateau throughout its uplift, raising the possibility that geology archives of &delta;18O archives are not an accurate reflection of the isotopic composition of rainfall and, consequently, of past elevation.     We also used climate models to explore the influence of Andean uplift on continental climate. Andean surface uplift leads to changes in low-level atmospheric circulation and an increase in precipitation along the eastern Andean flank which influences isotopic source and amount effects. Simulated changes in Andean rainfall &delta;18O and climate are not systematic with an increase in surface elevation, but are instead a function of orographic thresholds that abruptly change regional climate. As a result, the use of modern lapse rates to estimate past elevations is not justified. In fact, abrupt changes in rainfall &delta;18O triggered by orographic thresholds could account for the entire &delta;18O depletion that has previously been inferred to represent abrupt surface uplift.     Our climate modeling also demonstrates that factors other than surface uplift have likely influenced rainfall &delta;18O  across the central Andes. Among these, long-term global climate change through reduction in atmospheric CO2 has likely led to a systematic decrease in rainfall &delta;18O. Ignoring this trend has likely led to an underestimate of past Andean elevatio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
