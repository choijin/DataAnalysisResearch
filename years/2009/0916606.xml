    <AbstractNarration>Computer technologies play an important role in modern medicine and life&lt;br/&gt;sciences, especially in diagnostic imaging, human genome study, treatment&lt;br/&gt;optimization, and medical data management. Many computational problems &lt;br/&gt;arising in the field of biomedicine call for efficient and good quality &lt;br/&gt;algorithmic solutions. This project aims to develop new geometric &lt;br/&gt;computing and algorithmic techniques for solving computational problems &lt;br/&gt;in biomedical and engineering applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates a number of geometric optimization problems &lt;br/&gt;that are theoretically challenging and practically relevant. The target &lt;br/&gt;problems belong to fundamental topics of computational geometry, such as &lt;br/&gt;geometric partition, covering, shaping, approximation, motion planning, &lt;br/&gt;and clustering; they also arise in important applied areas such as &lt;br/&gt;radiation cancer treatment, medical imaging, biology, computer-aided &lt;br/&gt;manufacturing, and data mining. Some of the algorithms and software &lt;br/&gt;developed during the preliminary studies of this research have produced &lt;br/&gt;significantly better solutions for real application problems (for example, &lt;br/&gt;much improved radiation cancer therapy plans over those computed by the&lt;br/&gt;current commercial radiation treatment planning systems). The research &lt;br/&gt;will draw diverse techniques from other theoretical areas such as graph &lt;br/&gt;algorithms, combinatorial optimization, discrete mathematics, and &lt;br/&gt;operations research. It will also provide a rich source of interesting &lt;br/&gt;new problems/questions and new ideas to prod further development of &lt;br/&gt;algorithmic techniques in computational geometry and other theoretical &lt;br/&gt;areas. This project is expected to generate broader impacts beyond &lt;br/&gt;computational geometry and even computer science. It will produce &lt;br/&gt;efficient and effective algorithms and software for solving key problems &lt;br/&gt;in radiation cancer therapy and surgery, medical imaging, biology, and &lt;br/&gt;other applied areas. Furthermore, the newly developed algorithms and &lt;br/&gt;software will be incorporated into practical applications such as &lt;br/&gt;clinical radiation cancer treatment systems. Hence, this research will &lt;br/&gt;help unite and integrate the power of computational geometry, computer &lt;br/&gt;algorithms, and modern biomedicine for diagnostic imaging, radiation &lt;br/&gt;cancer treatment, and other applications, and improve the quality of &lt;br/&gt;life for the patients.</AbstractNarration>
