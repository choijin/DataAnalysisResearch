<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the development of a graduate training program in information security and privacy. Trainees will learn to translate the foundational principles of security and privacy into information technologies based on a deep understanding of social, economic, behavioral and public policy implications and requirements. The program will produce a cadre of technologists and scientists who can integrate technical, legal, financial, and psychological knowledge into practical solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program has at its core a new paradigm for building trustworthy systems, where technical security issues are seen only as one spoke in a wheel, along with equally important legal, social, psychological, policy, and economics issues. Trainees with this interdisciplinary background will join academia, industry, create new companies and drive public policy. A unique bridging program with local and national minority serving institutions and organizations will ensure that the program recruits and retains a diverse set of trainees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The INSPIRE program had two project objectives: provision of interdisciplinary training and career preparation in cybersecurity and contribution to a self-sustaining center or institutional structure on cybersecurity at NYU once the IGERT award ended.  15  students underwent interdisciplinary training. An external assessment confirmed that the majority of program graduates confirmed the interdisciplinary nature of their graduate training and the extent to which it prepared them to assume positions that benefited from a multidisciplinary background in the industry. Some labeled their training "shifted my focus entirely" or "transformational".   The INSPIRE program contributed to the institutionalization of an interdisciplinary cybersecurity focus at NYU. At least 15 non-STEM courses that added a module or lesson on cyber security.   A new interdisciplinary Masters program was created in "Cyber Security Risk and Strategy"  The program is run jointly by the Law School and the Engineering School and is genuinely multidisciplinary with students coming from Law and Computer Science.  The MS is starting in May 2018 and is expected to run a with a cohort of 30 students.   Also,  the project resulted in the establishment of  The NYU Center for Cybersecurity (CCS) is an interdisciplinary research institute dedicated to training the current and future generations of cybersecurity professionals and to shaping the public discourse and policy, legal, and technological landscape on issues of cybersecurity. NYU CCS is a collaboration between  NYU Tandon School of Engineering, NYU School of Law and NYU Wagner School of Policy as well as other NYU schools and departments.
