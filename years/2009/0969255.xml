<AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative research grant is the development of a novel laser-based surface engineering technique to enhance the ductility of non-crystalline materials, primarily metals. Laser interference patterning will be employed to produce modified regions of periodic lines or dots of localized ultrafine grain structure with residual stresses on the surface of these materials. The major objectives of the research are (i) to identify the thermo-physical effects associated with the interaction of modulated laser intensity during interference patterning and (ii) to characterize the modulated microstructure, crystallization dynamics, and distribution of residual stresses during laser patterning. These objectives will be instrumental in establishing the role of surface modification on enhancing global plasticity of the non-crystalline materials. Finally, a computational model based on the thermo-physical interactions associated with laser interference patterning of non-crystalline material surfaces for tailoring the effects will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project on laser interference patterning will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in ductilization of inherently brittle non-crystalline alloys leading to wider acceptance of these materials for advanced structural applications. The research will elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of plasticity enhancement of non-crystalline materials through design of periodic surface structures consisting of original non-crystalline regions and regions of ultrafine grain structure with residual stresses.  Through synergistic computational and experimental approach, the research is expected to establish a methodology for design and synthesis of next generation structural materials system. Furthermore, the collaborative project will provide opportunities for students to work on novel and advanced processing methods and materials and will help prepare diverse and capable workforce of next generation global scientists/engineers.</AbstractNarration>
