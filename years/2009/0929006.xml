<AbstractNarration>The RDE Collaborative Dissemination Project's objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To increase awareness of how people with disabilities can be successful in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. To increase awareness of strategies and resources for making STEM welcoming and accessible to people with disabilities, including the findings, products, and opportunities of RDE-funded projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. To increase collaboration of RDE-funded projects with respect to dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team will lead a community of representatives of RDE-funded projects, who will design project products, share strategies for making resources accessible, and explore possibilities and develop plans for cooperating on dissemination efforts.  They will create three project products and will utilize the Internet, public television, and existing networks to share what works and what does not to increase the successful participation of people with disabilities in STEM.  All project products will be designed to be accessible to people with disabilities.  Products include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Website:  A password-protected collaborative 'wiki' that engages RDE-funded projects in developing products and dissemination plans, including those for sharing information about projects, outcomes, and materials on the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Video:  A video that shows how high school, college, and graduate students and employees with disabilities succeed in STEM and highlights the RDE-funded Alliances for Students with Disabilities in STEM as resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brochure: A concise brochure that includes information and results regarding all RDE-funded Alliances for Students with Disabilities in STEM and pointers to the project website for the project video and additional information and resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All project products will promote creative and potentially transformative concepts. The project evaluation will document (1) high quality, useful, and accessible resources; (2) effective distribution methods; and (3) increased engagement of RDE projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The external formative and summative evaluation for this project will be conducted by Dr. Gerald Gillmore.</AbstractNarration>
