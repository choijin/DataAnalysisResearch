    <AbstractNarration>In July 2009, the twenty-first international conference entitled&lt;br/&gt;Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) will be held&lt;br/&gt;at the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation of the Johannes&lt;br/&gt;Kepler University in Linz, Austria. As in the past, there will be&lt;br/&gt;nine plenary speakers, about twenty-five contributed talks, and two&lt;br/&gt;poster/software demonstration sessions. The continuing success of the&lt;br/&gt;annual FPSAC conferences stems in part from their considerable&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary breadth---linking leading researchers in&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial mathematics with strong researchers in allied fields&lt;br/&gt;such as pure and applied mathematics, computer science, physics, and&lt;br/&gt;biology. The span of this conference series is unique among&lt;br/&gt;international conferences with an emphasis on combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as its breadth, a second distinguishing characteristic of&lt;br/&gt;FPSAC conferences is the concerted effort to recognize and encourage&lt;br/&gt;outstanding young scientists. This is accomplished in part by&lt;br/&gt;choosing at least one plenary speaker to be an ``emerging'' star and&lt;br/&gt;by ensuring that talented young researchers are well represented among&lt;br/&gt;the speakers selected for contributed talks. Another special feature&lt;br/&gt;of the FPSAC conferences is a continuing effort to emphasize&lt;br/&gt;inclusiveness among participants. The conference seeks to draw&lt;br/&gt;substantial participation from groups which have been traditionally&lt;br/&gt;under-represented in the mathematical sciences. FPSAC 2009 will be an&lt;br/&gt;excellent opportunity for these students and junior researchers to&lt;br/&gt;make both domestic and international contacts that will be of great&lt;br/&gt;value in their developing careers. This grant support their&lt;br/&gt;attendence. Additionally, because of the variety of past locations&lt;br/&gt;(2008: Chile, 2007: China, for example), FPSAC draws a truly&lt;br/&gt;international crowd.</AbstractNarration>
