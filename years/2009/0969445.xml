<AbstractNarration>Using results from the now-operational Large Hadron Collider, this project will probe the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking and test the twin theoretical ideas of the Higgs mechanism and supersymmetry. By examining extensions of the Higgs sector, the group will find ways to test the minimal models of supersymmetry and to distinguish among various models using data. This will also tie into tests of lepton flavor violation through Higgs decays, a phenomenon deeply connected to the ongoing efforts to study neutrino masses and mixings. Finally, connections will be explored between the physics of the Higgs boson, supersymmetry and the astrophysical problems of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the universe. In so doing, the group seeks to increase our understanding of physics which is not readily measured in experiment, such as the source of the neutrino masses and the properties of the dark matter correlated with experimental signatures for SUSY at the LHC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simultaneously, this project includes continued outreach to the Notre Dame academic community through new and innovative courses in modern physics for non-science majors, work on improving academic advising throughout the university, and programs designed to increase the number of Notre Dame students pursuing graduate studies in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This is coupled to continued outreach to the greater Northern Indiana community through public lectures and planetarium shows on the Notre Dame campus, and interactions with local high schools through the QuarkNet program.</AbstractNarration>
