<AbstractNarration>Full Center Proposal (Phase III) for an I/UCRC for the Center for Advanced Processing and Packaging Studies (CAPPS) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0968960 Ohio State University; Steven Schwartz &lt;br/&gt;0968955 North Carolina State University; Kandivan Sandeep&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;CAPPS is proposing a Phase III support (third five-year period) for the Center, including support for center personnel, evaluation and research.  The proposed Center is a multi-university Center comprised of the Ohio State University (lead) and North Carolina State University (NCSU).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAPPS was initiated in 1983 as an NSF IUCRC program, and since 2003 has been operating solely with industry member support. The major objectives of the Center include: enhancing the knowledge base in developing new and novel emerging food processing/packaging technologies; conducting research to ensure the safety of implementing non-thermal and novel processing technologies within the US; addressing industrially relevant food processing and packaging problems facing the industry; and, training students and other personnel to meet the future needs of the US food processing/packaging.&lt;br/&gt;Although the University of California at Davis is not actively seeking support as an official site, it will remain active within the Center contributing research expertise and facilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAPPS will create a program focus in food processing and packaging. With NSF and industry support, the Center anticipates that the collaborative efforts among faculty within the Center will result in advances well beyond what individual laboratories or a single institution could achieve. Participation by industry will require that fundamental advances in food processing and packaging be translated to in-house industry research or possess potential commercial applications. CAPPS will continue to retain company memberships, recruit new industry members and obtain participation from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

CAPPS was started over 25 years ago as a IUCRC/NSF centers and continued as a graduated center through 2016. CAPPS was the 13th IUCRC of 150 centers created with initial funding from NSF, and has achieved a significant level of seniority. The CAPPS membership is as strong and is continuing to operate as a university/industry consortium.     The Mission of CAPPS is to conduct industrially relevant, cooperative, world class research as needed to develop advanced technologies and novel solutions for processing and packaging food and beverage products.  The Objectives are: to enhance safety, quality and nutritional properties for food products processed using new and novel technologies; to characterize emerging processes for extending the shelf-life of foods, and to assure the integrity and functionality of food packaging.     The faculty expertise at the CAPPS institutions, include food chemistry, biochemistry, nutrition, microbiology and engineering, provides outstanding strengths for conducting research. Current programs focus on alternative processing technologies, innovative ingredient formulations, bioactive components of foods and the latest packaging concepts. The Center encourages an interdisciplinary approach to solving industry challenges.     The Industry Advisory Board members have emphasizes the benefits of CAPPS membership. For example, investments in CAPPS membership result in equal internal investments in projects initiated by CAPPS. Member companies indicate that significant R&amp;D cost savings occur during development of processes and new products. Representatives from member companies have stated that relatively small investments through membership dues have generated significant returns in terms of research outcomes.     The NSF/IUCRC initiation of CAPPS has contributed to the success of this consortium and the continued collaboration between the university partners with food industry companies.
