<AbstractNarration>The Museum of Science, Boston (MOS) and its primary collaborators, the Science Museum of Minnesota (St. Paul, MN) and the Exploratorium (San Francisco, CA), are continuing and expanding the Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE Net), which has been in operation since 2005. NISE Net has established a national infrastructure of over one-hundred hands-on science centers and universities within seven regional hubs with the goal of fostering public awareness, engagement and understanding of nanoscale science and engineering (NSE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this undertaking, NISE Net partners have: &lt;br/&gt;- created a nation-wide set of annual events called NanoDays; &lt;br/&gt;- developed dozens of interactive exhibits, media-based products, programs, and public forums based on NSE; &lt;br/&gt;- generated new knowledge about the design for learning about NSE, its applications, and societal implications; &lt;br/&gt;- produced a network that involves informal educators and researchers; and&lt;br/&gt;- developed a Web site for professionals, www.nisenet.org, that includes several resources for educators and researchers, including a catalog of educational products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the next five years (2010 - 2014), NISE Net will continue to develop new educational products, deepen the involvement of current partnerships in nanoscale informal science education, and expand the number of partners overall to 300 organizations. The advisory committee, content steering committee, regional hubs, and other work groups will continue to develop collaborative relationships between museums and university-based NSE research centers, including Materials Research Science and Engineering Research Centers (MRSECs) and Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers (NSECs).  A Diversity, Equity, and Access group will actively support, foster, and encourage the NISE Net's efforts to reach diverse audiences with regard to geography, dis/ability, gender, race/ethnicity, language, and income.  Four research studies will be conducted: Partnership and Network, Institutional Change, Learning Progressions, and Evidence-Based Decision Making.</AbstractNarration>

NISE Net includes more than 600 museums,&nbsp;universities, and other organizations. The&nbsp;Network is organized into regions, each with a&nbsp;regional hub leader that serves as primary point&nbsp;of contact and provides advice, encouragement,&nbsp;and support. Network partners work together to engage&nbsp;the public in learning about current science,&nbsp;engineering, and technology. Collectively, its efforts give the Network broad reach to diverse&nbsp;public audiences across the United States. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>NISE Net encourages national,&nbsp;regional, and local collaborations. After&nbsp;working together on NISE Net activities,&nbsp;partners continue to collaborate on other&nbsp;initiatives, building on and expanding the&nbsp;Network and its impact. The Network has had particular success&nbsp;fostering museum-scientist partnerships.&nbsp;Thanks to ongoing local efforts, there are&nbsp;many more opportunities for the public&nbsp;to learn about current science and meet&nbsp;researchers. At the same time, scientists and&nbsp;students have more opportunities to develop&nbsp;communication skills, share their work, and&nbsp;build public support for and understanding of&nbsp;research. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Educational Resources</strong></p> <p>NISE Net created high-impact, high quality&nbsp;exhibits, events, programs, and media.&nbsp;Working together, the Network&rsquo;s national team&nbsp;of educational product developers and scientists&nbsp;overcame the significant challenges of nano&nbsp;as a topic for interactive, informal learning&nbsp;experiences. NISE Net&rsquo;s website offers hundreds of&nbsp;open-source educational resources that suit&nbsp;different educational contexts, engage diverse&nbsp;target audiences, and convey a range of content. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>NanoDays is NISE Net&rsquo;s&nbsp;signature event&mdash;an&nbsp;annual celebration&nbsp;of nanoscale science, engineering, and&nbsp;technology.&nbsp;NanoDays mobilized hundreds of partners across the country to engage&nbsp;staff, volunteers, and members of the&nbsp;public in learning about nanoscale science,&nbsp;engineering, and technology. From 2008-&nbsp;2015, NanoDays reached over 7 million&nbsp;people, at annual NanoDays events and&nbsp;in related programming throughout&nbsp;the year.</p> <p>The <em>Nano </em>mini-exhibition is only 400 square feet, but it engages&nbsp;visitors in a range of key concepts&nbsp;about nanoscale science, engineering, and&nbsp;technology through interactive components&nbsp;and real phenomena.&nbsp;From 2012 to 2015, <em>Nano</em> was hosted by 149&nbsp;sites across the United States, reaching 23&nbsp;million people. Each year, over 10 million&nbsp;more people visit the exhibition.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Knowledge</strong></p> <p>Knowledge generated in this project is presented in research and evaluation reports, practical guides and professional development sources, and in the educational products themselves. At the end of the project there were 438 files in the www.nisenet.org online library associated with nano and NISE Net, categorized as:</p> <ul> <li>141 programs and      activities</li> <li>&nbsp; 21      exhibit files</li> <li>148 media files</li> <li>&nbsp;97      professional development resources</li> <li>&nbsp;63      research and evaluation resources</li> </ul> <p><strong>Broader impacts</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;NISE Net has had a major impact by&nbsp;incorporating current science into regular&nbsp;museum exhibits and programs, by improving&nbsp;the practices and skills of educators and&nbsp;scientists, by generating and disseminating new&nbsp;knowledge related to informal learning, and by&nbsp;creating lasting, valuable relationships among&nbsp;individuals and organizations. The relationships&nbsp;that NISE Net has fostered, and the practices&nbsp;and resources the Network has disseminated,&nbsp;will help partners engage public audiences in areas of current research for years to come.&nbsp;Professional partners have integrated broader&nbsp;lessons learned from NISE Net into other work&nbsp;they do. For many partners, Network products&nbsp;and resources serve as general models for&nbsp;informal education.</p> <p>&nbsp;NISE Net has also encouraged collaborations&nbsp;between museums and community&nbsp;organizations as a way to engage new and under-represented&nbsp;audiences in learning about nano. <em>Explore&nbsp;Science: Zoom into Nano</em> resources have helped&nbsp;Network partners work with national and&nbsp;local youth-serving organizations, libraries,&nbsp;schools, and other community organizations&nbsp;to reach underserved audiences, including&nbsp;low-income, female, and minority groups.&nbsp;After participating in the Network&rsquo;s Museums&nbsp;&amp; Community Partnerships initiative, 99%&nbsp;of professionals reported that they valued&nbsp;partnerships between museums and&nbsp;community organizations, and 94% reported&nbsp;being more likely to engage in similar future&nbsp;collaborations. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;NISE Net has transitioned to an ongoing identity&nbsp;as the <em>National Informal STEM Education&nbsp;Network</em>. The Network&rsquo;s new projects leverage&nbsp;the capacity and relationships of hundreds of&nbsp;organizations across the United States, built in&nbsp;over a decade of work together on nanoscale&nbsp;science, engineering, and technology.&nbsp;At the end of NSF funding, NISE Net continues to broaden its impact on professional and public audiences by engaging them learning about new areas of current science and technology. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/04/2017<br>      Modified by: Lawrence&nbsp;Bell</p> </div>

Thanks to ongoing local efforts, there are many more opportunities for the public to learn about current science and meet researchers. At the same time, scientists and students have more opportunities to develop communication skills, share their work, and build public support for and understanding of research.    Educational Resources  NISE Net created high-impact, high quality exhibits, events, programs, and media. Working together, the Network?s national team of educational product developers and scientists overcame the significant challenges of nano as a topic for interactive, informal learning experiences. NISE Net?s website offers hundreds of open-source educational resources that suit different educational contexts, engage diverse target audiences, and convey a range of content.       NanoDays is NISE Net?s signature event&mdash;an annual celebration of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. NanoDays mobilized hundreds of partners across the country to engage staff, volunteers, and members of the public in learning about nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. From 2008- 2015, NanoDays reached over 7 million people, at annual NanoDays events and in related programming throughout the year.  The Nano mini-exhibition is only 400 square feet, but it engages visitors in a range of key concepts about nanoscale science, engineering, and technology through interactive components and real phenomena. From 2012 to 2015, Nano was hosted by 149 sites across the United States, reaching 23 million people. Each year, over 10 million more people visit the exhibition.   Knowledge  Knowledge generated in this project is presented in research and evaluation reports, practical guides and professional development sources, and in the educational products themselves. At the end of the project there were 438 files in the www.nisenet.org online library associated with nano and NISE Net, categorized as:  141 programs and      activities   21      exhibit files 148 media files  97      professional development resources  63      research and evaluation resources   Broader impacts   NISE Net has had a major impact by incorporating current science into regular museum exhibits and programs, by improving the practices and skills of educators and scientists, by generating and disseminating new knowledge related to informal learning, and by creating lasting, valuable relationships among individuals and organizations. The relationships that NISE Net has fostered, and the practices and resources the Network has disseminated, will help partners engage public audiences in areas of current research for years to come. Professional partners have integrated broader lessons learned from NISE Net into other work they do. For many partners, Network products and resources serve as general models for informal education.   NISE Net has also encouraged collaborations between museums and community organizations as a way to engage new and under-represented audiences in learning about nano. Explore Science: Zoom into Nano resources have helped Network partners work with national and local youth-serving organizations, libraries, schools, and other community organizations to reach underserved audiences, including low-income, female, and minority groups. After participating in the Network?s Museums &amp; Community Partnerships initiative, 99% of professionals reported that they valued partnerships between museums and community organizations, and 94% reported being more likely to engage in similar future collaborations.        NISE Net has transitioned to an ongoing identity as the National Informal STEM Education Network. The Network?s new projects leverage the capacity and relationships of hundreds of organizations across the United States, built in over a decade of work together on nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. At the end of NSF funding, NISE Net continues to broaden its impact on professional and public audiences by engaging them learning about new areas of current science and technology.
