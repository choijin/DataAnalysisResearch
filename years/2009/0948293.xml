<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. John Morris of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Prof. Morris' research program focuses on the application of molecular beams to investigate the interactions between gas phase molecules of atmospheric significance and organic surfaces. The research discoveries will further molecular level understanding of how common atmospheric pollutants react on surfaces of environmentally important organic materials, including surfactant-coated water droplets or aerosols, soot particles, and polymers. The project will provide excellent educational opportunities for students, including some from under represented groups, desiring to work at the forefront of environmental science.</AbstractNarration>

A primary challenge in the field of gas-surface reaction dynamics is to develop a complete mechanistic understanding of interfacial processes, from the initial impact and accommodation to product formation and desorption. This challenge is particularly formidable for atmospheric gases colliding with organic surfaces, where the complex nature of the interface and high reactivity of the gases can result in a broad range of reaction pathways. During this grant period, we have employed molecular beam scattering methods to the study of collisions of key atmospheric gases on model surfaces to uncover the molecular-level details of reactions.

Together, these methods have helped in the development of a comprehensive description of the transformation of reactants into products at the gas-organic surface interface and provided an unprecedented level of insight into how gases react in the environment.  Oxidation at organic surfaces. Organic particulates and aerosols are abundant in the troposphere. The surfaces of most particles are initially hydrophobic, but reactions with oxidants such as O3, NO3, and OH render them hydrophilic by incorporating polar functional groups into the materials. Such reactions are important because they affect the fate of both particulate matter and the concentration of pollutants throughout the atmosphere. In addition, reactions between oxidants and organic compounds affect the balance between incident and outgoing radiation levels across the planet.  The focus of our NSF-funded project has been on building a more fundamental understanding of interfacial reactions relevant to the fate of atmospheric gases. For example, the initial step in the reaction of O3 with surface vinyl groups is addition across the double bond (primary ozonide formation); however, it was previously unknown how the rates of ozonide formation depend on the initial surface structure or polarity. For NO3, research suggests that surface reactions produce nitrates; however, the presence and stability of these groups at the gas-surface interface had yet to be explored. OH, the most reactive oxidant, likely abstracts hydrogen at organic surfaces; however, the reaction probability and its dependence on surface structure have not been systematically investigated. Our studies are among the first to combine molecular beam techniques and model organic surfaces to learn about how surface structure and functionality affect the collision and reaction dynamics of atmospherically-relevant molecules on surfaces.  Intellectual Merit.  During this finding period, we have made several significant contributions to the field of gas-surface reaction dynamics. Specifically, we have shown that interfacial accommodation depends on a sensitive balance between surface mass, attractive forces between the gas and the surface, and the rigidity of the surface. Each of these factors is affected in significant ways by the functional groups present on the surface of an organic material.  These efforts are leading to a more complete understanding of how structure, density, mass, orientation, and polarity affect the outcome of gas-surface interactions. We have published 12 peer-reviewed journal articles as part of this NSF-funded work. These publications are summarized in a recent review article on our work.1 In addition, the lead investigator organized a symposium at the American Chemical Society national meeting (Sp.
