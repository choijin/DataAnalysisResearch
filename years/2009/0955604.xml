<AbstractNarration>This project combines dynamical systems theory and computational topology in constructing and utilizing rigorous numerical techniques for the study of dynamics in model systems.  The primary focus is on constructing, extending and optimizing rigorous numerical techniques and investigating additional settings where computational topology may be used effectively to measure dynamical systems.  When possible, the computational results are verified rigorously, typically through the incorporation of error bounds and the use of topological tools.  The proposed projects include extending existing techniques for computer-assisted studies and proofs for discrete time dynamical systems and forcing theorems for braided stationary solutions.  Two more sets of projects are proposed in areas where the desired rigorous results are still out of reach, although some initial progress has been made.  These include measuring parameter sets for systems in a specified family which exhibit chaotic behavior, and the study of spatial and spatio-temporal pattern formation and evolution using computational homology.  There are many open research projects in these areas (both shorter and longer term) including the study of some very interesting and fundamental modeling questions concerning appropriate spatial and other scales in models.  This grant will fund a teacher-researcher postdoctoral position, undergraduate research projects, and support teaching and research group activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems models are being used throughout society.  Some examples include weather models used for hurricane prediction and population models used to study environmental effects on population size and persistence.  Currently, many researchers study dynamical systems like these using high powered computer simulations and statistical techniques.  On the other end of the spectrum, mathematicians have been able to decipher highly complicated dynamics in more abstract mathematical models.  The work described in this proposal aims to serve as a bridge between these two approaches.  More specifically, the investigator and her collaborators focus on the development of computational techniques that use sophisticated mathematical tools and yield mathematically rigorous results.  The mathematical tools come from the fields of algebraic topology, analysis, numerical analysis, and dynamical systems theory and may be used to decipher some of the phenomena of interest in the studied systems.  Prior progress in studying complicated dynamics in models from population ecology and heat convection motivates these continued studies.  In addition to continuing work with existing collaborators, the investigator will mentor a postdoctoral teacher-researcher and advise undergraduate research projects in these areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dynamical systems and computational topology are two fields of mathematical research that offer a number of interesting research projects accessible to people with a variety of backgrounds.  The main focus of this project is the development of computational techniques that can be applied to a variety of interesting dynamical systems from biology, ecology, and the other sciences in order to extract information.  While round-off and other errors are typically unavoidable in numerical studies of dynamical systems, topological tools, and in particular Conley index theory, are well-suited for extracting information from systems containing small, bounded error.  This approach combines ideas from dynamical systems, topology, analysis, graph theory, and numerical analysis and has led to a set of rigorous numerical approaches that are yielding results for a variety of systems.   One driving force behind continuing this work is that most dynamical systems that arise from applications are interesting because they are very complicated.  They may be high, or even infinite, dimensional and/or contain fractal invariant sets exhibiting chaotic dynamics.  Capturing dynamics in these systems often requires a numerical resolution that, although finite, may be large.  In addition, some very interesting dynamical structures still defy rigorous numerical detection.  Work on this project has resulted in algorithms and code to automatically construct symbolic dynamics which serves as a catalogue of detected dynamics and from which lower bounds on complexity, as measured by topological entropy, may be computed.  This and related developments of research code aided studies of benchmark systems as well as the Kot-Schaffer integrodifference operator and Leslie model from ecology as well as models constructed by supported undergraduate research students.   In addition to receiving teaching mentorship, the two postdocs supported on this project gained experience co-mentoring undergraduate research students and leading new research in applied topological data analysis.  Topological tools and, in particular, persistent homology serve as the base for three studies of spatially explicit data sets.  The first focuses on phase contrast microscopy images of flickering red blood cells and uncovers new methods for classifying cells by functional age.  The second, studying micro-CT images of firn, or old snow data focuses on extracting a topologically accurate representation of the pore structure in these samples.  Work in this direction resulted in an approach for thresholding spatially explicit digital data while optimizing for topological accuracy and is also applicable to images from materials science and other areas.  Finally, groundwork for studying coupled-patch models and related data describing population growth and dispersal across a spatially discrete (patchy) environment will serve as a base for future studies.
