<AbstractNarration>Supercell-type thunderstorms, which embody a complex arrangement of long-lasting rotating updrafts and intense downdrafts, are known to be responsible for generating most intense tornadoes.  However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding mechanisms culminating in the actual focus and downward extension of stormscale rotation in the form of a damaging tornadic vortex.  Some working hypotheses link this process to the strength, thermodynamic stability (temperature) and spatial configuration of downdrafts in the lowest reaches of these storms, which are in-turn dependent on rates of evaporative cooling influenced by the type and size distributions of falling hydrometeors (chiefly rain and hail.)  Rigorous attempts have not yet been made to investigate the range of these microphysical precipitation characteristics beneath supercell thunderstorms.  The overarching goal of this project is to i) deploy multiple mobile disdrometers (instruments that measure the characteristic sizes and fallspeeds of precipitation particles) beneath supercell thunderstorms during the second Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes EXperiment (VORTEX2; a field program conducted over the central United States known as "tornado alley") in Spring 2010, ii) conduct a comprehensive analysis of both existing and newly-obtained disdrometer observations to determine microphysical characteristics in tornadic compared to nontornadic supercell thunderstorms, and iii) relate these results to contemporaneous high-resolution polarimetric Doppler radar observations.  Both disdrometers and polarimetric Doppler radar can detect (or in the case of radar, infer) the size distributions of falling hydrometeors.  While preliminary analyses have provided some insights about hydrometeor distributions and their impacts on evolution of supercell storm features, a comprehensive analysis of a number of cases using well-placed high-resolution measurements has yet to be conducted and will be achieved in the course of this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This project will augment our knowledge about microphysical processes within supercell thunderstorms and may lead to improved short-term forecasts and warnings of life-threatening severe weather.  Since VORTEX2 hosts the largest number of polarimetric Doppler radars to ever monitor the full lifecycle of supercell thunderstorms, this experiment is an ideal laboratory to address these scientific questions.  At present, the lack of skill in forecasting and understanding microphysical processes is largely due to both the inadequate representation of microphysical processes and the lack of measurements.  This mobile deployment of disdrometers in VORTEX2 will provide by far the most comprehensive dataset of disdrometer and radar observations and analysis in supercell thunderstorms ever collected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The improvement of short-term forecasts and warnings of severe weather is strongly linked to the representation and understanding of the microphysical processes, which will be substantially extended by this work.  Results will be shared with the modeling community and integrated with other, existing VORTEX2 data sets.  Results will also be disseminated through presentations at conferences, seminars, and workshops as well as through publications in relevant professional journals.  Additional Broader Impacts will come through direct involvement of graduate students in collection and analysis of field datasets, as well as through enhanced classroom education at both undergraduate and graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>
