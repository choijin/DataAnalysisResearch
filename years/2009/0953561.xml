<AbstractNarration>The dynamic assembly and disassembly of proteins into molecular complexes lies at the heart of countless biological processes ranging from cell-to-cell communication to the assembly of viral particles.  However, almost everything known about the process of protein assembly into macromolecular machines comes from studying them in a test tube, isolated from the millions of other biological molecules present in cells.  This project will develop new optical microscopy tools for studying the nanoscale organization of multiple dynamic protein interactions within single living cells.  This work will take advantage of a process known as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to detect the binding of two proteins.  FRET allows observation of protein interactions through exchange of fluorescence energy between two fluorescent tags on the scale of five nanometers (~1/10,000,000th of an inch) and has become very popular in recent years to detect protein interactions.  One of the major limitations of FRET, however, is that it has only been applied to study the interactions between two proteins at a time, thereby limiting its utility for studying complex molecular assemblies.  This project will develop new methods and instrumentation to allow simultaneous detection of the interactions of four or more proteins in any combination.  In addition, this instrument will be able to image where they occur within the cell with superior resolution to conventional light microscopes.  This advance will be made by taking advantage of new methods for interfering patterns of light with the sample and then using computer reconstruction approaches to improve the subcellular resolution by about a factor of 2.5 over conventional microscopes.  By extending FRET microscopy to the coincident detection of multiple molecular interactions while simultaneously improving the resolution limit of the microscope, this project will provide a highly versatile tool for studying molecular assemblies within living cells.&lt;br/&gt;The project will enhance the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as provide summer research opportunities for high school teachers as part of the institution's Masters in Chemical Education program. The visiting teachers will develop new teaching and laboratory materials for South Dakota high school students, a high fraction of which are Native American.&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes from this work will be accessible through a new website (http://www.fretmicroscopy.org/) and wiki describing the instrumentation, methods and kinds of molecular information that can be recovered from them.  In addition, the software for performing the FRET calculations and image reconstructions will be distributed through this website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The assembly and disassembly of molecular machines is a fundamental process of all living things.  In this work, we developed cutting-edge microscopy methods to image the assembly of these molecular complexes within living cells.  This instrumentation is now being used to translate test-tube level biochemistry into new understanding of how these molecules function within living cells.      This project developed new instrumentation and has disseminated computational tools that are advancing the frontier of cell biology.  To achieve these outcomes, this project used an interdisciplinary approach that combined, physics, engineering and computer programming with molecular and cellular biology.  The physics cornerstone for this work was a process by which two fluorescent molecules within a moleculeÆs distance apart, exchange energy via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).  By combining knowledge about FRET with molecular biology we created an instrument capable of imaging multiple molecular interactions in the three-dimensional space of the living cell with unprecedented sensitivity.

Development of this instrument at a mid-sized university in South Dakota elevated research competiveness and this CAREER award has positioned the PI to make continued contributions to science and technology regionally, nationally and internationally.     This project enhanced the education and training of undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers as well as provided research experiences and development opportunities for high school teachers.  Specifically, the core research of instrument development, cell biology and molecular biology interfaced students and educators with in-the-lab experiences aimed at relating molecular motion and assembly to the biochemistry of life.  These activities translated into classroom and laboratory experiences for high school students, college students at SDSU and college students at a primarily undergraduate institution via Internet enabled experiences with the instrument.
