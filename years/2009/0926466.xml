<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to the University of Southern California (USC) for the support of a Workshop to Explore a Partnership for Nanotechnology Education, under the direction of Dr. James Murday of USC and Dr. Aldrin Sweeney, University of Central Florida (UCF) who are serving as co-chairs of the organizing committee. The workshop will be held April 26-28, 2009 at the Davidson Conference Center, on the campus of USC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent of this proposed workshop is to involve representatives from the various stakeholder communities, including K-12 teachers, community colleges, universities, continuing education, various professional communities, industry, foundations, state/local education authorities, and pertinent Federal agencies.  The workshop participants will be exposed to the present status of nanoscale education.  They will be charged with identifying opportunities/challenges associated with: a) the infrastructure needed to develop effective "nano" education; b) a functional stakeholder partnership(s) that addresses needs/opportunities, and c) mechanisms for that partnership(s) to provide information fo the state/local authorities, industrial leaders, and foundations to use in developing goals, strategies and programs toward effective nano education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop report will be prepared to transmit the workshop recommendation and it will also be published in a refereed journal to ensure the broadest dispersion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is being co-funded by the NSF Directorate for Engineering, Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources.</AbstractNarration>
