<AbstractNarration>The Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER) at the University of California Santa Barbara will install a new compact storage system to house its historically significant and biologically important algae and plant collections.  The collections include some of the oldest algal material from the central California coast and a rich diversity of plants from threatened and unique habitats.  The specimens will be transferred from the existing 60-year-old cases into the new storage system, which will provide enhanced accessibility and organization.  During the transfer, each specimen will be examined for damage, new labels will be prepared, and misidentified specimens will be corrected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new compact storage system and curation will have important impacts on research, teaching and outreach programs at the university and in the broader community. Scientists worldwide and the large environmental consulting community on the central coast that uses CCBER's resources will benefit from the increased accessibility and organization.  CCBER will also train graduate and undergraduate students in specimen preparation, curation, and the use of the collections as well as engaging local elementary students in activities focused on the plant and algae specimens.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In May 2009, the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER) at the University of California Santa Barbara was awarded a two-year Biological Research Collections grant from the National Science Foundation to install a new compact storage system in the herbarium and curate the higher plant and algae specimens.  The installation of the state of the art system increased our capacity for future collection growth.  The CCBER herbarium has approximately 100,000 specimens that were moved into the new compact storage system.     Our project contributed to the fields of biodiversity, systematics, and taxonomy. We were able to preserve and house our specimens in a better environment and to use our space more efficiently, allowing expansion and improved accessibility of the collections.  We also curated the collections thoroughly, increasing the accessibility and ease of using them. Finally, we have identified the backlog of specimens and made significant progress on the curation of important collections contributed by faculty and students during the past 50 years.      As part of the project, we hired two local consultants, two dedicated graduate students, and one undergraduate student to work on updating names of specimens, labeling, refoldering, and databasing.  Our project has provided opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and local environmental consultants as well, to learn about, contribute to, and become involved at CCBER.  One of the most rewarding aspects of the grant was the renewed interest in the CCBER plant and algae collections by students (current and former), California based consultants, and UCSB faculty whose valuable and historically important collections are housed at CCBER. In many cases, we received additional information to properly process and integrate the specimens into the main collection.    As part of the grant, CCBER launched a new curatorial internship program to recruit and train interested undergraduate students to assist with numerous curatorial activities.  We had over twenty students apply for the internship the first quarter!  Under the direction of CCBER staff and faculty, the students mounted specimens and assisted with curation of the collections.  We received a Research Experience for Undergraduates Supplement (REU) as part of our NSF grant.  The REU student worked under the guidance of the PI and project staff to learn about and work on the curation and conservation of plant specimens and to provide a leadership role for the Kids in Nature (KIN) environmental education program.   Since beginning this project, over 1200 K-12 students, faculty, consultants, community members, undergraduate and graduate students have used the collections due to the increased accessibility and organization of the herbarium specimens.
