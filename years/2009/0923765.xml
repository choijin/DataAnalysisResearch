<AbstractNarration>Studies of sensory cues and signals mediating plant-animal interactions have tended to focus only on one scale (community or individual) and one context (attraction). Relatively little is known as to how sensory cues modify behavior across scales and in different contexts. In this study, the tobacco hornworm hawkmoth (Manduca sexta) will be used to address the behavioral roles of relative humidity in foraging choices at different scales (local, habitat and landscape) and contexts (sex, age, nutritional status) and how these interact (additively, synergistically) to modify transitions in nectivorous behaviors of orientation, habitat selection and foraging and their implications for moth fitness. Cross-disciplinary training will be given to atmospheric science undergraduates from Cornell who will not only model relative humidity profiles at the study site, but will come to Arizona to learn, first hand, how climactic variables influence biological processes. This study will also support an outreach program that uses insects to teach biological principals to 2nd grade students in specially designed workshops and classroom visits, reaching over 5000 elementary school students most of whom are minority and of poverty economic status. These students will gain hands-on experience as to the importance of water and humidity in desert environments, how and why insects behave, and that bugs are inherently fascinating. Over 70 Undergraduate Preceptors will be trained in outreach teaching and how to convey an enthusiasm for science to the general public. An outreach program at Cornell ('Insectapalooza') is focused on the extraordinary biology of insects, and will guarantee a strong impact of this project on the public in two diverse cities. The undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows will receive cross-disciplinary training in ecophysiology, behavior, pollination biology, nutritional ecology and community structure, as well as one-on-one mentoring in experimental design, manuscript writing and the oral presentation of scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
