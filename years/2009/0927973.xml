<AbstractNarration>This project is a partnership among Hofstra University with the New York State Education Department (NYSED), and eight high-need school districts in New York (Amityville Union Free School District, Freeport Central School District, Hempstead Union Free School District, Longwood Central School District, Roosevelt Union Free School District, Uniondale Union Free School District, William Floyd Central School District, and Wyandanch Union Free School District). Research and evaluation activities are being conducted by the Center for Advanced Study in Education (CASE) at the City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate Center. Approximately 6,000 students, 46 middle school mathematics and science teachers, eight principals, and five higher education STEM disciplinary faculty participate in the Project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary mission of MiSP is to improve middle school student achievement in mathematics. The Project is rigorously developing, implementing, and researching an innovative and potentially transformative model that infuses mathematics into eighth-grade science education. Employing mathematical methods in science instruction would have great benefits both for mathematics and science. For mathematics, it would ensure that students see the mathematics they study actually being used, and would enhance their learning. The infused mathematics would also help transform the primarily descriptive instruction currently used in middle school science into more inferential and analytical instruction, and would therefore inform science understanding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Enhance student learning by deepening the mathematics-into-science infusion model.&lt;br/&gt;2. Enhance the operational features of the infusion model by applying Project criteria to the development of prototypical lessons and to associated professional development.&lt;br/&gt;3. Implement MiSP in authentic middle school science settings in eight low-performing schools.&lt;br/&gt;4. Conduct an experimental study of the infusion model that (a) collects evidence of the feasibility of implementing MiSP; (b) assesses Project impact on teacher knowledge, instructional behaviors, and attitudes; (c) assesses Project impact on student attitudes and academic achievement; (d) refines the conceptual and operational features of MiSP; and (e) in general, develops new knowledge regarding contextualizing mathematics in "real world problems."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Project model, prototypical curricula, and research results, as well as a primer for retooling existing science curricula to include mathematics, will be widely disseminated by NYSED and Pearson/Prentice Hall, Inc., a highly regarded commercial publisher with a national STEM presence. Learning opportunities will be sustained by partner districts and NYSED.</AbstractNarration>
