<AbstractNarration>The Gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta, is an unusual fish that excretes urea as its primary nitrogen waste product in distinct pulses, measured by a sudden increase in the appearance of urea in the surrounding water. A urea transporter has been cloned from toadfish gill (tUT) that is similar in amino acid sequence to mammalian urea transporters and the pulse of urea is believed to be due to the periodic activation of tUT, allowing for the movement of urea from the blood, across the gill, into the water. How tUT is turned on and off is not well understood, however, but research to this point has determined that the stress hormone, cortisol, and the neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-HT), are involved. High levels of cortisol appear to prevent tUT activation while 5-HT stimulates tUT function. The action of 5-HT appears to be mediated by a serotonin receptor subtype with pharmacological characteristics similar to mammalian serotonin type 2A (5-HT2A) receptors. This project aims to further examine the regulation of tUT by investigating how cortisol and 5-HT control tUT function and determine whether the actions of cortisol and 5-HT influence each other. Molecular techniques and in vitro tissue preparations will be used in parallel with whole animal studies to test the hypothesis that tUT function is controlled directly by 5-HT and indirectly by cortisol. These studies will also test the hypothesis that toadfish 5-HT2A receptors in the gill are involved in tUT activation and these receptors are not able to activate tUT when cortisol levels are high. The findings of this project will expand our understanding of nitrogen waste metabolism and excretion in fish and terrestrial organisms. In addition, results of this research will provide insight into the interactions between 5HT and cortisol, signals that are central to several human disorders. University of Miami has a diverse student body and this project will provide research experiences for students who are underrepresented in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ammonia is the direct by-product of protein breakdown.  Terrestrial organisms use energy to convert ammonia into a less toxic form, urea, using the ornithine-urea cycle (O-UC).   Aquatic organisms can excrete toxic ammonia across their gill without detriment, although some fish, for example, the Gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta, use energy to produce and excrete predominantly urea and do so when exposed to environmental stressors such as crowding, confinement, air or ammonia. The urea is excreted in distinct pulses, measured by a sudden increase in the appearance of urea in the surrounding water, suggesting the periodic activation or insertion of a selective urea transporter in the gill.  While this transporter is similar to those found in the mammalian kidney, the pulsatile nature of its activation is unique.  The objective of this project was to investigate the control of pulsatile urea excretion in toadfish and, based on preliminary data, test the central hypothesis that the toadfish urea transporter (tUT) function is controlled directly by the neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-HT) and indirectly by the stress hormone, cortisol.   This research project resulted in 14 peer-reviewed publications, one of which is an invited review, with two additional manuscripts in various stages of preparation.  The intellectual merit of this project is extensive.   Some of our major findings were: (i) several glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) are upstream of the coding region for tUT; (ii) treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (Prozac), results in an increase in aggression in dominant toadfish, possibly due to interference with pulsatile urea excretion; (iii) we sequenced the full-length toadfish 5-HT2A receptor (t5-HT2A), involved in pulsatile urea excretion, and 5-HT1A receptor (t5-HT1A), involved in the teleost stress response and the toadfish 5-HT transporter, SERT that is involved in the control of circulating 5-HT and perhaps the indirect control of pulsatile urea excretion; (iv) mRNA expression of t5-HT2A and t5-HT1A are highest in the swim bladder, gonad and the brain, with measurable levels found in the gill; (v) Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with t5-HT2A or t5-HT1A cRNA bind more [3H]5-HT than water-injected controls and both receptors demonstrate a pharmacological similarity to their mammalian counterparts; (vi) cortisol may have differential effects on gill t5-HT2A binding, which could have potential implications on the control of pulsatile urea excretion; (vii) t5-HT1A plays a role in the toadfish stress response within the central nervous system but not within the interrenal tissue and is subject to negative feedback by cortisol at the level of mRNA expression and binding; (viii) cranial nerves IX and X are involved in the control of the frequency of urea pulses but not pulse size; and finally, (ix) pulsatile urea excretion may be used as a method of chemical communication between fish.   These findings will vastly improve our current understanding of the role and interaction of cortisol and 5-HT and their receptors in the control of physiological processes and behavior in vertebrates.  The broader impacts of this work are substantial.  This grant contributed to the development of 14 undergraduate students (minorities, women, *contributed to peer-reviewed articles; B Macdonald; S Marin*, A Lange*, M Cartolano*, J Lonthair, Jacqueline Coffey, Emily Nelson, Bethany Figiel, Haley Nicholson, Abigail Wisnet, Jennifer Panlilio*, Marissa Lobl, Aalekhya Reddam and Daniela Tizabi), four PhD students (TM Rodela*, LR Medeiros*, M Cartolano*, M Broome) and one MS student (AW Frere*).  We have given 16 scientific conference presentations with funding from this grant.   In terms of outreach, each year we have been a part of the "RSMAS Exploring Marine Science for Girls" Women in Science Event,  we have done multiple presentations at Environmental Immersion Day, the Marine Science Undergraduate Program ParentÆ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
