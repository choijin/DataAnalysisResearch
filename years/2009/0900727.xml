<AbstractNarration>This project will develop novel MEMS-based capacitive plates with a large tunable dynamic range for power harvesting and voltage conversion. The device is unique in that it uses an innovative multi-cavity design to optimize the power harvesting and step-up voltage conversion efficiency, and electroplated nickel as the main structural material. The goal is to provide significantly improved performance in a small, lightweight, low-cost and maintenance-free energy source. The impacts of this work include new basic science that paves the way for portable wireless sensor systems for aircraft and bridges, educating students with state-of-the-art technology, and boosting US competitiveness and economic development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     We have designed, modeled, fabricated and tested novel MEMS capacitive plates with two air cavities (two capacitors) for power harvesting (single device and 1&times;4 array) by utilizing unwanted mechanical vibration in environment using electrostatic mechanism. The device is unique in the use of an innovative two-cavity design, and the use of electroplated nickel as the main structural material. When the capacitance increases for one capacitor, it will decrease for the other. This allows us to use both capacitors to optimize the efficiency of power harvesting. The dimensions of the two-cavity MEMS capacitive plates have been optimized for better mechanical behaviors and resonant responses. The fabrication processes were optimized and prototypes of a single two-cavity MEMS capacitive plate and 1&times;4 array were fabricated with a thickness of 30&micro;m and 40&micro;m and supported by &micro;m or 5&mu;m, and 3&micro;m thick suspension beams and 30&mu;m thick anchors, respectively. The tested device with movable plate with a thickness of 30&micro;m has achieved a resonance of 500Hz, and a maximum power of 0.22&micro;W and 2.5 &mu;W across the load resistors for single capacitor and from the 1&times;4 capacitor array, respectively, under a high DC bias of 15V and an excitation above 5 g. For the device with 40&micro;m movable plate, the resonance frequency was observed at 290Hz.     The two-cavity design has achieved higher average power than single cavity devices based on the dynamic simulations. The model assumes that the moving plate is allowed to only have the translational degree of freedom. We have identified the ranges of the forcing frequencies and amplitudes for which power generation on the order of microwatts can be achieved. The electrical performance under different the forcing frequencies and amplitudes has been studied in details. In addition, a different dynamic model has been established for involving the rotational effect (rocking instability, i.e. perturbations that may cause the movable plate not in parallel to the fixed plates) of the movable plate under two cavities and three cavities situation. To the best of our knowledge, the resultant symmetry breaking has not been studied in the past. The improved model verified the fact that that two-cavity model enhances the average output power by 2 to 10 times of single cavity model, i.e. under forcing amplitude of 50&mu;m and forcing frequency of 2.25 times of resonance frequency, output power is found to be 1.65&mu;W out of single cavity model and 3.24&mu;W out of two cavity model. The explanation of better power performance on two-cavity design is attributed to smaller rocking effect and double capacitive cavities. We conclude that power harvesting from low amplitude and low frequency vibration sources are feasible with this strategy. Finite element models (FEM) were created for studying the mechanical properties of optimized design of the movable plate of the MEMS capacitive plates. The natural frequencies of different designs of movable plate have been identified.    The proposed energy harvesters will be applicable to a wide range of applications in wireless sensor networks including structural health monitoring, predictive maintenance, and automotive systems. The power harvesting results demonstrated that electrostatic power harvester can harvest power in the microwatt range, and this power can increase by the use of large array. This exceeds the output power of piezoelectric and electromagnetic harvesters. In addition, the electrostatic approach has added the advantage of CMOS compatibility which enables the fabrication of arrays of power harvesters along with the CMOS circuit on the same chip. We now have a numerical program that can calculate the harvested power for given geometric design and for given vibration amplitude and frequencies. We conducted simulations of the variable capacitive plates with sinusoidal excitations by including the rotatio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
