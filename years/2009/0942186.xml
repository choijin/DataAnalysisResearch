<AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing, assessing, and disseminating materials for teaching a quantitative reasoning course.  In contrast with many similar courses, which cover a set of mathematical topics using relevant examples, this course is being driven by complex stories about, for example, inflation, fuel economy, and paying off debt.  Students are developing quantitative, common sense approaches to examine the issues of interest, and instructors review relevant mathematical material as necessary.  Spreadsheets are being used as a tool for investigation and computation.  Materials being developed include a textbook, homework problems and solutions, model spreadsheets, and supplements for both students and faculty.  Course materials are designed to incorporate best practices in teaching.  The project is evaluating the ability of the course to change, in the long term, the way students approach quantitative data.  Dissemination plans include faculty development workshops for prospective instructors of the new course. Overall, the project is seeking to develop students' willingness and ability to assess numerical evidence in order to make informed decisions.  It has the potential to impact a wide variety of students enrolling in general education mathematics courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Every day, citizens meet numbers they need to understand in order to make important decisions (or unimportant ones). Often all that's required is some common sense, some common knowledge (easily available on the web), a little mathematics, and  -- perhaps most important -- the confidence to apply those tools.  Unfortunately, students are often ill prepared to reason quantitatively. They come to college having studied mathematics (algebra, usually) that is of little use for everyday numeracy. That puts them at a substantial disadvantage in today's data rich world.  To address this problem we have developed, implemented, assessed and begun to disseminate a new approach for teaching quantitative reasoning to undergraduate college students. That approach relies on real problems drawn from current media. Students are taught to approach those problems with confidence and common sense, using technology (spreadsheets, calculators and web searches) as appropriate, to frame answers that shed light on issues that matter.  With National Science Foundation support we have completed a new quantitative reasoning text titled Common Sense Mathematics, written supporting materials including solutions and an instructor's manual, built a web home for the project at www.quantitativereasoning.net where you can find links to the text and a teaching blog, and led a group of software engineering students to create a web application called SCOPE (http://www.cs.umb.edu/~scope) that allows instructors to post and share exercises.   The results of the project are encouraging.  An analysis of student attitudinal surveys from the quantitative reasoning course at the University of Massachusetts Boston showed that using the project materials led to significant improvement in students' perceptions of math as applicable to the real world and in their ability to achieve concrete goals that called for using some mathematics.    More than twenty external reviewers have examined the text; their overall evaluations have been positive and encouraging. Instructors at half a dozen schools have used the text and our approach. This feedback has led to continuous improvement in the materials. We are hopeful that improvement and adoption will continue into the future.
