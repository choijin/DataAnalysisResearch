<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Sadaf Munshi will coordinate the collection of data in Pakistan and India to create a linguistically analysed and searchable archive of annotated texts in Burushaski. Burushaki is not known to be related to any other language in the world and is thus considered a linguistic "isolate". The database will consist of about 15-20 hours of high quality digitized audio and video recordings of Burushaski oral literature in different, significantly threatened, regional varieties, viz., Hunza, Nagar, and Yasin  in Pakistan and Srinagar in India. The genres to be included are: traditional folktales and legends, historical accounts, personal narratives, formal speeches, conversations, poems, speaker-to-speaker discussions of data, and metadata. A selection of the materials will be provided with time-aligned transcriptions, multi-tier annotations, morpheme-to-morpheme and free translations into English. Keeping in view the level of literacy and second language proficiency among Burushaski speakers, a version of smaller edited texts will be independently transliterated into Burushaski and translated into Urdu. Transliteration in Burushaski will be done using a modified Perso-Arabic (Nast√¢liq) script - a popular writing system for many of the languages spoken in the region. The materials will be archived in the following formats: audio in PCM wav, video in MPEG-2, texts  downloadable in TXT, Word, and PDF format, ELAN files with translations and sound alignment, and XML (with XSL). Morphosyntactic analyses and lexical files will be maintained using FLEx - Fieldworks Language Explorer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since Burushaski is primarily preserved orally and literacy in the first language is practically non-existent, Dr. Munshi intends the text collection to be the springboard for pedagogical materials that will facilitate native language literacy. The pedagogical materials to be included in the Archive are: introduction to alphabet, wordlists, parts of speech, and basic grammar. The documentation materials will be archived at the University of North Texas Digital Collections Library.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Following are the various grant-related outcomes:    Publications  Burushaski Language Resource is a digital corpus hosted by the Digital Collections Library of the University of North Texas (UNT), containing: 298 audio recordings in .WAV, 62 video recordings in .MPEG, 50 texts in .PDF and 372 photographs in .JPG formats. The contents include: 64 stories, 44 conversations/discussions, 32 personal/cultural accounts, 42 poems/songs, dozens of proverbs, and pedagogical materials (introduction to alphabet, basic greetings, wordlists, and a grammatical sketch). The corpus is available at: https://digital.library.unt.edu/explore/collections/BURUS/.   A book-length manuscript, partially funded by the grant, containing a grammatical description and three linguistically analyzed texts in Srinagar Burushaski (a regional dialect) has been accepted by Brill Publications (Leiden: Netherlands).   Two masters theses were a direct outcome of the project: "Burushaski Case Marking, Agreement and Implications: An Analysis of the Hunza Dialect" (Alexander Smith, 2012; UNT), and "Middle Voice Construction in Burushaski: From the Perspective of a Native Speaker of the Hunza Dialect." (Piar Karim, 2013; UNT).     The following works are in preparation: a book-length monograph containing a text collection in various dialects of Burushaski with interlinear analysis and cultural notes (to be submitted in Himalayan Linguistics: Grammars and Text Collections); and two articles: "Documentation of the Burushaski Language: Methods, Issues and Challenges" and "Literacy promotion and orthography issues for minority and endangered languages: the case of Kashmiri and Burushaski" (The articles will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals - Journal of Language Documentation and Conservation and  Journal of South Asian Languages and Linguistics).      Presentations and workshops (selected) Several presentations were made at various national and international venues as part of the project outcomes. These include:    Digitally-enabled Linguistics at UNT: from documentation of endangered languages to detection of abusive language online.

Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan, August 4, 2010. (invited)     In addition, the PI also conducted three workshops:    Three-day workshop on project outcomes and proposals for Burushaski orthography (with native speakers in Srinagar, India; 2016).    One-day workshop on FLEx (Fieldworks Language Explorer) with Linguistics researchers and faculty at the Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan (2015).    Two-day workshop on FLEx and ELAN with Linguistics graduate students and faculty at the University of Kashmir, India (2014).     Faculty Development  The project significantly developed the research and professional interests of the PI. The grant helped towards establishing her career from an assistant to an associate professor. The enormous amount of work conducted on the project and the associated challenges in meeting the goals have added to her ability and preparedness in conducting further documentation research in the ethno-linguistically diverse areas of South Asia begging more attention. The grant has helped build professional connections with researchers in various institutions towards exploring new research opportunities, thus strengthening the prospects of long-term collaborations and future grant-seeking opportunities in language documentation.   Student Development A graduate student and a native speaker of Burushaski was supported for one year of full funding (including a monthly stipend plus tuition and benefits) and one year of partial funding during the two years of his Master?s program in Linguistics at UNT. In addition, six Linguistics students (four graduate and two undergraduate) and two Computer Science students (one graduate and one undergraduate) worked as research/technical assistants. The project resulted in two Master's theses and two student presentations at conferences. At least three of these students have already made good strides in their career advancement.
