<AbstractNarration>In many parts of the world, America's influence has  been felt through technological programs designed to modernize health, agriculture, and family structure, and to protect nature.  Using a combination of archival and ethnographic methods, Thomas Robertson will write a social, economic, and political history of the environmental changes introduced by American technology transfer programs in Nepal by focusing on four strategically selected case studies from the 1950s to the 1980s: the Rapti Valley Development Project (1950s), the Malaria Eradication Project (1960s), U.S. Agricultural Development and Land Reform Programs (1960s), and U.S. Population Control, Natural Resource, and National Park Programs (1960s-1980s).  &lt;br/&gt;These four Cold War-era programs, and the ideas of nature and technology wrapped within them, placed Nepal on the frontlines of economic competition with the Soviet Union and China in rural Asia and also reshaped the contours of Nepal?s national and local life.  Together, the programs became the face of 'progress' and 'modern technology' at a time when Nepalis, on both the national and local levels, were just beginning to invent what modernity would mean for them.  In this book-length project, Robertson will explore both the environmental and economic transformations that came with these technological projects.  This will be a history that is multi-perspectival. Robertson will uncover the views of American strategists, American development workers, Nepali planners, and Nepali villagers, especially those often overlooked:  ethnic minorities, religious minorities, 'lower' castes, and women.&lt;br/&gt;At a time when international development has taken on new urgency because of Iraq and Afghanistan, assessing the impact of American technological transfer programs in earlier periods is more important than ever.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A very common problem in foreign policy making, and especially international development, is that policy makers do not know the history of earlier development projects. Historians have begun to focus attention on the history of international development, both for practical purposes and also to expand our understanding of what constitutes foreign relations. My study belongs to this larger field, but adds to it a focus on the environmental consequences of technology transfer. In many parts of the world, AmericaÃ†s influence has been felt not through the military or the market, but through technological programs to develop resources, both natural and human. Usually driven by Cold War strategy and often using technologies and methods devised during World War II, these development programs literally remade the world.     My study focuses on the environmental, social, and political consequences of Cold War-era U.S. technological transfer programs in Nepal, which opened to the outside world only in 1951.

The award has allowed me to collect thousands of documents and conduct scores of interviews in multiple locations in Nepal, as well as at international offices in Geneva, London, and around the U.S.     I have given over 15 presentations on aspects of this work at professional meetings in Nepal, India, France, Germany, and the U.S. I have begun publishing the results of the research. I have more articles on the way, and am trying to put the research together in a book.     Several of the more important articles include:  "Toward an Environmental History of Cold War-Era International Development Programs." This has been accepted by Cold War History and is in the publication process.   This article draws attention to the ways in which U.S. development programs during the Cold War transformed ecologies around the world.     2.     "A Lowland Plague in a Mountainous Region: A Historical Political Ecology of Disease in the Nepal Himalaya Before 1950" [under revision for submission for publication]  This article examines the mix of natural and human factors that created the malarial environments in Nepal before 1950s.    3.      "Point IV in Nepal:  DDT and U.S. Environmental and Social Engineering in the Rapti Valley, 1952-1962"  [under revision for submission for publication]  This article shows that eliminating a dread disease is not as beneficial as most assume. It highlights what happened to the Tharu people of the Rapti Valley.     4.     " Ã¦A Great Thing for Poor FolksÃ†:  Population Programs in Nepal in the 1960s and 1970s" [under revision for submission for publication]  This article counters the conventional wisdom about U.S. funded population programs by showing they brought not just problems to the people of Nepal but also benefits. The article makes a strong case for assessing international development programs by whether local people find them useful or not.
