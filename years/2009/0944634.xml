<AbstractNarration>This research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic program supports work by Professor Oleg Ozerov at Brandeis University to explore the chemistry of transition metal complexes supported by a series of rigid pincer-type ligands.  The modular construction and the rigidity will allow for logical and systematic variation of the electronic interactions of the supporting ligands with the transition metal centers.  New catalytic transformations by the designed metal complexes will be targeted, such as boron-boron bond formation and rhodium-catalyzed carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom coupling reactions.  The pursuit of catalytic applications will take place in synergy with fundamental explorations: generation of a unified scale for reactions of simple and oxidative addition, possible observation of a transition metal methane complex and of a gold hydride complex, and studies of electronic consequences of severe unsaturation at the metal center.  Research results will be used to create educational materials, which will be disseminated.  An integral part of the work is the collaboration with colleagues at other, especially primarily undergraduate, institutions.  Prof. Anthony Fernandez of Merrimack College will be supported through a subaward to investigate solid-state oxidative addition reactions.  A regional undergraduate research symposium will be organized to promote undergraduate research and enhance ties in the regional chemistry community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transition metal catalysis is indispensable in many industrial processes of importance to modern society.  Chelating supporting ligands can be used to stabilize homogeneous transition metal catalysts.  Using a series of modularly variable, rigidly constructed ligands will permit the development of better understanding of the influence of the individual donor sites on the overall reactivity of the metal complex. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Catalytic transformation of chemical feedstocks into higher value products is a critical ingredient for efficient resource utilization in the modern world.  Transition metal compounds are the most common types of catalysts used in industrial applications and fundamental research.  Catalytic cycles and chemical transformations in general consist of sequences of elementary chemical steps in which individual chemical bonds are being broken or formed.  The design of novel catalytic reactions can be viewed through the prism of designing new elementary chemical steps.  Our work has focused studying how these elementary chemical steps take place at transition metal centers, especially elements of groups 9 and 10 (rhodium, iridium, nickel, palladium, platinum) and manganese.  Our approach has been to confine transition metal atoms within a rigid molecular framework of the so-called "pincer ligands" that fosters a well-defined supporting environment with built-in spectroscopic reporter probes.  This environment allows for convenient study of a multitude of bond-making and bond-breaking transformations.  Through careful design of the ligand framework we have been able to control the reactivity at the transition metal center.  Among our successes are the identification of new ways in which rhodium complexes can be used for catalytic carbon-carbon and carbon-sulfur bond-making, the development of understanding of how palladium complexes in a pincer-type framework can break bonds, the exploration of the potential of complexes of manganese for catalytic organometallic chemistry, and the synthesis of a number of new pincer frameworks.  Our work has been carried out with the help of collaborations within the US and abroad, including researchers at primarily undergraduate institutions.  These collaborations further the impact of this NSF-funded research and build the foundation for future joint efforts.  It is worth noting that, even outside of collaborations with us, our ligand frameworks have been used by a number of other research groups studying reactivity of transition metals compounds.  One of the major benefits of this project has been the training of highly qualified personnel.  Three former postdocs now hold their own faculty appointments.  Of the seven graduate students who have contributed to the project, three are continuing, two are employed in the US chemical industry, one is a high school teacher, and one is a postdoctoral scholar.  All three undergraduates who have contributed to this project have moved on to graduate school, and one won the prestigious NSF Graduate Fellowship.
