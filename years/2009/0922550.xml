<AbstractNarration>What do asset markets signal about future macroeconomic developments? How are macroeconomic risks generated and allocated and what frictions may prevent a first-best solution? What are the appropriate policy responses to upheavals on financial markets? The proposed research seeks to contribute to answering these questions, pursuing three projects in particular. The first project investigates the interrelationship between macroeconomic shocks and financial markets empirically, identifying shocks by their explanatory power for forecast error variances. The second project investigates the allocation of macroeconomic risks and several frictions with the help of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, capable of delivering appropriate risk premia. The third project seeks to understand the 2008 financial crisis as a systemic bank run, in which tradeable bank assets become illiquid. It also examines the case for a fiscal stimulus in a financial crisis.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of Proposed Activity&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research extends the existing literature in a number of dimensions. The first project provides a new method for identifying shocks based on their contribution to explaining future variance, which should be useful more generally. It applies this methodology to examine the interaction between key shocks moving asset markets and macroeconomic aggregates, thereby deepening our empirical understanding of these relationships. The second project extends and/or streamlines the literature, which seeks a joint model&lt;br/&gt;for asset markets and macroeconomic allocations. Generic formulations for preferences and technologies provide restrictions on elasticities which should prove generally useful. The role of key frictions and features shall be clarified. A DSGE model suitable for studying monetary policy, while delivering key asset market observations, extends the existing literature. The third project is motivated by recent events. While reminiscent of a classic bank run, a key difference is that the assets of shaky financial institutions are marketable at least in principle. The proposed research contributes to the literature of constructing a model of a systemic bank run, filling this gap in our understanding. The proposal furthermore contributes to the literature of the special role of fiscal policies during a financial crisis.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of Proposed Activity&lt;br/&gt;The interrelationship between asset markets and financial intermediaries on the one side and macroeconomic behavior on the other as well as appropriate policy responses to disturbances in the financial sector have become a topic of considerable general interest. This research hopes to contribute to a deeper understanding of the issues involved, which may be of help for the relevant policy institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ What do asset markets signal about future macroeconomic developments?   How are macroeconomic risks generated and allocated and what frictions may prevent a first-best solution?  What are the appropriate policy responses to upheavals on financial markets?  These questions are not new: they are at the core of a substantial body of research.  Yet, their answer still seems elusive.     The research funded by the NSF grant 0922550 sought to make a contribution to that end, pursuing three projects in particular. The first project planned to investigate the interrelationship between macroeconomic shocks and financial markets empirically, identifying shocks by their explanatory power for forecast error variances.   The second project  was planned to investigate the allocation of macroeconomic risks and several frictions with the help of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, capable of delivering appropriate risk premia.  The third project was planned to understand the 2008 financial crisis as a systemic bank run, in which tradeable bank assets become illiquid and their prices decline as a result.  The project was planned to investigate the scope for monetary policy, injecting liquidity by trading government securities for private securities, and the scope and role for a fiscal ``stimulus'' in a financial crisis.     The projects evolved over time, some of them still resulting in ongoing investigations.  Several publications in academic journals resulted from the grant activities: it may be best to briefly describe the main insight of some of them.     The paper "A model of a systemic bank run", part of the third project and published in the Journal of Monetary Economics 2009, provides a model of the view that the 2008 financial crisis is reminiscent of a bank run, focussing on six stylized key features. In particular, core financial institutions have invested their funds in asset-backed securities rather than committed to long-term projects: in distress, these can potentially be sold to a large pool of outside investors at steep discounts. I consider two different motives for outside investors and their interaction with banks trading asset-backed securities: uncertainty aversion versus adverse selection. I argue that the version with uncertainty averse investors is more consistent with the stylized facts than the adverse selection perspective: in the former, the crisis deepens, the larger the market share of distressed core banks, while a run becomes less likely instead as a result in the adverse selection version. Therefore, the outright purchase of troubled assets by the government at prices above current market prices may both alleviate the financial crises as well as provide tax payers with returns above those for safe securities.  This distinction results in rather different policy recommendations.  With uncertainty averse investors, pooling the risks of various securities and then offering shared in these pooled securities can alleviate the depth of the crisis, for example.     In the paper, "Corporate Debt Structure and the Financial Crisis," joint with Fiorella de Fiore at the ECB and part of project 2, we construct a dynamic stochastic macroeconomic model where firms optimally choose among alternative instruments of external finance. The model is used to explain the evolving composition of corporate debt during the financial crisis of 2008&ndash;09, namely, the observed shift from bank finance to bond finance, at a time when the cost of market debt rose above the cost of bank loans. We show that the flexibility offered by banks on the terms of their loans and firmsÆ ability to substitute among alternative instruments of debt finance are important to shield the economy from adverse real effects of a financial crisis.      In the paper "Fiscal stimulus and distortionary taxation", with Thorsten Drautzburg, part of project 3 and published in the Review of Economic Dynamics 2015, we quantify the fiscal multipliers in r...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
