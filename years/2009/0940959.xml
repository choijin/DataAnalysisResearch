<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Massachusetts Maritime Academy is evaluating and dissemination a new interactive instructional circuit analysis computer environment (CIRCE) for college physics and engineering laboratories.  CIRCE includes interactive, on-line software that provides immediate feedback, which is known to increase student learning and mastery of concepts.  It also provides students with hands-on experience with electrical measurements and their interpretation.  CIRCE includes an authoring tool that allows faculty to modify the environment to fit their own laboratory apparatus and curriculum goals.  The project seeks to improve student learning by (1) providing immediate feed-back of the laboratory report and an opportunity for students to correct their errors, (2) freeing instructors from the task of checking student work so they can provide higher-level supervision of the laboratory exercise and (3) supporting the educational community by enabling flexible creation of new laboratory software.  A consortium of faculty from 4-year colleges and the University of Massachusetts Amherst are introducing the software into their circuit analysis classes and evaluate its efficacy.</AbstractNarration>

The suite of circuit analysis software used intelligent models to support hands-on learning and to explore the impact of computational labs on student learning and affect.  The software kept students on task during typical laboratories by providing immediate feedback and engineering content. These labs are vetted and freely available.  One of our goals was to develop software that drives innovation in the way instructors teach and students learn. Tutoring help is provided at "teachable moments" as opposed to asking students to wait days or weeks for traditional teacher-graded reports to be returned. Quantitative and qualitative studies show that using the software leads to improved learning, verbalization and conceptual knowledge and reduces the teachersÆ workload. Students also reported that they enjoyed using the software.  Intellectual Merit. The software models the studentÆs knowledge and behavior and then adapts the software to the studentÆs learning needs.  Thus it might produce advanced material for a high achieving student and remedial material for a struggling student  Students perform their usual hands-on experiments or projects using physical circuitry while submitting data to the computer in real time. For example, they sketch oscilloscope waves into the software and receive feedback about features of their waves, e.g., "The amplitude is too large" or "The period is too small." As they plot a graph or record data they receive feedback about whether the data is within the expected range (green) or outside the expected range (red). Out-of-range data points are immediately flagged. Students can move ahead or return to prior topics as they want.

Students who receive immediate feedback generally demonstrate improved learning. The software tracked student performance and identified activities that led to learning gains. We performed both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the online student learning. We explored studentsÆ comprehension of key engineering concepts and studied whether students demonstrated increased positive affect conducive to learning (e.g., increased interest, engagement) while using the system.  Results showed that the software improved student ability as measured by lab grades. We evaluated 78 lab grades assigned by the software and based on recording student answers and key-strokes in Fall 2012 at a Northeastern community college. We also measured improved conceptual knowledge using pre-post quizzes. We evaluated 41 pre and post conceptual quizzes associated with each lab unit. Traditional tests are not necessarily effective tools for diagnosing the content and structure of studentsÆ knowledge of physics or engineering. The software also led to positive student affect as measured by surveys. The students enjoyed using the software; they thought it was friendly, helpful, and enabled them to understand their errors. Finally the software led to improved verbalization as measured by Tweets, brief textual messages crafted by students within the system to describe their knowledge of engineering topics. We evaluated 70 student Tweets.       Last Modified: 03/31/2015       Submitted by: William J Leonard]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
