<AbstractNarration>This project is developing new simulation frameworks for the ns-3 discrete-event network simulator, a free and open-source research tool designed for use by computer communications network researchers. Simulation remains in heavy use for network research and education, because of its ease of use, reproducibility, availability, scalability, and ease of software development.  However, the workflow of a typical simulation study requires the user's careful attention to a number of best practices in methodology to ensure that the results are credible and reproducible by third parties and that errors are not introduced.   This project is building an automation framework for the ns-3 simulator that provides an environment that is more conducive to the creation of rigorous studies.  The automation framework guides the user to produce valid network simulation models by composition and consistency checking, and definition of experimental settings. The framework exercises control over large-scale simulation studies, and applies statistical methods for output data analysis and execution control. The framework also collect details required to reproduce the experiment and report results.  The framework also allows users to specify wide ranges of simulation network topologies, application traffic, and other parameters, allowing experiments to be conducted on a wide range of scenarios with minimal effort.  Finally, maintaining the ns-3 software, documentation, and dissemination activities continue.   The additions to ns-3, disseminated as open source software, are improving the methodology and credibility for future simulation-based network research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ns-3 network simulation has met and exceeded its originally stated goals.  The tool has been extended over the life of this award by adding dozens or   hundreds of new network models into the simulation environment allowing  it to be used to simulation more and more different network infrastructures.  Further, the scalability of ns-3 has been shown to increase the overall  network size of the simulated networks, allowing simulation and analysis of  networks on a scale not previously possible. Particular attention in ns-3  has been paid to a large number of wireless network models including several  of the 802.11 family of protocols, plus cellular networks other newly evolving  protocols.  Further, the ns-3 tool has support for various network emulation  methods allowing traffic to and from existing networks to be sent and received  by the simulation environmnet.  This allows experimentation with a mixture  of both actual network components and simulated components.  Further, the development of the newer Software Defined Networking methodologies will lead to higher confidenct in the SDN protocols and detailed analysis of the behavior of SDN networks prior to actually constructing such networks.  The IPV6 models found in ns-3 can be used to understand the behavior, strengths and weaknesses of the IPV6 protocol and may lead to increased  adoption of IPV6 as time goes on.
