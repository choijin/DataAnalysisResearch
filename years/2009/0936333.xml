<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the International Workshop on the Search for New Superconductors ? Frontier and Future to be held at the Shonan Village Center in Japan, May 12 ? 16, 2009. The workshop has been jointly organized by a Japanese and an American committee.  The goal is to understand the implications of recent unexpected discoveries of superconductivity in MgB2 and in the Fe-As complex pnictides, as well as to explore the opportunities for further discovery in a small workshop format.  While Japan has had national programs with the goal of searching for new materials for several years, as a whole the US does not have such broad-ranging discovery programs.  One year after the discovery of the large class of pnictide superconductors, it is opportune to explore the opportunities for further discovery in a small workshop format.  NSF support will enable young US scientists of diverse background and goals to attend the workshop.  The Japanese have also emphasized a significant role for young scientists.  The small workshop will provide an opportunity for the young scientists to present their work and to interact with leading researchers in the field.  Along with the potential of developing future collaborations, the workshop may serve as the essential seed needed to generate long-term materials discovery programs in the US.</AbstractNarration>
