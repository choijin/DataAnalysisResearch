<AbstractNarration>Two projects are to be performed in the area of theoretical atomic physics. The first project involves using a well established method to study low-energy scattering of an exotic atom, positronium (Ps), from the conventional atoms hydrogen (H) and lithium (Li). This project is of interest since Ps-H scattering is a fundamental four-body Coulomb process and Ps-Li scattering is an effective four-body Coulomb process. A graduate student will work on the project for his Ph. D. dissertation. The project involves an international collaboration with Dr. Peter Van Reeth, who is in London, UK. The second project concerns the search of vortices for positron-hydrogen ionization. It is timely due to the recent explanation of the previously unexplained minimum in results for electron-impact ionization of helium and the development of positron reaction microscopes. The project is in collaboration with Dr. Joseph Macek and Dr. Serge Ovchinnikov who are at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Positronium scattering has applications in astrophysics, biophysics and condensed matter and vortices are important in many fields of physics such as fluid dynamics, astrophysics, condensed matter and nonlinear dynamics. The plan is to present results through  publication, at national conferences and at an international conference. To provide the graduate student a broad exposure to inquiry-based and other pedagogical methods, the graduate student will assist Teach North Texas (TNT), a program at UNT that prepares future secondary mathematics and science teachers. Novel program features developed by TNT will be disseminated at conferences concerning teacher preparation for science and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Angular Momentum is an important physical quantity in classical and quantum mechanics that is conserved. Conservation of physical quantities such as energy and angular momentum  is of extreme importance in physics. We have studied theoretically a particular scattering process of  fast electron impact ionization of an inner-shell of a carbon atom. We used the Coulomb-Born method  which is a quantum mechanical method that allows for transfer of angular momentum. The Coulomb-Born approximation is important since it  gives the correct high energy limit for ionization for fixed scattering angles. We obtained a zero in a the ionization transition matrix element  which is a quantity that gives information on the scattering process, and this zero is relates   to the physical process of angular momentum transfer. A vortex in the velocity field of the ejected electron is associated with the zero in the transition matrix element. For the first time for electron impact ionization we have obtained a segment of a vortex line for a particular set of kinematics. Vortices have previously been obtained for electron-impact ionization of helium, as well as ionization by proton, antiproton and positron projectiles. In addition to vortices being of importance and fundamental in atomic  physics, vortices are of interest in other areas of physics such as in astrophysics, fluid dynamics and condensed matter. A paper on the vortex work for inner-shell ionization of carbon by electron impact  has been accepted for publication and it has been presented at national meetings. The work was done in collaboration with Dr. J. H. Macek (University of Tennessee).

The work has been presented at a national and international meetings. Majority of the presentations of this work have been made by Mr. Woods, who has given both poster presentations and talks. We are currently preparing a detailed paper on the work to submit for publication in a physics journal. One semester Mr. Woods helped with a course for Teach North Texas (TNT), which is a program at the University of North Texas  that prepares future secondary mathematics and science teachers.
