<AbstractNarration>Solar neutrinos have played a crucial role in the experimental confirmation that neutrinos have mass and oscillate, which is evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. Borexino is a large solar neutrino detector in operation at the Gran Sasso Laboratory (LNGS), Italy. With its proven sensitivity, high radiopurity and low energy threshold, Borexino has the potential to resolve the solar neutrino energy spectrum into its various components and to probe the transition between vacuum and matter-enhanced oscillations in the ~ MeV energy region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on their previous experience, the UMass group will contribute to the scientific goals of Borexino in two areas: (1) data analysis: the PI currently coordinates the US Borexino data analysis effort, focused on a deeper understanding of systematic effects, to reduce the uncertainty on the measured rate of Be-7 neutrinos; and (2) detector stability: as members of the vessel working group, the PIs are experts on the stress patterns and vessel deformations and on the laser diffuser system used for calibration and studies of light propagation properties. These skills will be fundamental to monitor the stability of the detector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the program will provide students with the opportunity to experience research at a unique international physics laboratory, and to have an impact on important scientific results. The PIs will continue to participate in an outreach program that brings high school students from a relatively poor region of Italy to Princeton for a summer program in physics. This program has recently been extended to a group of women and minority high school students from South Dakota.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF-PHY-0902140 "Solar Neutrino Science with Borexino" covered the activities of the UMass Borexino group.  Borexino is a neutrino experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy. It detects neutrino-electron scattering events in a large target of ultra-pure liquid scintillator by recording the induced flashes of scintillation light, proportional to the event energy. The Borexino scientific program centered on the measurement of solar "berillium-7" neutrinos.  These were a clue with which to understand why neutrinos were missing between the Sun and Earth. We now know that neutrino oscillations explain the deficit;  Borexino has confirmed oscillations and looked for subdominant neutrino oscillations.   Measuring Be7 solar neutrinos, with boron-8 and pep neutrinos in a neutrino "snapshot" of the Sun, tells us about the inner workings of our star and the nuclear fusion reactions that provide its thermal energy.  Borexino has set the best limit on the flux of solar CNO neutrinos, providing a small fraction of the SunÆs energy but copiously produced in larger stars. This award partially supported the core work to measure solar pp-neutrinos, the most abundant and the ones with the lowest energy. This measurement confirms Borexino as the leader in ultra-clean detectors for rare events and neutrinos, reaching unprecedented purity of its target of order 10^-19 for the radioactive elements U-238 and Th-232.  Borexino has measured anti-neutrinos from EarthÆs radioactivity and from far-away nuclear reactors, and has set limits on the existence of exotic processes (violation of PauliÆs exclusion principle, electron decay, the existence of axions).  The UMass group included graduate student Keith Otis and numerous undergraduate students, some of which have had significant roles in producing scientific results (John Quirk Æ12, Keith Fratus and Amanda Lund Æ11).  It has focused on:  detector stability radioactive calibration source insertion pep and pp solar neutrinos cosmic muon flux      The outcomes of this award are summarize by the following Borexino and Borexino-related papers:  Borexino collaboration, G.
