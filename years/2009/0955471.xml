<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this CAREER project supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program in DMR is to investigate the fundamental properties of Co3O4 nanowire arrays and their applications for efficient solar energy harvesting and conversion. Co3O4 is an exciting material for energy &amp; environmental science. It has one of the highest turnover frequencies for the oxidation of water. It is a high-capacity anode material for Li-ion batteries. Black cobalt oxide is also one of the most promising materials for high-temperature solar selective absorbers. Nanowire arrays have the structural advantages of large surface area, enhanced light absorption, and efficient separation and collection of photo-excited charge carriers over thin film or bulk counterparts. The PI's group has recently discovered a facile method for growing mesoporous single-crystalline Co3O4 nanowire arrays and demonstrated their superior performance as an anode in Li-ion batteries. This project is to investigate their fundamental growth mechanism, study their basic electrical, optical and catalytic properties and explore their applications for the oxygen evolution reaction, photoelectrochemical cells, and solar selective absorbers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;Cobalt oxide is an exciting and versatile material for solar energy harvesting and storage. This project is focused on understanding the chemistry of cobalt oxide nanowire arrays, which is expected to open up substantial opportunities in splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules, as well as converting solar energy into heat. This project also involves integrating the PI's research interests in energy materials with the educational goal of building a strong multi-tiered energy education program. For example, the PI will integrate the research on solar selective absorbers with hands-on activities of building solar cookers for elementary and middle school teachers and students. Other activities consist of: (1) developing a new freshman seminar class in sustainable energy technologies, (2) modifying the existing general chemistry curriculum, (3) developing research modules for the Ohio Consortium for Undergraduate Research: Research Experience to Enhance Learning (OCUR-REEL), and (4) recruiting minority and women undergraduate students to take part in research on energy materials. Through these activities, the PI hopes to build a solid education program on energy &amp; environmental science, which is vital for the sustainable development of our society.</AbstractNarration>
