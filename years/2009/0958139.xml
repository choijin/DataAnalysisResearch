<AbstractNarration>This project is developing new simulation frameworks for the ns-3 discrete-event network simulator, a free and open-source research tool designed for use by computer communications network researchers. Simulation remains in heavy use for network research and education, because of its ease of use, reproducibility, availability, scalability, and ease of software development.  However, the workflow of a typical simulation study requires the user's careful attention to a number of best practices in methodology to ensure that the results are credible and reproducible by third parties and that errors are not introduced.   This project is building an automation framework for the ns-3 simulator that provides an environment that is more conducive to the creation of rigorous studies.  The automation framework guides the user to produce valid network simulation models by composition and consistency checking, and definition of experimental settings. The framework exercises control over large-scale simulation studies, and applies statistical methods for output data analysis and execution control. The framework also collect details required to reproduce the experiment and report results.  The framework also allows users to specify wide ranges of simulation network topologies, application traffic, and other parameters, allowing experiments to be conducted on a wide range of scenarios with minimal effort.  Finally, maintaining the ns-3 software, documentation, and dissemination activities continue.   The additions to ns-3, disseminated as open source software, are improving the methodology and credibility for future simulation-based network research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project continued development of the ns-3 discrete-event network simulator, a freely available network simulation tool for research and education.  ns-3 is the third generation of a series of widely used network simulation tools.  ns-3 is primarily a tool for conducting performance evaluation studies of computer-communication networks, through the use of simulation models of computers (servers, sensors, etc.) and the propagation of signals between such computers.  ns-3 allows researchers to build and test their research ideas on synthetic computer networks. Experimentation of this sort has several advantages, including ease of use, low cost and low barriers to entry by users, and experiment reproducibility.  However, the advantages above can also turn out to be liabilities if over-simplified or erroneous results are produced and the wrong conclusions are drawn.  This project was one of three collaborative awards aimed at enhancing the experiment management capabilities of ns-3.  This award, in particular, supported the development of software to improve the automation of ns-3 simulations.  This project contributed to the development of a data collection framework for ns-3, by defining a consistent mechanism for sampling the states of values in simulation models, a mechanism for processing the data from samples before they are sent to output, and a mechanism for consolidating the streams of values and providing the data to output files or plotting programs.  This award was also essential in sustaining the ns-3 project by providing funding to support fifteen open source software releases of the tool during this period, with each release including new features or capabilities, along with software maintenance and the web infrastructure to disseminate the software.  The broader impact of this project has been significant due to the freely available software and open source project that this award has helped to maintain.  ns-3 is one of the leading tools cited in published research that uses network simulation for performance evaluation, and several hundred publications using ns-3 are published annually, including works published in top-tier conferences and journals.  The project conducts technical discussions and help for users on two public Internet mailing lists, with a significant amount of activity (over four thousand subscribers authoring over ten thousand posts per year).  The tool has also been used as courseware at several universities and is being used in industry and government research centers.  The project has established a consortium and steering committee to help manage the continued growth and to raise funding to sustain the open source project.
