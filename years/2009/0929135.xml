<AbstractNarration>The Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Miniority Participation (OK-LSAMP) under the leadeship of Oklahoma State University will sponsor as fifth cohort  of Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) students at the University of Oklahoma.  The program will focus on the recruitment, retention, mentoring, and graduation of the students from STEM fields pursuing M. S. and Ph.D. degrees in science, technology, engineering, and technology (STEM) fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program objectives for this cohort are: (i) recruitment of 12 LSAMP graduates to the BD program by the start of the grant period, (ii) completion of coursework by each BD Fellow within the first two years of the graduate study, (iii) identification of a research mentor by the start of the 2nd year in the program, (iv) at least 80% of the fellows earning Ph.D. degrees, and (v) each BD fellow earning at least one graduate degree in a STEM field. The program has also identified four key educational outcomes that each BD fellow must achieve prior to graduation. These outcomes are: (i) knowledge of learning methods and effective teaching strategies, (ii) ability to communicate effectively, (iii) ability to perform research independently, and (iv) an understanding of the importance of life-long learning. To achieve these&lt;br/&gt;objectives and outcomes, the program has developed a strong and ambitious plan which includes workshops, seminars, socials, meetings, international research experiences, conference activities for the BD fellows and research mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BD Fellows of Cohort III will serve as mentors for the new&lt;br/&gt;fellows. Reciprocal exchanges identified between OU and Oklahoma State University?s (OSU) BD programs will benefit all BD students at both universities.  The evaluation of the program objectives and&lt;br/&gt;the assessment of the achievement of educational outcomes include input from students, external program evaluator, and the BD Council. BD Council consists of members from OU and OSU including the PI of the Oklahoma Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity involves the furthering the research on what constitutes best practices for the recruitment, retention, and graduation of underrepresented minority students with doctoral degrees in STEM fields. There are several other research initiatives at the University of Oklahoma which are targeted at the success of females and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields such as ADVANCE, IGERT, GAANN programs and Sooner Engineering Education (SEED) Research Center. Collaboration between the BD program and these other programs in the university will not only benefit the BD Fellows but also the faculty engaged in research targeted towards promoting diversity in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential impacts of the proposed activity are multidimensional. At the institutional level, success of the BD program will positively impact institutionalization of the best practices. Diversity in the graduate STEM programs will promote diversity in the undergraduate programs and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institutional commitment to diversity as evidenced by a diverse student population will undoubtedly support the efforts of diversifying STEM faculty. For Oklahoma, it will lead to stronger relationships between K-12 schools including tribal establishments and STEM programs, diversification of the pipeline for STEM education, and further stimulating economic development in the state. At the national level, graduation of at least 10 BD Fellows with Ph.D. degrees who have achieved the four key outcomes stated for the program will have a significant impact on the gender and ethnic profiles of STEM faculty in academia, as well as industry and other government agencies employing Ph.D. graduates. Dissemination of best practices through archival paper publications and presentations at professional conferences will&lt;br/&gt;broaden the impact as more institutional will implement the best practices which will in turn transform the ethnic and gender distribution of the STEM workforce and also increase the number of graduates from STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
