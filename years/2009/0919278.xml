<AbstractNarration>This proposal, from the University of Minnesota, requests funds for the design of a Facility for the Assay and Acquisition of Radio pure Materials (or FAARM), which is to include a dedicated, water-shielded room located at the 4850 ft. level, housed in a standard lab module (20m by 20m by 50 to 75m).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award, through a Cooperative Agreement, will fund the University of Minnesota in Twin Cities and collaborators to produce a Preliminary Design for such a facility to be constructed at DUSEL for experiments requiring extremely low backgrounds. Assay and acquisition of radio pure materials is essential to the success of a wide range of experiments at DUSEL, which therefore must include a low background counting facility. This work is inherently broad in impact, in that it creates screening infrastructure for use by both the rare event search community, as well as other scientific fields - many of general interest, such as national security, archaeology, public health, and environmental monitoring. Also, it will provide training of scientists in radiation-detection technologies and low-background techniques, which supplement the country's technical intelligence base, both inside and outside physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The common thread in the search for rare events or weakly interacting particles is their need for an environment free of background from cosmic rays and natural radioactivity.  Dark matter searches, solar neutrino detectors, proton decay and searches for neutrinoless double beta decay are all examples of these types of experiments.  In order to reduce backgrounds, they must move deep underground and employ shielding which is devoid of the ubiquitous radioactive trace elements found in nature.  Under this grant, we created a broad collaboration which included representatives from all major dark matter and double beta decay experiments, as well as representatives from the geology and microbiology communities.  The name given to this entity is "Assay and Acquisition of Radiopure Materials" or AARM, since we are concerned with measuring the degree of radiopurity in a large range of materials (Assay) and with finding methods to procure and store radiopure materials for the common good (Acquisition). We have worked together over the last three years to better understand low-radioactivity environments and exploit common resources. By organizing around common goals that would benefit from structured cooperation, we have succeeded in creating a forum for sharing information and advancing research goals, including new technologies for particle detection, simulation techniques, and material screening. Originally focused on the DUSEL project, we began with background characterization of the Homestake Mine and design of a low-background assay facility called the Facility for Assay and Acquisition of Radiopure Materials, or FAARM.  We then identified which projects would most benefit from shared resources and concentrated on integrative tools for underground physics, specifically:  1. Development of community-wide simulation software modules;  2. Confirmation of simulation physics models and cross sections relevant to underground science by comparing to data worldwide and supporting specific efforts in neutron benchmarking;  3. Establishment of a community materials assay database; and  4. Two AARM integration workshops per year centered on simulation, material screening, and underground physics.  The site-specific FAARM engineering design was completed for the DUSEL laboratory. It optimized economy of scale (combining ultra-sensitive and production screening in the same area) and took advantage of common infrastructure (such as purification plants and water shield engineering at DUSEL). It was designed to be a self-sufficient laboratory to service the needs of all experiments over the life of DUSEL, enclosed in its own building with a separate safety system and infrastructure.  A rendering of the design is shown in figure 1.  The sensitive assay takes place inside a toroidal lab surrounded by a water shield. In the very center of the toroid is an immersion tank for the most sensitive assay of all. A hatch and crane lifts materials and equipment to the second floor, and a monorail provides transport to the clean room preparation space above the water shield. The second floor provides sample storage and preparation space with wet benches and fume hoods, as specified by microbiology and geochemistry users, as well as some radiochemistry. In order to maintain the cleanliness of the facility, entry to the lab is through the two locker rooms which include shower and gowning facilities.  Equipment passes through the cart access interlock, which includes a cleaning station.   The goal is to maintain a 10,000 class clean room protocol throughout the building, with tighter standards in the inner tunnel lab, some assembly areas, and in the immersion tank top-loading clean room.  The design was further refined after the NSB decision to terminate DUSEL, resulting in a leaner site-independent design, see figure 2. In the newly-engineered FAARM, a water-shielded toroidal lab is retained, but much of the ancillary functions get moved to the top of the wa...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
