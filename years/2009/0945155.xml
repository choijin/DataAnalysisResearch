<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a prototype feasibility assay for low level detection of methacillin resistant Staphlococcus aureus (MRSA) protein biomarker, Penicillin Binding Protein 2a (PBP2a), using an innovative, patented detection technology.  The company has developed a detection technology called Soluble Analyte Amplification, or SAM, a versatile diagnostic platform that is capable of identifying biological molecules at currently undetectable concentrations in solution. In the US over 94,000 patients acquire MRSA bloodstream infection yearly with a mortality rate of almost 20%. Currently, no diagnostic platforms can detect MRSA directly from blood. The project will use the SAM technology to develop an assay that will detect PBP2A in blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are the development of the innovative SAM technology that will serve as a springboard from which SAM will find multiple applications in human medicine. While clinical diagnostic testing has profoundly impacted healthcare delivery, the sensitivity of tests currently on the market do not have the ability to detect molecules at the low levels observed early in disease when treatment is more efficacious. Introduction of a SAM-based assay system as a sensitive and easy to use technology for detection of proteins, carbohydrates and other molecules of interest at very low concentration will enhance the understanding of many diseases and lead to important advances in therapeutics and early detection strategies.</AbstractNarration>

The project was unable to reach the feasibility stage of development in the time frame of the award and was unable to move into a Phase II application, but several important reagents were fabricated and valuable steps accomplished that will lead to a feasibility assay in the near future.   A commercially available monoclonal antibody designated 6G10 from CalBioreagents provided the material to begin to fabricate DNA-conjugated binding constructs. Two peptide mimetics, G10-1 and G10-2, were isolated and capable of binding to monoclonal antibody 6G10.     Antibodies consist of two identical antigen-binding proteins that are covalently attached through disulfide bonds and other non-covalent interactions.

Mab 6G10 treated in this way was then conjugated to a DNA template to construct DNA-labeled antigen binding constructs described in the introduction to the SAM Technology. It is essential that the antibody be split into two chains because an antibody that can bind two antigen molecules can also bind to the immobilized peptide mimetic that is used to remove binding constructs that have not bound antigen. In the case of intact antibody, then, one arm of the bi-functional molecule can bind to antigen in the solution and another can bind to the solid phase. The result of this situation is a dramatic drop in the sensitivity of detection because only binding constructs that have bound two antigen molecules will be able to pass through the particle bed. A molecule capable of binding only one antigen will always pass through.     Work to separate intact antibodies into...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
