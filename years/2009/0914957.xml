<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many real world applications need to compress, sort, and otherwise &lt;br/&gt;manipulate large volumes of multidimensional data arrays (i.e., higher-&lt;br/&gt;order tensors), so there is an increasing need for theoretical and &lt;br/&gt;computational tools to deal with multiway data.  The subject of &lt;br/&gt;multilinear algebra and tensors has gained increasing prominence in &lt;br/&gt;the past decade due to a surge in applications such as approximation &lt;br/&gt;of Newton potentials and stochastic PDEs, image compression and &lt;br/&gt;deblurring, network traffic analysis, biological assay interpretation, &lt;br/&gt;unmixing of signals, and many more.  Such applications with higher-order&lt;br/&gt;tensors involve factorizations of the tensor.  There are multiple &lt;br/&gt;possible extensions of matrix factorizations to higher-order tensors &lt;br/&gt;(e.g. extensions of the matrix SVD), with some more amenable to certain&lt;br/&gt;applications.  The investigators are advancing the state-of-the-art in &lt;br/&gt;both theoretical and computational multilinear algebra via several newly&lt;br/&gt;developed tensor constructions based on new notions of tensor &lt;br/&gt;multiplication, orthogonality and diagonalizability.  Algorithms with &lt;br/&gt;compression schemes based on these new constructions are being &lt;br/&gt;implemented by the investigators and tested on several datasets from &lt;br/&gt;various applications including handwritten digit identification, &lt;br/&gt;genomics, the spectral unmixing problem, video compression, and computer&lt;br/&gt;image recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current applications in the sciences can involve &lt;br/&gt;analysis, classification, searching and compression of large volumes of &lt;br/&gt;data that is "multidimensional" in nature.  Consider, for example, the &lt;br/&gt;problem of facial recognition, used to identify a terrorist from within &lt;br/&gt;a database of images of known terrorists. The database can be considered &lt;br/&gt;multidimensional data in the sense that for each individual there &lt;br/&gt;corresponds a specific viewpoint, illumination, and facial expression. &lt;br/&gt;It is critical in this scenario to have an accurate and fast algorithm &lt;br/&gt;to match an unknown image against a database of images of known &lt;br/&gt;terrorists. Another example where a multidimensional representation is &lt;br/&gt;useful is genomic data.  Here, DNA microarray two-dimensional tabular &lt;br/&gt;data from different experiments is concatenated into a multidimensional &lt;br/&gt;array.  Recently published results have indicated that so-called &lt;br/&gt;'factorizations' of this multidimensional data can be used to discover &lt;br/&gt;new molecular-level interactions.  Hence, along with advances in &lt;br/&gt;computer architecture to store large datasets must come mathematically &lt;br/&gt;sound models for the compression and/or analysis of such data.  &lt;br/&gt;Development of new concepts and ideas is therefore required to deal with&lt;br/&gt;the different geometries that arise in the multidimensional case.  The &lt;br/&gt;investigators are contributing directly to this effort by developing &lt;br/&gt;innovative mathematical theory for multidimensional objects that is &lt;br/&gt;consistent with two-dimensional proven ideas.  With theoretical &lt;br/&gt;constructs in place, the investigators are able to create computational&lt;br/&gt;tools and algorithms to analyze and compress multidimensional data.  A &lt;br/&gt;significant component of the proposal is the involvement of &lt;br/&gt;undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers.  The investigators &lt;br/&gt;are leveraging the strengths of both universities in a novel, &lt;br/&gt;inter-institutional vertical integrative experience for all students &lt;br/&gt;(undergraduate and graduate) involved in the research.  This arrangement&lt;br/&gt;allows students at all levels, mentored by leading researchers in the &lt;br/&gt;field, to advance the state-of-the-art in the analysis and compression&lt;br/&gt;of multidimensional data.</AbstractNarration>
