<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0914008&lt;br/&gt;Mete Sozen&lt;br/&gt;Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wenchuan event of 12 May 2008 was a tragedy for humanity: it is reported to have caused over 80,000 fatalities and left a population of 5,000,000 people without shelter. At the same time, it was a grand experiment for science and engineering: it was a megaquake (Ms =8) that broke through to the ground leaving a surface rupture extending 270 km, it damaged a region of approximately 250,000 km. A magnificent new array of 398 strong-motion records is recorded in the affected region. Study of these data in conjunction with well documented geotechnical and structural damage is bound to result in new technology that will enable improved planning to protect society from such events in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to provide travel support for of a US delegation to attend an international workshop to be held in Guangzhou, China, in February 2009. The main goal of the workshop is to set a new research agenda to make optimum use of the Wenchuan Experience. The outcome of the workshop could guide the research communities to develop collaborative projects that would have positive impacts on the life and economic safety.&lt;br/&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of the workshop are:&lt;br/&gt;1. To specify research initiatives that will lead to major improvements in the technology for the protection of society from earthquakes. 2. To assure a thorough documentation of the available information on the effects of the Wenchuan Earthquake. 3. To identify the data that may be missing and arrange for the missing data to be obtained and documented. 4. To develop a mechanism for maintaining the momentum and the quality of the selected research initiatives. 5. To plan procedures for timely exchange of information during the conduct of the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
