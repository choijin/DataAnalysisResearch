<AbstractNarration>Efficient Operation and Control of Power System Networks with Increase Distributed Generation Penetration&lt;br/&gt;ECCS No: 0901851&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop insight into modeling of Distributed Generation (DG) particularly Renewable Energy Resources for network penetration, incorporating MW and MVAr demand response under load variability; to develop a value based optimization tool for integration of DG interconnection; to develop new performances metrics for evaluation of reliability, efficiency and congestion management of power system . The approach is aimed at developing improved models of DG and loads for grid penetration, Renewable Energy Resources response to demand system and control data approximate and determination of limits as input to overall optimized problems design of performance indices, metrics, and system studies for different scenarios associated with DG for optimum energy of the distribution or sub transmission. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research will use a computational approach to evaluate the impact of DG on network operation. A preferred method of marginal benefits of DG as a function of Location Marginal Price for voltage stability changes will be developed utilizing interior point and integer programming extensions. The robustness of the integrated scheme will be tested on a benchmark system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research will enhance optimization techniques for energy systems, thus improving system efficiency. It will further provide a contribution to the development of the autonomous Smart Grid under increased penetration of DG including alternative energy options. This is of benefit for the Nation's energy security and quality of life. The project will further facilitate training of minority students and have impact on educating the future power and energy workforce. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

We believe the algorithm   will be tested on large-scale systems with satisfactory results.  With the results obtained so far, we are confident that future electric grid design and construction will benefit from the promising preliminary works of this project.  During the research we developed three  matrices  for valuing  DG based distribution  networks .  They are  resilience ,  reliability and  sustainability as well as cost  and benefit analysis. Our findings realizes that  DG based  networks will improve reliability and stability of the overall network whie reducing economic costs of power system operation. Additionally, the results  so far provide a research  in large  scale for   deciding   to  what extent  does one   develop   DG  based  network  compared to CG based  networks .We also discovered  that accuracy of the model is an important contribution to the overall performance of the DG based grd.    The research  project has provided the opportunity to develop  new curriculum in the power system  research which attract the  best and the brightest  young  students to  consider research and career in the power field . This  has led to development of  a new  fundamentals  of  energy systems at Howard for juniors student and  also  smart grid course  for graduates  students in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. The materials from the   research are used in the courses. We believe that  broader impacts of the research   work has touched many students who participated in the research and the courses taught  by the  Principal Investigator during the life  of the grant . Several   students have completed  their  theses  and project and  are now  gainfully employed in the industry. The  projects results were  published  in refereed  journals and proceedings and  presented  at the IEEE conferences and workshops.  Summer  outreach programs were held  during the  project which used renewable energy resources with  hands on exercises.The  team based activities involve   graduate students, Research Experience Undergraduate and Pre- college student's  working in a team based environment to  validate different functions   in automation  for Distributed Generation (DG) based network for load and voltage  control.  The  research and education opportunity has helped  to  retain the interest of the students and   faculty in the  area of power systems  which has led to being awarded best paper awards at  the Howard University research Day. The  skill set for modeling and simulation which involves  power  system with different  models under uncertainties has been achieved by the students who participated in the project.
