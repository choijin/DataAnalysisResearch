<AbstractNarration> The Partnership for Advanced Marine and Environmental Science Training for Pacific Islanders improves technological education at the undergraduate and secondary school levels through the community colleges of the Pacific Islands by supporting regionally relevant curriculum development, the professional development of community college faculty and secondary school teachers, internships and field experiences for faculty, teachers, and students, and by strengthening the scientific infrastructure of the participating institutions. The activities include workshops that provide both training and the necessary tools to perform relevant research, development of articulation agreements between marine and environmental sciences programs at regional two-year colleges and minority-serving universities, research experiences and collaborations, secondary school teacher and student support, and will build on existing programs supported by NSF and NOAA to address the scientific and technical needs of the U.S.-Affiliated Pacific Islands: American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau.  The Pacific Islands contain highly diverse and unique coral reef and terrestrial ecosystems that are under elevated levels of stress and degradation due to development pressures, the effects of overfishing, and coastal pollution from sedimentation and the increased use of agrochemicals. The future of the Islands and their populations depends on the technical skills and knowledge available to local resource managers, policy makers and stakeholders. An effective means of providing critical access to accurate and adequate information, in a culturally appropriate manner, is to strengthen the capacity of the local institutions of higher education: American Samoa Community College, the College of Micronesia - FSM, the College of the Marshall Islands, Northern Marianas College, and Palau Community College. Input from local agencies, businesses and stakeholders will identify the skills needed by community college graduates to fill positions within the government and private sector.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In the past 6 years,    All faculty attended professional development training   2 footlocker workshops (content and tools: interactive global platform to share data, bio-chemistry tools to monitor abiotic variables in the ocean)    LSAMP grant writing and learning how to carry out student research in marine resource conservation.    COSEE training (content and activities: oceanographic microbes and bio-chemical linkages in the Pacific Ocean)   PCC &amp; ASCC attended professional conferences to learn new techniques and strategies to conduct research and/or mentor students. Students also attended several of these conferences.       Faculty from each of the schools have developed or carried out research with outside university faculty and/or federal or state organizations, regionally and with the mainland US including University of Michigan, University of Guam, University of Hawaii at M?noa, and the Unites States Geological Society.     127 Students were awarded internships, some as tutors for their institution, but the majority of the internships were partnered with local ?state? and/or federal environmental agencies.     66 Students have participated in or attended scientific meetings in places like Guam, Tahiti, Hawaii, and Indiana.     All institutions developed certificate programs and/or environmental clubs as a result of building strong student interest in STEM. These clubs are proactive in the community, implementing outreach to K-12 programs and a few have negotiated regional policy changes.    NMC?s NRM program has been nationally recognized and awarded for their conservation efforts by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Office.          Students in the programs at ASCC and CMI have extended their skills beyond their academic capabilities and have made their mark in changing policies. ASCC students were able to convince their Governor to sign a Territory-wide ban on plastic bags. Six years later, Hawaii would be the first state to do the same!    Both programs at ASCC and CMI have worked with their local CZM agency to support better land-use practices using equipment provided by the NSF ATE grant program.         Twenty-two articles have been published to various media outlets such as local newspapers. Other institutions have started Facebook and other social media outlets to draw attention to their Marine/Environmental programs. Several videos were produced that reach a much broader audience than the regional communities.    "The Next Generation of Young Leaders: Western Pacific Islands", a 10-minute documentary on the NSF ATE grant program, was shown locally on Palauan television, shared at the Hawaiian Conservation Alliance Conference, and accepted in  a traveling international film festival.       34 course curricula were strengthened, primarily at ASCC and PCC, and over half of those courses were articulated with a four-year University.     Over 26 local, regional, and/or federal organizations and/or non-profits have worked directly with the colleges.     Over 1,000 community college students  have directly benefited from the program   Over 2,000 students in high school have participated in science fairs and open houses as a STEM recruitment tool.    Steady increase in number of students pursuing and graduating with  Environmental and/or Marine Science AS degrees and either pursuing advanced degrees at 4-year Universities or directly entering the STEM workforce. Those students with BS, MS, and PhDs are now at the age where they are returning to their home institutions for employment in STEM-related careers.
