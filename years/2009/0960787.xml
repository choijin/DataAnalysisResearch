<AbstractNarration>Sea level rise (and in some places, sea level fall) is one of the most troublesome of ongoing environmental changes, with potential and likely impacts generating huge costs for inevitable adaptation. Despite a growing literature discussing past, present and future sea level shifts, quantitative understanding of the causes of both regional and global mean sea level change remains quite poor?because the shifts reflect some of the most basic elements of physical oceanography, geodesy, glaciology, and meteorology, including biases from inadequate and shifting observation systems and small but accumulating errors in ocean models. Almost all of the resulting issues are discussed somewhere in the voluminous and growing literature, but primarily in isolation. The intent of this project is to combine into one framework, that of a specially adapted ocean general circulation model and all of the available data, to quantify the causes of regional and global sea levelchange. Separate, but overlapping efforts would be directed to the period(s) since 1992, and the much more data sparse periods prior to that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Understanding of the components, spatial distribution and rates of sea level rise has enormous social consequences. A sea level rise of 1 mm per year versus one of 4 mm per year sustained for 25 years implies adaptation costs that differ by orders of magnitude. Observed regional rates of change, which are the ones of societal importance, are more than an order of magnitude greater and of both signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: At the present time one cannot make credible predictions, and this work should take a major step toward that goal. Impacts and adaptation strategies are not part of this proposal, but it should be of interest to anyone concerned about those problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project had three major outcomes.  In Gomez et al. (2012) we explored how sea level and ice sheets interact with one another.  It had long been appreciated that an ice sheet whose base is grounded below sea level could become unstable in the case that it began retreating when sitting on a bedslope that inclines downward as the ice retreats --- a not uncommon geometry at the margins of Antarctica.  Retreating ice then moves the point where ice intersects land deeper and implies an increased flux of ice from the ice sheet into the ocean and, therefore, further retreat --- an unstable situation.  It has also been appreciated that sea level stands higher along the margins of an ice sheet because of the gravitational attraction of the ice, and that loss of ice will, therefore, lead to a decrease in sea level relative to the remaining ice.  Combining these two effects in a time evolving model allowed us to explore the degree to which sea level could stabilize or slow the loss of Antarctic ice.  Depending on the geometry of the land at the base of the ice, sea level changes can slow rates of ice loss by a factor of two or even help to stabilize ice loss through giving more time for crustal rebound to occur.  Second, ocean circulation is generally constrained through using estimates of density to determine pressure gradients and flow, but this information is sparse making it interesting to explore the utility of other sorts of observations.  Much more abundant are tracers that do not contain direct information about density but do indicate flow pathways, and in earlier work we developed a mathematical model to optimally determine such flow pathways.  Applying this model to a wide variety of available ocean tracer data allowed us to resolve features of ocean circulation not previously accessible at the global scale.   In one study (Gebbie and Huybers 2011) we determined how much of the ocean interior is filled from thousands of distinct surface regions and found a general description of the ranked volume associated with each surface grid box.  This ranking helps to constrain the overall relevance of advections and diffusion in determining the interior properties of the ocean.  In related work, we explored the discrepancy whereby the estimated time elapsed since interior waters were last in contact with the surface determined using ocean models is older than observationally inferred ages using radiocarbon.  We showed that taking into account the mixing of a large number of distinct surface properties when inferring age from radiocarbon reconciles this discrepancy (Gebbie and Huybers 2012).    Third, and finally, intrinsic variability in ocean temperature variability was explored using proxies derived from sediments (MgCa and alkenones) and corals (Sr and delta18O).  Discrepancies amongst major classes of proxy temperature estimates were demonstrated and then reconciled using a statistical model of the noise, sampling, and sediment-mixing influences on the proxy record (Laepple and Huybers 2013).  Having a self-consistent estimate of ocean temperature variability, we then compare the proxy estimates against instrumental data and model outputs.  Consistent with instrumental observations, the proxies document a large-magnitude difference between ocean temperature variability and model simulations at small spatial scales and at decadal and longer timescales, especially in the tropics (Laepple and Huybers 2014).  This discrepancy could result from ocean models being too diffusive or from having too weak air-sea interactions.        References:  Gomez, N., Pollard, D., Mitrovica, J.
