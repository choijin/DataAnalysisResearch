<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to evaluate the velocity-electric field characteristics of single crystal based and polycrystalline organic transistors.  The approach is to use both DC and transient measurements to measure the velocities at electric fields up to 106 V/cm.  DC measurements involve the extraction of velocities from the output characteristics of a set of small-channel length devices.  Transient measurements involve the measurement of channel formation time and the extraction of velocity information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Knowledge of the charge carrier velocity-electric field relationship is important in understanding charge transport mechanisms in organic transistors. Such measurements are not routinely done by research groups due to the requirement of specialized instrumentation, device structures, and measurement methods. The proposed work will address this need and fill this gap. Additionally, the proposed research will enable the characterization of trapping phenomena and its effects on the turn-on and turn-off characteristics of transistors.  This will be useful in designing circuits and systems such as displays based on organic transistors. Trapping phenomena are especially important in thin-film transistors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.:  This work will lead to the continued development of coursework in organic electronics as well as the production of trained human resources for industry/academia including Ph.Ds.   Minority and women students will be given research opportunities leading to enhanced diversity in the workforce.  Interactions with US-based industries will lead to knowledge transfer of information generated from this work and collaborative work. Outreach to area schools will promote interest in science and engineering among such students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is a significant trend towards designing electronic circuits and systems on flexible substrates.  This trend is in keeping with the spread of electronic functionality everywhere and the emergence of new materials systems, device architectures, and fabrication processes to create new types of electronic circuits.  This has led to projections that this new sector &ndash; flexible hybrid electronics &ndash; will be an important part of the economy in the next 20 years, with significant growth beginning in a few years. Organic and polymer transistor based circuits are key components in flexible electronic systems and are being investigated for a number of low-cost, large-area applications.  These applications include display switches, display drivers, radio-frequency identification tags and various types of sensors and actuators.     Organic transistors are devices in which the active semiconductor material is composed of an organic or polymeric material rather than an inorganic semiconductor such as silicon.  There are numerous organic semiconductors that have been reported to date.  Key figures of merit for organic transistors are carrier mobility, which is a measure of how fast the transistor can operate and on/off current ratio, which defines how good of a switch a transistor is.  Other figures of merit include reliability, compatibility with other materials, etc.     There continues to be a major drive to create new organic semiconductors with improved properties.  One area of active research area is the field of donor-acceptor conjugated polymers.  Recently, these materials have exhibited the highest mobilities of any organic semiconductor other than a single crystal.  The research we have conducted improved our understanding of the device science of such transistors and enabled us to extract key scientific information to help understand how these materials work and how the can be further improved.  We have characterized in detail how charges (electrons and holes) move in the most promising of these donor-acceptor polymers that have been discovered so far.  We have also devised new characterization methods that enable us to study devices while they are still turning on.  We have also reported new device configurations and structures (dual gate devices) with donor-acceptor polymers. This research will impact the fields of displays, sensors, and thin-film, flexible electronics.       Last Modified: 11/28/2012       Submitted by: Ananth Dodabalapur]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
