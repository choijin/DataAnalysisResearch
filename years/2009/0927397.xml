<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this GOALI award is to develop theoretical foundations, algorithmic infrastructure, and computational framework for robust geometric computation required by complex component design.  The new approach is based on a point representation, layer-depth normal image, by converting a continuous surface into a set of points.  Layer-based additive manufacturing will be the primary target fabrication approach for the processed geometric forms in this project. Key research activities will include: (1) investigating a point-based geometric computation theory and related techniques for improving its robustness; (2) developing a set of point-based geometric operations and related computational approaches that are effective and efficient; (3) investigating a parallel computing strategy and related algorithms for point-based geometric operations; and (4) verifying the developed prototype software by using aerospace and biomedical test cases.  By working closely with an industrial partner, the research will result in prototype software for designing complex product components and a library of geometric operations and test cases that will be publicly available from a project website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide an opportunity to create a component design with dramatically more complex shapes for achieving better performance such as multi-functionality and the minimum usage of material and energy.  Example applications include bioengineering, aerospace, and tooling. Such complex shape design could also bring about a transformational breakthrough to the applications of direct digital manufacturing, which can be a disruptive manufacturing technology. This work will also enhance the infrastructure for research and education by building software systems, teaching materials, lab projects, and case studies.  Graduate and undergraduate engineering students and mid-career professionals will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research. Outreach programs to high school students will be utilized to increase minority participation. The designed hands-on learning experience and exposure to real world applications will increase domestic students' interest in science and engineering and, therefore, strengthen our competitiveness in the global workforce.</AbstractNarration>
