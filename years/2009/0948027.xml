<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of Nanotechnologies for Energy Production and Environmental Protection in Rural Areas of Wyoming&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maohong Fan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description &lt;br/&gt; Project goals are to provide opportunities for GK-12 Fellows to assume responsibilities as researchers, grade 10-12 (G10-12) educators and students and to infuse STEM education with energy and environmental nanotechnology (ee-nanotechnology); and to foster the collaborations of University of Wyoming (UW) with its partners to enhance STEM education. &lt;br/&gt; Project theme is to disseminate ee-nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt; The related STEM disciplines are chemical, environmental and mechanical engineering; physics, chemistry, mathematics. &lt;br/&gt; The approaches include expanding the transferable expertise of GK-12 Fellows in ee-nanotechnology, providing ee-nanotechnology knowledge for K-12 teachers and students, increasing students? STEM career interests, strengthening UW?s collaborations with its partners, utilizing cyber infrastructure in GK-12 programs, and sustaining the project. The innovative approach is to use cyber infrastructure for spread of ee-nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;  The activities to be conducted include involvement of Fellows, teachers and students with ee-nanotechnology projects, seminars, various collaborations; Fellows? service learning from G10-12 teachers and students; participation of teachers in UW?s classes and research works; joint-development of STEM curricula by teachers, Fellows and mentors; integration of the project into UW graduate program; and expansion of cyber infrastructure for GK-12 programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt; The project will enhance GK12 Fellows? understanding of ee-nanotechnology while improving their communication, team building and leadership skills. G10-12 teachers will improve their STEM content knowledge and instructional strategies. G10-12 students will become more interested in STEM careers. UW will benefit from institutionalizing K12 STEM partnerships in its graduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In classrooms across the state of Wyoming and on the campus of the University of Wyoming, Wyoming, middle and high school students were immersed in cutting-edge nanotechnology research. These students built Wilson-Cloud chambers to detect radioactive particles, used different colored candies to learn about light absorption and designing materials to absorb light for solar cell applications, became &lsquo;geologists for a day&rsquo; as they explored current issues related to petroleum engineering, and gazed into the future of DNA nanotechnology and DNA origami. Each of these activities involved a unique partnership between a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) graduate student at the University of Wyoming and a Wyoming teacher.&nbsp; These partnerships were made possible through the EENano program, an NSF GK-12 project.</p> <p>From 2010 to 2016, the EENano program fostered partnerships with over 30 Wyoming teachers to engage middle and high school students from rural communities in real-world STEM activities.&nbsp; During this time, 25 PhD and Master&rsquo;s students were supported and given training to enable them to successfully communicate the intricacies of their research through engaging and hands-on activities.&nbsp; Each graduate student&rsquo;s research was related to nanotechnology, an emerging field with which many middle- and high- school teachers and students were unfamiliar.&nbsp;</p> <p>The heart of the EENano project was the collaboration between Partner Teachers and Graduate Fellows, and there was a significant impact on both. Fellows received training to develop their Energy and or Nanotechnology lessons using the principles of inquiry. Partner Teachers appreciated the infusion of new activities and ideas to their curriculum, and their students appreciated learning in an inquiry-driven and hands-on atmosphere. Graduate Fellows learned how to best present their research in an interactive, engaging, and understandable method. Partner Teachers were challenged to teach outside their comfort zone and to learn more about nanotechnology, engineering, energy and environmental topics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>For Partner Teachers, Fellows, and Wyoming students, the EENano Program provided opportunities to help teachers (and schools) incorporate new ideas and cutting-edge research in STEM fields into existing STEM curriculum. By taking Energy and Environmental Nanotechnology research and sharing it at an age-appropriate level, three major goals were met, all in sync:</p> <ul> <li>ONE: Fellows gained confidence and leadership skills, broadened their understanding of nanotechnology and their own areas of research. Through teaching and collaboration they increased their communication skills and learned to contribute as part of a team. Making their research understandable to a non-technical audience gave Fellows new insights on their own research and their field in general as well as a deeper understanding and renewed passion for their field as they got caught up in student excitement at doing their hands-on, &lsquo;real&rsquo; science activities.</li> <li>TWO: Partner Teachers gained insight into nanotechnology and the cultures and practices of science. Their students not only got to interact with practicing scientists but also were able to see real-world connections between the science in their textbooks and cutting-edge research. Partner Teachers also learned about current research happening at the University, which helped reignite their own passion for teaching science and updated their content knowledge. The lessons and activities devised and implemented by Graduate Fellows within Partner Teacher classrooms were designed to provide content-rich and research-current activities Partner Teachers can integrate in their courses. This extends the reach of the program beyond the students who worked with the Graduate Fellows to the Partner Teacher&rsquo;s future students.</li> <li>THREE: Allowing Wyoming K-12 students to do &lsquo;real&rsquo; science with a &lsquo;real&rsquo; scientist or engineer increased their interest for STEM fields. By connecting Graduate Fellows' research with what the teacher is teaching and showing students concrete examples of when, indeed, they will use &ldquo;all that stuff&rdquo;, this program gave middle and high school students a taste of where science and engineering can take them &ndash; and why it is so important. Graduate Fellows are inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers &ndash; helping these students picture themselves as the future STEM leaders.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> </ul><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2016<br>      Modified by: Maohong&nbsp;Fan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0948027/0948027_10017935_1472572858959_IMG_7960--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0948027/0948027_10017935_1472572858959_IMG_7960--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Geologist for a Day"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0948027/0948027_10017935_1472572858959_IMG_7960--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Geologist for a Day"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students become ?Geologist for a Day,? in an oil-finding activity designed to expose students to the basic concepts of petroleum geology.
