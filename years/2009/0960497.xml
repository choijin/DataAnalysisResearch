<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to understand some basic physical mechanisms which contribute to climate variability and climate change.  Three research topics will be pursued.  The first is the interaction through which the extratropical impact of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is regulated by the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and vice versa.  Preliminary work shows that when the QBO is easterly or ENSO is in its warm state the polar vortex is weak, but when either of these conditions hold, the influence of the other is weak.  The research will be conducted using the NCAR Whole Earth Community Climate Model (WACCM), with modifications to generate and sustain the QBO.  The second topic is the interaction between jet streams and high-frequency transient eddies which plays a dominant role in the natural climate variability of the extratropics.  Earlier work by the Principal Investigator (PI) and a student showed that eddy-jet interactions produce a positive feedback which enhances the persistence of low-frequency annular modes.  The work here seeks to understand how a similar positive feedback operates in the variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation.  The primary tool for the analysis would be ensemble sensitivity analysis, performed using multiple simulations from a barotropic model and later multi-level baroclinic models.  The third topic is the hypothesis that the temperature of tropical anvil clouds remains about the same under global warming (the Fixed Anvil Temperature, or FAT, hypothesis), previously developed by the PI and his students.  The PI's previous work suggested that FAT behavior is related to clear-sky radiative cooling, and the PI suggests that this behavior can explain the similarity of longwave cloud feedbacks in global warming simulations.  One avenue of experimentation would be to modify the water vapor passed to the radiation code of the model independently of the water vapor tracked in the convection scheme and other components of the model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three graduate students will be supported under this grant, thus providing for the education of the next generating of scientists.  In addition, research on the above topics will enhance understanding of climate variability and change, and may be beneficial for the development of prediction capabilities for short-term climate variability and long-term climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes: AGS-0960947     Research under this grant showed that warming and cooling of the tropical Pacific Ocean associated with El Ni&ntilde;o contributes to variability in the tropical winter stratosphere.  Sudden warming events in the polar Northern Hemisphere stratosphere are more likely when the tropical Pacific is in its warm, el Ni&ntilde;o phase.  Using a combination of past observations and modeling, it was shown that the cold winter in eastern North American in 2013-14 was caused to a significant extent by sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean.      The role of the atmospheric energy balance in constraining global mean precipitation changes associated with warming climate was demonstrated.  While the global-average rainfall is constrained to increase less than the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, the precipitation intensity shifts to higher values, such that larger rain rates become more likely in a warmed climate.  Absorbing aerosols (soot) in the atmosphere reduces the mean rainfall rate.      Climate models predict that clouds in middle and high latitudes, such as over the Southern Hemisphere ocean, will reflect more solar radiation in a warmer climate, yielding a negative feedback in those latitudes.  Research conducted under this grant showed that in the current generation of global climate models this is caused by the transition from cloud ice to cloud water as the climate warms.  Water droplets are more reflective and stay in the atmosphere longer than ice particles.  This leads to a cooling of the high latitudes relative to the tropics and requires the atmosphere to transport more energy toward the pole in a warmer climate.  This leads to a poleward shift of the storm track in midlatitudes and an expansion of the tropical dry zone associated with sinking motion in the subtropical atmosphere (15-40 degrees of latitude).  Observational evidence suggests that the models have too much ice in high latitude clouds, and that this "cloud ice to cloud water" feedback is probably exaggerated in models compared to nature.  If so, then the subtropical drying associated with warming may also be exaggerated in models.     Storm tracks that produce midlatitude weather tend to move north and south as a consequence of interactions between the storms and the mean westerly winds in which they are embedded.  Theory and modeling was used to show that the feedbacks that drive these north-south movements of the storm tracks become suppressed when the jet is at a high enough latitude, simply due to the spherical shape of the Earth.  This means that variations in the jet position will become less as the storm track shifts farther poleward, and that there is a maximum latitude beyond which the jet shift cannot go and near which variations in the jet position will be suppressed.  This explains why models that have jets displaced too far equatorward also have too large variability in jet position.  The Southern Hemisphere jet and storm track are already near the latitude where sphericity will limit further poleward migration.     High ice clouds in the tropics heat the upper troposphere by absorbing infrared radiation from below.  This causes the temperature to be warmer than it would otherwise be.  High spatial resolution, cloud-resolving model simulations indicate that the amount of high ice cloud can be enhanced by radiative heating of ice cloud layers.  Possible changes in the amount of high altitude tropical ice cloud are a key uncertainty in determining climate sensitivity, the amount by which we expect Earth to warm in response to natural and human-induced forcing of climate change.     Work supported by this grant led to the award of 5 PhD degrees, three to men and two to women.       Last Modified: 02/14/2017       Submitted by: Dennis L Hartmann]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
