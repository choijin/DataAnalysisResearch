<AbstractNarration>This proposal encompasses the preparation of a variety of cyclic and acyclic compounds from environmentally friendly and readily available starting materials.  The Louie's laboratory recently discovered a potentially important intermediate in Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.  Mechanistic analysis of both cycloaddition reactions as well as cross-coupling reactions will be continued.  Concurrent to these investigations, reactive M-CO2 intermediates will be synthesized and their reactivity toward other substrates will be explored with the intention of incorporating these reactivity patterns into the repertoire of new catalytic reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Janis Louie of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah.  Professor Louie's research efforts revolve around the development of facile transition metal-mediated methods for the formation of cyclic and acyclic compounds.  In addition, new methods for utilizing benign starting materials such as carbon dioxide will be evaluated. Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A potentially attractive method for the rapid construction of carbon-heteroatom and carbon-carbon bonds, which are ubiquitous in pharmaceutical compounds, is the cycloaddition of unsaturated compounds.  Cycloaddition reactions provide an ideal, atom-efficient entry to ring systems.  As such, we chose to build a research program centered around the development of a general Ni-based cycloaddition catalyst system because 1) mechanistically, heteroatom incorporation and concurrent inhibition of side product formation seemed more tangible for the Ni system; and 2) stoichiometric oxidative coupling reactions suggested that Ni may have a higher reactivity (and therefore more generality) than the traditional Co and existing Rh and Ru systems.  Our efforts have paid off as we have developed a general Ni catalyst that allows one to prepare numerous cyclic structures from readily available starting materials.  In addition, many of these cycloadditions were not only impractical but completely unavailable to synthetic chemists before our discoveries.  We have since expanded our focus to include the development of new Fe based cycloaddition catalysts.  These efforts revolve around the premise that catalysts should not only be effective, but would preferably be composed of cheap starting materials rather than of expensive precious metals.  With each of our cycloaddition systems, we continue to ask the fundamental questions of how the catalyst mediates the reactions so that newer, better systems can be developed.
