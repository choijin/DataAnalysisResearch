<AbstractNarration>This award provides  partial support for a 4-day  conference on designs, codes and geometries. The meeting will take place on March 29-April 1, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;The funds will be used to support five speakers as well as a number of graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together researchers from designs, codes and geometries in one setting. There have been exciting recent developments in these areas recently. Overall, the organizers plan 10 fifty-minute talks by the invited speakers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference webpage URL is:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.udel.edu/~xiang/Conf.html&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Conference on Designs, Codes and Geometries, supported by NSF grant DMS 0962694, took place during March 29--April 1, 2010 at the University of Delaware (Lewes campus). We had a total of 9 plenary talks by internationally well-known experts in the three research areas in the title of the conference, and a total of 21 contributed talks. This conference provided an opportunity for researchers and graduate students working in the three areas mentioned above to discuss latest developments, exchange open problems and share ideas. We were especially pleased to see a large number of junior researchers and graduate students at the conference.  Designs, codes and geometries are important research areas in discrete mathematics. Geometry, of course, has had a long history, while the areas of designs and codes are relatively young. Combinatorial designs first arose in recreational mathematics problems, such as Euler's 36 officer problem, and later in the design of statistical experiments. They have many applications in other disciplines, including coding theory, cryptography, computer science, and electrical engineering. Designs, geometries and codes are intimately related. Many efficient error-correcting codes are constructed from designs and geometries. These codes are used nowadays in our daily life, for example, in CD players, high speed modems, and cellular phones.
