<AbstractNarration>This U.S.-India International Research Experience for Students(IRES)award is  for a Summer Research Program in Green Chemistry that will take place at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science(IACS)in Kolkata, India.  It is an opportunity for twelve Southeast Missouri State University(SMSU) undergraduates to conduct research in Green Chemistry at the IACS under lead mentor, Professor B.C. Ranu, Head of the Department of Organic Chemistry and four organic chemists in his department.  For each of three years, four students will spend 8 weeks at the IACS working on collaborative research projects investigating catalysts for organic synthesis and visiting nearby research facilities.  &lt;br/&gt;Conducting research in Green Chemistry at a well-known post-graduate research institution in India with highly qualified investigators has great strength and the potential to provide an innovative, quality research experience for SMSU undergraduates.  The intellectual merit of this proposal is strong and the research topic timely.  The technical qualifications of the Indian lead mentor are unquestionably high, the proposed research topics are well-thought-out, and they address cutting-edge topics of both academic and applied chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project facilitated scientific visits during the summers of 2011, 2012, and 2013 for fourteen undergraduate students to conduct collaborative research in green chemistry at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS) in Kolkata, West Bengal, India.  Intellectual Merit.  This green chemistry project addressed the problem of limiting waste and maximizing atom efficiency in organic chemistry.  The students developed new methods for converting various types of alcohols to aldehydes or carboxylic acids and sulfides to sulfones using ruthenium based catalysts.  Fifteen alcohols were converted to aldehydes at room temperature in yields up to 99%.  Ten alcohols and one aldehyde were converted to the corresponding carboxylic acids in yields up to 100%. The reaction of 19 sulfides under similar conditions produced the corresponding sulfones in yields ranging from 58-100%.  Broader Impact. Participants were involved in significant research that generated new methods that limits pollution.   These results have generated six presentations at American Chemical Society regional and national meetings. Eight male students and six female students including one minority student participated in the project. This project has provided the opportunity for our students to participate in globally significant research and cultural activities otherwise not available to them.  A significant benefit of this project was that the participants worked side-by-side with Indian graduate students and lived directly among the Indian people.
