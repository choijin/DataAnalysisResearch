<AbstractNarration>Natural language processing, information extraction, information&lt;br/&gt;integration and other text processing solutions are central components&lt;br/&gt;of computer science, and key tools for addressing the ever-increasing&lt;br/&gt;problems in information overload.  Issues of information overload are&lt;br/&gt;not only personal problems, but critical for business productivity,&lt;br/&gt;national defense, and increasingly government decision-making and&lt;br/&gt;transparency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State-of-the-art natural language processing is increasingly based on&lt;br/&gt;machine learning.  However, the methodologies can be complex, and&lt;br/&gt;software infrastructure necessary for such systems is generally&lt;br/&gt;difficult to develop from scratch.  To address this need we have&lt;br/&gt;created MALLET (MAchine Learning for LanguagE) and FACTORIE (Factor&lt;br/&gt;graphs, Imperative, Extensible), open-source software toolkit that run&lt;br/&gt;in the Java virtual machine.  They provide many modern&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art machine learning methods, specially tuned to be&lt;br/&gt;scalable for the idiosyncrasies of natural language data, while also&lt;br/&gt;applying well to many other discrete non- language tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will fill three critical gaps: (1) broadening these&lt;br/&gt;toolkits' applicability to new data and tasks (with better end-user&lt;br/&gt;interfaces for labeling, training and diagnostics), (2) greatly&lt;br/&gt;enhancing their research-support capabilities (with infrastructure for&lt;br/&gt;flexibly specifying model structures), and (3) improving their&lt;br/&gt;understandability and support (with new documentation, examples,&lt;br/&gt;online community support).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have a direct positive impact on NLP and other&lt;br/&gt;machine learning research, on teaching, and on collaborative research&lt;br/&gt;activities.  Well-designed toolkits not only help researchers avoid&lt;br/&gt;duplicate implementation effort, but (a) they encourage sharing of&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and code, and thus also cultivate increased collaboration&lt;br/&gt;and intellectual flow of ideas; (b) they foster the communication of&lt;br/&gt;detailed clarity of algorithms and scientific reproducibility; (c)&lt;br/&gt;they help "level the playing field" by providing state-of-the-art&lt;br/&gt;implementations of foundational building blocks and recent methods to&lt;br/&gt;top-tier and small institutions alike; (d) they supply a teaching&lt;br/&gt;tool, not only by making it easy for students to experiment with the&lt;br/&gt;supplied research methodologies.  Furthermore, by providing multiple&lt;br/&gt;ready-to-use systems, non-programmers will have access to modern,&lt;br/&gt;scalable implementations of text processing tools that will spread&lt;br/&gt;knowledge and use of these techniques across fields, to the social&lt;br/&gt;sciences, humanities, and bio-medical fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/nsf-mallet</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF MALLET - Project Outcomes     Natural language processing, information extraction, information integration and other text processing solutions are central components of computer science, and key tools for addressing the ever-increasing problems in information overload.  Issues of information overload are not only personal problems, but critical for business productivity, national defense, and increasingly (as the Obama administration has made a stated goal of "evidence-based" policy) government decision-making and transparency.  State-of-the-art natural language processing is increasingly based on machine learning.  However, the methodologies can be complex, and software infrastructure necessary for such systems is generally difficult to develop from scratch.  To address this need we have created MALLET (MAchine Learning for LanguagE) and FACTORIE (FACTOR graphs, Imperative, Extensible), open-source software toolkits that run in the Java virtual machine. They provide many modern state-of-the-art machine learning methods, specially tuned to be scalable for the idiosyncrasies of natural language data, while also applying well to many other discrete non- language tasks.  Other toolkits for machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) exist, but, MALLET and FACTORIE play distinguished roles in their strong combination of both ML and NLP, and their already-successful use by a broad community.  This project has filled three critical gaps in features of the tools: (1) broadening these toolkits' applicability to new data and tasks (with better end-user interfaces for labeling, training and diagnostics), (2) greatly enhancing their research-support capabilities (with infrastructure for flexibly specifying model structures), (3) improving their understandability and support (with new documentation, examples, online community support), (4) a complete and state-of-the-art natural language processing pipeline was added to FACTORIE.  As a result of this project, more than 50k lines of code were added to FACTORIE, new state-of-the-art algorithms were developed for data science model specification, probabilistic inference, parameter estimation, classification, sequence labeling and natural language parsing.  We completed integration of FACTORIE into the Apache SPARK pipeline (a widely-used fast and general engine for big data processing).  As a result, FACTORIE can now seamlessly be used to run a complete natural language processing pipeline in parallel, using SPARK distributed parallelization on data stored in SPARK storage standards; we coordinated with the SPARK team in making this possible.  By providing reusable building blocks of cutting-edge machine learning capabilities to natural language practitioners, our work has accelerated research in these areas, advanced and spread understanding of scientific details not often sufficiently explained in the text of research papers, and integrate research and education.  By providing multiple ready-to-use systems, non-programmers now have access to modern, scalable implementations of text processing tools that have spread knowledge and use of these scientific techniques across fields, to the social sciences, humanities, and bio-medical fields.  MALLET 2.0 and FACTORIE 1.2 have been publicly released as open source software, and are available through mallet.cs.umass.edu and factorie.cs.umass.edu respectively.  MALLET is now widely used for topic modeling in the social sciences and humanities.  FACTORIE was used to win multiple tracks of the BioNLP competition, extracting information about bio-medicine from PubMed articles.    MALLET and FACTORIE have now been cited in over 1,700 research publications, including papers from UMass Amherst, Berkeley, Harvard, Carnegie Mellon, University of Maryland, University College London, KU Leuven, University of Illinois, University of Stuttgart, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, Indiana University, and many others.  One of our own papers about our FACTORIE work won an Outstanding Paper Award at the Conference of the Association of Computational Linguistics, the flagship conference in the field.  Over the course of the project, over ten students received training in software engineering, machine learning, and methods for operating on big data; many have already graduated and and employed in companies that value their expertise gained from the project.  MALLET and FACTORIE have been used by hundreds of companies, both small and large, including multiple startup companies, small defense contractors, Oracle, Amazon, IBM, and Google.
