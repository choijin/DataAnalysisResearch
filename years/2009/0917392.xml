<AbstractNarration>Web applications are prevalent and enable much of today's online&lt;br/&gt;business including banking, shopping, university admissions, and various&lt;br/&gt;governmental activities.  However, the quality of such applications is&lt;br/&gt;usually low, and they are increasingly popular targets for attack.  This&lt;br/&gt;project aims at developing practical testing and analysis mechanisms and&lt;br/&gt;tools to secure web applications. In particular, it focuses on&lt;br/&gt;developing novel, principled techniques to address the following&lt;br/&gt;research issues: (1) how to formalize security threats in web&lt;br/&gt;applications; (2) how to provide runtime security for deployed&lt;br/&gt;applications via dynamic monitoring; and (3) how to provide static&lt;br/&gt;security enforcement during application development and testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is interdisciplinary, touching upon a number of requisite&lt;br/&gt;areas including computer security, software engineering, and programming&lt;br/&gt;languages. It has the potential to advance knowledge in each of these&lt;br/&gt;disciplines with novel formulations of security requirements, systems&lt;br/&gt;concepts, and advanced testing and analysis techniques.  The project&lt;br/&gt;also has the potential for significant industrial and societal impact.&lt;br/&gt;Through the proposed research, education, and outreach activities, the&lt;br/&gt;project will empower web application developers with the knowledge,&lt;br/&gt;methodologies, and development tools to build secure web&lt;br/&gt;applications. Testing and analysis tools developed in the project will&lt;br/&gt;also be distributed to other institutions and the industry for teaching,&lt;br/&gt;research, and experimental evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[For the duration of this NSF project, we, the principal investigator and graduate students, have investigated novel and practical techniques to detect, analyze, and prevent vulnerabilities and attacks in Web and database applications. The conducted research and education activities have advanced our understanding regarding attack detection and prevention for these important software systems, helped discover many serious vulnerabilities in widely-deployed software, and trained next generation security researchers and engineers. More specifically,   - We have developed a low-overhead, purely browser-side mechanism to   detect the fast-spreading cross-scripting (XSS) worms.   - We have developed effective testing and analysis techniques that   have been used to uncover serious vulnerabilities in popular Web   applications (such as osCommerce, which powers more than 10,000   online stores), thus significantly improving the security of   existing software and systems.   - We have substantially advanced our knowledge regarding software   security by investigating new types of vulnerabilities, and   inventing new techniques to detect attacks and vulnerabilities.   - We have disseminated our research results through publications in   top outlets such as highly-competitive conferences and premium   journals, public tool releases, and research exchanges.   - We have successfully trained the next generation computer security   experts through graduate student advising and engineers through   undergraduate and graduate level education.
