<AbstractNarration>This research program will examine the reionization of the Universe in both hydrogen and helium, combining analytical and numerical approaches to elucidate the physics underlying reionization and how it is influenced by the nature and abundance of the ionizing sources and the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM).  The analysis will be further employed to consider the impact of reionization on observable signatures of this process, including fluctuations in 21 cm radiation from hydrogen at high redshifts, surveys of Ly-alpha emitting galaxies, spectra of gamma-ray bursts, and the statistical properties of the Lyman-alpha forest. The results of this investigation will be used to guide optimal observing strategies for ongoing and future experiments to investigate emission from high-redshift galaxies, quasars, and diffuse gas in the IGM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work include training of underrepresented students, and public outreach through visualizations and simulations accessible through the web.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Technological progress has made it possible for astronomers to make detailed observations of regions and objects in our Universe throught its cosmic history. We have images of regions of the Universe as they were 380,000 years after the Big Bang to observations of objects in our vecinity, nearly 14 billion years after the Big Bang and many epochs in between.   This observations have allowed us to understand how the Universe around us came to be through the development of detailed mathematical models that incorporate the physical laws as measured in the laboratory.  The work funded by this proposal was aimed at perfecting these physical models so that we can better understand some of the existing and upcoming observations.  Although our models explain many of  observations extremely well, there are several intreaguing features of our model, such as the fact that the Universe appears to contain large amounts of an unknown substance we call dark matter. There are also periods in the Universe's history we have very little information about, such as the so-called Cosmic Dawn era, when the first stars and galaxies appers.  The work of this proposal was directly aimed at unswering these puzzles which will ultimately be done by combining better measurements with improved theoretical understanding of the physical processes at work such as those provided by the results from this work.
