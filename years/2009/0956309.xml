<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research project is to examine the ways in which people's feelings (i.e., affect) influence their thoughts, judgments, and behavior. Many theories of affect and cognition suggest that specific feelings lead individuals to process information either globally (with a focus on the big picture) or locally (with a focus on details).  A large body of research suggests that happiness is tied to global processing, whereas sadness is tied to local processing.  The current research challenges the notion of a dedicated link between particular feeling states and global versus local processing.  This project advances a theoretical framework that suggests that the impact of feelings on information processing is highly malleable and depends significantly on the context in which the feelings are experienced.  The research tests this framework in three key social psychological domains that are of both theoretical and real-world importance: the self, impression formation, and perceptions of groups.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four sets of two studies will examine the impact of feelings and global versus local processing inclinations when generating information about the self (Studies 1-2), when forming impressions of others under typical experimental conditions (Studies 3-4) and under more real-world decision-making conditions (Studies 5- 6), and when forming perceptions of groups members (Studies 7-8). Studies 5-8 are also designed to extend the proposed framework to more real-world judgment contexts (hiring, voting) where individuals actively seek out information about others to form a judgment and to situations in which individuals can engage in meaningful real-world behaviors (i.e., helping group members, voting).  This research project will advance our theoretical understanding of the affect-cognition relationship while advancing knowledge in key social psychological domains.  Knowledge gained from this research will shed light on how real-world judgments and behaviors are influenced by feelings. This project will also provide scientific training and educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, some of whom are members of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research demonstrates that feelings play a ubiquitous role in our everyday lives and have a significant influence on everything from how satisfied we are to how we perceive stimuli in the world around us. Contrary to classical views in philosophy and psychology that embrace the notion that removing the affective component from thought will lead to more rational judgments, this work embraces the notion that affect and cognition are necessary allies that work in tandem to produce adaptive responses. A fundamental assumption in this work is that feelings convey valuable information that guides individuals' thoughts, judgments, and behavior. This project sought to enhance our understanding of the ways in which feelings influence ordinary, everyday information processing, judgment, and behavior.  This project applied the Affect-as-Information (AAI) framework to investigate the influence of affective experiences (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, fear) on global versus local information processing. This long-standing distinction between global and local processing captures differences in the extent to which individuals rely on abstract, global information (e.g., stereotypes) versus detailed, specific information (e.g., behaviors).  Changing individuals' processing styles can significantly alter their perceptions, judgments, and behavior.  This research directly challenged the longstanding view in psychology that different affective states are tied to specific processing styles by demonstrating that the impact of affect on processing is highly malleable.  This work advanced the theory that rather than prescribe particular processing styles, as past research has assumed, affect influences information processing by either promoting (i.e., in the case of happiness) or inhibiting (i.e., in the case of sadness) preexisting information processing tendencies. In this way, affect acts as a psychological traffic cop that regulates perception, judgment, and behavior.  This program of research rigorously tested the novel AAI framework in three key social psychological domains that are of both theoretical and real-world importance: the self, impression formation, and perceptions of groups.  Supportive evidence was found in all three domains.  For example, feelings significantly altered the extent to which active information processing inclinations were expressed, influencing the extent to which individuals described themselves in abstract (e.g., I am angry) versus more concrete (e.g., I am angry at work) ways (Isbell, Rovenpor, &amp; Lair, under review).  These findings have potential implications for clinical psychology and therapeutic interventions.   In the stereotyping domain, affect influenced the extent to which both temporary processing inclinations induced  in the laboratory, as well as more dispositional processing inclinations naturally adopted by individuals, led individuals to rely on stereotypes versus individuating information when forming impressions of an individual (Hunsinger, Isbell, &amp; Clore, 2012).  In addition, studies on intergroup perceptions demonstrated that global impressions of groups (which are often stereotypic) are easily changed by altering both perceiversÆ current feelings and their active processing inclinations.  Specifically, the extent to which individuals perceived members of a highly stigmatized group (i.e., homeless individuals) as similar to one another was easily increased and decreased.  PerceiversÆ attributions for homelessness were similarly altered, as were their intentions to donate money to help homeless individuals and organizations (Isbell, Lair, &amp; Rovenpor, under review).  Given the difficulties in society that result from stereotypes, such findings help us understand the conditions under which stereotyping is less likely to occur and present a possible avenue for increasing individuation of out-group members, increasing helping behavior, and promoting more positive relations between group...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
