<AbstractNarration>This project will create a substantial U.S. presence in the international Visiting Lecturer Program (VLP) in mathematics, organized and sponsored by the International Mathematical Union (IMU). Under this program, mathematicians from developed countries deliver intensive short courses in advanced mathematics for degree programs at universities in developing countries. Two main objectives of U.S. involvement are: 1) to build capacity in mathematics and mathematics education in developing countries, and 2) to increase mathematical interaction between the U.S. mathematical community and the vast, mostly untapped reservoir of mathematical talent in the developing world. The program will draw on a large pool of U.S. mathematicians who have already indicated their willingness to participate, essentially pro bono, in the VLP in the coming years. They will offer 3-4 week math lecture courses in topics at the advanced undergraduate level, such as statistics, differential equations, numerical analysis, etc., the capacity for which is lacking at many universities in developing nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three long-term effects of the VLP will be the establishment of a critical mass of successful students of advanced mathematics in individual developing countries, establishment of contacts between U.S. mathematicians and the brightest young mathematical talent in those developing countries, and establishment of ongoing international contacts between U.S. mathematicians and the international mathematical community engaged in similar efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
