<AbstractNarration>Wu&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0907913&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This award is funded under the American Recovery and&lt;br/&gt;Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  The project focuses&lt;br/&gt;on two well-known partial differential equations modeling&lt;br/&gt;geophysical fluids: the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation&lt;br/&gt;and the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations.  The major&lt;br/&gt;objective is to develop strategies and effective approaches for&lt;br/&gt;solving the global regularity problem on the classical solutions&lt;br/&gt;of these equations.  The global regularity issue concerning these&lt;br/&gt;equations has recently attracted substantial attention and much&lt;br/&gt;important progress has been made.  However, it remains open in&lt;br/&gt;the cases of the inviscid SQG equation, the SQG equation with&lt;br/&gt;supercritical dissipation, and the inviscid Boussinesq equations. &lt;br/&gt;To deal with the inviscid or supercritical SQG equation, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator combines extensive numerical computations with&lt;br/&gt;analytic and geometric approaches.  The immediate plan is to&lt;br/&gt;study the curvature of the level curves in the spatial regions&lt;br/&gt;where the gradients are comparable to the maximal gradient.  The&lt;br/&gt;boundedness of the curvature in these regions would rule out any&lt;br/&gt;finite-time singularities.  The strategy on the global regularity&lt;br/&gt;issue for the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations is to&lt;br/&gt;gradually reduce the dissipation and thermal diffusion.  The&lt;br/&gt;first aim is at the case when there is only vertical dissipation&lt;br/&gt;or thermal diffusion.  In contrast to the recently resolved case&lt;br/&gt;with horizontal dissipation or thermal diffusion, the situation&lt;br/&gt;now is more sophisticated due to the "mismatch" of derivatives. &lt;br/&gt;To handle this case, new tools such as logarithmic type&lt;br/&gt;inequalities involving Sobolev norms of derivatives in different&lt;br/&gt;directions are developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The three-dimensional quasi-geostrophic equations derived by&lt;br/&gt;J. G. Charney in the 1940s have been very successful in modeling&lt;br/&gt;large-scale motions of atmosphere and oceans.  The dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;these three-dimensional equations with uniform potential&lt;br/&gt;vorticity reduces to the SQG equation.  The SQG equation has been&lt;br/&gt;very useful in studying many weather phenomena such as&lt;br/&gt;frontogenesis, the formation of sharp fronts between hot and cold&lt;br/&gt;air.  Mathematically, frontogenesis corresponds to the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental issue of whether classical solutions of this equation&lt;br/&gt;can develop finite-time singularities.  This project helps&lt;br/&gt;improve the understanding of many weather phenomena governed by&lt;br/&gt;this equation.  Boussinesq equations model many flows in nature&lt;br/&gt;such as oceanic circulation, central heating and natural&lt;br/&gt;ventilation.  The study here of the potentially singular behavior&lt;br/&gt;of solutions to the Boussinesq equations not only yields a&lt;br/&gt;significant contribution to the mathematical issue of global&lt;br/&gt;regularity but also has potential environmental applications.  As&lt;br/&gt;part of this project, several Ph.D. students of the investigator&lt;br/&gt;are actively involved in the proposed research and develop&lt;br/&gt;analytic and computational skills that enable them to become&lt;br/&gt;capable scholars and highly skilled workforce. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
