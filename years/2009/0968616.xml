<AbstractNarration>This project studies the ongoing NASA-ESA-ASI Cassini Mission to Saturn to better understand the issues that envelop complex socio-computation systems, such as the mutual interdependence of humans and machines, to present broader implications for the design of complex human-computer systems more generally. While the robots become famous, robotic space exploration missions also require networked and distant hardware to control spacecraft movement, extensive home-grown software suites that coordinate work activity, and several hundred human scientists and engineers who must negotiate scientific priorities and make decisions that guide the robot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using ethnography, oral history interviews, and archival work, researchers will probe the practices of sociotechnical organization, distributed operations, data sharing, and community maintenance in an existing, complex, high-stakes and international sociocomputational environment. The research addresses the questions: what constraints does the social place on the technological, and vice versa? Also, how does the political and decision-making structure of a group align or clash with their technical infrastructure, and with what consequences for both social interaction and scientific production?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in its melding of five disciplinary areas of investigation - Science &amp; Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Organization Sciences, Human-Computer Interaction, and Human-Robot Interaction - to generate a holistic picture of the institutional and workplace realities of large-scale technoscience in a radically distributed context. The broader impacts of this work include design implications for the next generation of socially-intelligent computational systems both within and outside of planetary exploration.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over a period of five years, we supported four ethnographic researchers who visited and studied various aspects of the Cassini mission to Saturn, informing a doctoral dissertation and graduating thesis, providing material for a book manuscript, and training young researchers in the sociotechnical systems community. Our key finding is that social and micropolitical structures not only influence decision making and the uptake of particular technological tools, but also affect scientific production (Vertesi): we support this with observations from a variety of sites from group members as well as network analysis of publications (Mauricio Lanio). Additionally, Marisa Cohn's thesis on the subject of long-lived technological systems provides implications for the design and implementation of large-scale sociotechnical systems that age alongside newer components and human resource turnover. We also studied elements of spacecraft calibration: the manufacturing of trust through paper work in the laboratories that craft and manage instruments (Emma Lawless) and the inter-institutional and micropolitical role that calibration algorithms can play in the management of instrumental data and expertise (Matt Bietz). We made advancements in the development of sociomaterial theories through a description of how the social and material are co-articulated in practice (Mazmanian, Cohn, and Dourish). Finally, we applied a reflexive lens to our own multi-sited fieldwork to develop new methodological implications for other team ethnography projects that take seriously the situated positionality of the researcher.
