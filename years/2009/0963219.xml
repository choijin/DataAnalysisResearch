<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks funding to renovate a natural science research facility in the institution's Sage Hall.  The project will result in 3370 sf of renovated research space serving the Chemistry and Biology Departments.   The facility will provided renovated laboratories for Chemistry, Synthetic Chemistry, Computational Chemistry, Aquatic Biology, and Behavioral Neuroscience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The institution is a small, private university serving 2,222 undergraduate students.  Every natural sciences major must complete a research project that spans several semesters as a part of his or her degree requirements. Additional student research is supported by Stetson Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) grants, and SURE grantees must present their research at both professional conferences and Stetson's own campus-wide annual research symposium.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research topics planned for the renovated labs include:  the binding of organic thiophenes to copper centers with a goal of gaining a better understanding of the copper-thiophene interactions relevant to the desulfurization of fuels; the binding of alkenes to copper centers with a goal of understanding the chemistry of ethylene binding to the plant enzyme ETR1; curcumin and its role in inhibiting oxidative stress in biosystems; drug delivery hydrogels based upon copolymerization of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA); the neural control of behavioral responses to taste input, the neurophysiology of the rat gustatory system, the influence of catfish biology on the impact of invasive loricariid catfish on a Florida ecosystem, and freshwater ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing infrastructure for research by faculty members, the renovation will result in an increase in research opportunities for students from Stetson and for students from a nearby State College who wish to spend a summer working on a research project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to renovate five laboratories in the Chemistry and Biology Departments at Stetson University to provide modern and safe places for our students and faculty to collaborate on research.  In two of the rooms, simply removing and replacing existing antiquated furniture and upgrading electrical and plumbing services dramatically improved the functionality and safety of the research spaces for aquatic biology and behavioral neuroscience. Another room was renovated from a chemistry storage space into a lab for computational chemistry research.  This room was reconfigured and provided with wiring for computers.  The other two rooms in the Chemistry Department required dramatic infrastructural upgrades to improve air handling in addition to replacement of old casework, countertops, cabinetry, fume hoods and flooring.  These renovations have improved the ability of Stetson faculty and students to conduct research in synthetic chemistry, computational chemistry, behavioral neuroscience, aquatic biology, as well as other subfields of biology, chemistry, and psychology.  The infrastructural improvements have allowed more efficient interaction among researchers, easier access to equipment and other resources that have been moved to the renovated rooms, and given students collaborating with faculty members dedicated and modern spaces in which to work.  Progress on several scientific endeavors has been achieved over the past year in the renovated spaces.  For example, Stetson students and faculty are investigating the use of hydrogels for timed drug release, the use of synthetic copper compounds to remove organic molecules from crude oil, the neural control of behavioral responses to taste input, and the reproductive biology of an invasive catfish that thrives in a natural spring environment.  The broader, more long-term, impacts of the project will include increased visibility of research efforts of Stetson faculty and students, increased ability of faculty to secure research grants, an increase in research opportunities for students, enhanced integration of research into the science curriculum, improved recruitment and retention of students in the natural sciences, and an increased number of Stetson graduates pursuing careers in the sciences.  Specific broad impacts measured this past year are an increase in the number of student research projects done in the renovated rooms, an increase in the number of presentations about these projects, and an increase in enrollment in the natural sciences at Stetson University.
