<AbstractNarration>As the web continues to play an increasing role in information&lt;br/&gt;exchange, so too is it becoming the prevailing platform for infecting&lt;br/&gt;vulnerable hosts. One commonly deployed strategy for delivering&lt;br/&gt;web-malware involves the underhanded tactic of targeting browser&lt;br/&gt;vulnerabilities to automatically download and run malicious software&lt;br/&gt;upon visiting a website. When popular websites are exploited, the&lt;br/&gt;victim base from these so-called drive-by downloads can be far greater&lt;br/&gt;than other forms of exploitation because traditional defenses (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;firewalls) pose no barrier to infection. Unfortunately, with the&lt;br/&gt;plethora of (insecure) web applications being deployed today, it is&lt;br/&gt;likely that web servers will continue to be popular targets for&lt;br/&gt;exploitation for the foreseeable future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of our primary goals is to take an in-depth look at the malware&lt;br/&gt;serving network on the Web by building a scalable malware execution&lt;br/&gt;and analysis infrastructure. Specifically, we plan to build a&lt;br/&gt;resource-efficient host architecture that permits lightweight process&lt;br/&gt;monitoring via tracking of interactions with the OS. An important&lt;br/&gt;facet of our research direction is to explore a transactional&lt;br/&gt;framework that unifies virtualization and logging to allow efficient&lt;br/&gt;analysis. In this framework, the granularity of recorded transactions&lt;br/&gt;is dynamically adjusted based on execution contexts, aggregating&lt;br/&gt;multiple transactions to a single, summarized, transaction whenever&lt;br/&gt;possible. Broader impats of this project will result from the&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive analysis of the different aspects of the problem posed&lt;br/&gt;by web-based malware, and the tools, methods, and analytical&lt;br/&gt;techniques that will ultimately allow for large-scale malware analysis&lt;br/&gt;by the security community at large.</AbstractNarration>
