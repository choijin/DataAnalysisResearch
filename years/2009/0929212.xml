<AbstractNarration>The "Building an Alliance for New Careers in STEM (KC-BANCS): A Collaborative Model for the Inclusion of Youth and Veterans with Disabilities" is a project that will increase the participation and success of high school and college students with disabilities within the Kansas City region in STEM education pathways. The result will be an increase in veterans and other students who complete associate and undergraduate degrees and ultimately enter the STEM workforce.  The KC-BANKS Alliance's lead institution, the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC), will partner with two associate degree granting institutions: Metropolitan Community College (MCC) and Kansas City Kansas CC (KCCC).  The project will work with Project Lead the Way and Project UpLink to access secondary students from 42 Kansas City high schools.  Additionally, collaborations with Veterans Upward Bound and local Veteran Services Offices will provide partnering for veteran student recruitment.  The following objectives will be addressed by the KC-BANCS Alliance:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) To increase the number of students and veterans with disabilities who enter STEM post-secondary academic programs (pre-college pipeline experiences);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) To increase the number of students and veterans with disabilities who complete two-year and four year degrees in STEM fields (support and retention in post-secondary experiences);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) To increase the number of STEM students with disabilities who enter the workforce in STEM related careers; and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) To develop an Alliance Partnership Model that engages STEM educators, community organizations, and youth/veterans with disabilities as equal partners and collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An evaluation team from the Resource Development Institute (RDI) will work with the KC-BANCS Alliance team to conduct formative and summative evaluation. During the initial phase of the project the RDI team will work with KC-BANKS and contact people at UMKC and each of the partnering organizations to identify key personnel who can supply data on students with disabilities currently attending the educational institutions.  RDI evaluators will work with these designated personnel to establish procedures by which each institution will supply disaggregated baseline data on the number of students with disabilities to include type of disability, race/ethnicity, gender, and STEM major for those students with disabilities; as well as data on those completing STEM associate, baccalaureate and graduate degrees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of KC-BANCS was "to increase the participation and success of people with disabilities within the Kansas City region in STEM education pathways."  The result was an increase in students who complete associate and undergraduate degrees and ultimately enter the STEM workforce. The University of Missouri-Kansas City Institute for Human Development and School of Computing and Engineering, in partnership with a regional collaboration of post-secondary and community partners, formed an Alliance to implement this project.  This project focused on addressing the needs of individuals with disabilities from the following target groups.  Target Groups  Traditional College Students with Disabilities who may experience a range of disabilities (e.g. physical, sensory, learning, mental health). Former members of the Armed Forces with service-connected disabilities or combat trauma who experience a range of physical and mental health disabilities as a result of their military service, which may include Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI), Post Traumatic Stress Disorders, Amputations, Spinal Cord Injuries and others.    Key Activities  KC-BANCS was designed to provide direct, indirect, and systems interventions to support the engagement of students and veterans with disabilities in STEM coursework and in a STEM career path.  The direct interventions were services and supports provided directly to the students and veterans with disabilities.  The indirect interventions were services and supports provided to college faculty to improve access to coursework and a STEM career path. The system interventions were community activities designed to enhance and enrich the involvement of community partners in supporting students and veterans with disabilities as they work toward STEM careers.  The supposition was that the levels of context (indirect and system) influence the effects of the intervention experienced by students.  KC-BANCS provided workshops and forums to 155 college and university faculty members on ways of implementing universal design for learning (UDL) across STEM curricula. A byproduct of these sessions was the development of a cohort of faculty, a community of learners who share similar goals around student inclusion and success. One faculty member noted, "This became a think tank for me and offered the opportunity to reflect on my instructional practices and how I might improve them."  KC-BANCS hosted a national think tank:  Transition STEM:  A Wounded Warrior Think Tank.  This event was an opportunity for individuals across the country with expertise in working with student veterans and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields to engage in focused conversations. Unanimously, the Transition STEM participants acknowledged a natural fit of veterans and STEM fields.  The participants described a range of services and resources needed by veterans with invisible disabilities to support them in their STEM education and with connecting them to STEM careers.  The results were programmatic and policy recommendations for higher education, policy leaders, veterans? services, and STEM business/industry.  Outcomes  KC-BANCS supported 234 college students with disabilities majoring in STEM and 42% of them represented culturally/linguistically diverse backgrounds.  This includes 91 traditional students with disabilities and 135 veterans with service-connected disabilities. The majority of students (81%) credit KC BANCS with helping their efforts to complete their degree. KC-BANCS focused on helping students use existing resources at their college campus, such as supplemental instruction, tutoring and resource centers, faculty office hours, undergraduate research, and career services.  KC-BANCS incentivized career building during the college education. For example, each year students engaged in internships, attended career fairs, participated in undergraduate research, and learned about networking and resumes. According to a KC BANCS student, "Being a STEM Scholar helped me figure out what is needed for a STEM career and how certain skills can lead to more opportunities than what a degree implies." Almost all of the respondents (90%) agreed that participating in the STEM program changed the way they planned for their future career. KC-BANCS designed an academic coaching system which can be managed online using REDCap, an open-source, secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases, mostly used by colleges and universities.
