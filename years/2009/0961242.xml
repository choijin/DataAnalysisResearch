<AbstractNarration>In this project, researchers at the Scripps Institute of Oceanogrpahy will continue to provide a mechanism for the quality control of the oceanic carbon dioxide measurements, in particular those that are made as part of international global programs. This will help to ensure that such measurements are comparable and accurate although made in different laboratories at different times; and will be an important factor in the design of a Global Ocean Observing System. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As they have done under previous NSF awards for this activity, they will prepare and certify reference materials for the parameters of the oceanic carbon dioxide system: total dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and hydrogen ion concentration, pH for a sample of sea water. The reference materials for total dissolved inorganic carbon and for total alkalinity will be based on natural seawater, sterilized, bottled, and analyzed using appropriate reference methods for these parameters. Reference materials for Tris will be based on synthetic seawater and analyzed using classical Harned cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These reference materials will be distributed to US and to international investigators to assist in the quality control of oceanic CO2 measurements. During the course of this project, they expect to distribute at least 15,000 bottles of reference material. These materials will also be used to provide test samples for use in collaborative studies of the analytical methods used to determine these various parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important part of the project involves planning for the future. It is essential to assure a long-term supply of reference materials for future ocean science research, and it will be necessary to identify an agency or company that will take on this responsibility. To encourage this, the principal investigator will interact with the US National Institute for Standards and Technology, the European Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) in Geel, Belgium as well as with Ocean Scientific International (the IAPSO Standard Sea Water Service), and with various Japanese investigators to assess and recommend a plan for the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Infrastructure: The provision of reference materials to the international community of carbon cycle researchers helps to improve the overall quality of oceanic carbon data around the world both for field studies of the distribution of oceanic carbon, as well as for studies related to ocean acidification. Thus it is a significant contribution to research infrastructure in this field. Education: The existence of such a laboratory at a major US Oceanographic Institution, ensures that undergraduate students and graduate students that work in the lab alongside this reference material program benefit from the education in high-quality analytical techniques that is part and parcel of such a program, and also from the ancillary discussions associated with quality control and quality assurance. It also provides a resource for other students in the institution who are interested in making high-quality carbon measurements as part of their research. The principal investigator is also called on to instruct others in CO2 measurements, both by telephone or e-mail conversations, and also in more formal courses. Outreach: The principal investigator will be involved in a number of public outreach efforts related to his research studies on the ocean carbon system. In particular, he expects to make a number of public presentations in the area of ocean acidification, as well as to work with Niijii Films (makers of A Sea Change) to develop materials for use in education related to this topic.</AbstractNarration>
