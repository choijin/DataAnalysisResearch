<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report represents projects that are funded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and awarded through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Cooperative Agreement to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) for the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  Despite continued development in representing coupled carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry at global scales in the Community Land Model (CLM),  assessing the environmental consequences of reactive N has been difficult.  The research efforts under this award focused on closing the assessment  gap. The research provided initial estimates of the relative magnitude of different fluxes (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, terrestrial export of reactive N to riverine and coastal environments) and a community tool to investigate and refine understanding of global biogeochemical cycles and their interactions with the climate system.  An additional aspect of this project was to evaluate the nitrogen sensitivity across versions of the Community Land Model. Confronting models with experimental manipulations provides insight into the assumptions responsible for ecosystem response to perturbations. Models appear to represent fundamental tradeoffs between simulated carbon and nitrogen limitation that can be evaluated with observations.  The model code developed in this project extends the simulation of the nitrogen cycle in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and its land component the Community Land Model (CLM) by enabling reactive nitrogen gas emissions to the atmosphere in response to fertilizer and manure additions. Reactive nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere affect air quality, atmospheric composition, and climate. The new model code expands the scientific community using CESM and CLM to include atmospheric chemists and allows the study of the effects of agricultural management on climate.  The model code developed in this project will better inform policy options to mitigate anthropogenic climate change through agricultural management and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  A manuscript describing research findings was published to Global Biogeochemical Cycles.  Research findings were also presented to the EPA Connections working group during their Moment of Science and at the Land Model Working group.
