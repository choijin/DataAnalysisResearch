<AbstractNarration>0957137&lt;br/&gt;Manghnani&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports upgrade and new capabilities at the University of Hawaii Mineral Physics Laboratory with the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology.  New equipment to be acquired incrementally over the next three years will include: 1) a solid state laser that would be employed for Raman and Brillouin spectroscopic measurements of the elastic and structural properties of hydrous and anhydrous silicate glasses and melts under high temperature and pressure conditions in the laser heated diamond anvil cell (DAC); 2) electronics necessary for ultrasonic measurements of the compressibility of silicate melts in the large volume press; 3) microscopes and computer controlled translation stage for diamond anvil sample loading and micro-Raman scattering experiments; 4) an vibration isolated optical table to support new Raman and Brillouin spectroscopic capabilities; 5) a new power supply for an existing Raman system; 6) equipment to support development of a new spectroradiometric system for measuring temperature in situ in the laser heated diamond anvil cell; and 7) a new control system for an existing Brillouin spectrometer.  The lab upgrade will allow for the collection of new observations of silicate melt elasticity at pressure and the effects of water on melt structure and compressibility.   The lab upgrades will support student and postdoctoral research training in materials characterization methods with implications for supporting the next generation geoscience workforce and the development of synthetic materials for societal and military applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Completed the set up of the Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) system and obtaining data for the -OH species in hydrous mantle minerals and lunar soil, and in mineral inclusions in diamonds.   A graduate student  and a postdoc were trained.   Two papers have been published and a manuscript is being prepared for publication. Papers are attached with the final report.  Most of the project goals have been successfully accomplished. Aquisition, upgrading and repairs of the proposed equipments have been carried out. The capabilities of the high pressure-temperature experiments in mineral physics laboratory have been greatly improved.   The multi-disciplinary spectroscopic investigation of minerals inclusions in diamonds, lunar soils and boron carbide have provided useful data and cross-checks. The acquisition, repairs, and upgrading of the instrumentation have greatly improved the capability of conducting in-situ high-pressure high-temperature experiments in diamond anvil cells. The high-temperature ultrasonic measurments on iron-rich melts have provided useful information for modeling the compostion of Earth's core.   The research also has impact in other disciplines. For example, implications for determining the Gruneisen parameters from high-pressure Raman and FTIR measurements which provide cross-checks on the results from the two methods. Useful deployment of high-pressure-temperature ultrasonic and spectroscopic methods have led to potential use of these techniques in physics and materials science.
