<AbstractNarration>This EAGER project aims to address a controversy regarding the role of phosphorylation on neurofilament (NF) transport.  Neurofilament phosphorylation has long been considered to regulate their axonal transport rate and in doing so to provide stability to mature axons.  Phosphorylation of the C-terminal extension of the largest (NFH) of the 3 NF subunits is classically thought to slow NF transport.  This project proposes that phosphorylation inhibits transport by fostering NF-NF associations leading to formation of NF bundles too large to transport.  Other approaches involving NF subunit knockout or truncation have advanced the notion that phosphorylation does not regulate transport.  This project is set out to address this controversy by expressing the NF-H sidearm in transfected cells.  They will manipulate cdk5 activity to alter sidearm phosphorylation and monitor the influence on association with NF bundles.  The proposed experiments should provide the first direct comparison of the impact of sidearm phosphorylation without the complications that have compromised prior studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, fostering their publications, and introduce them to the scientific community at large by supporting their attendance at international meetings.  This research also has broad impacts regarding the field of cell biology, in that it will continue to provide novel information regarding the "load-bearing" aspect of intermediate filaments in all cell types.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of our research was to determine critical aspects of how the nervous system develops.  Neurons (the "thinking" cells of the nervous system) transmit signals that allow us to think, remember and move.  They are cells like any other cell in our body, but to transmit signals, they elaborate long extensions called "axons," that function like telephone wires and connect either to the next neuron, or to muscle cells.  These axons must find their way to their appropriate target as we develop prior to birth, and, once they connect with their target, they must remain in contact with it for the lifetime of an individual.  Failure to do so results in paralysis of muscle or mental retardation.   In carrying out this task, the axon must start as a flexible structure that "sniffs" out its target by following a chemical trail.  Once it locates and connects to its target, it must then transition into a stable structure.   This transition is accomplished by the orderly assembly of a protein structure within the axon, that is collectively termed the "cytoskeleton" (that is, the skeleton of the cell).  Unlike our bones, however, this cytoskeleton is composed of repeated proteins that hook together essentially  like legos.  While this may sound simple, orderly assembly of the cytoskeleton requires manufacture of the proteins, transport of them into and along axons, and finally orderly assembly.  When one considers that axons can be thousands of times longer than the cell body itself,  It is easy to imagine that (1) this process takes tremendous energy, and (2)  failure to transport the proteins would quickly clog the cell body.    Our studies elucidated the complex mechanisms by which axons accomplish these tasks using a minimum of energy.  Our laboratory, under NSF support, has trained many graduate and undergraduate students, who have entered the biotechnology workforce and/or become professors themselves.
