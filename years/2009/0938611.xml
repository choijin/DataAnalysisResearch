<AbstractNarration>Orography has a dramatic influence on lake-effect snowstorms, not only in regions with major mountain barriers such as the Great Salt Lake Basin of northern Utah, but also in the eastern United States and Canada where more modest relief is found around the Great Lakes. For example, over the Tug Hill Plateau of northern New York, which lies downstream of Lake Ontario, annual snowfall increases 25-50 mm for every 100 m rise in elevation and storm-total accumulations have reached 360 cm in extreme lake-effect events. Orography also modifies the morphology of lake-effect snowstorms by altering the relationship between the large-scale flow and the development of precipitation structures such as broad-area precipitation shields and shoreline bands. Knowledge of lake-orographic precipitation processes is important not only for weather prediction, but also applications in hydrology, ecology, and geomorphology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the project is to improve understanding of lake-orographic precipitation processes and their influence on the weather and climate of lake-effect regions. Key questions to be investigated include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) to what extent does orography modify the morphology of lake-effect snowstorms, &lt;br/&gt;(2) which orographic processes and phenomena are responsible for these modifications, and &lt;br/&gt;(3) to what degree do lake-orographic precipitation processes contribute to the hydroclimate of lake effect regions? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions will be addressed in a three year research program that examines two regions where there are strong orographic influences on lake-effect precipitation. The first is the Great Salt Lake basin of northern Utah where the Wasatch Mountains and other ranges rise up to 2000 m above lake level. The second is the Tug Hill Plateau of northern New York, which provides a broad upland region 400-500 m above Lake Ontario. The research will produce a synthesis of results from a radar-based climatology, a field campaign, and numerical modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The research will advance knowledge and understanding of the physical processes that control lake-effect and orographic precipitation and, in turn, the influence of these processes on the hydrometeorology of lake-effect regions. Efforts to establish a relationship between the large-scale flow and lake-effect morphology have proven challenging, with previous workers specifically identifying the need to better understand the role of orography in altering structural transition zones. Project results will address this need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the societal need to improve weather and climate prediction in lake-effect regions. Other broader impacts include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) the infusion of research findings into undergraduate and graduate courses, training courses, and web-based educational modules, &lt;br/&gt;(2) the mentoring of two graduate students and the broadening of the participation of women in NSF-sponsored programs, and &lt;br/&gt;(3) the enhancement of public scientific understanding through collaborations with an NSF GK-12  graduate fellowship program that involve graduate student researchers in K-12 classrooms to teach discovery based environmental science in Salt Lake City school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further, this research program  will likely engender broad scientific interest in other allied research communities such as hydrology, ecology, and geomorphology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Great Salt Lake produces snowstorms several times each winter that affect commerce and transportation along UtahÆs densely populated Wasatch Front urban corridor, help fuel UtahÆs $1.2 billion dollar winter-sports industry, and contribute to the buildup of a mountain snowpack that drives much of the surface-water runoff that provides water resources to Salt Lake City and other municipalities.  Historically, these storms have proven difficult to predict and their contribution to precipitation within the Great Salt Lake Basin largely unknown.     In this project, we have advanced our understanding and prediction of lake-effect storms using a multifaceted approach that integrates field observations, radar data, computer modeling, and other techniques.  In particular, we have improved knowledge of the the environmental factors that contribute to the development of lake-effect storms, which has led to new forecast techniques that are now utilized by the National Weather Service.  We also evaluated the techniques used to simulated these storms with computer models, identifying some of the best practices and common pitfalls.  Finally, we showed how the mountains surrounding the Great Salt Lake affect lake-effect storms (Figure 1).  Depending on the environmental characteristics, these mountians can act to suppress lake-effect storms (for example, the drying and warming of flow moving over the mountains northwest of the lake) or may be essential for storm initiation (for example, the funneling of flow into the Salt Lake Valley can be important in some events).    Using radar and precipitation data over about a 12 year period we showed that lake-effect periods produce up to 8.4% of the total cool-season (mid September to mid May) precipitation in the Great Salt Lake Basin, with the largest contributions in the Oquirrh Mountains and central Wasatch Mountains to the south and east of the lake.  In general, this fraction is lower than expected by the public and many scientists.  The amount of lake effect varies dramatically from year to year depending on the occurrence or non-occurrence of major storms at a given location.  In some years, lake effect contributes little, but in other years, it can be more significant and contribute more modestly to mountain snowfall and runoff.   Nevertheless, these results suggest that lake-effect precipitation does not play a major role in changes in the elevation and area of the Great Salt Lake.    The teaching and training of future scientists was an important component of this project.  In addition to the five graduate research assistants who contributed to the research effort, more than 20 graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Utah participated in field program activities, including the launching of weather balloons and the operation of a mobile "Doppler on Wheels" radar provided by the Center for Severe Weather Research.  In November 2011 we taught K-12 students about severe weather, radar, and weather forecasting by bringing the Doppler on Wheels to several K-12 schools in Salt Lake City (see Figure 2 for example) including Newman Elementary (~100 students), the Salt Lake Center for Science Education (~80 students), the Madeleine Choir School (~125 students), Highland High School (~30 students in an AP environmental science class), Nibley Park Elementary (~90 students), and Hillside Middle School (~95 students). Many students at Newman Elementary and the Salt Lake Center for Science Education are from traditionally underserved groups.       Last Modified: 06/16/2014       Submitted by: W.
