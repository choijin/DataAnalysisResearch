<AbstractNarration>Understanding the sources and chemical composition of the most energetic extraterrestrial radiation or "cosmic rays" is a major thrust of current astrophysics research. Particles with enormous energies regularly strike the Earth from within our galaxy and beyond. Understanding the origins of these particles will require accurate models of the most violent processes in the universe. However, progress in the field of high-energy cosmic rays is currently limited by the rarity of the most interesting rays striking Earth. Indeed, the continuation of the field beyond the current generation of observatories may become financially and practically impossible if new ways are not found to achieve remote coverage over large portions of the Earth's surface. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, these scientists will investigate a new technique: the remote sensing via bistatic radar technology of cosmic ray induced extensive air showers. They build on experience gained by the MARIACHI project in developing this technique, the opportunity afforded by the location of the northern hemisphere's largest cosmic ray observatory, the Telescope Array, in Utah, and the donation of analog television transmission equipment to this effort by a local television station. The successful outcome of these studies would be the development of a new detection technique with the potential of having a transformative effect on the field of ultra-high energy cosmic ray research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, this project has potential for connecting the local community to the astrophysics research currently being conducted in Utah. Radar techniques similar to those being used for cosmic ray studies have long been utilized in the study of micrometeors, and this group has already hosted public events in which visitors to the Millard County Cosmic Ray Center "listen" to meteor showers and learn about the cosmic ray project. It will also connect with their successful ASPIRE program.</AbstractNarration>
