<AbstractNarration>The San Francisco Bay Integrated Middle School Science Project (IMSS) Targeted Math-Science Partnership is a partnership  - between California State University, East Bay (CSUEB), the Alameda County Office of Education, and the Hayward, San Leandro and San Lorenzo unified school districts - that is developing and studying a comprehensive teacher professional development model designed to transform science teaching and learning in underperforming middle schools serving predominately low-income, underrepresented minority students.  Grounded in an extensive body of research and evidence based best practices, the IMSS is engaging students and teachers in authentic discovery as active members of a science professional learning community with federal research laboratory and industry scientists, disciplinary faculty and educational specialists.  The project is preparing fifty-one middle school science master teachers and three regional science leaders/coaches who are impacting approximately 432 teachers and 69,000 students over the life of the project.  In addition, thirty-six district and site administrators are participating in the professional development activities and are providing the master teachers with release time and other resources to support the project goals.  The preservice program at CSUEB is being modified to include additional science content knowledge and preparation on the use of inquiry-based learning in middle school science courses.  Four new science courses are begin added to the preservice program and the program is being aligned with the new California Foundational Level General Science Credential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IMSS project expects the following outcomes:&lt;br/&gt;1) To increase the quality of middle school science teachers by increasing their science content knowledge and stimulating their sustained use of inquiry-based pedagogies. &lt;br/&gt;2) To create, assess, and refine exemplary investigative science instructional case modules and to distribute these modules through an online professional development community maintained in MERLOT and the NSF-funded National Science Digital Library.  The instructional case modules are being developed in the context of disciplinary research being conducted by disciplinary faculty and scientists at federal and industrial research laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;3) To have statistically significant gains in middle school students' science achievement as measured by the California Standards Test (CST).&lt;br/&gt;4) To develop leadership models and infrastructure that lead to sustained institutional change in all core partners in the project.&lt;br/&gt;5) To recruit and prepare forty-two middle school science teachers from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;6) To rigorously study the impact of inquiry-based learning and teacher professional development on student achievement in middle school science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERIT  A. Overview  The S.F. Bay Integrated Middle School Science (IMSS) Partnership was funded in 2010 to develop and study a multi-pronged, comprehensive professional development (PD) model aimed at transforming science teaching and learning in under-performing middle schools serving predominately low-income, underrepresented minority students. The project design was informed by the teamÆs prior experience in K-12 STEM education reform and research on promising strategies for STEM professional development.  Mid-way through the project, a focus on  3-dimensional science instruction and learning was added to address the shifts in instruction and learning required by the post-award release of the Framework for K-12 Science Education and in anticipation of CaliforniaÆs adoption of NGSS.    B. Project goals were to         1. Increase the quality, quantity, and diversity of middle school science teachers and students engaged in transformative science teaching and learning,    2. Create online PD anchored in exemplary project-based investigative science instructional cases aligned with CaliforniaÆs foundational level science credential K-8 science teachers and state and national science standards; and    3. Develop school leadership and a partnership infrastructure to support systemic change and sustain and scale the project.  C. Partnership Model for Comprehensive Science Education Reform    IMSS proposed to partner with middle schools in 3 districts and one county office of education. By year 2, it expanded to 10 districts in 4 S.F. Bay Area counties. Eight of those districts implemented all 6 components of the model, as follows:         1. Quarterly District Leadership Institutes. For teams of district and site administrators, teacher leaders, and "critical others." Focus: systemic change processes, strategic planning to support IMSS PD, connections to other district priorities and capacity building.    2. Summer Institutes for Teacher Leaders. Focus: Intensive PD on content and pedagogy aligned with the new science reform documents, systemic change processes, strategic planning to support IMSS PD and capacity building, and teacher leader development.    3. Academic Year Quarterly Teacher Leader PD. Focus: content and science practices including inquiry, assessment, strengthening communities of practice; elements essential to the development, refinement, and implementation of instructional cases; and team building.    4. Academic Year Lesson Study PD for Teacher Leaders. Lesson Study teams of 3-6 teachers met monthly to research lessons developed during summer institute. Focus: cyclical process of lesson study using the instructional cases.      5. Other District Professional Development. Many of the IMSS districts requested district-based PD that scaled IMSS PD to all district middle school science teachers. These sessions were collaboratively developed with district science leaders.    6. Coaching and Capacity Building. Critical to implementation of the "gradual release" or transition from IMSS-led to district/teacher leader-led PD.   D. Projected and actual outcomes are as follows:    1. Middle school science teachers:  Projected: 100 &mdash;Actual: 1,658 (including 1,067 elementary and high school teachers    2. K-12 administrators:  Projected: 20 &mdash;Actual: 40    3. Preservice teachers:  Projected:  42  &mdash;Actual: 120    4. IMSS teacher leaders:  Projected: 36 &mdash;Actual 60    5. Students impacted:  Projected: 22,000 &mdash;Actual: 47,340     BROADER IMPACTS  A. Research. 4 theoretical constructs framed the research:     1. Development of content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge    2. Development of professional learning communities    3. Development of science teacher leadership    4. Capacity building for all leaders.  The project committed to publishing 4 papers. To date, 4 have been published, 2 are under review, and 3 additional papers are in progress (and have already been presente...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
