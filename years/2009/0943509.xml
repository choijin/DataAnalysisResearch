<AbstractNarration>This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to develop a series of twenty engaging, multi-media case studies of ocean scientists addressing the Broader Impacts activities of their research.  This effort will involve representatives of all Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE) in identifying scientists who have formulated effective methods to convey the Broader Impacts of their research activities to students, educators, and the public.  These case studies will be available in various electronic media, including the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 2002, COSEE has worked collaboratively to become a truly integrated national network for improving ocean sciences education and outreach.  COSEE is establishing communications and resources to become a leading force in the improvement of ocean sciences education, with significant partnerships among federal, state, and local agencies and businesses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of proposed activities lies in the network-wide effort to compile insights and information regarding existing programs that will identify the most effective practices by which scientists improve the broader societal impacts of their work, while possibly developing new methods for engaging scientists. Resulting electronic resources will broaden awareness of the diversity and success of COSEE programs and communicate the most effective practices scientists use to convey the broader societal impacts of their research to students, educators, and the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of these efforts include recognizing and distributing examples of excellent education and outreach activities developed within the ocean sciences research community.  It is expected that these high-profile examples will illustrate effective means by which scientists can develop their own engaging Broader Impacts activities to serve the public interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
