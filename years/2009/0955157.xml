<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to design new cognitive power management techniques for memory dominated mobile devices that exploit the variable nature of the wireless channel. The approach is based on redefining the run-time architectural error tolerance of memory blocks according to the time varying tolerance of the application to hardware induced errors.  This allows the margin of acceptable performance to be dynamically managed by the needs of the application utilizing the hardware unit at that instant in time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the work lies in enabling designers to abstract the concepts of power efficiency and error awareness for memory dominated devices early in the design cycle, with significant implications on the cost, performance and reliability attributes of the overall structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multidisciplinary nature of the project, which spans theoretical, circuit, system and experimental work, creates an exciting framework to engage students, educators and the community. The proposed research and education plan places an emphasis on expanding the engagement of the investigator in programs designed to attract undergraduates (particularly female students) and minority students from underrepresented groups into engineering. Finally, since power conscious mobile devices are rapidly becoming ubiquitous in every aspect of modern day society spanning government, corporate and private life, this work has particular significance in accelerating the rapid deployment of inexpensive and energy-efficient devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research performed under this grant investigates how relaxing stringent hardware reliability constraints placed on mobile computing and communication devices can lead to devices with much longer battery life while maintaining the desired quality of service.  From a physical perspective there are two main issues facing the community: First, with shrinking transistor geometries, it is becoming impossible to guarantee that all transistors on a multimillion transistor die will be designed identically and function as expected. Secondly, due to wide manufacturing variation, system designers are forced to budget very large operational margins to ensure functionality, leading to lower yields and higher power consumption. Based on these observations, it is essential to create a new design paradigm where systems can be fault tolerant by design, yet exhibit high yield and low power consumption.  Within this context, one of the clear trends in Systems on a Chip is the increased use of embedded memories in various forms, and their domination of the power and performance metrics of modern systems. Thus, this project focused on studying the design space that is created when one ponders the following two questions:  1-      Are power management schemes aware of the content that embedded memories store?       2-      How would power management policies diverge from current state of the art approaches, if that knowledge is available?   Given the harsh nature of wireless propagation, many bits that are stored in a wireless transceiver are inherently unreliable. Therefore, there is no need to store off-air samples in a memory that is (from a hardware perspective) perfect. Clearly, the margins of the memory can be relaxed, leading to savings in both area and power. In fact, by monitoring the quality of the wireless channel and the needs of the application, one can select the best and most efficient mode of operation of the underlying circuits that provide the expected quality of service. Publications resulting from this effort show that by applying the error aware techniques proposed under this grant, power consumption of mobile devices can be reduced by 20% to 40% depending on the scenario, with little to no degradation in performance.   The methodology developed under this work was generalized and applied to various fields including, wireless system design, forward error correction, image processing, memory CACHE architectures, emerging memory systems (memristors), thermal stability of manufactured system and yield management.  Results from this project will enable newer paradigms for the rapid design, development and deployment of energy-efficient mobile computing and communication devices.
