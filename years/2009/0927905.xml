<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT HRD 0927905&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winston Salem State University is implementing, Raising Achievement in Mathematics and Science (RAMS) Program, to engage students in research on and off campus throughout their undergraduate career at the university, and to increase the number of STEM majors graduating from WSSU, strengthen undergraduate research education and capacity at WSSU, and increase the number of STEM graduates who matriculate into graduate programs. This effort builds on the successes achieved under previous HBCU-UP funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities are based on a strong needs assessment by the HBCU-UP advisory committee with input from all stakeholders on campus, institutional data, and the university community involved in supporting students at WSSU. The goals and objectives of the project are based on clear and specific interventions, and the strategies are adapted from best practices described in the literature and previous institutional experiences. The strategies involve engaging STEM UG students early through ?active learning pedagogy? and ?learning through conducting research? in order to increase retention and graduation rates. Student engagement in research on and off campus is a cornerstone of this project.  With the availability of financial support and through extensive collaboration, the project will impact high school students, community college students, and students on the WSSU campus. Program activities such as university research day, curricula changes and GRE preparation workshops have a large impact campus wide. Improved graduation and retention rates serve as a marketing tool for recruiting well-prepared high school students into STEM programs at WSSU. Collectively, this leads to a larger pool of STEM students graduating from WSSU and matriculating into graduate programs at research intensive universities.</AbstractNarration>
