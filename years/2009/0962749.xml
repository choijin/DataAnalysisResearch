<AbstractNarration>Archaeological analysis suggests that cultural exchange from regional centers like Cahokia to peripheral areas took place at the time of Mississippian Emergence (~1000 years ago), and this study focuses on the relationship between human culture and biology, a central question for anthropologists. Ancient DNA methods are used to examine the importance of small-scale population movements in this change. DNA is analyzed from individuals at sites that span the Late Woodland and Mississippian periods (AD 930-1200) on the periphery of Cahokia, and from Mississippian individuals at Cahokia region sites. Analyses test the hypothesis of temporal genetic continuity at these sites, and determine whether alterations in mortuary practice reflect changing concepts of kinship. Fluoride dating will resolve the burial sequences at these sites.&lt;br/&gt;This project will significantly increase the genetic data from previously unstudied populations of prehistoric Native American peoples. Analyses will further our understanding of Native American prehistory and how culture is affected by movements of people, and provide the first genetic data from multiple Late Woodland mounds.  Hypotheses regarding Late Woodland and Mississippian mortuary practices and kinship will be tested. This is the basis for a larger regional study of prehistoric genetic diversity and disease, and will be used to investigate familial factors in research on prehistoric tuberculosis infection patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides educational opportunities at multiple levels. This research is part of the dissertation of three female graduate students. The development of the Fluoride Dating Lab enhances options for graduate and undergraduate training and provides a direct benefit to regional anthropologists. Results will be utilized in outreach programs to local K-12 schools and museums. A symposium will be organized at the Midwest Archaeological Conference. These results may aid in policy formation by government institutions and museums with respect to Native populations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is evidence for great cultural changes occurring from the Middle Woodland through the Mississippian periods (approximately the last 2,200 years) in the U.S. Midwest, including shifting subsistence strategies (e.g. the adoption of maize agriculture), settlement patterns, material culture (e.g. pottery types), mortuary practices, social stratification, disease and injury patterns, monumental architecture, and symbolism. The emergence of Mississippian culture approximately 1000 years ago has been the focus of speculation and investigation for more than a century, in particular the relationships among diverse sites in the region and Cahokia, the largest prehistoric settlement in North America (located near modern St. Louis).  Expressions of the Mississippian culture (or aspects of it) were found throughout the Midwest and Southeast U.S, and it represents the widest cultural influence experienced by prehistoric North America, raising the possibility that population movement contributed to these changes. Some scholars speculate that the transition from Late Woodland to Mississippian was due to an expansion of people from the region of Cahokia. Changing mortuary practices are often pointed to as a signal of the expansion of Mississippian peoples into the region.  They suggest that Woodland and Mississippian mortuary practices might contain a signal of the kinship patterns of these cultures (e.g., mounds or rows representing family groups, in particular matrilines), that the large number of individuals buried together (especially children with adults) may be close relatives, and that these patterns would also have changed with the adoption of Mississippian culture.  Other scholars suggest that these cultural changes do not indicate the movement of peoples, but rather the spread of cultural practices from Cahokia, which were variously adopted by peoples already living in the Midwest.  We examined variation in the maternally-inherited mitochondrial DNA from individuals at several archaeological sites in the Lower Illinois River Valley (in Illinois) as well as from Cahokia.  Comparison of the mitochondrial matrilines in people buried during the Woodland versus Mississippian periods at individual archaeological sites showed no genetic discontinuity or evidence of population movement into those sites from Cahokia at the Mississippian transition.  In addition, analyses of burial patterns at these sites do not show changes in the patterns of maternal relationships in the individuals buried at these sites at the Mississippian transition, suggesting that changes in (maternal) kinship patterns were not a factor in shaping their differing mortuary practices. For example, the genetic evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis that matrilineal kin were buried in defined rows (Mississippian) or mounds (Late Woodland). In fact, we find no examples of maternal relatives being buried together at all. The genetic evidence also does not suggest that individuals with significantly different corn content in their diet, overall health, or burial treatment are æoutsidersÆ or æmigrantsÆ into the population, except in two cases of individuals who suffered from a different strain of tuberculosis from that found in other individuals at the Yokem site.  These individuals belong to a rare mitochondrial matriline not seen in other individuals buried at the site, and therefore they might be immigrants to the region.  Thus, despite evidence of significant culture change in a short period of time at the Woodland/Mississippian transition, and a clear link to the likely source of the Mississippian culture (Cahokia), genetic analyses suggest that these changes did not spring from the movement of people out of Cahokia into the outlying regions, but rather through culture contact and the adoption of new cultural practices by existing populations in Illinois.  These results make it clear that we must not assume that culture spread (today or in the past) occurs onl...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
