<AbstractNarration>Multimedia research, in particular, media understanding research which traditionally largely relies on computer vision research, has been around for many years. However, in general this area still remains open due to the challenging nature in computer vision research. The goal of this project is to attempt to narrow down the whole area to the connected multimedia with the hope to solve for real-world problems in this narrow area that shall lead to the technology development. To achieve this goal, this project is aimed at organizing an international workshop on connected multimedia to specifically address the general media understanding problem under the two constraints -- the social aspect and the cultural aspect. The intellectual merits are manifested through the expected advances in the literature of multimedia, data mining, information retrieval, as well as computer vision after the workshop; it is also expected that organizing this workshop may expedite and catalyze the interdisciplinary development in the areas of multimedia, data mining, information retrieval, and computer vision. The broader impacts of organizing this workshop include the promoted collaborations between computer scientists and social scientists and between academia and industries to work together to solve the problems on the topic of connected multimedia, which may further lead to technological development to provide effective solutions to several important real-world problems. The advanced literature this workshop generates may also serve as the updated materials for the graduate students working in the related areas to broaden and enrich their exposure to their professional training and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.fortune.binghamton.edu/nsf-iis-0956924.htm&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
