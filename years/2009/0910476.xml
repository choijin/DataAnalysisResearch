<AbstractNarration>Information Science and Systems (33)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Information Security and Assurance for Healthcare Applications project extends a previous project which provided exposure to the increasingly critical field of healthcare security to a new generation of computer security and information assurance (IS&amp;A) professionals. As a result of the previous project, 29 students were successfully placed in jobs in federal agencies or labs, including those with healthcare security interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relevance of this goal has since been repeatedly underscored at the highest levels of the federal and state health infrastructures by mandates to broaden utilization of information technology in the delivery of healthcare while protecting the security and privacy of health information exchanges and on-line databases. It is now widely recognized that establishment of trusted national healthcare information networks and databases to unify health and medical computing infrastructures, streamline healthcare monitoring and delivery, and accelerate research and dissemination of health and medical data while assuring that privacy is systemically protected have collectively achieved the scope of a critical national challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides its graduate students: (a) Rigorous and broad educational foundations addressing the theory, design, and applications of IS&amp;A technologies; (b) Healthcare policy, management, and privacy issues; and (c) Potential vulnerabilities associated with computer-based medical devices, which increasingly have networking and wireless capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: The goal of this proposal is to provide the option to 15 new students to complete either the Master of Science in Security Informatics (MSSI) degree program or a dual MSSI/Master of Health Sciences (MHS) program, which was developed by means of a previous SFS capacity building grant. Focused outreach to assure diversity for this healthcare security opportunity takes advantage of existing partnerships with HBCUs and MSIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The dual masters program made available to the new SFS scholars is based on an integration of courses, labs, research projects, and internships stemming from the two different academic cultures represented by the public health and computing schools. The intellectual merit of this partnership is represented by the development and implementation of a unique interdisciplinary framework supporting educational cross-training regarding IS&amp;A technologies relative to healthcare security applications. Selected healthcare security courses to support the dual MSSI/MHS degree are made accessible in an on-line format.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2009, the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute (JHUISI) was awarded a grant totaling $1,795,068 over 6 years by the National Science Foundation CyberCorps&reg;: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program to provide full financial support including tuition, room and board, classroom materials and living expenses for students who committed to completing the Master of Science in Security Informatics (MSSI) program at JHUISI along with the commitment to work in a U.S. government agency in an information security-related duty for a commensurate amount of time.  As a direct outcome of the grant, over the term of the award JHUISI awarded MSSI degrees to 16 SFS students who subsequently embarked on information security careers with the following U.S. government agencies (number of students in parentheses): DoD/NSA (5), FFRDC/MITRE (3), FFRDC/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (2), DOJ/FBI (2), CIA (1), NASA/Goddard Space Center (1), DHS/NPPD (1), with one recent graduate still undecided.  SFS students at JHUISI completed work in state-of-the art courses such as Software Vulnerability Detection, Network Security, Critical Infrastructure Protection, Practical Cryptography, and so on; in addition, the students completed capstone projects in the area of information security under the mentorship of Johns Hopkins faculty and in some cases with mentors from organizations such as NSA.  The students attended numerous seminars given by researchers and representatives of information security companies to provide broad exposure to current practices and challenges in the field.  The goal of the program has been to prepare SFS students enrolled in the SFS program for careers in technical leadership in information security-related fields.
