<AbstractNarration>Aschbacher will focus on two projects. First, he has begun a program to simplify parts of the classification of the finite simple groups, by working in the category of saturated 2-fusion systems. In particular Aschbacher hopes to obtain a new proof of the classification of simple groups of component type; this represents roughly half of the classification of the finite simple groups. A byproduct of this effort would be classifications of certain classes of fusion systems, perhaps including all simple saturated 2-fusion systems. Second, Aschbacher has begun a program to describe the subposet of the lattice of subgroups of a classical group  consisting of the overgroups of certain important subgroups, such as quadratic subgroups and some tori.  As an application, Aschbacher and J. Shareshian  seek to prove there exist finite lattices which are not intervals in the subgroup lattice of any finite group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the work would lead to a new proof of one of the most important results in twentieth century mathematics, the classification of the finite simple groups, and to strong new results on the subgroup structure of the simple groups, the main tool for applying the classification. The simple groups are the building blocks of finite group theory, and finite groups are the mathematical tool with which one studies the symmetry of finite objects.</AbstractNarration>

The classification of the finite simple groups is one of the premier achievements of modern mathematics and makes possible many applications of finite group theory in various branches of mathematics.

The theory of fusion systems is an emerging area of mathematics on the boundary between algebra and topology. Aschbacher approaches fusion systems from an algebraic point of view. He is in the midst of a program to classify a certain large family of 2-fusion systems, and to use this result to simplfy the proof of the theorem classifying the simple groups.  In order to apply the classification of simple groups one needs deep information about the subgroup structure of such groups. Part of the intellectual merit of the project derives from new theorems proved by Aschbacher on the lattice of subgroups of finite simple groups. He is also attempting to use such results, together with the classification of the simple groups, to settle in the negative an important question in universal algebra, dating to 1980: is every finite lattice an inverval in the subgroup lattice of some finite group?  Broader impact was achieved by mentoring five students in the Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Profram. The students proved theorems related to Aschbacher's research program, and in the process were introduced to mathematical research.
