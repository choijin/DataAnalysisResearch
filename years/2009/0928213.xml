<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT HRD 0928213&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University (NCA&amp;T) is incorporating Superpave Technology into the undergraduate civil engineering curriculum. Currently, the Superpave Binder system has been adopted by all of the 52 State Highway Agencies including those of Alaska and Hawaii. Since 2001, the North Carolina Department of Transportation has required all asphalt mixes be designed using the Superpave method. However, due to a lack of equipment, NC A&amp;T State University has been teaching an outdated method (Marshall Design) instead of the Superpave method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is acquiring Superpave asphalt binder test equipment, including a Dynamic Shear Rheometer, a Bending Beam Rheometer and a Direct Tension Test Device. The addition of this equipment is improving the quality of undergraduate education, including development of learning skills through laboratory experience. The use of this instrumentation is enhancing students? understanding about Superpave technology and pavement design and increasing students? competitiveness to pursue graduate study in the field of transportation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These improvements are supporting North Carolina A&amp;T State University in its effort to meet the highest educational standards. The improved curriculum places students in a more competitive position for employment and careers in the field of transportation and allows NCA&amp;T to produce knowledgeable and effective engineers for the local, state, and national job markets.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project was to incorporate Superpave Technology into the undergraduate civil engineering curriculum.  To achieve project objective several educational testing equipments were acquired to facilitate both studentsÆ hands-on training and the departmentÆs preparation for transforming the teaching methodology from lecture-based to project-based approach.       As part of this project four term-projects were conducted by students.  Students worked in teams to conduct assigned projects and write manuscripts and reports.  Several of those student-authored manuscripts were presented in national conferences and undergraduate research symposia. Two of those papers received best paper award and the second best poster award from American Society of Engineering Education (June 29 and April 12, 2011, respectively).     In addition, as part of the project effects of implementation of Project-Based Learning (PBL) on students' learning outcomes were studied.  It was found that use of PBL in classroom significantly improved ease of learning the subject matter.  Furthermore, such hands-on training motivated students to pursue career in research in areas related to transportation and materials.     Considering that two of the critical issues in transportation are shortages of skilled people and retirements, the broader outcome of this effort was to produce knowledgeable professionals in the field of transportation which will directly benefit the national infrastructure and economy.
