<AbstractNarration>Lichens are highly successful obligate mutualistic symbioses between fungi and photosynthetic green algae and cyanobacteria that live within their tissues. Bright orange-colored species of the fungi in the group named Teloschistales are among the most noticeable lichens worldwide. This recently redefined group of fungi includes nearly 2,000 described species that live in wide variety of habitats, including surfaces of man-made substrates. This will be the first global phylogenetic study of these brightly colored organisms. The results of this study will lead to a better understanding of the diversity of these fungi, and will likely result in the description of new families and the re-definition of most genera.  This study will also be an experimental test of a novel method of finding genetic markers that can be used to study patterns of evolution in fungi and other organisms.  This study will also demonstrate the importance of studying the evolution of genes involved in reproduction in organisms living in symbiotic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the training of one female postdoctoral researcher and one female Ph.D. student, a workshop will be organized during year three of this proposed project to develop a worldwide consensus among all leading experts on a new system of classification for these fungi. This new classification, which will be co-authored by all workshop participants, will be a long-lasting contribution of this project to fungal biology.</AbstractNarration>
