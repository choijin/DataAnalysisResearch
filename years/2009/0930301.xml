    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a high-performance--spectrally adaptive and high operating temperature--detector for multiple spectral-band infrared detection and discrimination applications. The bio-inspired, photon detector will be able to operate throughout the 3 to 14 micron infrared spectrum. In addition the detector material will be optimized to have the highest performance in the 3 to 5 and 8 to 12 micron spectral atmospheric windows. The overarching theme of the proposed research and development effort is to produce a marketable product that will be the preeminent solution for many infrared detection and imaging applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are will allow sensing of infrared electromagnetic radiation, which is very important for a wide variety of activities and applications. Infrared (beyond the red visible light) detection provides a means of seeing-in-the-dark or un-illuminated objects. The proposed spectrally adaptive high-performance sensor will be important for many medical, commercial, scientific, and defense applications. In particular, the research and development activities will directly lead to a sensor product for agile multispectral imagery, without the use of cryogenic cooling.</AbstractNarration>
