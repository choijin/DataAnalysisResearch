<AbstractNarration>This Materials World Network award by the Metallic Materials and Nanostructures program and the Office of Special Programs in the Division of Materials Research to Texas Engineering and Experimental Station is to fabricate inexpensive meta-magnetic shape memory alloys (MMSMAs) in polycrystalline bulk form having large magnetic field-induced actuation work output and enhanced ductility using a powder metallurgy approach.  This award is also cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.  Magnetic shape memory alloys (MSMAs) are promising candidates for actuation, sensing, energy harvesting and magnetic refrigeration. The development of these materials have been limited by small actuation work outputs, poor ductility, and a lack of systematic studies to connect the issues in solid-state physics, conventional metallurgy, and applications. The problem of low work output was recently resolved by the present U.S.-Japan team from Texas A&amp;M and Tohoku Universities by the discovery and preliminary understanding of MMSMAs. Yet the ductility problem remains and the works on MMSMAs are limited only to single crystals, which are difficult to fabricate. In addition, porous MMSMAs will be fabricated for the evaluation of their potential in biomedical applications, focusing on the characterization of biological viability and their use as active tissue scaffolds. These goals will be achieved through the synergistic combination of materials design, fabrication, and multi-scale characterization in order to develop an understanding of the magneto-thermo-mechanical response and magneto-microstructural coupling, and evaluation of their corrosion resistance, cytotoxicity, and potential for stimulating tissue growth remotely with the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this transformative research will provide an opportunity for (a) revolutionizing the field of shape memory alloys by fertilizing completely new applications and property landscapes, (b) transformation of current understanding of field-induced shape change in MSMAs through a multi-scale, multidisciplinary characterization on the new MMSMAs; and (c) the creation of an entirely new family of tissue scaffolds that would allow remotely controlled mechanical stimulus for tissue growth. Ultimately, the methodologies in this work will contribute to the overall effort to maintain US-leading role in active and biomaterials research. Graduate and undergraduate students including several minority students will benefit through establishment of joint-degree and exchange programs with the Japanese partner institution, new course developments, classroom instruction and direct involvement in the research. K-12 students and high school teachers will be engaged in developing science projects with SMAs to increase the awareness of science and engineering among them and provide them firsthand research experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Morphing tissue scaffolds provide support for cellular growth much like a structural scaffold provides support for a building and can "massage" bodily tissues which has been shown to stimulate bone cell growth. Meta-magnetic shape memory alloys (MMSMA) are metallic materials that link magnetic, thermal and mechanical energy domains; in other words they can convert one form of energy into another. While these properties show great promise for unique biomedical applications such as morphing tissue scaffolds and micro-pumps that can be activated from outside the body using magnetic fields, current MMSMAs are very brittle and their actuation frequency or speed of activation is very low. Previous research on other types of shape memory alloys has showed that introducing pores into the material can improve the ductility and actuation frequency. Also, tissue scaffolds require pore sizes on the order of 500 microns to bond to bodily tissue. The introduction of controlled pore sizes can also improve the other areas of MMSMA research such as magnetic-based refrigeration and energy harvesting.  In this project, the PI (Ibrahim Karaman) and Co-PI (Maria Hahn) worked on the development of biocompatible porous MMSMA tissue scaffolds with a controlled pore size and expanded their application capabilities discovering new phenomena exhibited by MMSMAs.  This three year project produced the following achievements:  1)       Scientific Outcomes:  Through this project we have identified the processing parameters required for more ductile NiCoMnSn scaffolds using ammonium bicarbonate space holders and the solid state replication technique. Extremely clean scaffolds with improved energy domain coupling were created through the use of improved processing techniques. We have also demonstrated that while NiMnSn is toxic due to the release of Mn ions, the biocompatibility of these alloy systems can be improved by coating these materials with a polymer passivation layer. It was shown that layer-by-layer assembly is a effective method for applying Poly[Allylamine Hydrochloride]/Poly[Acrylic Acid] passivation coatings to MMSMAs. The creation of porous NiMnCoSn can improve the magneto-thermo-mechanical coupling and thus increase the magnetic-refrigeration capability of these materials. This research contributed to the discovery of a Kauzmann point and spin-glass transition that were previously unknown to exist in MMSMAs. These new findings have the potential to increase the practicality of these alloy systems.   2)      Broader Impacts:  The PI and Co-PI are highly committed to the dissemination of science, particularly of materials science since many technological problems the US and the World currently face are ultimately related to materials. Through this project, the PI and Co-PI have been able to contribute to the dissemination and outreach mission of NSF. The following are some of the examples:  Seven students (including two female and three Hispanic students) have been supported through this research. This will result in two Ph.D. theses. The PI and Co-PI have been collaborating with local high schools, advising local students interested in competing in science fairs at the local, state, national and international levels. The PI and Co-PI also collaborate with the International Sustainable Energy, Engineering and Environment Project (ISWEEP) Olympiad, the largest of its kind in the US. The PI and Co-PI have also contributed to the learning experience of undergraduate students at Texas A&amp;M through the supervision of projects on Shape Memory Alloys. The PI has organized a series of international workshops and symposia on SMAs for oil/gas, aerospace and automotive industries           Last Modified: 01/31/2013       Submitted by: Ibrahim Karaman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
