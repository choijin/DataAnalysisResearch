<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to apply results on geometric Calabi-Yau modular forms obtained recently by the PI and Co-PI to the problem of black hole entropy in string theory. The project rests on the observation that the Siegel modular forms considered so far in the black hole context can be constructed in terms of ordinary modular forms that have a geometric interpretation because they are derived from the cycle structure of Calabi-Yau manifolds. These geometric modular forms provide a more general reservoir of modular forms than, for example, the elliptic genera considered in the literature. The project addresses one of the open questions in black hole physics: how the results obtained so far for N = 4 supersymmetric models can be extended to systems with fewer supersymmetries. Such theories are given by compactifications on generic Calabi-Yau manifolds instead of special cases that have been the main manifolds considered at this point. The investigators plan to use their previous work on the construction of geometric modular forms for deformation families of Calabi-Yau threefolds as ingredients. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This project can be formulated in such a way that it is easy to involve undergraduate students in the work, and hence is ideal for the PI and Co-PI who work as theorists at a Predominantly Undergraduate Institution.The physics department at IUSB has recently introduced a series of upper level classes that teach some of the techniques used in theoretical research, such as quantum field theory and string theory courses. The students are prepared for the research experience through a combination of attending these courses and guided independent work. IUSB is the only public university in the region with a physics major, hence provides the only opportunity for a large section of the student population to be involved in research in this field. To recruit more students to IUSB and into STEM fields, the investigators regularly talk to high school physics classes about their research and participate extensively in outreach activities organized by the physics department and IUSB.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the investigation of two synergistic lines of research, one concerned with the understanding of black hole entropy via automorphic forms, and another with the motivic interpretation of automorphic forms in a more general framework than black holes.

Our success in this direction is based on our discovery of a new lift from certain types of elliptic modular forms to Siegel forms that extends and refines a lift constructed previously by several mathematicians.  We have reported the results of this work in several published research papers, review articles, and conference proceedings, as well as in a number of talks given by both the senior investigators as well as the students supported by this grant.  The second direction of our research was concerned with the geometric understanding of automorphic forms, in particular the extension of our previous work to families of motives that form the fundamental building blocks of geometric objects such as manifolds. Our work builds on our new construction of deformations of motives and allows for a detailed analyis of the modular structure of phase transitions.  We have reported the results of this part of our work in an additional set of published research papers and conference proceedings, as well as in talks.  In addition to the results and activities described above, this grant supported the research of four undergraduate students, including a female student. Their work has resulted in undergraduate theses written by two of the students, with a third thesis is in preparation.
