<AbstractNarration>The increasing performance and decreasing cost of processors has enabled increased system intelligence at peripherals such as disk drives. This computational capability at the disk has led to the development of object-based storage whereby some of the file system functionality is moved to the disk. The computation capability can also enable computation at the storage node in what has been called active disks or active storage.  This active storage computation serves as a mechanism to enable parallel computation using distributed storage nodes.&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the use of these active disks for parallel file system and storage management.  A functional active storage system architecture built on the standardized object-storage device specification is being developed.  The architecture supports a variety of execution engines allowing multiple programming languages and models.  Using this active object storage architecture, mechanisms to improve overall scalability and large-scale system reliability are being investigated.  In addition, active and object storage are used to enable customizable and extensible file systems including autonomic (self-configuring and self-managing) storage as well as application aware storage such that the storage can be optimized for application and user needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project is to improve the performance of high performance computing (HPC) storage systems through the use of intelligent storage platforms.  The core technology is called "active object storage" and is based on smart disks paired with a rich data interface.  The project has developed a new active object storage platform that is available for other researchers to use, evaluate, and improve.  The platform has been used to develop techniques to improve the performance of parallel file systems that are often used in HPC systems.  This can have an impact on a variety of critical HPC applications such as data mining, simulation, modeling, and analytics.  The project has also explored what is called "application aware storage", such that the storage system is modified to become more tuned to the needs of the application.  In particular, techniques were developed to extend object storage technology such that it also can have an impact on desktop computing.  These improved approaches expose low level data structures to applications so that they can have the most efficient access to data.  Finally, the project has developed new energy saving algorithms to decrease the amount of energy used in an distributed storage system.  Power in a datacenter or cloud storage system is a significant part of the cost and these techniques can significantly reduce the cost of operating such a storage system.
