<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Chemistry Department at Cleveland State University will acquire a triple quadrupole/linear ion trap liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer system (LC MS/MS).  This instrument will promote research in a wide range of scientific and engineering fields, including: analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, clinical chemistry, pharmacology, forensic chemistry, environmental sciences, biochemistry, molecular biology, green and renewable energy, nano-science, engineering, and others. The projects include studies on: I) Elucidating molecular mechanisms of drug resistance; II) Biomaterial development for drug delivery; III) Ante- and post-mortem forensic analysis of drugs; IV) Nano-particle fuel cells; V) Efficient bio-fuel production; VI) Metabolomic studies of lipids in the liver: biological and analytical aspects; VII) A novel separation technology interfaced to mass spectrometry; VIII) Proteomic studies to elucidate plant arsenic detoxification mechanisms; and IX) Undergraduate research experiences to enhance learning: Use in the Research Experiences to Enhance Learning (REEL) Program in Analytical and Pharmaceutical Chemistry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is used to identify the chemical composition of a sample and determine its purity by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer.  A tandem mass spectrometer system is two mass filters in series to better identify the constituents under study.  Chromatography is an isolation technique that precedes the mass spectrometry analysis.  It separates a mixture into its several constituent chemicals which are then analyzed and identified by the mass spectrometer.  These are some of the most widely used analytical techniques used to identify and quantify the chemical composition of a sample. The LC-MS/MS would improve the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students.  This acquisition involves faculty and students from the Department of Chemistry, the Department of Biological, Geological and Environmental Sciences, the Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, and the Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering at Cleveland State University (CSU), as well as researchers from Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office, Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, University of Akron , Case Western Reserve University, and students from Cuyahoga Community College (CCC). This instrument will promote the growth and interdisciplinary research between these departments, and institutions, that will act as a catalyst for the development of new ideas in research and education within CSU, Cleveland area institutions and the Northeast Ohio community</AbstractNarration>
