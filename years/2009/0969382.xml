<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;A decline in the annual retention and graduation rates of LeTourneau University's School of Engineering and Engineering Technology to significantly subpar levels motivated a study of the underlying causes. An analysis of performance and predictor data, as well as surveys of the literature and of students leaving the school, produced several recommended corrective actions based on documented best practices. The project initiatives to increase retention include the development of a coordinated faculty-peer-industry mentoring program for first-year students, and a new two-course sequence whose primary aim is to stimulate first-year student interest and engagement through early exposure to real-world engineering practice.  These multifaceted initiatives include several best-practice components, namely:&lt;br/&gt;. the development of the faculty mentoring program for first-year students;&lt;br/&gt;. the development of a peer mentoring program for first-year students;&lt;br/&gt;. the development of an industrial contact mentoring program for first-year students;&lt;br/&gt;. the formation of student clusters in key first-year courses;&lt;br/&gt;. exposure to engineering practice through two new courses employing multidisciplinary projects, presentations by practicing engineers, presentations by students involved in co-op education, and presentations by senior capstone design project students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most specific and immediate goal of this project is to increase the School's graduation rate from its present five-year average of 42% to an improved five-year average of 65%.  Based on the current average annual first-year cohort size of 120 students, the total number of engineering and engineering technology graduates will increase from 50 to over 75 per year.  Over the five-year period comprising the project, more than 125 additional graduates will be queued to join the ranks of the engineering profession. The School's retention improvement efforts focus on "first time in any college" (FTIAC) freshmen.  To achieve the target graduation rate of 65%, 1-year retention of new students will be increased to 85% from its present level of 68%. Implementing these best practices will not only increase first-year retention, but will positively impact retention in subsequent years, as well, since students will carry forward their improved study habits, academic support network, and higher level of commitment to pursue engineering.</AbstractNarration>
