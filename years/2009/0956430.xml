<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development, manufacturing and commercialization of a novel miniature self-aligned tunable diode laser. The tunable laser platform offers two major advantages compared to currently available products and technologies: (1) passive optical alignment and assembly; and (2) extremely broad spectral coverage from visible (375nm) to the infrared (4,000nm). The self-alignment feature translates to much simpler and efficient manufacturing, and the optical design enables the new platform to be two orders of magnitude more compact than commercially available tunable diode lasers. These features combine to considerably lower the labor costs associated with assembly and packaging.  The research objectives are to determine the parameters of the passive cavity that enable (1) stable single frequency operation, (2) a linewidth less than 30KHz, and (3) less than 1MHz wavelength drift.  It is also critical to develop methods to tune the output to a specific target wavelength. Prototypes of the tunable laser will be built for three wavelength groups: blue (400-415 nm) ? Red (635-660 nm) and near-infrared (760-790 nm). This novel laser platform will enable a broad range of technology areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project has direct links to commercial applications that decrease energy use or promote renewable energy implementation.  Specifically, this laser technology can assist the reduction of carbon emissions by monitoring and optimizing efficiencies in combustion processes such as engines and coal plants (via gas sensing with infrared tunable lasers). The technology will help accelerate the deployment of environmental sensing stations by providing the key optical source for sensing systems at a fraction of today?s cost.  A second role would be to provide athermal operation of lasers, which could significantly reduce the energy consumption in telecommunication systems by eliminating the requirement for cooling the lasers.&lt;br/&gt;A third application would be improving the efficiency of renewable wind power (via wind sensing with blue-violet lasers) by enabling ?smart? wind turbines. A laser-based wind sensor would provide each ?smart? turbine of a wind farm with the ability to preemptively assess and accurately predict the wind load far in advance, helping improve overall turbine efficiency and utilization. This information is critical to the planning of energy supply into the power grid. All of these applications have immediate commercial potential to help reduce the World?s dependence on fossil fuels.</AbstractNarration>
