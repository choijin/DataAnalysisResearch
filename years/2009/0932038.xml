<AbstractNarration>With NSF support, Fisk University proposed second phase CREST Center for Physics and Chemistry of Materials (CPCoM) will primarily establish a sustainable program that integrates high-quality science education with state-of-the-art research and develop it over the course of CREST support into an internationally recognized research center in the area of physics and chemistry of advanced materials. Education of undergraduates and graduates will be a vital component of the Center. The major objectives of the CREST-CPCoM Center are to continue establishing a world-class research center for the study of electronic and optical materials and related technologies. The research focus of the proposed Center for Physics and Chemistry of Materials is in the study of advanced materials, novel processing methods, new properties and phenomena while enabling new devices for science, industry, energy, environment, and medicine. Phenomena and their applications will focus on detection, emission and modulation of electromagnetic radiation based on selected electronic and optical materials in the form of crystals, nanomaterials, amorphous materials and glasses, glass-ceramics and thin films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include dramatic increases in the production of well prepared members of underrepresented groups (primarily Afro-American and/or female) with Masters and PhDs at CPCoM and its partners through rich interdisciplinary interactions and cross-fertilizations of ideas among the faculty and students in the discovery and study of novel materials and creating breakthroughs based&lt;br/&gt;on scientific and technological excellence.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For the final period of the award (Aug. 2014-Jan,2015), five students completed their work for a Masters degree in Physics with a concentration in Materials Science or Astrophysics.  During the life of the grant, the center has significantly impacted the work force by graduating over 26 Masters-degree students from under-represented population including Blacks, Hispanic and women.  Most of these students have gone on to matriculate in a Ph.D. degree programs, primarily through the Fisk-Vanderbilt MA -Ph.D. bridge program.  We have been successful in interesting individuals from under-represented groups in STEM fields by involving them in varying projects starting at five years of age.  Four summer programs have been successfully run; they are  GUSTO: 2-month camp for girls from ages 9 to 15 (average of 36 participants per summer)  THRUST: 2-month camp for boys from ages 9 to 15 (average of 45 participants per summer)  PCSI: a 6-week camp for children 5 to 9 (average of 25 participants per summer)  Summer Research: 2-month Research experience for undergraduates: (average of 10 participants per summer from different universities and colleges)  Over 95% of all students participating in our summer camps have decided to go to college upon graduating from high school.   Other outreach activities included a Saturday Science Academy and Middle School Science Club.  Rocketry was used to gain interest in the clubs science clubs such that these clubs became the largest clubs in the middle schools in which they were established.  The Saturday Science Academy dealt with high school students and sought to improve their critical thinking skills and to help them develop greater confidence in their ability to pursue degrees in STEM areas.  100% of the science club members who have graduated from high school have pursued a college degree with over sixty percent choosing STEM fields.   Significant research in materials science has occurred resulting in numerous publications and presentations to the scientific community.  In summary, we have significantly contributed to the body of knowledge in the area of material science and impacted the number of persons from under-repreented groups that participate in a competitive and highly skilled workforce.  We have also established programs that can be replicated to insure better paticpation  in STEM areas from members of under-represented groups.
