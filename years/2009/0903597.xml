<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award supports the development of a new Ph.D. program at Columbia University that will combine architecture and engineering perspectives to address the growing challenges of urbanization. The program will provide doctoral students with the multidisciplinary design and planning skills needed to conduct research to meet new urban requirements for: (1) adaptability - designing buildings and power, transport, water and sanitation infrastructure with sufficient flexibility to be repurposed as urban needs evolve, and as the immediate environment surrounding various urban structures changes; (2) ecology - designing to address the environmental performance of buildings, urban landscapes, land uses and infrastructure; and (3) resilience - designing buildings and infrastructure anticipating the impact of climate changes on sea level, and the possibility of man-made and natural disasters.  The most important intellectual contribution of this IGERT will be the examination of the interdependent requirements of planning, and designing holistically for adaptability, ecology and resilience. Collaborative architectural and engineering studios will be used as a pedagogical tool for integrating engineering and architectural research approaches at the doctoral level.  The involvement of urban stakeholders in the studio research will help ensure that the research is relevant and applicable in practice. Collaborations with universities in urban environments located within Europe, Africa and Asia will provide a global perspective to the program. Significant efforts will be made to ensure broad participation of women and under-represented minorities in the program. The IGERT will graduate a cohort of diverse doctoral students who can help shape the policies, priorities, and investments needed for contemporary urbanization.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Urbanization is creating an array of contemporary, and interconnected, environmental, physical and societal challenges related to the planning and design of roads and bridges, water and sewer systems, telecommunications networks, airports and subway lines, and buildings of all sorts.  In fast-growing cities, governments struggle to build infrastructure to maintain pace with population growth.  In slow-growing and declining cities, they must contend with replacement and on-going maintenance in the face of stagnant or declining tax revenues.  At the same time, technological advances make existing systems obsolete while current consensus supports thinking in terms of sustainability, not just solving the problem now, but addressing longer time frames to make buildings and infrastructure adaptable, ecologically sensitive, and resilient to natural and man-made disasters.  This Interdisciplinary Research and Education (IGERT) Program sought to address the growing challenges of urbanization through a PhD training program that integrated the disciplines of architecture, engineering and planning in order to advance new design solutions to urbanization challenges that are adaptive, ecologically sound and resilient. A primary goal of the IGERT was to engage with urban stakeholders, and to conduct applied research that could addresses challenges faced by real-world urban communities, with a particular emphasis on low-income communities.  Outcomes/ Intellectual Merit: Over the course of the program, 27 graduate students (25 supported with funding from the program, and 2 affiliated with, but not supported by, the program) conducted research with a suite of urban stakeholders. Twenty of the Trainees came from Columbia University?s School of Engineering and Applied Science, including the Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering Departments, while seven of the Trainees came from Columbia University?s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, providing interdisciplinary perspectives on all research outcomes. The IGERT Trainees formed into three primary cohorts: one with an urban energy theme, the other an urban water theme and the third an urban transportation theme. Program outcomes included new designs for eco-feedback systems to reduce building energy consumption in the urban residential sector, new designs for green infrastructure systems to reduce urban flooding and stormwater management issues, and new models for funding urban public transportation systems, among many others.  Outcomes/Broader Impacts The applied research conducted with urban stakeholders resulted in six collaborative projects with low-income or non-for-profit urban community groups that were based in New York City (two projects), the Dominican Republic, East Aalborg, Denmark, New Rochelle and Detroit, Michigan. Advances were made in understanding the role of problem and site based research in supporting interdisciplinary research training. The IGERT was also instrumental in supporting the development of a diverse, U.S. STEM research workforce, with 68% of the supported students coming from groups currently underrepresented in STEM.  Products The IGERT was a training grant and its products are strongly tied to student education.
