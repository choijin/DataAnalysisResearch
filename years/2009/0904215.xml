<AbstractNarration>Environmental stresses result in considerable losses in crop quality and plant biomass productivity.  Exposure of plants to temperature extremes, drought, pollution, and pathogens results in the generation of reactive oxygen species that alter signaling pathways and growth.  As part of their response to these stresses, plants produce the peptide glutathione.  Glutathione acts as an antioxidant by quenching reactive oxygen species and is essential for the detoxification of environmental pollutants.  Two enzymes catalyze glutathione synthesis:  glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), and glutathione synthetase (GS).  This project explores how these enzymes function and are regulated by 1) examining the structure of plant GS, 2) establishing the role of GCL as a regulatory switch in glutathione biosynthesis; and 3) identifying additional plant proteins that act as redox-linked regulatory switches.&lt;br/&gt;Efforts related to broader impact fall into two categories.  First, the research project provides undergraduate and graduate students with multidisciplinary training in plant biology, biochemistry, and structural biology.  At the graduate level, two students are involved in the project.  At the undergraduate level, both the PI and Co-PI are active in the NSF-REU program at the Danforth Center and in the Pfizer-Solutia Summer Students and Teachers as Research Scientists (STARS) program.  Second, the PI helped develop an upper-level undergraduate/graduate plant biology course (Bio4024) at Washington University that offers research-based experiments that combine protein chemistry, x-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry/proteomics, and microscopy (Jez et al., 2007 Biochem. Mol. Biol. Educ. 35, 410-415).  By blending biochemistry and plant biology, students acquire the breadth of understanding and the scientific skills required for solving problems at the interface of these disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Environmental stresses result in considerable losses in crop quality and plant productivity.  In plants, exposure to temperature extremes, heavy metal-contaminated soils, drought, air pollutants, and pathogens results in the generation of reactive oxygen species that alter the intracellular redox balance, which in turn influences multiple biochemical pathways.  This project examined how changes in redox state controls a wide-range of metabolic functions in plants.  This project successfully revealed how plants synthesize a critical redox buffer (i.e., glutathione), where the synthesis of the molecule occurs, and how multiple proteins across a range of biochemical pathways are controlled by its presence or absence.  Thus, demonstrating that it can act as a 'control switch' in different parts of plant metabolism.  In addition, an experimental technique was developed that allows for identification of proteins that respond to changes in redox balance.  Use of this method demonstrates that long-term climate change in ozone levels, which is an reactive oxygen related stress that affects crop yields, alters the biochemical status of multiple proteins in plant metabolism and provided new understanding of how environmental ozone affects redox-sensitive pathways to aid in the development of crops better adapted to global climate change.  The scientific studies in this grant provided graduate and undergraduate students, including under-represented minorities, with multidisciplinary training that bridges plant biology, biochemistry, and structural biology.  Students working on this project were involved in both research and teaching efforts, as much of the work was also integrated into a protein chemistry lab course taught by the lead investigator.  By blending biochemistry and plant biology, students and trainees will acquire the breadth of understanding and the scientific skills required for solving problems at the interface of these disciplines.  In addition, multiple outreach activities targeted high school teachers and students and the general public on the topic of "Proteins, the Environment, and Sustainability".
