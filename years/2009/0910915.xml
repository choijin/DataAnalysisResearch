    <AbstractNarration>The Workshop on Physical Organic Chemistry is an annual conference for the discussion of topics that span bioorganic chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials chemistry, gas-phase reactions, mechanistic organic chemistry and supramolecular chemistry. Although the range of topics is broad, the field covered by the workshop has grown to include not only physical organic chemists but those who use the methodology, synthetic strategy, and tools developed by physical organic chemists. Attendance at the workshop is limited to about twenty participants, all of whom present informal talks on new, unpublished research results. Conferences are held at remote sites in order to minimize distractions and encourage informal discussions. The goal is to provide a safe environment where cutting-edge research can be discussed and a forum for the exchange of ideas. A strong effort is made to create a diverse environment of participants that will include women, underrepresented groups, young investigators, and senior investigators. Attention is also paid to including researchers from diverse geographical areas and from both small and large schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program (OMC) supports the on-going Workshops on Physical Organic Chemistry, which is organized by the co-PIs, Professors Nancy S. Goroff of SUNY at Stony Brook, Theodore G. Goodson from the University of Michigan, and Brent L. Iverson from the University of Texas. The Workshop will provide opportunities for the generation of new ideas, and facilitate collaborations. The Workshop benefits the OMC Program by identifying new research areas and by helping to develop new, young investigators who will become new awardees, reviewers and advisors for the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
