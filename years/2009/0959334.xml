<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Rolando M. Roque-Malherbe and colleagues José Duconge, César Lozano, Francisco Marquez-Linares and Agustín Ríos from the School of Science at Universidad Del Turabo will acquire a powder X-ray diffractometer that will also be utilized by scientists from the Department of Chemistry and Physics as well as the Institute of Physical Chemical Applied Research. The instrument will be used to support research activities and education programs in the synthesis, characterization and properties of new or modified zeolites, silica, molecular organic frameworks, carbon nanotubes, porous anodic materials, semiconductor and metallic nanostructured catalysts, proton conducting and oxygen permeable perovskites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. A powder diffractometer allows diffraction studies and analysis of powdered crystalline materials. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry, materials chemistry, and geology. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
