<AbstractNarration>Symposium: Domain Microstructures and Mechanisms for Advanced Properties in Phase Transforming Materials; Pittsburgh, PA; October 25-29, 2009&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL: Domain microstructures and their behaviors are central to several different research communities, and, historically, the understanding of domains in ferroelectric materials, magnetic materials, and shape-memory alloys has evolved independently in these communities, despite important commonalities among the underlying physical phenomena. Recently discovered nanoscale domains in these materials play an important role in the way these materials respond to various applied fields. This 3-day MS&amp;T 2009 Conference symposium brings together researchers from these communities to present recent research in their fields with the following objectives: (1) To explore recent advances in experimental observations, theory and modeling of domain microstructures and the mechanisms for achieving advanced thermomechanical, magnetostrictive, and piezoelectric properties in phase transforming materials; (2) To discuss the role of nanoscale domains in improving the properties of ferroelastic, ferroelectric, and ferromagnetic materials; and (3) To consider the use of domain microstructures, domain walls, and crystal defects to design new functional materials with advanced properties.  NON-TECHNICAL: The symposium includes experimentalists, theoreticians and computational scientists from different research communities with overlapping interests to facilitate discussion, debate and collaboration. It exposes young researchers (students, postdocs, junior faculty) and members of underrepresented groups (minorities, women, persons with disabilities) to the exciting field of phase transforming materials. It encourages new collaborations across disciplines and generations. The NSF funds are directed to the support of young researchers and underrepresented groups to encourage their participation. Availability of the financial support will be announced together with the symposium announcement and invitation through websites and emails. Invitations will be sent to researchers active in ferroelectrics, ferromagnetics, ferroelastics and shape-memory alloys to ensure symposium success and broad participation. The symposium focuses on emerging aspects of nanodomains, and the technical discussions should provide new insights into how domain engineering may be exploited in the creation of new materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
