<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)    The project is developing an approach to teaching undergraduate biophysics that allows students to develop teamwork skills needed for interdisciplinary research.  The coursework focuses on learning modules that utilize interactive software based on SciPy (scientific tools for python).  The modules play a role similar to laboratory experiments, and are studies by teams of students.  Each team has members with different skills coming from biology, chemistry, engineering, computer science and physics.  The learning modules can be modified easily and analyzed in ways that foster creativity and interaction between team members.  The software runs on all major computer platforms and is easily installed on the students' computers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Many of the most exciting areas of research today involve teams composed of researchers from different disciplines. However for the most part, our teaching methods do not reflect this reality.  This award developed content and techniques to teach a course in biophysics that requires strong collaboration between students from different disciplines. The outcomes are now described.  Upper division undergraduate students worked in teams, mostly of three, coming from a variety of majors, for example, physics, biology, and biomolecular engineering.  They learned to interact in a team setting to complete projects requiring expertise from many different areas.  Many cooperated intensively to accomplish their goals. By refining the course based on feedback and evaluation from educational experts, much has been learned on how to effectively teach this kind of course. For example, we now have excellent techniques to improve the balance of work among team members.  Educational materials were developed that encouraged this kind of collaboration, much of it focusing on current research. The learning centers around software programs that were developed to help in understanding and exploring scientific problems. The software is written in Python and is easy to modify but still teaches students many important features of scientific simulation techniques.  Examples include models of pattern formation, movement of molecules through pores, protein structure and folding, and how molecular motors work.  The material, including elearning materials and software, has been made freely available on websites.  Overall, the students in this course were very enthusiastic about it, in particular this new way of learning interdisciplinary material and collaborative skills. Because of the unique nature of the educational experience, involving both interdisciplinary collaboration and the extensive use of software, many students have been strongly influenced by it, changing their career paths towards software or biosciences.  In addition to their educational aspects, the materials developed have already been used internationally by researchers in modelling biophysical processes.
