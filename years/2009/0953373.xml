<AbstractNarration>This project studies natural image statistics, and their applications in diverse fields such as computational neuroscience, image processing, computer vision, and graphics. The centerpiece of this project is a new image representation based on a simple nonlinear transform that is statistically justified and biologically inspired. This representation provides a new language to describe image signals, and forms the basis to build statistical models to more effectively capture statistical properties of natural image. Built upon this new image representation, this project explores new paradigms to model and interpret visual neural responses and high-level perceptual properties, and provides new tools for image restoration, analysis and synthesis. On the other hand, by applying natural image statistics to the forensic analysis of digital images, this project facilitates forensic practitioners in criminal investigations, and contributes to national security and public safety. Moreover, this project contributes to education by making the learning of Computer Science fun and useful for undergraduate students, promoting the participation of women and undergraduate students in research, and improving the early learning of mathematics and sciences for local high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The goal of the proposed research project is to construct a new statistical frame- work that interweaves efficient coding transforms, image representations and statistical image models for better understanding and application of natural image statistics. The centerpiece in this framework is an image representation based on nonlinear efficient coding transforms that are optimized for describing and simplifying statistical properties of natural images.      Our work on divisive normalization revealed a previously unobserved phe- nomenon that divisive normalization?s performance as an efficient coding transform depends critically on the dimensionality of the inputs: with smaller number of inputs, it may actually increase the dependency in the input data, contrary to the conventional belief in the literature.  Our work shows that a wide range of non maximum likelihood learning methods that are developed in recent years can be unified with a simple scheme, contrary to the common belief that they are unrelated.&bull; We confirmed that local statistical image features such as SIFT are very effective in detecting duplicated regions in digital images for the purpose of digital image forensics;  We have developed an efficient and effective global and local blind image noise estimation methods based on natural image statistics. The global blind noise estimation method achieves improved or comparable performance from the state of the art algorithms, and the local blind noise estimation method is the first such algorithm in the literature. The splicing detection algorithm based on the local noise estimation method also shows promising performances.  We introduce a new framework, Uni- HIST, to incorporate marginal his- togram constraints into image restoration.
