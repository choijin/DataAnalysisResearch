<AbstractNarration>The primary purpose of this CAREER award is to enhance, strengthen and broaden the research program and the education and outreach activities of Professor Gershtein at Rutgers University. It will partially support the salary and the tuition of graduate students to work on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It will also support a part time staff (undergraduate student) for the new outreach program he has initiated at the University. His research at CMS is focused on the search for the Higgs boson through its decay into two photons, its most likely discovery mode at the LHC. He also proposes to use the techniques needed for the Higgs discovery to search for signs of new physics, including manifestations of hidden valleys, supersymmetry, and new strong dynamics. It is expected his experience at D0 should enable him to take a leading role in such searches. In coordination with the New Jersey Chapter of the American Association of Physics Teachers, he is initiating a "Saturday Morning Physics" program of lectures at Rutgers University on the cutting edge developments in science and technology. It will target high school students from under-represented urban areas such as Camden, Newark, New Brunswick, and Trenton, aiming to improve their perception of science and inspire some to pursue careers in engineering or science. Students who attend the lectures would be tracked in an attempt to understand whether this increases the fraction that pursue science in college. An undergraduate student will aid in this effort. In addition, he plans to hold seminars following these lectures targeted to high school teachers. In order to better evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of this program, and to help implement the material into the actual lesson plans, the PI plans to closely involve high school teachers and pre-service teachers. These lesson plans would be posted on a web site - creating a resource for teachers not able to attend the lecture/seminars. Working with the Graduate School of Education and the NJ Department of Education a further goal is for teachers to earn developmental credit for the lesson plans evolving from the lectures and other projects such as QuarkNet activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The duration of this award, 2010-15 coincided with one of the most exciting periods in particle physics in decades: it was the dawn of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) era. The jump in energy that LHC provided had to bring new discoveries. My proposal was to focus on the search for the Higgs boson through its decay into two photons, and to use the techniques needed for the Higgs discovery to search for signs of new physics, including supersymmetry.     Higgs discovery in the two-photon mode has been in my sights since Run 2 of the Tevatron, where I became an expert in reconstructing and identifying photons in the hadron collider environment. The award has allowed me to adapt this work to the LHC, and build on it. My team and I have come up with several new methods that improved photon reconstruction and identification, and developed novel multivariate regression techniques for photon energy resolution as well as per-photon estimate of expected measurement precision.     On the way to the discovery, in addition to the work on the photon reconstruction and identification, we performed several analyses of the LHC data aimed at informing us about the nature of the Electroweak symmetry breaking.

My group has contributed to most aspects of the Higgs discovery analysis and the following exploration of its properties using the two-photon decay mode.  But establishing the existence of a new boson with properties similar to that of the Standard ModelÆs Higgs boson is just a beginning of long research program. In particular, its small mass, 125 GeV is extremely small compared to its "natural" value of 1019 GeV &ndash; strongly suggesting the existence of new particles at mass scales accessible at the LHC. My group took a lead on searches for such particles produced in association with the Higgs boson and put significant constraints on their properties.     This project produced two PhD thesis, one on the Higgs discovery and the other on the search for supersymmetry with Higgs boson. Several Rutgers undergrads also have contributed to the development of the multivariate methods used in the Higgs search.     Finally, the funding of this project has helped support educational outreach.  I have been involved in the Quarknet program, working with high school teachers and students to build large cosmic ray detectors, and participated in the international Particle Physics Master Class project.
