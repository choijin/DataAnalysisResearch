<AbstractNarration>The Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) is a research institute for the mathematical sciences that fosters interdisciplinary research at the interface of the mathematical and biological sciences.  The mission of the MBI is (i) to foster innovation in the development and application of mathematical, statistical, and computational methods for the solution of significant problems in the biosciences; (ii) to engage mathematical and biological scientists in the solution of these problems; (iii) to expand the community of scholars in mathematical biosciences through education, training, and support of students and researchers.  The mathematical sciences and the biological sciences have had a long and fruitful relationship.  The mathematical sciences have been used to help model specific areas in the biological sciences and to understand the implications of these models.  The biological sciences have motivated the development of new mathematical theories and techniques.  MBI will continue to support and encourage exploration of both directions of this interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MBI brings together disparate communities to help initiate research within and between disciplines and create new collaborations.  MBI workshops are divided between emphasis year activities that promote both breadth and depth in a general area and current topic workshops that focus on emerging areas in the biological sciences that are ripe for modeling or on emerging areas in the mathematical sciences that are needed for progress in biology.  MBI also influences and is influenced by the mathematical biology community through its Institute Partner program and its various outreach programs.  MBI's education programs and community building efforts enrich the mathematical sciences community, for example through summer programs for undergraduates and for graduate students, workshops for young scientists, training and education programs, short courses in mathematical biology, public lectures, and a range of programs designed to facilitate the participation of researchers from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
