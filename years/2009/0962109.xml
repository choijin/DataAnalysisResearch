<AbstractNarration>The degree to which chemical heterogeneity in the mantle affects the chemistry of lavas erupted on the spreading centers of the globe-encircling mid-ocean ridge is a topic of hot debate in the marine geology and geophysics community.  Up until now, most work has focused on characterizing and trying to understand geochemical trends in axial lavas.  This project focuses on off-axis and transform lavas from the East Pacific Rise which, due to their low magma recharge rates, should provide better indicators of undiluted mantle chemical differences.  Project goals are to examine the extent to which these lavas exhibit compositions inherited directly from the mantle or from mixing during melt aggregation.   Magmatic volatiles such as H2O, CO2, S, F, and Cl will be analyzed in about 200 geochemically well-characterized lavas from two different areas near the Rise.  These data will be combined with geophysical data to determine the evolution of the magmas and whether it can be determined how much of the mantle composition of origin they represent.  Broader impacts of the work include support of an institution in an EPSCoR state, international (Japan and France) and inter-institutional collaboration, and undergraduate training.</AbstractNarration>

Once the extent of degassing and contamination was accounted for wedetermine the volatile contents of the primitive melts and their mantle sources beneath the East-Pacific-Rise and the Galapagos Archipelago.  We studied two different areas: the East-Pacific-Ridge (EPR) from 15oN to 23oS and the seamounts surrounding the Galapagos Archipelago, areas that have geochemically well-characterized sample collections, geophysically imaged axial magma chambers (AMCs), and clear variations in the tectonic parameters along the ridge (e.g., spreading rate, axial bathymetry, AMC depth).

Seamounts/intratransform basalts share common mantle source/s with axial MORB, but seamount/intra-transform basalts have undergone relatively less mixing and fractionation processes representing pre-aggregated melts.     We verified that excess Cl in submarine magmas originates from assimilation of variably seawater-altered rocks surrounding the AMC, but did not find any correlation between slower melt transport through the crust (shallow depth of H2O-CO2 vapor-melt saturation) and larger extent of contamination,"excess Cl", as the distance to the ridge axis increase in the seamount and intratransform basalts. In most cases our data indicate that shallow level alteration in axial MORB occurs after the aggregation of E and D-MORB. Suggesting that NMORB does not actually represent a melt originated from a single mantle source with composition intermediatebetween EDMM and DDMM, but it is the result of mixing between EMORB and DMORB.

For EMORB we used the correlations between Nb, Cl and CO2, the Nb and Cl contents of uncontaminated EMORBs to obtain a CO2/Nb ~600. We demonstrated that the F/Nd ratio is not constant in oceanic basalts (e.g., E- andD-MORB) as proposed by Workman et al. 2006, but it varies from a value of 16 inDMORB to 26 in EMORB.
