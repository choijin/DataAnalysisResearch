<AbstractNarration>The five-year project seeks to: (1) refine a developing theory of teacher preparation; (2) examine empirically the relationships among teacher preparation, teacher learning, teaching practice, and student learning; and (3) understand the conditions under which teachers use the knowledge and skills acquired during preparation and during their first few years of teaching to improve their practice. Utilizing a longitudinal design and following two cohorts of teachers as they transition from mathematics teacher preparation programs into classroom teaching, the project will study how preparation programs, field conditions, and selected contextual variables affect the implementation of effective classroom mathematics teaching. Research methods will include a planned mix of controlled experiments, small-sample replications, and case studies. Data collection will include both large-sample written assessments and small-sample recurring observations and interviews. By focusing on selected rational number topics and the middle grades 7-8, researchers will compare the effects of two different preparation programs, one designed for elementary/middle school (grades K-8) and the other for secondary school (grades 7-12).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the fundamental issue of how teachers can be taught to teach effectively from the preservice to the inservice stage. Its longitudinal aspect involves documenting growth in effective mathematics teaching from the time participants are in schools as preservice undergraduate education majors to many years after when they are in schools as professional, inservice mathematics teachers. The project takes the view that effective mathematics teaching in the schools does not only require strengthening teachers' mathematics content but also addressing ways in which they can be supported in dealing with contextual variables (institutional constraints) that either hinder or support effective implementation of effective teaching practices. The project also addresses the following controversial issue facing mathematics teacher education research today: Does having more mathematics content (in the case of secondary mathematics majors) than mathematical content knowledge for teaching mathematics (in the case of elementary and middle school majors) a sufficient condition for effectively teaching mathematics (and vice-versa), in particular, fractions?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Every year, the United States spends millions of dollars preparing thousands of teachers, with little evidence of effectiveness. Until there is sufficient empirical data on how teachers learn to teach effectively, the U.S. has no choice but to make crucial decisions based on best guesses.  The goal of this longitudinal study was to help build a knowledge base for designing effective mathematics teacher preparation programs by investigating relationships between mathematics content courses and graduates' knowledge, skills, and classroom practice. The aim was to move beyond best guesses by contributing to a more informed research basis for making critical decisions about preparing mathematics teachers. Research participants were two cohorts of graduates from a K-6 teacher preparation program, followed from graduation to three to four years after graduation.  A total of 132 graduates participated in the study.  The mathematics portion of the preparation program consisted of three mathematics content courses and one mathematics methods course. Before the study began, the mathematics content courses had been carefully designed, tested, and refined over many years.  In order to provide more effective learning opportunities for students, mathematics education faculty and doctoral students had collaboratively developed, tested, and revised detailed, shared lesson plans for each class session. Each section of the same course used the same lesson plans to provide similar learning opportunities to all students. Previous empirical studies indicated the courses had become increasingly more effective over time.  This study focused on the effects of the first two mathematics content courses, taken by prospective teachers in their freshman year in the program. These courses focus on developing number and operation concepts.  Participants completed a set of paper-and-pencil tasks, an online video task, and a lesson planning task.
