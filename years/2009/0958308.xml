<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Graptolite Biogeography, Paleo-GIS, and Evolutionary Dynamics of Early Paleozoic Zooplankton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daniel Goldman, Dayton University, EAR-0958372&lt;br/&gt;Charles Mitchell, SUNY, Buffalo, EAR-0958308&lt;br/&gt;H. David Sheets, Canisius College, EAR-0957672&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Deep-time perspectives on climatic and oceanographic change are critical for understanding the long-term controls on environmental processes. This is particularly the case for the 'tipping points' that lead to episodes of climatic extremes, events that are often associated with episodes of profound biodiversity change. The spatial and temporal distribution of planktic organisms has proven to be critical to the reconstruction of climatic and oceanographic conditions during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. The oldest geological period for which there is a diverse and abundant record of zooplankton is the Ordovician, and that record is provided by graptolites. PIs objectives are to analyze the changing biogeographic distribution patterns in graptolites from the mid-Ordovician into the lower Silurian using newly developing global databases, ecological modeling, and paleo-GIS techniques. Graptolite spatial distribution patterns should help understand the relationship between ancient ocean structure, climate, and zooplankton biogeography. Strong parallels have recently been drawn between the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian and those of the late Cenozoic. Therefore, understanding the biogeographic and biodiversity changes associated with these climatic cycles will provide insights relevant to our understanding of biotic response to recent and modern climate change. Although this study will focus on the Ordovician and Early Silurian biosphere and its interconnections, the questions PIs propose to pursue - how range area and spatial patterning of faunas affect or respond to changing environmental history and species evolutionary dynamics - are fundamental questions that biologists and paleobiologists are pursuing across our traditional disciplinary boundaries of taxon, age, and conceptual approach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intent of this project is to use the unique properties of graptolites to examine theories about what controls the frequency at which species originate and become extinct over geological timescales.  Graptolites are marine animals distantly related to vertebrates (such as fish and humans) but unlike vertebrates, were small, soft-bodied animals and formed complex colonies that constructed elaborate communal dwelling structures (a set of interconnected organic tubes that each housed a graptolite animal; see Figure 1).  In contrast to most other marine shelly animals, graptolites did not live on the sea floor but were planktonic, drifting freely in the surface waters of the deep ocean.  Because of their unique ecology graptolites responded directly to changes in surface ocean conditions such as temperature, productivity and oxygen content.  Thus, they had an unusual mode of life that exposed them to different selective forces than actively mobile fish, bottom dwellers such as clams, snails or corals. This means that features of their evolutionary record (such as controls on rates or origination and extinction of graptolite species) that are similar to those of other animals demonstrate that those features are truly of general significance, while differences among groups help to illuminate the influence of the special features of each group on their large-scale evolution.               In addition to their unique ecology, graptolites have a densely sampled fossil record with many species (probably some 3,000 in total) distributed around the world in rocks formed during the Ordovician to early Devonian periods of Earth history (485-408 million years ago).  We have constructed a database that includes nearly all known occurrences of graptolites from this whole interval and all around the world, keeping track of which species occur together in samples and the associated rock types and other environmental indicators.  From these data we are constructing an integrated succession of species occurrences, including species origination and extinction events, as well as data on the commonness of each species and its geographic range (both where it lived and over how large an area it occurred).  Using the occurrence information and other data from the geological literature we are testing and extending a leading theory about where exactly graptolites lived in the water column and how they partitioned food resources.              Building on that ecological work, we have tested whether graptolites living in deep, low oxygen waters exhibit similar evolutionary dynamics (lifespan, range size, frequency of occurrence) as species that lived in more shallow, better-oxidized habitats.  Preliminary work on a subsample of the total graptolite record confirms that they have different dynamics: smaller ranges and shorter durations, but similar levels of commonness within their favored habitats (Figure 2).  We are following up this work with a more detailed analysis of Mid Ordovician species and habitats in an effort to separate the inevitably confounded sampling and ecological effects of geographic range on evolutionary turnover of species. We have published one preliminary paper on that work and a second is in draft.              We are also using our database and the fact that graptolites passed through the second largest mass extinction known to have affected life on Earth (the late Ordovician mass extinction, LOME) to examine how marine planktonic communities respond to major climate change events. The LOME event is associated with a major episode of glaciation and global cooling followed by an equally rapid global warming episode. This one-two punch had dramatic effects on marine ecosystems and wiped out most planktic graptolite groups.  Our work on graptolite extinction and recovery demonstrates that the evolutionary effects of such changes are highly unpredictable and result from severe disruption of preexisting ecosystems, for ever changing ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
