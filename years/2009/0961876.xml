<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the 2010 Photoions, Photoionization &amp; Photodetachment Gordon Research Conference. (Galveston, TX. January 31-February 5, 2010 Chair: Albert Stolow). This conference series attracts the world's leading experts on the basic phenomena linked to the ejection of electrons by absorption of light. This fundamental process underlies attosecond science, modern x-ray and synchrotron science, high harmonic generation and strong field physics, spectroscopy/dynamics in complex environments, ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopies and photoionization probes of molecular dynamics. The deep intellectual theme unifying all of these is the physics of the electronic continuum, a field which unites collision physics with spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are that the fundamental study of photoions, photoionization and photodetachment underpins broad areas of highly important science. The implications of attosecond science, strong field physics, laser control, modern x-ray science etc. are broad and far reaching. This 2010 conference brings together world-class researchers from various areas of physics: laser science, synchrotron science, chemical physics, x-ray science, strong field physics, ultrafast physics. This meeting provides a forum for disseminating NSF-sponsored research to a broad and international group of scientists and US-based graduate students. This grant will partially offset registration and/or travel costs of participants, such as graduate students and/or postdocs attending the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
