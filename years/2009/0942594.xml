<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Mechanical (56)&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaborative project between the University of Houston at Clear Lake and the University of Houston to develop multifunctional Labs-to-Go (LTG) kits that would enable undergraduate engineering students to engage in take-home hands-on experiments. The LTG kits include a set of components that can be easily configured to perform a range of experiments. The kits will be used in combination with course modules on the topics of systems dynamics, vibrations, controls, smart materials, active vibration damping, and sensors. The LTG kits provide students with an experimental and experiential component to help them better understand the associated physical concepts and theories. The project engages seven instructors from two universities. The LTG kits will be integrated into 16 courses with an anticipated impact on 525 engineering and technology students. Due to the diverse nature of the student populations at the institutions, the project aims to impact approximately 260 minority students. The LTG kits will target student learning of structures, dynamics, control, and electronics technology in multiple disciplines including civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and electronics technology. The project includes outreach efforts such as an exhibition at the Children's Museum of Houston and performing demos at local high schools.</AbstractNarration>
