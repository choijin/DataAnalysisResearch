    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0964980 PI: Addadi, Lia ORG: Gordon Research Conferences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: 2010 Gordon Research Conference on Biomineralization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The purpose of this conference is to explore the fundamental mechanisms that underlie biomineralization processes in all organisms, as well as their possible applications. The interest in this topic stems from the important role that biomineralization processes play in biology, biotechnology and medicine, and the inspiration that can be derived from the understanding of biomineralization strategies in chemistry, interfacial science, materials science, nanotechnology and paleoclimate reconstruction. The goal is thus to foster discussions across disciplines, by bringing together chemists, physicists, biologists, medical doctors, geochemists and engineers who would otherwise not overlap on the conference circuit, in a setting that promotes cross-fertilization of new ideas. Biomineralization has attracted increasing attention in the past decades because it lies at the meeting point between several areas where true scientific revolutions have occurred. Nanotechnology and systems biology are only two examples of areas that may derive inspiration and practical knowledge from biomineralization, while in turn contributing to it with fundamental understanding of physics and biology, and with technical advances. Tissue engineering, synthesis of bio-inspired materials, structure-function relations and material property investigations are examples of more specific areas that will be foci of the planned conference. This conference will also help to define new research directions that are vital to providing a firm scientific foundation for some major technological challenges for decades to come, such as miniaturization, synthesis of environmentally benign materials, and improving quality of life for an aging population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: Biomineralization has a significant and obvious impact on human health. But in addition to such well known pathologies as osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and tooth decay and the promise of medical regeneration of hard tissues, the field has implications for understanding the paleontological record and the historical climate record of the earth. It also holds promise of revealing revolutionary new biomimetic means for producing an array of useful new ceramics. Past Biomineralization Gordon Research Conferences have been characterized by broad participation. In 2008, for example, participant demographics closely reflected the breakdown for speakers and discussion leaders, with 34% being female and 52% coming from North America; 30% came from Europe, 13% from Asia, 1% from South America, and 4% from Oceania. For 2010 30% of the speakers and discussion leaders are female. One goal for 2010 is to increase the percentage of participants from under-represented regions. Because the 160 attendees will be selected from a much larger pool of applicants, the organizers can be selective in choosing participants. In addition to the scientific background of the applicant, they intend to use diversity and location in an underrepresented region as selection criteria. Financial assistance will be used directly to encourage participation by faculty, students, and post docs from underrepresented regions.</AbstractNarration>
