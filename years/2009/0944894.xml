    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I research project will lead to an electrical panel with modules that provide interfaces between the electrical grid and the residential customer?s on-site loads and other energy systems. Through the use of interactive solid state meters, the utility will be able to intelligently regulate loads and dispatch on-site energy systems. The on-site energy systems include, but are not limited to, controlled loads (e.g., water heating), pluggable EVs, generation systems (e.g., PV panels), and energy storage (e.g., spent EV batteries). The panel and modules represent the most integrated and economic system attempted so far to enable more intelligent energy management and will encourage renewable energy and conservation. In addition, new grid stabilization opportunities will be created for the utility. The proposed approach will use advanced power electronics, along with state-of-the-art communications techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are (1) to enable utilities and over 50,000,000 residential customers to implement safe, convenient and economic energy management techniques, (2) to encourage renewable energy, and (3) to provide distributed generation and storage systems that assist the utility in stabilizing the grid. This would lead to more reliable and less costly energy for the customer, along with reduced greenhouse gas.</AbstractNarration>
