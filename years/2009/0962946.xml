<AbstractNarration>EUROCHAMP (Integration of European Simulation Chambers for Investigating Atmospheric Processes) is holding the Formal Intercomparison of Observations of Nitrous Acid (FIONA) at the EUPHORE chambers in Valencia, Spain, in May 2010, and the investigators have been invited to participate.  Because of its demonstrated high sensitivity and freedom from known interferences, PF-LIF (photofragmentation - laser induced fluorescence) is a particularly desired measurement technique for FIONA.  The investigators plan to attend FIONA under EAGER because of the compressed timeframe prior to deployment for FIONA .  Nitrous acid, HONO, is a critical species in the chemistry of the atmosphere.  It photolyzes rapidly in the near ultraviolet to produce the hydroxyl radical, OH, and nitric oxide, NO.  OH is the primary oxidant in the atmosphere and drives the bulk of atmospheric chemistry; NO, in the presence of volatile organic species, catalyzes the production of OH and thereby ozone.  However, understanding of the behavior of HONO is incomplete.  A key component to better understanding this important molecule is to ensure that the research community can measure it accurately. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a joint effort between the Georgia Institute of Technology, where the HONO instrument exists, and the University of Louisiana at Monroe (ULM).  ULM will contribute a field calibration and validation instrument, and deployment and modeling expertise.  Working in parallel is important for time reasons, given the mid-2010 FIONA date.  The educational impact of collaboration between ULM and GA Tech will allow a highly motivated and self-disciplined undergraduate from ULM to have experience with and access to new technology; to gain exposure to current issues in atmospheric chemistry; and to develop critical thinking skills needed in research.  Interaction with a large research university like Gergia Tech provides access to opportunities that ULM cannot provide.  This student will be expected to contribute to the science. The University of Louisiana at Monroe is located in the Lower Mississippi Delta region which is historically an economically disadvantaged area.  ULM is committed to serving as a gateway to diverse academic studies for citizens of the Lower Mississippi Delta.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Collaborative Research: EAGER--Deployment of a New Photofragmentation Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) Nitrous Acid (HONO) Measurement on FIONA was a collaborative research effort between David Tan at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Anne Case Hanks at the University of Louisiana at Monroe (ULM).     In order to assess current measurement techniques for low levels of nitrous acid in the atmosphere, an intercomparison of nitrous acid (HONO) measurements known as the Formal Intercomparison of Observations of Nitrous Acid (FIONA) was held at the EUPHORE chamber in Valencia, Spain in May of 2010.   HONO photolyzes in the near ultraviolet to produce the hydroxyl radical, OH, and nitric oxide, NO.   It is a critical species in understanding the OH budget in  the atmopshere.      The photofragmentation laser was successfully deployed and data was collected for a variety of conditions.  The PF-LIF was able to resolve low levels (ppt) of HONO at the EURPHORE chambers.   Results and data have been submitted.  One benefit of this project was that it provided undergraduate students from the University of Louisiana at Monroe a research experience.  Two students were able to participate in helping to build the calibration system to reducing data.   This was an invaluable experience for undergraduates who would not necessarily be exposed to research.       Last Modified: 02/23/2012       Submitted by: Anne T Case Hanks]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
