<AbstractNarration>0958790&lt;br/&gt;Romanowski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes acquisition of a broadly tunable femtosecond laser system, which includes an optical parametric oscillator pumped by a titanium-sapphire laser and associated instrumentation. It will enable a broad range of experimental work on the interface of nanotechnology, materials sciences and medicine. This highly advanced instrumentation is prohibitively expensive to be acquired through individual research funding. The requested instrument will be installed in a novel type of a laser beam facility, which will provide open access to the laser beam, and room for multiple experimental installations as required by researchers sharing the research focus on optical spectroscopy and imaging. Research in many areas of chemistry, materials sciences, biology and medicine relies on using light for probing structure and function of individual molecules, their assemblies, and living systems. Increasingly important is understanding of photophysics and photochemistry at the time scale as short as femtoseconds, and in the broad spectral range spanning ultraviolet, visible and near infrared. The shared laser facility is requested by a core user base representing a broad range of research expertise and active projects. When installed, it will accelerate the pace of research in medical diagnosis and intervention, analytical methods for bio-threat agents, solar energy harvesting and conversion, and basic sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The main goal of this project is acquisition of an advanced laser system,  It will enable a broad range of experimental work on the interface of nanotechnology, materials sciences and medicine. This instrumentation is installed in a new facility, specifically prepared to accommodate technical requirements of this installation.  It provides open access to the laser beam, and room for multiple experimental installations required by researchers sharing the research focus on optical spectroscopy and imaging.  Specific applications of this facility span areas as diverse as solar energy conversion, protein biochemistry, and medical diagnostics.       Research in many areas of chemistry, materials sciences, biology and medicine relies on using light for probing structure and function of individual molecules, their assemblies, and living systems. Increasingly important is understanding of photophysics and photochemistry at the time scale as short as femtoseconds, and in the broad spectral range spanning ultraviolet, visible and near infrared.  These phenomena can be studied with great efficiency by using modern laser sources which provide a broadly tunable parameters, such as precisely controlled wavelength (color) of light and duration of individual pulses.         Required sources are often too costly for acquisition through individual research funds.  In response to this challenge this facility is being made available to researchers sharing interest in phenomena initiated by light with subsequent physcial and chemical processes, and in using light for probing structre and function of materials and living systems.  The shared laser facility will accelerate the pace of research in medical diagnosis and intervention, analytical methods for bio-threat agents, solar energy harvesting and conversion, and basic sciences. We envision that not only will this facility add a momentum to individual research projects but will also provide a platform for cross-disciplinary interactions among participating scientists, and new research plans, fundings, and discoveries will follow.    The first and foremost effect of this installation is increased access to shared scientific instruments, and improved quality and scope of research and research training in science and engineering. This increased access is further facilitated through the host of this facility, the BIO5 Institute for Collaborative Research at the University of Arizona. The main impact of this installation will be in the area of strategic goals set forth in the University of Arizona Strategic Plan 2010-2014, which calls for increased efficiency of the research enterprise, particularly in energy sustainability, bioscience &amp; biotechnology, and optics, as well as enhancing education excellence.
