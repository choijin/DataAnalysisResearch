<AbstractNarration>Displine: 21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inquiry-based learning has been a prominent component in education since the days of&lt;br/&gt;Socrates. In more recent times, one of the strongest proponents of this type of learning has been R.L. Moore. In his approach, Moore provided the students with a bare outline of the essentials of some mathematical topic, and the students were required to discover the major results in this topic using only their own creative thoughts. The students, having arrived at proofs of the main facts, would then present the results to their classmates and to Moore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Present-day Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) includes less strict versions of Moore's techniques, which are in direct contrast to the traditional lecture method of instruction. The activities of this project are designed to accomplish several major goals related to IBL. Among these are the necessity to modify the teaching and learning of mathematics in such a way that students gain a deep understanding of the subject matter through their own participation in its discovery and presentation. The method of IBL changes the focus in the classroom from the instructor to the students. It has been found that students in IBL classes, in comparison with their peers in regular mathematics classes, have a deeper knowledge of mathematical structures and a stronger retention of mathematical concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this project is dissemination of IBL mathematics teaching through three summer workshops in different geographical locations. Participants from each workshop come from colleges and universities in the general geographical location of the host institution. The workshops expose the participants to the various components of effective IBL teaching of mathematics. The workshops include model classes, sessions on the creation of materials, film viewings, and presentations by the participants themselves in an IBL setting. As part of the follow-up, current IBL practitioners from the four participating universities establish regular contacts with the workshop participants, including visits to the individual departments. Through this follow-up, additional advice and counsel is provided by those who have already experienced success in IBL teaching. Detailed assessment of the project activities takes place at every stage so that each facet of the planned activities is subjected to careful scrutiny. This includes assessment of the effectiveness of IBL itself as well as the ability of the workshops to communicate to faculty the methods for conducting an IBL class. The ultimate goal is to improve mathematics education by having every undergraduate student experience at least one IBL mathematics class during her or his college career.</AbstractNarration>
