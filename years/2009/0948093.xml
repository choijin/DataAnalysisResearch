<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a high-rate and large-area manufacturing process for a non-toxic barrier coating that can be used in flexible display and other applications.  A flexible single-layer and environmentally-friendly barrier that has both inorganic and organic properties will be used to allow a much thinner barrier to be effective, thus significantly reducing the manufacturing costs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the development of a cost-effective thin film encapsulation technology to enable a wide range of applications such as emerging display, imaging, battery and power generating technologies.  These applications require a flexible, low-cost, and mostly transparent, thin permeation barrier to prevent oxygen and moisture from causing degradation.  In this project, large-area scalability and ability to encapsulate devices made on flexible substrates will be addressed.</AbstractNarration>
