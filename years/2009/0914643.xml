<AbstractNarration>The METALS (Minority Education Through Traveling and Learning in the Sciences) represents a multi-institution collaboration to broaden participation in STEM fields by creating meaningful geoscience experiences among groups typically underrepresented in the geosciences and to motivate these groups to choose academic and career paths in the geosciences. The METALS program aligns four universities with strong field geology programs, an institutional history of emphasizing teaching and mentoring in the geosciences, and a commitment to providing access to college for large populations of underrepresented minorities. A strategic alliance of active geoscience diversity programs at San Francisco State University, the University of Texas at El Paso, the University of New Orleans, and Purdue University is being used to engage minority high school students in experiential learning opportunities through field-based settings. Project activities include: (1) Four 10-day instructional field trips, each for 40 high school students selected from each of the four university regions. The field trips take place in a different region each year: California and the Pacific Coast, the Colorado Plateau and Southwest, the northern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains, and the Gulf Coast. (2) Professor and graduate student-led field seminars and colloquia designed to connect underrepresented students with a deeper understanding of how Earth science processes impact local communities, how place-based understanding of landscapes varies among cultures, and the geological configuration of the U.S. (3) The building of pathways and support systems among the universities, first through students traveling and learning together in the geosciences, and second through social networking and 'virtual' sharing during the academic year resulting in an expanded network of mentor friends and a broader connection to faculty outside their department that will encourage and support student effort throughout their careers. (4) Engagement of minority graduate and undergraduate students in the program through field and research projects that grow out of data collected during the summer programs.  The METALS program is expected to: significantly affect the academic choices of minority students as it relates to their choice of major and course selection in college; promote excitement about geology in a field setting while gaining a mutual respect, interdependence and trust among individuals of different ethnicities; and, strengthen the collaboration and knowledge base among partners toward encouraging diversity in the geosciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ METALS Project Outcomes Report  The overriding goal of the METALS (Minority Education Through Traveling and Learning in the Sciences) program is to increase the likelihood of minority students entering college and choosing academic and career paths in geoscience fields.  Additional goals include improving student perception of geoscience and enabling underrepresented students to realize that Earth science issues have direct impacts on their lives and their communities.  METALS field-based activities are designed to create unique and pivotal experiences for high school students by engaging these students in geoscience learning opportunities in field settings.   Intellectual Merit  Findings from the analysis of program summative data indicate the program does provide a useful model for student engagement.  There is considerable evidence that the METALS team (from San Francisco State University, University of New Orleans, University of Texas at El Paso, and Purdue University) was able to develop, reflect upon, and refine four years of experience in conducting field experiences for minority high school students.  The formation and the model of a collaborative, adaptable, and creative group of committed leaders who are passionate about their field bodes well for successful implementation of similar programs.  Findings show that the METALS partnership was a strong one, and the multi-university character of METALS was also beneficial for high school students and undergraduate and graduate students mentors.   Broader Impacts  A review of the METALS Years 1-4 findings show a distinct pattern of high to moderately high impact on most students in the various cohorts of the program.  Although most students in each cohort were new to the METALS experience, and the locations of the field experience were different each time, there was a remarkable consistency in the general findings from each of the METALS fieldtrips. The project team and the program goals remained relatively constant over the different years of the program and this is likely a factor in why this consistency exists.    Overall, the METALS students experience has been influential towards shaping and shifting student attitudes and orientation toward geoscience, both during and beyond their field experience. Findings also show that METALS is positively linked with bringing many of the students closer to and moving into geoscience related studies and careers.  The engagement expressed by student participants in science and geoscience activities implemented through METALS indicates that the METALS experience has been effective in serving the programÆs goals of increasing student interest in the field of geosciences.
