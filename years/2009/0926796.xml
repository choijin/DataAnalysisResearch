<AbstractNarration>The focus of the research is to develop an understanding of an innovative low temperature synthesis pathway for oxidation resistant aluminide coatings without degradation of alloy steel properties that occurs with high temperature processing. The mechanism that enables the development of a large Al flux at low temperature must be resolved to provide the fundamental understanding that will allow for a robust process control. The Al5Fe2 phase appears to be an important component of the reaction pathway and is characterized by a high lattice defect content.  A quantitative coating growth kinetics analysis will be conducted to confirm the role of the Al5Fe2 phase in enhancing low temperature synthesis. An examination of the stability of the Al5Fe2 phase will allow for an understanding of the defect structure and diffusion kinetics. While the rapid kinetics is an advantage in initial coating synthesis, it is a concern during service since it results in depletion of Al and the loss of oxidation protection.  In order to address the lifetime extension the multicomponent diffusion pathways will be assessed so that a novel kinetic biasing strategy can be employed to develop in-situ diffusion barriers and compliant layers as part of an integrated coating design.&lt;br/&gt;The advancement in the understanding and control of low temperature aluminide coating synthesis reactions resulting from the research will yield a deeper fundamental knowledge of the governing kinetic mechanisms. The introduction of a novel kinetic biasing strategy in order to develop an in-situ diffusion barrier will provide a key missing component that is required in order to implement low temperature synthesis as an effective means to protect alloy steels in energy conversion applications to allow for increased power generation and efficiency. The coating design strategies developed in this research have a general application as a cost effective means to enhancing the resistance of structural materials to degradation under aggressive environments at high temperature. An important component of the project effort will be the education of a graduate student. Further, lecture demonstrations on coating synthesis will be incorporated into outreach programs for high school and incoming undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
