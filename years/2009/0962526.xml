<AbstractNarration>Doctoral candidate Cassandra Workman-Whaler (University of South Florida), with the guidance of Dr. Nancy Y. Romero-Daza, will conduct research on how multiple crises may combine to affect human lives. The particular focus of this project will be on the combined epidemics of water insecurity and HIV/AIDS. These apparently separate crises develop synergy because safe and reliable water is necessary to prevent infections among people with HIV, to grow household gardens to maintain adequate nutrition, and to ensure anti-retroviral drug adherence.  Since women are the ones primarily responsible for the procurement of water, water insecurity impacts their ability to effectively provide care for both healthy and ill family members and, as a result, creates additional work and stress.  Presently, gender considerations are being written into policy and programs throughout southern Africa.  Researchers and policy analysts question the efficacy of these approaches and note the need for a grounded understanding of their impact. This project will address that need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in Lesotho. The researcher will document and analyze the combined impacts of water insecurity and HIV/AIDS on women, as well as women's coping strategies. The researcher will employ a mixed methods approach using both quantitative methods from the field of public health and qualitative methods from the field of anthropology.   The researcher will measure water insecurity and contributing factors such as food insecurity and poverty.  The effects of water insecurity and illness such as HIV will be assessed through surveys, interviews, observations and focus groups.  Finally interviews with people working in development and with local women will explore the efficacy of programs targeted at ameliorating both water insecurity and the effects of HIV/AIDS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is critically important because mutually reinforcing crises are common but are under-theorized by social scientists. The methodology employed in this project offers a holistic approach to this understudied phenomenon.  The research will have policy impacts because access to safe and reliable sources of water is crucial for individuals and families affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Funding this research also supports the education of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research sought to understand how water insecurity, or the lack of adequate and safe water, impacts women and their families in rural Lesotho, Africa.  As families there depend on farming and gardens for food, water is life sustaining.  However, the importance of water goes above and beyond nutrition alone.  Women often generate income by selling their surplus vegetables and using water for home-brewing beer.  Men may earn a living as builders and repairmen and rely on water to fashion the building materials.  Hygiene and protection from water-borne illness depends on reliable access to safe water.  Water is essential for caregiving and household chores, and shortages thus create additional burdens for women.   Using both qualitative and quantitative methods from anthropology and public health, this research assessed household food insecurity, household water insecurity, and household health and how these combined stresses manifest themselves on a depression and anxiety scale.  In addition, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted to discern the challenges faced by Basotho in maintaining their health and that of their families in light of continued drought, the global economic recession, and endemic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.  My focus was capturing womenÆs voices, as they are primarily responsible for maintaining the home, including engaging in water-dependent activities, such as gardening, household chores, and caregiving, and yet they are routinely portrayed as passive victims to social pressures.  In the course of my research I found that men, also, faced pressures and could be marginalized within a community.  Understanding how water insecurity, and all of its effects such as food insecurity and daily stress, affects women and men is important as gender is being written into most international development policies today.    While this research was conducted in three villages in the Lesotho lowlands, this research is relevant to larger anthropological theory regarding international development since gender is being mainstreamed into international development policy, that is, all programs must demonstrate the understanding that women and men may have different social positions and that development programs impact women and men differently.  As such, understanding women and menÆs daily lives and what they would like changed is critical to appropriate and equitable programs.  However, gender mainstreaming is often reduced to focusing on women without understanding that gender is a set of relations between women and men.  In addition, critics of gender mainstreaming assert that not all womenÆs voices are heard equally and that the drafting of policy is not always as democratic as it should be.  As a result, despite best intentions and gender sensitivity, programs can have the unintended effect of reinforcing the status quo resulting in the continued exclusion of some women and men.  Furthermore, how people within a community mobilize around issues that affect them such as funerals or food insecurity is contingent on many factors, the gender and social positions of the participants being particularly salient.  Understanding why people chose to participate or not in community development programs helps mitigate stereotypes about women in the global south as passive victims and also shows how women and men face and respond to a myriad of challenges for themselves and their families.
