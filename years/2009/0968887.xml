<AbstractNarration>I/UCRC for Water Equipment and Policy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0968887 University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee; Erik Christensen &lt;br/&gt;0968844 Marquette University; Michael Switzenbaum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Water Equipment and Policy (WEP) will focus on improving water quality and understanding related technologies.  The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) AND Marquette University (MU) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UWM as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will focus on improving water equipment based on recent advances in materials, sensors, and control hardware/software.  The Center will conduct policy studies including water demand and risk analysis.  A goal is to improve the profitability of water equipment manufacturers and to improve the industry competitiveness and ability to adopt new technology for enhanced economic development.  The five potential research thrust areas that form the basis of WEP include: Advanced Sensor and Control System Technology, Novel Materials, Autonomous Inspection and Repair, Environmental Systems Design, and Regulation, Legislation and Water Policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will stimulate growth and economic development. The teams of researchers from both universities will work with the industrial advisory board to select high priority projects that should benefit society through improved water quality and availability, not only in the Great Lakes region but elsewhere in the US and world.  Underrepresented students will be hired to work on these research projects that are of direct industrial relevance. The PIs plan to work with the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and the National Society of Black Engineers student organizations to attract highly qualified minority students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Growing populations around the world are overwhelming scarce water supplies.  And climate change is making the situation much worse.  The Water Equipment and Policy I/UCRC (WEP) is headquartered in Southeastern Wisconsin, which is home to more than 150 companies serving the water industry.  The WEP I/UCRC has collaborated with the companies in establishing the region as the Western HemisphereÆs leading water technology cluster.  WEP research focuses on creating new sensors and devices, novel materials, innovative water treatment systems, and water policies that will help change the way the world manages its acutely stressed water resources.  As a result, WEP has grown substantially during Phase I.  In addition to retaining 5 of its 6 original founding members WEP added 11 more for a membership totaling 16.   Phase I saw an immense investment in new facilities, labs, and equipment, which attracted more PIs and students to participate in WEP research, and motivated stakeholders to become actively engaged in helping to grow the center.  In 2011 Marquette University (MU) opened its new Engineering Hall with the state-of-the-art Water Quality, Sensors and Nanodevices Labs where WEP PIs pursue research.  In 2013 the Water Council opened the Global Water Center where WEP has offices and research labs.  In 2014 University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) opened its School of Freshwater Sciences (SFS), featuring extensive lab space to support water research.   MU and UWM also invested in four new faculty who have made important contributions to WEP research.  MU hired 2 new tenure-track researchers who successfully competed for 4 WEP funded projects, 1 CORBI, and 1 fundamental research grant.  UWMÆs College of Engineering and Applied Science hired 2 tenure-track faculty members who successfully competed for 3 center-funded projects and 1 fundamental research grant.  Since its opening in 2014, UWMÆs SFS hired 5 faculty members, and two SFS faculty members are serving as WEP PIs.  WEPÆs growth can be attributed to more than the investment in facilities and new tenure-track faculty members.   In 2013 WEP was awarded an Innovative Managing Director (IMD) grant that provided resources to implement the new business plan that included strong marketing initiatives such as creating marketing materials, maintaining a website, writing news articles that appeared in leading trade magazines in the U.S., India, and Central and South America, attending tradeshows, and creating a quarterly newsletter that was distributed to key member prospects and others.  The center also collaborated with members and stakeholders to identify champions within prospective companies and then worked with them to convert decision makers.  This concerted effort resulted in the opening of many prospect doors to hear WEPÆs value propositions.   Throughout Phase I, WEP continued to refine its Technology Roadmap and increased the focus on aligning its core strengths with the areas of research that members believed would result in game changers for their organizations; the creation of new real-time sensors, advanced wastewater and stormwater treatment systems, and new materials for the water industry.  As a result, PIs filed 11 invention disclosures and 5 patent applications, leading to the execution of 10 licensing agreements with member companies.
