<AbstractNarration>Coherent control of chemical reactions has been a driving force in laser physics since the invention of the laser itself.  The group will use this full arsenal of control techniques on molecules to answer basic questions about the interaction of molecules with intense laser fields.  The broadest goal is to understand the transition from molecular to atomic behavior in molecules as a function of internuclear separation.  In addition, over the past several years, an entirely new concept has evolved from studies of molecules in intense laser fields that we call "incoherent" or "dissipative" control.  Unlike traditional coherent control, this new method actually works better at higher temperatures and may lead to methods for controlling chemical reactions at room temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interest in high-harmonic generation (HHG), attosecond physics, and short-pulse x-ray free electron lasers has exploded over the past decade.  However, research in these fields requires huge investments of time and money.  We can study and test many aspects underlying the physics of these processes more quickly and inexpensively at a small University-based lab to support projects at large facilities.  In addition, the experiments require state-of-the-art laser systems, giving students hands-on experience with the latest laser and optical technologies and preparing them for a variety of research-based academic or high-tech industrial career paths.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chemical reactions between molecules and reactions initiated by light are fundamental to all of life.  Apart from human activity, virtually all life is powered by the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy at the cellular level.  This involves a sequence of reactions starting with the absorption of a photon to the conversion of ADP into ATP, for example.  In order to harness solar energy, such reactions must be understood on an ultrafast timescale and at an atomic level.  When a photon is absorbed by a chlorophyll molecules, the first reactions take space within 1 picosecond (one trillionth of a second) and the motion induced by the reactions is around 1 nanometer (one billionth of a meter).  Studying such fast and small events requires novel experimental techniques that have been under development for the last decade.  Central to these efforts have been our ability to manipulate light in ever more sophisticated ways.  Laser pulses as short as 30 femtoseconds are routinely produced and attosecond pulses are being generated in a number of labs around the world.  Moreover, various techniques are being developed to measure the actual molecular orbitals &ndash; the structures in molecules in which the electrons reside.  In our lab, we study the simplest of molecules consisting of two identical atoms (diatomic molecules), such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and iodine, to understand the most basic aspects of the interaction of molecules with light.  Iodine (I2) is particularly interesting as it is the heaviest diatomic molecule and so it moves relatively slowly.  We can gentle pull the molecule apart and study its properties in great detail as a function of the separation of the two atoms.  This motion is really the breaking of the molecular bond and is how all chemical reactions start.  As we probe the molecule as it is coming apart, we find that its behavior at distances 2-3 times its natural bond length is quite different from when the molecule is in its natural state.  The molecule becomes much more susceptible to the absorption of radiation, leading to ionization.  Also, electrons more deeply bound in the molecule become active, leading to excitation of the molecule.  Finally, molecules at this separation are expected to convert light to much shorter wavelength.  Only recently have we been able to study bond breaking in such detail.  A more ambitious goal is to study the molecular orbitals as the molecule comes apart.  The evolution of the orbitals as a function of atomic separation will provide a deeper understanding of how chemical reactions proceed.
