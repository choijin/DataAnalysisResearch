<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support to the University of Kansas experimental particle physics group (KU) to continue studies with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, the D0 experiment at Fermilab's Tevatron, data analysis from the CLEO experiment, efforts on international linear collider (ILC) detectors, using radio detection techniques for high-energy cosmic rays, and performing public outreach. The range of studies by KU form the basis for the high intellectual merit of the program since these studies have the potential to provide a greater understanding of matter and energy at the smallest distance scales and so address some of the most fundamental questions in science. The broader impacts of this proposed activity are also considerable. Graduate students and postdocs will receive extensive training. The group also has a strong record of success in undergraduate research and will continue such involvement. The Quarked!  Project, started by Professor Alice Bean in 2004, as well as the QuarkNet program provide an important outreach focus as will the continuation of the program to disseminate research findings via the Internet with web sites aimed at different communities.</AbstractNarration>

The broader impacts of this proposal were also considerable. Graduate, undergraduate and postdoctoral students received extensive training. The Quarked!TM project was an important outreach focus. A major goal is to get children excited about science by presenting modern physics principles in an engaging way. The website (www.quarked.org) that was launched in February 2006, was further developed and some of the educational games were made available as phone aps. KU has been a part of QuarkNet, a nationwide project to introduce particle physics into the high school classroom, since 2001. Each summer the KU centerÆs activities included a workshop for area high school physics teachers and research experiences for area high school students.                  Three graduate students completed their Ph.D dissertations and a fourth student is nearing his graduation. Two additional graduate students completed Master...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
