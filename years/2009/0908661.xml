<AbstractNarration>Despite efforts at conservation, tropical forests continue to face land conversion, threatening many tropical trees, especially those that are dependent on specialized pollinators for reproduction. The proposed research investigates pollen dispersal patterns for a "buzz-pollinated" tree species.  Buzz-pollination occurs when bees grasp a flower and vibrate pollen free of specialized pores.  Because this mechanism excludes pollen dispersal by exotic honeybees, tracking pollen movement will yield a uniquely powerful indicator of native bee movement.  Native faunal biodiversity and plant gene flow patterns will be examined in undisturbed habitats and in highly fragmented shade coffee plantation habitats and will provide mechanistic insight into the capacity of shade coffee farms to serve as biodiversity refuges and habitat corridors.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As agricultural areas continue to expand, it is critical that the impacts of land management on pollinator communities and pollen dispersal processes are understood.  By focusing on international collaboration, this research strengthens understanding between scientists, students, and managers in the United States and Mexico in order to build local and international leadership in the study of tropical forests and sustainable agroecosystems.  Thus far, this research has provided the opportunity to communicate with coffee farmers about land management, pollination services and erosion control within their farms. As deforestation continues, it is essential to understand how to maintain key ecological processes required by tropical plant and pollinator communities.</AbstractNarration>
