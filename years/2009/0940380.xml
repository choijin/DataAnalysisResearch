Laser spectroscopy of many molecules has been intensively pursued for many years and has led to both scientific breakthroughs (including several Nobel prizes) and important applications in both commercial and defense/security fields. Notwithstanding this progress, a broadly and continuously tunable infrared laser source or sources covering this spectral region has remained elusive. A particularly important spectral region is 3 &ndash; 4 micrometers that covers the absorption bands of the important carbon-hydrogen (C-H) stretch that is a signature of all organic molecules. For remote sensing applications a reasonable level of power is a desirable feature. The detection range is directly related to the available power.     In this project we have developed a novel tunable laser source that: is continuously tunable over a wide range (so far about 30 nm, but over a 100 nm wavelength range has been demonstrated in a slightly different geometry), is high power (a record power of ~ 1 W from a tunable distributed feedback laser), and with a small number of devices is capable of covering the entire 2.5-20 micrometer range.
