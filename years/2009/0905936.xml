<AbstractNarration>Although ethnic minority adolescents face many daunting challenges during their&lt;br/&gt;transition to adulthood, many draw on unique cultural strengths to survive and thrive. Racial&lt;br/&gt;socialization, the process by which parents and other socialization agents give adolescents&lt;br/&gt;race-related messages, is one of the most important of these cultural strengths. The main aim&lt;br/&gt;of this Social and Behavioral Sciences Minority Post-Doctoral Fellowship research and&lt;br/&gt;training activity is to increase understanding of processes associated with the transmission&lt;br/&gt;and receipt of racial socialization messages. The prospective project would draw on the&lt;br/&gt;resources of New York University's Center for Research on Culture, Development and&lt;br/&gt;Education (CRCDE, currently funded by a grant from National Science Foundation). The&lt;br/&gt;center's diverse collection of scholars and focus on mixed methods will allow for the&lt;br/&gt;exploration of both quantitative and qualitative data in the study of the racial socialization&lt;br/&gt;process.&lt;br/&gt;One of the largest unresolved questions about racial socialization concerns how&lt;br/&gt;parent?s messages are communicated to and received by adolescents. Racial socialization&lt;br/&gt;studies have largely used either parent or child reports of racial socialization, a practice that&lt;br/&gt;precludes analysis of the relation between parent and child reports of racial socialization or a&lt;br/&gt;thorough examination of the reasons behind successful communication of messages.&lt;br/&gt;These discrepancies between parent and child reports of racial socialization are&lt;br/&gt;noteworthy and merit further investigation for at least three reasons. First, an understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the discrepancies can be used to help parents to talk to their children about race in ways&lt;br/&gt;that enhance youths' identity and self-esteem. Ineffective communication about race and&lt;br/&gt;ethnicity on the part of parents may undermine the protective functions such communication&lt;br/&gt;is intended to serve. Second, advancement in this literature may help&lt;br/&gt;mental health professionals and community leaders to further refine interventions and social&lt;br/&gt;programs that help parents to talk to their children about race in productive ways. This&lt;br/&gt;research will lead to evidence-based interventions and programs that improve mental health&lt;br/&gt;and academic outcomes for ethnic minority adolescents. Third,&lt;br/&gt;explaining the gap will link the racial socialization literature with a broader socialization&lt;br/&gt;literature that has already grappled with discrepancies between parent and child reports of&lt;br/&gt;socialization.&lt;br/&gt;An initial goal of the proposed research is to explore how parent and adolescent&lt;br/&gt;reports differ on three aspects of racial socialization: messages stressing group differences&lt;br/&gt;and racial bias; messages that teach children about their culture; and messages stressing&lt;br/&gt;distrust between racial groups. The proposed research will also examine how racial&lt;br/&gt;socialization is affected by the broader context of parenting, including parenting style and&lt;br/&gt;family functioning. Finally, the project seeks to broaden understanding of the racial&lt;br/&gt;socialization process by examining the full range of contexts in which race socialization&lt;br/&gt;occurs. Increasing knowledge of the race socialization process will inform interventions that&lt;br/&gt;promote healthy conversations about race between parents and children.&lt;br/&gt;During the time at the CRDCE, the fellow will collaborate with an interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;team of scholars, including many minority researchers. The proposed activity consists of&lt;br/&gt;research projects, seminars, and coursework that will enhance the fellow?s understanding of&lt;br/&gt;ecological and developmental influences on the race socialization process. The fellow will&lt;br/&gt;also enhance his knowledge of research methods by taking courses and consulting with&lt;br/&gt;scholars on qualitative, mixed, and observational methods. The fellowship will also allow for&lt;br/&gt;the potential fellow to work on at least three first authored publications and to work on other&lt;br/&gt;papers at the center. The fellow's time at the center will provide increased preparation for a&lt;br/&gt;tenure track position at a research university.</AbstractNarration>
