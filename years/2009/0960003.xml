<AbstractNarration>0960003&lt;br/&gt;Lofland&lt;br/&gt;Rowan U.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work outlined in this proposal aims to create a multiple user facility for a four-circle x-ray diffractometer. The diffractometer is highly automated, as required for a multi-user facility, particularly when most of the users are undergraduates.  The instrument is capable of small angle x-ray scattering for studying composites and reciprocal space mapping for investigating film epitaxy, and it has a scanning stage for completing combinatorial thin-film studies.  The instrument will allow the advancement of several important research projects including the use of combinatorial techniques to investigate the fundamental chemical/structural/property relationships in MAX phases, an interesting set of compounds with unusual refractory and tribological properties, the determination of the mechanism leading to the degradation of magnetorheological elastomers through repeated use, the optimization of multifunctional oxides by cationic substitutions as well as the functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles for targeted delivery of cancer medications.  These projects, from a wide array of fields, all have potential for significant technological impact.  Additionally the instrumentation also has the potential to enhance the economy of southern New Jersey as it can be used for interfacing with start-ups at the new South Jersey Innovation Center located on the Rowan University campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work outlined in this proposal aims to create a multiple user facility for an x-ray diffractometer.  X-rays have a wavelength near atomic dimensions, allowing one to probe the structure of matter and thus a diffractometer is an indispensable tool in materials research.  With the proposed instrument, one can identify new compounds and their structures, study the morphology and size of nanoparticles, and investigate the surfaces of multilayered films, even if the film is buried. The facility will enhance existing research and educational programs investigating novel materials as well as promote the creation of new interdisciplinary programs, particularly with advent of the newly announced Cooper Medical School of Rowan University.  Support of this acquisition will lead to the development of new materials for various applications such as drug therapies, protective coatings, energy storage, and vibration control.  In addition, this instrument will improve our ability to impact businesses in the region through interactions with companies at the on-campus South Jersey Innovation Center.</AbstractNarration>
