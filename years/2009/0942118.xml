<AbstractNarration>(99) The Teaching Pipeline for STEM project creates, implements, and evaluates two new degree programs to facilitate the entry of many more STEM majors into careers in K-12 teaching. The project describes new minors in science education and mathematics education; degrees designed to complement the deep discipline training that upper division courses provide. The new programs provide 40students/year over three years from the Life and Physical Sciences or Engineering with an opportunity to explore science or math teaching through seminars and internships at local secondary schools. Individual projects in the capstone courses of the minors bring these students into collaboration with UCLA faculty and secondary school science and math professionals, teachers of the discipline. By embedding these interdisciplinary minors within the fabric of the science and mathematics departments, the project increases the visibility and value of teaching careers within the research-intensive university environment. Collaboration with faculty on other campuses with large graduate teacher education programs will establish new and flexible pathways and options for UCLA students to move into credential programs. The evaluation plan uses baseline data collected to evaluate the change in the attitudes towards and the valuing of the K-12 education profession in the natural sciences at a research-intensive university resulting from the infusion of the programs in the departments. The project serves as a national model for increasing the number of highly qualified STEM students who enter teaching careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In "Tipping the Balance to STEM Teaching," UCLA proposed to develop, and seamlessly weave, two new STEM Education-focused minors into the fabric of the undergraduate Science, Mathematics, and Engineering curricula.   The project has accomplished this goal!   Not only have these minors - one in Science and one Mathematics - been developed and implemented, twenty-two students already proudly display diplomas that show both their accomplishments in their STEM major as well as their commitment to explore and often pursue STEM teaching careers.   The integration of the minors into the curriculum is complete.  They are included in the General Catalog along with the 76 other minors offered in the College of Letters and Science.  All the courses for the minors are part of the regular Schedule of Classes.  These new minors, however, have rigorous STEM prerequisites guaranteeing the quality of the students in these  programs.  The Science Education minor requires a breadth of eight courses across Biology, Chemistry, and Physics before students can declare the minor; students applying for the Mathematics for Teaching minor must have completed four courses in mathematics including one upper division course.  The broad involvement of faculty mirrors the breadth of the curricula in the two minors.  Faculty in Mathematics, Life Sciences, Chemistry, Physics, Earth Science, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Physiology, and Physics as well as Education all participate in teaching the courses required for the minors.   As a result of this award, a pathway to a career in STEM teaching is now a viable option for all STEM majors at UCLA.
