<AbstractNarration>0959272&lt;br/&gt;Hayes&lt;br/&gt;Union College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Micro-FTIR and micro-Raman spectrometers will enhance a state-of-the-art Materials and Molecular Characterization Facility at Union College, currently serving the research needs of eight faculty and their students in four science departments and two engineering departments.  These instruments will enhance current projects including using fission track analysis in dating geological samples, polymer nanocomposites for photovoltaic application, identification of environmental pollutants in aerosol samples, sorption and photochemistry of environmental contaminants, thermodynamics of nanoscale confined systems, nanomaterials characterization, and art conservation research. Micro-Raman and micro-FTIR are complementary instruments and in combination will broaden the capabilities of our characterization lab to allow for molecular and structural characterization of samples.  Noninvasive capability of the micro-Raman system along with its long working distance will be especially helpful to several of these research projects.  In addition, the acquisition of these instruments will support Union's long-standing commitment to incorporate research as an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum and to develop innovative, multidisciplinary teaching and research opportunities through state-of-the-art instrumentation. These instruments will be integrated into individual student faculty projects and classroom laboratory training to enrich the research experience of our undergraduates.  They will also be used during our open house workshops designed to showcase modern characterization instruments for local high school students and their teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials characterization is important in many areas of engineering and scientific research.  Researchers in materials characterization use a variety of instruments and laboratory measurement methods to learn about the elemental and molecular make up, and the composition of the samples they are investigating.  This information not only helps with the understanding of how the materials were formed, but also their function and behavior.  The micro-Raman and micro-FTIR instruments are two of the most versatile and most commonly used instruments for micro characterization.  Researchers at Union College will use these tools to further their analysis of geological samples and environmental pollutants, characterize nanomaterials in polymer nanocomposites for photovoltaic applications as well as nanoscale confined systems,  and aid with identification of pigment and binders in art conservation research. The acquisition of these instruments will support Union's long-standing commitment to incorporate research as an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum and to develop innovative, multidisciplinary teaching and research opportunities through state-of-the-art instrumentation. These instruments will be integrated into individual student faculty projects and classroom laboratory training to enrich the research experience of our undergraduates.  They will also be used during our open house workshops designed to showcase modern characterization instruments for local high school students and their teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two analytical spectrometers were acquired with this funding: a micro-Raman and a micro FTIR.  These instruments enhance the analytical capabilities of our Materials and Molecular Characterization Laboratory at Union College, which is widely used by students, faculty, and collaborating researchers for research and teaching in STEM fields.   The micro-Raman is best suited for study of inorganic material (minerals, crystalline solids, paint, etc.), while the micro-FTIR can also be used with characterizations of organic materials.  These instruments are shared by faculty and students from Biology, Chemistry, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Physics for their research.  In addition, collaborating researchers from nearby universities and institutions have regular access to these spectrometer systems. The instruments are also used for instruction in advanced laboratory courses in Chemistry and Geology as well as for outreach events designed to motivate high school students, especially those belonging to under-represented groups, to enter into STEM fields.  The research projects that were investigated with the help of these instruments ranged from fundamental sciences to practical applications in technology, to environmental studies, and to the preservation of cultural heritage.  The micro-Raman was used to measure and quantify radiation damage caused by radioactive elements present in the crystals of zircon, which is an accessory mineral in many rocks.  This novel and on-going research aims to use radiation damage as a method of dating minerals and further refine dating techniques used in studies of basins.  The instruments are used to evelop the next generation of solar cells that are made of unique compounds.   Our research group comprised of several faculty from three different departments used the micro-FTIR and the micro-Raman to characterize these next generation solar cells composed of organic-inorganic materials.  Our work has also been focussed on preserving art in America. One research group is using the micro-Raman to understand the specific composition of mortar used in the construction of a historic New York State house revealed the identification of the pigments in the mortar and the cause of its color change from red to black.   This work is related to restoration efforts.                   Last Modified: 06/04/2013       Submitted by: John I Garver]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
