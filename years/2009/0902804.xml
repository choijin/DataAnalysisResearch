<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation is constantly striving to more fully document the impact that I/UCRCs have on the development of technological breakthroughs, technology transfer and commercialization.  Previous compendia have been used by the I/UCRC program to demonstrate the scope of high quality, industrially relevant research outcomes produced by the program.  The proposed project will gather, organize, catalogue and illustrate noteworthy program-related technological breakthroughs that have resulted from I/UCRC research and subsequent technology transfer activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deliverables from the proposed project would make it easier for policy makers and researchers to access breakthrough descriptions from all I/UCRC scientific areas.  Deliverables will also be useful as marketing tools for informing industry and the scientific community of the benefits of such programs, and could pave the way for studies of economic impacts of cooperative research.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
