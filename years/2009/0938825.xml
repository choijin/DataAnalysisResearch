<AbstractNarration>The search for gravitational waves from astrophysical sources will be refined through the vigorous work of hundreds of scientists from around the world as part of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC). Working along side their European colleagues, data from both the LIGO and VIRGO interferometers is being analyzed in the search for these first signals. The search for gravitational waves has become a worldwide effort. It is expected that scientists will be in constant communications with each other as they engage in numerous working meetings to be scheduled regularly in the United States and Europe. A concerted effort is being made to provide an effective means for remote participation in meetings and other collaboration activities within the LSC without actually having to travel to the physical location. As technology for conducting high quality teleconferencing, the Enabling Virtual Organizations (EVO) service will continue to be used and improved upon, leveraging its original development for use in the high energy physics collaborations around the world and improving its value to high energy physics and to other large and small collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of EVO for audio and video teleconferencing is becoming a substantial enabling technology around the world for the LSC. Support and continued development of remote participation technology will be contributed to the EVO architectural framework by activities carried forward by this award. Effective and beneficial use of the EVO services will be assured for the LSC through the addition of new members to the EVO development team. EVO software and network development, as well as LIGO/LSC user support, will be advanced using guidance that will be provided by LIGO and the LSC collaborators. Small groups, students, those with limited travel funds and others with difficulty travelling will be enfranchised to fully participate in important discussions and presentations by providing remote access to LSC meetings and events.  Strong international relationships will be promoted by lowering the barriers for bringing together scientists and their work from around the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO[1]) and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC[2]), along with international partners Virgo[3] and Kagra[4], consist of over one thousand scientists, engineers, post-docs, students and staff, spread out around the globe, that are in pursuit of the direct detection of gravitational waves associated with the most energetic events in the universe, as predicted by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity in 1915, nearly a century ago.

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics[5] was awarded for discovery of the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar that suggests gravitational waves are carrying away energy as predicted by general relativity.

Orchestration of these efforts and maximization of the scientific knowledge being extracted from the data collected at the observatories around the globe has demanded the ability to remotely participate in meetings, sharing knowledge with rich communication content without the burden of constantly having travel around the country or globe to collaborate on a common scientific mission.  The Internet technology EVO[6] (Enabling Virtual Organizations), having demonstrated extensive use in other large scientific collaborations, e.g., CERN[7] and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC[8]) experiments, was adopted by the gravitational wave collaborations as a technology to enable the remote participation experience needed to develop a culture of working together from all corners of the globe on very complex challenges associated with the pursuit of the first direct detection of gravitational waves.

Performance was also addressed on many fronts during this award. The basic audio and video quality was improved bringing new codecs for smoother communications between clients. The user interface was reworked from the existing Koala client user interface, which had multiple windows that users had to manipulate, to a newer SeeVogh client that combined features into a single, user-friendlier interface. Dedicated support staff identified common pitfalls and used this experience to improve online documentation, enhance debug features built into the client and guide the advancement of the software and system architecture.
