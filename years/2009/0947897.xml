<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of this exploratory project is the design, synthesis and functional characterization of a new class of nanostructured materials ? block copolymer supramolecular assemblies. The major aspects to be addressed in this study are: i) donor-acceptor interactions in supramolecular assemblies; ii) distribution of the components in the assemblies and at the interfaces; iii) the effect of nanoscopic confinement of electroluminescent additives on their optoelectronic properties; iv) the benefits and limitations of electroluminescent supramolecular assemblies for OLEDs, solar cells, and other energy harvesting and conversion applications. This project will include cooperative efforts in (a) synthesis of efficient electroluminescent additives and (b) characterization of donor-acceptor assemblies aiming (c) development and optimization of novel materials for efficient energy conversion and energy harvesting. Upon completion of this research project, the fundamental knowledge of the sequence molecular structure - mesoscale organization - optoelectronic properties - of this new material will be gained. This knowledge will be applied toward a range of important applications of the donor-acceptor block copolymer assemblies in the emerging fields of renewable energy harvesting and efficient energy conversion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is directed towards the rational design of novel class of nanostructured polymeric materials. These materials can open a venue to technical innovations in flexible electronics, large area displays, efficient plastic solar cells, energy conservation. Therefore, highly efficient technologies based on this approach are extremely beneficial to society as they aid to conserve natural resources. The project stipulates strong collaboration with scientists at the National Institute of Standards.  The educational component is closely tied to research objectives. The students of both undergraduate and graduate levels will be involved in the project, thus gaining experience and knowledge of the modern instrumentation and techniques in diverse areas of materials science, chemistry, and nanotechnology in an intellectually stimulating research environment.</AbstractNarration>
