<AbstractNarration>The observations obtained during the CLIVAR MODE Water experiment (CLIMODE) suggest that a significant fraction of Eighteen Degree Water (EDW) formation occurs within the eastward-flowing, separated Gulf Stream (GS). This is because water entering the formation area near 70 degree West under the North Atlantic storm track has warm temperatures, relatively high salinity, high potential vorticity (PV) and low percent oxygen saturation in the EDW source waters, while EDW exiting the region near 50 degree West has lower temperatures, salinity &amp; PV, and higher oxygen saturation. All of the water being discussed is found within the 100 km anticyclonic region just to the south of the maximum downstream Gulf Stream flow. Estimates that 50%-90% of the needed amount of new EDW is formed within this frontal region indicate that a new paradigm of EDW formation may be needed: one that departs significantly from the quasi-one dimensional ideas of purely diabatic formation in the Northern Sargasso Sea and that involves diabatic and wind stress-driven production of new EDW within the Gulf Stream frontal region and vigorous cross-frontal mixing and freshening of the water column associated with sub-mesoscale instabilities and shear dispersion by near inertial waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study proposes to examine the robustness of these results through innovative analyses of the observations available from CLIMODE combined with sub-mesoscale resolving numerical simulations nested within the global, eddy-resolving hybrid coordinate ocean model (HYCOM) run with assimilation. In particular this project will investigate the importance of sub-mesocale motions and frontal dynamics on the large-scale budgets of PV and salinity as they relate to EDW formation in the proximity of the GS. Additional case studies will be examined of EDW production during the winters of 2006 and 2007 using extensive shipboard observations, subsurface profiling float measurements, and nested model simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of intellectual merit, this project will critically examine the importance to EDW formation of frontal-scale processes with active submesocale instabilities and mixing driven by inertial shear dispersion. While there is emerging evidence that strong episodic heat and buoyancy exchange occurs over the wintertime Gulf Stream and that background oceanic vorticity may be an essential element in the new mode water formation, the role of the stress driven formation process remains an open question which will be evaluated using both existing data and numerical simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, if this new paradigm is valid, sub-tropical mode water formation, which is invariably tied to the flanks of strong zonal flows, cannot be adequately understood in coarse, Complex climate models that do not properly resolve or parameterize these frontal dynamics. This research project has a high potential to contribute to fundamental new ways of parameterizing air-sea coupling in regions of strong oceanic fronts. The investigators on this project are all members of academic institutions with strong graduate programs in environmental sciences and one graduate student and a post-doc will be trained and mentored as part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a contribution to the U.S. CLIVAR (CLImate VARiability and predictability) program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  The subtropical mode water of the North Atlantic, known as ``18-degree water," has been observed in the Sargasso Sea for many years, but it's formation process has been the subject of some debate. At a basic level, a mode water is nearly always the remnant of deep wintertime mixed layers, but the extent to which the details of the mixed-layer formation process (\emph{i.e.}, wind mixing \emph{vs.} buoyancy loss) or the strong shear and vorticity of a boundary current like the Gulf Stream influence the properties of the resulting watermass have not been extensively studied until now.  The NSF CLIVAR Mode Water experiment (CLIMODE) was conceived to directly observe the wintertime formation of mode water and learn about theprocesses responsible, both in the Sargasso Sea and in the Gulf Stream proper. Identification and quantification of these processes can be used to bothvalidate and improve numerical models of the ocean and atmosphere, leading to greater confidence in circulation and heat transport estimates(important components of models used for climate change forecasting).  The grant described in this report dealt with the analysis of subsurface profiling float observations of shear and stratification at internal wave scales that were collected during the winter 2007 field experiment. These measurements targeted subsurface mixing processes and advective fluxes and their influence on mode water formation.  Outcomes  The detailed measurements of subsurface velocity, shear, stratification, and watermass properties in the CLIMODE experiment represent a new window on the process of mode water formation. Though only two EM-APEX profiling floats were used, they were able to sample the Gulf Stream's mixed layer deepening and near-inertial response to atmospheric forcing in unprecedented detail, even when the shipboard observations were unable to proceed. A major focus of this work has been on the properties of near-inertial waves (NIW) observed in the CLIMODE region by multiple platforms. Principal conclusions about these waves include the following:   (1) These waves are forced by the rapid and frequent storms passing over the region but are also affected by the strong vorticity structures of the Gulf Stream and eddies.  (2) Satellite-tracked surface drifters appear to show stronger mixed-layer oscillations associated with anticyclonic vorticity, but the noise characteristics of the drifters makes a robust relationship difficult to determine.  (3) The elevated shear of the downward-propagating waves appears to be responsible for the enhanced dissipation and mixing within and below the Gulf Stream, as assessed by comparisons between microstructure measurements and profiling float (EM-APEX) shear observations.  (4) Effective lateral diffusivity by shear dispersion, on the other hand, is much smaller than initially estimated.
