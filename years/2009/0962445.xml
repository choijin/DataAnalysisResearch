<AbstractNarration>This action funds renewed support for the Board of Life Sciences (BLS) at the National Academy of Sciences.  The BLS serves as the National Academies' focal point for a wide range of scientific, technical and policy topics in the life sciences, including infrastructure, bioterrorism, genomics, biodiversity conservation, and key topics in basic biological and biomedical research. It organizes and oversees studies that provide advice to government and the scientific community on the biological sciences and their impact on society. Further, it maintains expertise in and understanding of the full spectrum of life science disciplines, from molecular genetics to ecology. This enables it to deal with issues of both basic science (e.g., knowledge gaps, research priorities, needed investments) and the higher level policy concerns that flow from or build on the basic science. The Board also oversees important studies on the improvement of biology education, particularly at the undergraduate level, and the maintenance of a strong life sciences workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Board on Life Sciences (BLS) serves as the National Academy of Sciences' focal point for a wide range of topics in the life sciences, including genomics, biodiversity conservation, bioterrorism, and key topics in basic biomedical research, such as stem cells. The board organizes and oversees studies that provide advice to government and the scientific community on the biological sciences and their impact on society as well as important studies on the improvement of biology education and the maintenance of a robust life sciences workforce. BLSÆs work is carried out by National Academies staff who organize expert committees, guide the conduct of studies and the production of reports, and help generate project ideas. The staff work under the oversight of the Board, which defines program direction, advises on topics for studies, and oversees studies and other projects.  Over the past decade, BLS has produced a number of "high impact" studies. Some of these resulted in the establishment of a new funding program or an amplification or shift in direction of an existing one; produced organizational or other changes in a funding agency; highlighted new areas of research or important issues that subsequently received greater emphasis; or established new policies that were adhered to by the scientific community or by funding agencies. Many of our high impact reports addressed topics recommended by members of the Board, who are appointed to serve in this capacity for their in-depth understanding of scientific frontiers and other topics that are ripe for exploration.  Broader Impacts of Core Support to the Board on Life Sciences  As noted above, the impact of National AcademiesÆ studies can be substantial.  Studies prepared specifically for NSF by BLS helped persuade the Congress to initiate funding for the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), provided two successive five year plans for the National Plant Genome Initiative, and inspired NSF investments in new areas, such as metagenomics and theoretical research. It must be understood that BLSÆs ability to produce valuable and timely studies to assist NSF would be greatly hampered in the absence of NSF's support to BLS through core funding.   Intellectual Merit   Past BLS reports have provided impetus for the initiation of new science projects (e.g., the human genome), new fields of science (metagenomics), and new ways of teaching science (BIO 2010) and have reinforced the value of new facilities and infrastructure (e.g., NEON). Core funding from NSF helps allow the Board to plan and execute studies to assist the Foundation with program planning, analysis, and assessment. The potential intellectual merit that arises from NSF's core funding is substantial, not only for NSF itself, but also for the large number of life science subdisciplines that form NSF BIOÆs natural constituencies.
