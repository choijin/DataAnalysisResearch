<AbstractNarration>Miami University (Ohio) is awarded a grant from the Faculty Early Career Development program (CAREER) for the development of algorithms related to the automatic annotation of transposable elements, as well as the analysis of the results to expand our understanding of the roll of neutral substitution rates and other processes in the evolutionary history of animal and plant genomes. Transposable elements are pervasive across the genomes of higher order organisms and are a fundamental force behind genomic evolution.  They are also are one of the key data sources for studying evolutionary processes at the genomic level.  But while effective algorithmic methods exist for the identification of transposable elements that have retained sufficient sequence similarity to their progenitor, the capability of these methods quickly diminishes when searching for transposable elements that have experienced a higher level of sequence decay due to age or presence in more evolutionary volatile genomic regions.   The key research results of this study will include 1) the mathematical formulation and implementation of an algorithm underlying a comprehensive de novo generation of transposable element libraries, 2) a fast, sensitive search tool for transposable elements based on that library, 3) a model of transposable element domain structure leading to the improvement of transposable element discovery, 4) an improved understanding of mammalian neutral substitution rates from a transposable element based analysis, and 5) adaptation of the same methodology of neutral substitution rate analysis to plant genomes and a comprehensive study of rate variation in plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will also provide an opportunity to develop aspects of a comprehensive bioinformatics program using the proposed research as the background for the introduction of new students into the field.  In addition to using the problem of transposable element annotation as the basis for an introductory programming class targeted towards undergraduate biologists, an online Bioinformatics course will be developed and implemented with the goal of allowing the remote teaching of the subject at schools without the resources to maintain their own program.  To this end, we will specifically target Berea College, an institution exclusively serving economically disadvantaged students, developing a bioinformatics module to be incorporated into certain courses and an annual workshop designed to expose their students to the field.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals behind this grant were oriented around the discovery and analysis of genomic transposable elements with an interest in furthering our understanding of the human and other genomes.  Specifically, we focused on (1) the development of software tools to allow for the identification of transposable elements without need of laboratory procedures, and (2) understanding the role of transposable elements in genome structure and evaluation to help us better understand how the genome works.  To this end we:  (1) Developed a new software tools phRAIDER, for the de novo identification of transposable elements in genomic sequences (meaning: finding them when no information is known about the genome past its sequence content).  phRAIDER results are of roughly the same quality as other tools, with a runtime that is orders of magnitude faster &ndash; making it the only tool that can be used on a whole genome in a reasonable amount of time. For further discussion, see the paper Schaeffer et al., "phRAIDER: Pattern-Hunter Based Rapid Ab Initio Detection of Elementary Repeats", ISMB (2016).  (2) Developed a software tool for library-based transposable element identification.  That is, a tool that can take preliminary information about transposable elements (e.g. the output of phRAIDER) and preform a more comprehensive search.   (3) Developed a set of tools for the estimation local neutral substitution rates based on transposable element of data.  That is: a method for determining how fast evolutionary neutral DNA changes in different parts of a genome, providing a baseline for find functional DNA (DNA that is changing more slowly, or quickly, than is expected &ndash; presumably for some biological reason).   (4) Established the existence of strand-asymmetry instability.  It has already been established that certain genes are subjected to strand-asymmetric pressure: different types of base mutations on the different strands are not changing at the same rate.  We have identified genes where this does not appear to have been a constant: at some point in the past they either lost or gained their strand-asymmetric properties &ndash; for presumably interesting biological reasons we are still trying to identify.  (5) Created curriculums for various courses with the goal of training students in the field of bioinformatics. This included a traditional class titled "Programming for the Life Sciences" &ndash; introducing biology majors to programming concepts in the context of use of a biology career, and an online course entitled "Computational Genomics" &ndash; introducing advanced undergraduate computer science majors to the field of Bioinformatics.   All software produced as part of this project is open source and freely available to researchers who could benefit from them.
