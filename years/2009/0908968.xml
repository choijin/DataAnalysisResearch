<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year continuing award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Rice University, entitled, "RET Site: Nanotechnology Research Experience for Teachers", under the direction of Dr. Vicki Colvin. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this RET in Engineering Program include enhancing the science and engineering content knowledge and teaching skills of 35 Houston, Texas high school teachers each year for three years. The site will combine a full semester spring content course (CHEM 570) and summer internship, followed by a set of school year activities to keep participants engaged with each other and with Rice University. The participants will improve the quality of secondary school science education through the development of inquiry-based learning activities based on laboratory research and create a community of high school and higher education teachers that can motivate secondary students towards careers in science and engineering. The program is designed not only to facilitate teacher professional development but to scale-up the research experience by forming a network of master teachers that can train new teachers.  Since the innovative developments at the nanoscale are integrated across biology, physics and chemistry, this program will provide teachers with new insights on basic science that is also well-aligned with Texas State standards and targets underserved teachers and schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rice University will work closely with the Houston Independent School District (HISD), a large, urban, majority historically underrepresented minority school district in South Texas.  This year long RET is designed to be scalable to have a large impact on science teaching via community workshops for students and teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Rice University Nanotechnology Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program aimed to impact science education by enhancing teachersÃ† science and engineering content knowledge and pedagogical skills through innovative and engaging summer research internships and yearlong activities.  The distinctive program design consists of essential elements that maximize the impact to the participating teacherÃ†s community.  The following opportunities were provided to RET participants.  A 4 to 6 week summer research experience in a Rice laboratory learning about nanotechnology and other related scientific disciplines.  Mentorship supported by Rice faculty, postdoc, or graduate student throughout the internship.   Yearlong teacher professional development courses which included secondary (Biology, Chemistry, Physics) and elementary science. Participation at the Rice Quantum Institute Poster Symposium to present summer research as well as other professional conferences. Involvement and engagement in various activities during the school year including Rice lectures, outreach events, and interactions with peer teachers in the training courses.   Tours at Houston companies such as Baker Hughes, LyondellBassell, NASA Johnson Space Center, Schlumberger Technologies, and South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company.     As a result, the unique amalgamation of activities provided participants exposure to research infused with inquiry-based approaches to learning that were the building blocks of lessons that could be implemented in the classroom.  These lessons were developed and honed collaboratively in weekly RET group meetings and ultimately shared to peer teachers and their school districts, and widely disseminated at Rice University and conferences.   The 2010-2013 RET program concluded with 33 participating secondary and elementary teachers originating from 9 school districts in addition to private and charter schools in the Houston area.  The student impact generated from this program is immense and incalculable as one teacher can affect so many students in a year in addition to the many other educators who were enriched along the path.  As one can imagine, the cultivation of a class of motivated and learned students starts from a single teacher.      This experience has excited me about teaching!  -2012 RET Participant     Saw how the disciplines of science intertwine and depend on each other.    -2011 RET Participant     Our participant's enthusiasm was contagious and it was also very rewarding to see a lesson plan materialize out of work we'd been doing in the lab.  It was nice to have a creative experience that grew out of the research.  -2010 RET Lab Mentor                                                                   Last Modified: 11/10/2014       Submitted by: Carolyn A Nichol]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
