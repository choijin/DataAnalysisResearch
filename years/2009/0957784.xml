<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Lingjun Li at the University of Wisconsin-Madison seeks to develop sensitive and versatile approaches to assessing the neurochemical response to environmental stress.  Probes include mass spectrometric imaging and capillary electrophoresis, with novel tagging reagents and improved bioinformatics software. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tools will have broad applicability to analysis of biochemical and peptidergic signaling in nervous systems.  Insights gained should lead to better understanding of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanisms involved in adapting to environmental stress, a process that is highly conserved among all living organisms to maintain their survival in the face of both externally and internally generated stimuli.  In simple terms, the long-term aim is better understanding of the detailed functioning of nervous systems.  The tools will be promulgated rapidly to the neuroscience community through long-term and active collaborations with biologists in the field.  Collaboration with industrial partners will also facilitate both improvement and promulgation of the CE-MS interface design.  A large group of graduate and undergraduate students with diverse background (including many women scientists) is actively engaged.  A partnership with the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) provides opportunities to host and mentor high school students during summer research internships.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF sponsored project aimed to develop novel analytical chemistry tools that enable an improved measurement of important signaling molecules such as neuropeptides and neurotransmitters with enhanced spatial and temporal information.  Significant changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature fluctuation and salinity changes, pose an obvious physiological challenge to marine animals.  There is a great deal of interest in understanding the underlying molecular mechanism which regulates these stress-induced responses.  As an essential class of molecular regulators of various physiological processes, neuropeptide are believed to play a key role.  Given the extreme chemical complexity of neuropeptides and their minute quantities in the nervous system, new analytical tools are needed to determine the spatial distribution, dynamic secretion and quantitative changes of these low-abundance signaling molecules in vivo upon environmental perturbations.  Professor Lingjun Li and her research team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison developed several innovative mass spectrometry (MS)-based comparative peptidomic strategies to investigate the problem under the NSF support.  Specifically, she and her team developed mass spectral imaging techniques to map the co-localization patterns of neuropeptide isoforms in response to environmental stress.  Furthermore, they developed novel interface of microscale separation coupled to MS detection and imaging for enhanced neuropeptide detection.   In terms of the intellectual merit of the project outome, this study enabled new technological advancements that would have broad applicability to the large-scale analysis of biochemical and peptidergic signaling in many nervous systems, including humans.  The molecular insights gained from probing neurochemistry in response to stress could lead to a better understanding of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanisms involved in adapting to environmental stress, a process that is highly conserved among all living organisms to maintain their survival in the face of both externally and internally generated "stimuli".  The project outcomes will have impact on both analytical chemistry and neuroscience research fields.  In terms of the broader impact of the project outcome, besides the technological and scientific impact in related fields, the project enables directly translating analytical tool development to neuroscience applications.  More importantly, the project provided unprecedented training opportunities for a large cohort of graduate students, undergraduate researches and high school students who are interested in pursuing an exciting research career at the interface of neuroscience and chemistry.  A diverse group of students including many women scientists have participated in various aspects of this NSF sponsored project and many of them have launched their own independent career following the critical training received while working on the project. It is satisfying and rewarding to observe the positive outcomes of in training and developing workforce besides advancing basic science knowledge and enabling tool development.
