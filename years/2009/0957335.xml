<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Mostafa El Sayed of Georgia Institute of Technology. Prof. El Sayed's research program focuses on the development of plasmonic nanocatalysts, a new generation of materials at the frontier of the field of chemical catalysis. Prof. El Sayed and his students will examine the effects of two new properties of nanoparticles on the rates of chemical and photo-chemical reactions: 1) the cage effect on the rates of chemical reactions when they occur inside a nano-cage and nano-frame type nanoparticle; 2) the effect of plasmonic fields and other properties of nanogold on the rates of some chemical and photochemical reactions. The project will provide excellent educational opportunity for trainees desiring to work at the forefront of catalysis research.</AbstractNarration>

We feel that this outreach is an important part of inspiring the next generation of scientists.     During the previous 3 years of the support, we have carried out research work in five different directions:  1) Synthesizing novel hollow nanoparticles including single and double shells as well as semiconductor-metallic hybrid nanoparticles.  2) Studying the nanocatalysis inside the hollow nanocatalysts and elucidation of the cage effect.  3) Studying the relationship between the electrodynamics of the semiconductor-metallic hybrid materials and their photocatalytic activity.  4) Studying the effect of Langmuir-Blodgett monolayer assembling on the optical dynamics of the semiconductor nanoparticles.  5) Controlling the mechanism of the electron transfer redox reaction by the metallic nanoparticles.  Below are detail descriptions of our findings in the past support.           Last Modified: 05/30/2013       Submitted by: Mostafa A El-Sayed]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
