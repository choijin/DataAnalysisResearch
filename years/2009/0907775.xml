<AbstractNarration>Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (University of Georgia) proposes to support technical services on R/V Savannah, a 92? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  They will provide a technician on most cruises to maintain and assist scientists in the use of shared-use instrumentation at sea.  The technical services group will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.</AbstractNarration>

Typical research projects included those to examine factors that influence the rates of benthic primary production in the South Atlantic Bight, to assess microbial and zooplankton diversity and productivity in environments ranging from coastal estuaries to the Gulf Stream, to examine biogeochemical dynamics, to support fisheries research, and to support a variety of educational programs, including a graduate education program for coastal ocean-science and engineering.
