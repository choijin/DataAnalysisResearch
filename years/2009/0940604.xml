<AbstractNarration>Citizen Schools proposes to engage 5,700 disadvantaged middle school students in hands-on computing and related STEM projects across its 7-state network of after-school and extended learning programs. By working side-by-side with professionals and graduate students from information technology and other scientific fields, middle school students will realize a connection between their after-school computing apprenticeships and the college and career opportunities to which they can aspire. In the 11-week apprenticeship courses offered within existing Citizen Schools after-school programs, middle school students will create authentic projects that develop a combination of hard and soft skills. Students will build relationships with the adult volunteers who will lead their apprenticeship courses, and these volunteers will speak credibly to students, sharing with them career opportunities in the computing and STEM fields and discussing the academic preparation necessary to pursue them. As a result, disadvantaged middle school students will be more likely to enroll in challenging courses when they enter high school, to better prepare for college, and ultimately to pursue careers in computing and other scientific fields. The project will include four types of apprenticeships: Programming in Computer Game Design, Programming in Robotics, Web Design and Web Related Projects, and Apprenticeships in Astronomy, Solar Energy, Biotechnology, Engineering, and other STEM fields. The project will be evaluated based on pre-post assessments of students? interest in pursuing computing and STEM careers, their understanding of the educational requirements for entry and advancement in those fields, and their sense of efficacy in their ability to attain college admission and career opportunity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In February of 2010, the National Science Foundation awarded a $1,000,000, three-year grant to Citizen Schools in support of the After-School Computing Apprenticeships Project, to engage disadvantaged students in computing and related STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) hands-on learning activities.  More specifically, with support from the NSF, Citizen Schools:   Expanded apprenticeships in computing fields. Organized field trips and events that expose students to professionals in computing and technology. Built partnerships with corporations and volunteer professionals in computing fields. Shared successful approaches and best practices on local, regional, and national levels.    Citizen Schools exceeded our goals for computing related apprenticeships in all three years of the grant period, including in Year 3 when we had 126 computing apprenticeships vs. a goal of 120. In the combined three years of the project, Citizen Schools offered 305 apprenticeships in computer programming, including game design, robotics, and web design, well exceeding our goal of 240. 4,270 students participated in computer programming apprenticeships in the three years of this project (vs. goal of 3,360).

Because each student participates in four apprenticeships a year (two each semester), the majority of Citizen Schools students experienced at least one computing or related STEM apprenticeship each year.  Citizen SchoolsÆ Expanded Learning Time (ELT) program extends the learning day for all students in a grade by more than 30% with an integrated program of education and youth development staffed by a "second shift" of staff and volunteers. The model includes three primary elements: (1) weekly, semester-long apprenticeships, hands-on courses led by community volunteers in which students explore new fields and careers; (2) daily academic support, homework time and staff-led, standards-aligned lessons in English Language Arts and math; and (3) weekly College to Career Connections, a combination of college visits and a research-based curriculum.

Students learn how to apply the design process to identify objects (agents) and interactions (operations). The apprenticeship also introduces students to computational thinking, including basic object interaction, stacks, creating object instances, algorithmic thinking, and message sending. For their "WOW!" presentation event, students demonstrate Frogger before a live audience and provide attendees the opportunity to play the game. In light of the inspiration and achievement gaps in science and technology fields, the need for a different approach to STEM education is clear.
