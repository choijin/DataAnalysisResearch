<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Narayan Hosmane of Northern Illinois University will develop ways to integrate metallacarborane chemistry into a variety of materials.  Carboranes are clusters of boron and carbon atoms, and metallacarboranes are formed when the carborane is bonded to a metal ion.  When carboranes and metallacarboranes are bonded to supports, the resulting materials could have novel therapeutic, heavy metal remediation or radiation shielding properties.  Additionally, the PI will investigate the chemistry of boron nanotubes, a counterpart to the more widely studied single walled carbon nanotubes.  During this project, undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral research scholars will be trained in synthetic chemistry and materials science.</AbstractNarration>
