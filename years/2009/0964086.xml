<AbstractNarration>Detection, identification, and tracking of CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive) plumes can be accomplished by combining the modalities of sensor and cyber networks. The sensor network provides information about physical-space activities, e.g., locations and movements of the plume sources. The cyber network provides storage and computational resources to analyze and infer where the plume originated, the trajectory of its movement, and the prediction of its future movement. The challenges in realizing such a sensor cyber network include intelligent sensing (intelligent sensor selection and coverage) and the capability to deal with uncertainties (uncertainty in measurement as well as in modeling). This project proposes to leverage the convergence between the sensor and the cyber networks to achieve these goals. In particular, the plan is to carry out three synergistic research tasks: 1) network formation by sensor selection, placement, and coverage; 2) sensor tasking protocol with temporal/spatial uncertainty management; 3) protocols for reliable sensor-cyber communication supporting the above two tasks. The PIs will prototype the research results and integrate the prototypes for different components to build the sensor cyber network for plume detection, identification and tracking. They will also evaluate the sensor cyber network using various test scenarios in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Lab. If successful, the project will provide technology for building detection and tracking sensor networks that can give great protection to people and the environment against harmful plumes.</AbstractNarration>

The research results were presented in major journals and international conferences in networking and the project trained two graduate students at Purdue University.  The project developed a number of robust and efficient algorithms for sensor networks and for smart green buildings. The algorithms use low cost sensors and unsupervised learning to simplify deployment efforts, which make them feasible for practical use in end users' homes and offices. We created working prototypes of the sensing systems, and demonstrated them in major international conferences. Our work also introduced novel methods to make wireless sensor networks resilient to faults and attacks with little energy consumption.  Our demonstrated technologies will have impact on reducing the carbon footprints of urban societies, thus contributing to general environmental sustainability efforts. They contributed to a technology base for behavioral social scientists to encourage people to adopt energy-efficient usage of appliances in everyday living.  Our techniques also increase the trustworthiness of wireless sensor networks in general. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
