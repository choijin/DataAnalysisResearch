<AbstractNarration>This project is supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Metals and Metallic Nanostructures Program of the Division of Materials Research. Professor Stanko Brankovic and his research group at the University of Houston will investigate the governing thermodynamics and kinetics processes controlling the morphology of the metal nanodeposit obtained via surface limited galvanic displacement reaction. In this novel deposition method, a single monolayer of less noble metal is oxidized-displaced by more noble metal cations which are simultaneously reduced-deposited on a substrate surface. The obtained metallic deposit has just a single atom in thickness as nanoclusters uniformly distributed over the substrate surface. Such nanodeposit will be used as model system to study structure-property relation of catalyst monolayers, their stability in different chemical reactions and their self-organization. In addition, a nanoscale three dimensional metallic structures produced by this method or by dealloying will be evaluated as a potential path for the fabrication of more complex nanostructures, including those that can be used for ultrasound sensing application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental concepts that will be developed in this work will have an impact in many other scientific and technological disciplines. Perhaps the most immediate one is the application to microelectronics fabrication, where precise, uniform deposition (i.e., "conformal deposition") on complex substrates remains a daunting challenge. Self-organized 2D metallic architectures, design of active catalyst monolayers or organized growth of carbon nanotubes are some other examples. This program integrates an educational component which spans over the range from high school to graduate students, and addresses the development of cutting edge research in the physical sciences, with an over-reaching theme of long term sustainable technology development. The long term goal of this program is to produce the highly qualified scientist and engineers able to carry out the technical challenges of the modern world.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This program provided the scientific base for 4 PhD and 2 MS thesis/students, Figure 6. They successfully demonstrate that electrochemical monolayer (ML) deposition is enabling process for synthesis of functional thin films, catalyst materials, nanostructures and chemical sensors. The most important results are reported in 20 peer-reviewed publications (15 published and 5 submitted) and more than 30 presentations at international conferences. During this program PI has established collaboration with some of the most prominent research groups in the field of electrochemistry, fuel cells and computation material sciences and founded a lasting outreach programs with local community, schools and Universities abroad,Figure 6A-F. Intellectual merit and broader impact of this program are summarized in several areas of scientific work:</p> <ul> <li>The phenomenon of underpotential deposition (UPD) of Cu and Pb monolayers is studied in very detail on theologically relevant substrate such as Ru. The formation of Cu UPD monolayer was found inhibited by the presence of strongly adsorbed OH<sup>?</sup> species at the steps of Ru surface, Figure 1A. Unlike Cu, the Pb UPD formation proceeds as seen in other systems, Figure 1B, with nucleation and growth on surface defects and then on free terraces until full completion. These results were further exploited for design of the process for Cu and Co thin film growth using Pb ML as a surfactant or as reactive precursor, Figure 5A and 5C. This work is the first to reveal the electroless formation of Pb ML (E-less Pb ML) on different substrates (Cu, Ru, Pt, Pd) which is a prelude to development of Electroless Atomic Layer Deposition (ElessALD) process. Each of these achievements should greatly impact researchers in electrodeposition field and in semiconductor technologies as it provides new avenues for synthesis of functional coatings and thin films of practical importance for new generation of micro devices. &nbsp;</li> <li>For the first time, the UPD ML formation on surface modified by noble metal nanoclusters have been studied in detail, Figure 2. Results show that combination of the substrate and modifying metal propensities for UPD process result in distinctively different behavior of these systems. In the case of Pt-modified gold, Pt<sub>SML</sub>/Au(111), &nbsp;the first stage of Pb UPD starts by nucleation on free Au terraces, Figure 2A. In the case of Ru-modified gold, Ru<sub>SML</sub>/Au(111), Pb UPD starts by decoration of the perimeter of 2D Ru clusters, Figure 2B. These results are further exploited for design of new class of bi-functional catalyst monolayers and catalyst monolayers having so called core-edge configuration, Figure 4D. These results are of great importance for design of new generation of catalyst monolayers with applications in many areas of industrial catalysis and fuel cells. </li> <li>The great effort was focused on better understanding of the reaction kinetics of metal (catalyst) deposition via surface limited redox replacement (SLRR) of UPD ML, Figure 3A. For the first time, the fundamental link between nucleation, growth and morphology of catalyst monolayer and corresponding SLRR reaction kinetics is identified and presented in a form of comprehensive analytical model, Figure 3B-C. The basic terms and formalism for SLRR reaction kinetics are defined and experimental methodology to study them is developed. This should have a great impact on practitioners in catalysis field as they are now able to understand the link between the catalyst morphology and catalyst synthesis conditions during SLRR of UPD ML.</li> <li>This work is the first to identify, describe and fully quantify the finite size effects in monolayer catalysts, Figure 4A-D. This fundamental effect has an origin in the size-dependent strain in 2D catalyst nanoclusters. Therefore, it exist in every catalyst monolayer/substrate system and it points to the better appreciation of catalyst morphology control which is a function of SLRR kinetics and conditions for catalyst monolayer synthesis. The phenomenon is studied and demonstrated using Pt ML on Au(111) in hydrogen oxidation reaction, Figure 4A-B, in Pt ML on Pd(100), Figure 4C, and Ru-Pt core-edge ML configuration on Au(111), Figure 4D, using CO adsorption/oxidation as the probe molecule/reaction. &nbsp;Our findings on single crystal surfaces are already reconfirmed in several high surface area catalyst configurations which illustrates the relevance and value of these results in general area of heterogeneous catalysis and fuel cells.</li> <li>There are many emerging application of noble metal monolayers synthesized via SLRR of UPD ML. Some of them are design of chemo resistive films, or synthesis of catalyst ML with precisely defined size, morphology and spatial distribution/organization on the surface, Figure 5D. Other&nbsp; applications are foreseen in the energy, defense or aerospace technology sectors where coatings of Re, Os, Rh or other noble, high melting temperature metals are in great need for more efficient turbine blades, jet nasals, or critical parts of space ships and satellites.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/26/2017<br>      Modified by: Stanko&nbsp;R&nbsp;Brankovic</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0955922/0955922_10017100_1487797501453_Picture6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0955922/0955922_10017100_1487797501453_Picture6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 6"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0955922/0955922_10017100_1487797501453_Picture6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 6"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">PhD and MS students supported by NSF 0955922 project.
