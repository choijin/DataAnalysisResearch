<AbstractNarration>Objective: The Workshop on the Frontiers of Controls, Games and Network Science will host participants from academia, industry and government. The aim is to increase inter-community collaboration in the applications of emerging analytical tools and techniques from controls, games and network science for both commercial wireless networks and military networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Over the last few years, we have observed the confluence of several technological and algorithmic advances that promise tremendous impact on both commercial and military wireless networks. These include the proliferation of data-enabled smart-phones, changes in wireless spectrum policies, as well as fundamental advances in distributed network control algorithms. At this juncture, it is important that the academic community, government participants and industry participants effectively interact in order to develop easily deployable network control algorithms that are based on a sound theoretical basis. The workshop will consist of seminars and discussions to foster long-term collaborations between the student, faculty, government and industry participants. A poster session will encourage fruitful exchange of ideas between the various participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This workshop will introduce students to the state-of-the-art and current trends in research and industry. Collaboration in this frontier area is especially needed to ensure successful technology transfer from ideas to practice, and this workshop will educate students and participants on the critical problems in this space. A special emphasis will be placed on ensuring strong participation by women and under-represented minority students/participants.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
