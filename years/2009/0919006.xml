<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biogeography is the study of the spatial distribution of species and ecosystems. While the biogeography of natural ecosystems is relatively well understood, we have a poor understanding of spatial patterns of plants in cities.  Both the physical environment (e.g., climate and soil type) and decision-making (about which species to plant) are likely to determine urban plant biogeography. This interdisciplinary group of ecologists, geographers, and social scientists will develop a biogeography of urban ecosystems, using the Los Angeles urban forest as a case study.  Data from historical photographs, satellite imagery, ground inventories, and plant measurements will document historical and current distributions of tree species, record their physiology, and describe spatial patterns of species and physiological diversity.  The researchers will also conduct surveys and focus groups and document historical literature to understand preferences and decision-making about planted species. This information will be integrated into a simulation model of urban forest development and productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project can be used to integrate ecological factors into urban planning by improving our understanding of preferences of urban residents for specific tree species, the performance of those species in the urban environment, and the role of biodiversity in influencing urban ecosystem services.  Results will be shared with the Los Angeles city government and partner agencies. Educational workshops on urban forestry will be developed for underserved high schools and community colleges in collaboration with Urban Semillas, a local non-profit community-building organization.</AbstractNarration>
