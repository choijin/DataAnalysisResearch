<AbstractNarration>The first ant was a hunter-gatherer.  But around 50 million years ago, one ant species discovered agriculture and began cultivating fungus gardens for food.  Today over 230 species of 'fungus-farming ants', all descended from that single ant pioneer, participate in intricate symbioses with their cultivated fungi.  These symbioses also include a fungal 'crop disease' and bacteria that produce antibiotics useful to the ants.  Using DNA sequence data and computer algorithms, this research will focus on reconstructing the shared evolutionary histories of the farming ants and the fungi that they cultivate, shedding light on the origin and evolution of this spectacular biological system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will benefit the education and career of one postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, and a number of undergraduate interns.  Ant workshops will foster enthusiasm for science in secondary and high-school students and museum exhibits and family festivals will educate the general public.  Because ant agriculture has become a model system for the study of symbiosis and coevolution, the results of this project will benefit a wide range of biologists.  Finally, the results could benefit society in general because fungus-growing ants provide a rare non-human model system for the emerging field of 'Darwinian agriculture', aimed at improving human agricultural methods through the study of natural systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Like humans, some insects grow their own food.  In this project we studied fungus-farming ants, a group of around 300 ant species that cultivate fungus gardens.  The most well-known of the fungus-farming ants are the leaf-cutting ants, which grow their fungi on cut leaves.  We studied the evolutionary histories of fungus-farming ants and of the fungi that they grow in order to understand how this remarkably complex behavior arose and how it evolved in various fungus-farming ant lineages.   Because most fungus-growing ant species are only known from a few specimens and because most of their fungal cultivars are unknown, this research required a lot of field work in South America, during which we discovered new species and recorded natural phenomena never before observed.  Back in the lab, we sequenced DNA, analyzed DNA sequence data with specialized computer programs, and constructed evolutionary trees of ants and their fungi.  For some species we acquired whole-genome DNA sequences of ants and fungi.  We found that, as in the evolution of human agriculture, early ant farmers cultivated small gardens, lived in small colonies, and grew undomesticated crops that were able to live apart from the ants in the wild.  In contrast, we found that colonies of the recently evolved leaf-cutter ants, which grow thousands of gardens and live in large, complex societies of millions of individuals, grow highly domesticated fungal crops that are incapable of living in the wild apart from their ant farmers.  These complex ant colonies are the equivalents of human cities and their highly domesticated fungal cultivars are the equaivalents of our highly domesticated strains of corn, wheat, rice, and other industrial-scale crops.  Clearly, ant agriculture has a lot in common with human agriculture.  For this reason, fungus farming has become a model system in the fields of Darwinian agriculture and Darwinian medicine, which aim to improve human agriculture and disease management through the study of analogous natural systems.  Recently, several antibiotics and antimalarial quinones have been isolated and described from ant fungal cultivars and ant-cultivated fungi are being studied by our scientific colleagues for clues to more efficient biofuel production.  Fungus-farming ants have also become model systems for the study of symbiotic evolution and coevolution, so our research provides useful data for the broader fields of evolutionary biology and ecology.   In the course of our project we educated eight postdoctoral fellows, nine graduate students, eight undergraduate interns, and four high school students.  The students and postdocs included sixteen females, four minority students, and five South American students.  Two students came from underserved Washington, DC, area high schools.
