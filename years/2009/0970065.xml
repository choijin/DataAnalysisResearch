<AbstractNarration>The work is a study of the scattering of laser light by free electrons both theoretically and experimentally. In the experiment, electron wave packets will be created through ionization in a strong laser field and radiation from the focus at right angles to the laser beam will be observed. The radiated light from one or a few electrons is extremely weak and the experiment requires the unusual combination of quantum-optics measurement techniques and high-intensity laser technology. To separate this low-level signal from the significant background, the investigators filter in time (looking only at the signal in a nanosecond wide window), space (using baffling and a fiber coupling system to collect only photons originating from the spatial location of the focus), and wavelength (using bandpass filters to view only the relativistic red-shifted signal while explicitly masking these frequencies in the compression system). The investigators will also study the theoretical underpinnings of free-electron photoemission and how the quantum-field description might be appropriately related to a semiclassical framework. Initial work has already been accomplished in the simplified case where the driving laser and the emitted radiation are treated as plane wave fields. Extending this analysis to describe localized interactions is non-trivial, but it is necessary to create a theoretical framework for understanding radiation in this system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include the study of the foundations of quantum mechanics in the context of the interface between the particle/wave nature of electrons and the particle/wave nature of light and seeks to resolve conflicting viewpoints held by different researchers in the laser-interaction community. This work will lead to a better understanding of the nature of photons, especially the connection between emitting and absorbing photons and the quantum measurement process (involving wave function collapse). The project provides opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students to make meaningful contributions to the work while gaining valuable experience. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In quantum mechanics, electrons are not thought of as distinct point-like entities, but rather as distributed "wave function."  The founders of quantum mechanics disagreed for a time on the physical interpretation of the wave function. Schr&ouml;dinger initially suggested that the wave function might be interpreted as a classical distribution, where the charge of the electron is thought of as being spread out in space. When a charge distribution is accelerated, the laws of classical electricity and magnetism dictate that it will radiate light, and when a distribution is wiggled such that different portions are accelerating in different directions at the same time, interference can cause a dramatic suppression of the light that is radiated from the distribution. Thus, under the Schr&ouml;dinger interpretation, one would expect dramatic suppression of scattered radiation when a single-electron quantum wave packet grows to the scale of a laser wavelength and is then accelerated by a laser.     The Schr&ouml;dinger interpretation is incorrect, and was dismissed fairly early in the development of quantum mechanics, and replaced by Born's probabilistic interpretation.  The Born interpretation accurately predicts physical phenomena, and withstood the subsequent development of a more rigorous description that includes light/matter interactions referred to as quantum electrodynamics (QED).  The Born interpretation and QED accurately predict experimental results, but they do not provide a concrete mental picture for visualizing dynamics at the smallest scales.  Because of this lack of visualization, most laypeople, and sometimes even scientists in peer-reviewed literature, still picture electrons with a mental picture that closely resembles the Schr&ouml;dinger interpretation.  This has led to some confusion and misunderstandings about how large electron wave packets radiate when accelerated by laser fields.  In this research, we first theoretically demonstrated using QED that light scattered from an accelerated electron wave packet is independent of the size of the electron packet. Radiation coming from different regions of the same electron wave packet does not interfere, so there can be no radiative suppression.  This agrees with the earliest measurements of Compton scattering, where x-rays with wavelengths on the scale of atomic size interact the many closely packed electrons in the atoms of a crystal.  The wave functions for these bound electrons are spread out over atomic sizes, and no unusual radiative suppression happens in this situation where the accelerating light has a wavelength similar in scale to the size of target electron wave packets.  We also successfully completed a challenging experiment to directly measure the scattering of light from individual electron wave packets. In this experiment, a laser pulse that is very short in time (about 40 femtoseconds long) is focused in a vacuum with a small amount of helium present.  A first laser pulse rips the two electrons from the helium atom, and the two electrons are allowed time to drift apart and for their wave packets to expand to the size of a laser wavelength.  Then a second, more energetic laser pulse interacts with these large electron wave packets.  The second pulse accelerates the electrons to move near the speed of light in the direction that the laser is propagating, while at the same time being violently accelerated them side-to-side.  The side-to-side acceleration causes light to be emitted laterally out the side of the focus, while the high forward velocity causes this emitted light to be Doppler-shifted to longer wavelengths in a fashion similar to the pitch change observed when a car drives by.   The light emitted from these large electron wave packets is very weak; typically just a single photon is emitted.  Since the laser pulse contains about a billion billion photons of energy (1018 photons), we must use extreme care to distinguish the single photons of ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
