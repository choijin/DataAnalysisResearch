<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds for a three-year RUI grant for continued support for a program of undergraduate student research with the CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) experiment at the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly). CUORE is a next-generation cryogenic bolometry experiment to search for neutrinoless double beta decay in tellurium. The observation of this decay would indicate that neutrinos are Majorana fermions and therefore are their own antiparticle. It also isolates the scale for the effective Majorana neutrino mass, identifying the appropriate neutrino mass hierarchy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will have the exciting opportunity to participate in hands-on CUORE construction at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy. In addition, they will assist with shift activity with CUORE-0, an intermediate single-tower of CUORE slated to be online by mid-2010, designed to demonstrate background, analysis, and material milestones before full CUORE deployment in 2012. Locally at Cal Poly, students will explore various proposed detector calibration schemes by running GEANT4 simulations, and test these simulations against existing data from Cuoricino, a recently decommissioned prototype of CUORE. They will also write and utilize software to obtain nuclear spectra from the raw data obtained by the earlier Cuoricino detector and help with software development to process CUORE and CUORE-0 data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concerning Broader Impacts, experiments such as CUORE bring together many experimental and analytical techniques from low temperature, solid-state, particle, and nuclear physics. Improvements in these technologies may lead to benefits in other areas of science and engineering where they are applied. Both neutrino and underground physics are subjects that spark the imagination and provide a unique platform for vigorous public outreach through Cal Poly's Center for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Education and the local Central Coast Astronomical Society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is a next-generation cryogenic bolometry experiment currently being built at the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy.  It is a very sensitive detector designed primarily to measure a process known as neutrinoless double beta decay in the isotope tellurium-130.   Neutrinoless double beta decay is a hypothesized very rare nuclear decay that, if detected, would demonstrate neutrinos are their own antiparticles, a currently unknown characteristic of these mysterious objects.  This knowledge would then be used to constrain cosmological models to help determine the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe.  It would also help refine the Standard Model of particle physics and contribute to the understanding of the inner workings of nature at the very deepest levels.  CUORE-0 has been operating at the LNGS since 2013 and is one tower-equivalent of CUORE. It is constructed to the background, material, and analysis standards of CUORE, and represents an intermediate technological step towards the full detector.  CUORE-0 results confirm that the materials and design standards of CUORE are sound.  CUORE-0 was preceded by the smaller Cuoricino experiment, an operating scientific prototype, which was a productive experiment in its own right.  The combined experimental results of Cuoricino and CUORE-0 did not detect neutrinoless double beta decay and currently set the lower limit of the half-life of the decay at greater than about 3.0 yotta-years (3 with 24 zeros after it).  This is over a million-million times the age of the universe, highlighting the extreme rarity of the decay.  With support from the NSF, Cal Poly undergraduate students had the exciting opportunity to participate in hands-on CUORE and CUORE-0 construction and research and development activity at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy.  In addition, they assisted with experimental shift activity with CUORE-0.  This gave students invaluable experience working with a cutting-edge physics experiment in a world-class underground laboratory and facilitated important personal and professional growth that naturally accompanies travel and study abroad.  Locally at Cal Poly, students explored various computational projects.  Students ran simulations of the detector performance and also wrote code using WolframÆs Mathematica to help with pattern recognition in quality assurance of images during the delicate process of gluing thermistors onto the tellurium dioxide crystals used in the detector.  This helped researchers identify potential problems during detector construction.  Students also worked closely with researchers at UC Berkeley, UCLA, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on various projects, giving the Cal Poly students experience working at research universities while building synergy between CaliforniaÆs State and UC university systems.  The Cal Poly CUORE group was given a certificate by the California State Assembly for providing international research opportunities for undergraduate students.  Projects of this kind are ideally suited for undergraduate participation and provided experience in nuclear physics as well as practical programming and critical thinking skills.  All of these activities contributed to developing essential technical skills during the studentsÆ formative undergraduate education.  This contributed not only to basic science but also to creating a stronger, better-trained US workforce as we move deeper into the 21st century.
