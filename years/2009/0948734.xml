<AbstractNarration>Magma eruptions are fascinating phenomena that have captured the attention of humanity for millennia. They also represent a significant natural hazard. This project is concerned with fundamental questions regarding eruptive systems: Why do some silicic magmas erupt while others stall in the subsurface? Why do some magmas erupt effusively (i.e. as lava flows) while others do so explosively? Are these different magmas that are predestined to different eruptive potential and style, or are they similar magmas subject to different contingencies? Much attention has been given to the importance of external triggers (e.g. earthquakes) in initiating eruptions. Many lines of evidence suggest, however, that eruption triggers are only effective to the extent that a magma body is already primed to the point where eruption is already very likely or inevitable. The fundamental question that this project aims to address is what is the path for priming of a magmatic body? The project will explore the importance of the internal evolution (i.e. crystallization, bubble formation, and magma evolution) of silicic magmas to eruptive potential, and in particular, to explosive potential. A combination of thermodynamic and fluid dynamics modeling will be employed, using selected natural systems as inspiration and guides to exploring the parameter space of the models. While the research being conducted is academic in nature, it will help further the understanding of the eruptive potential of magmatic systems, and may eventually help volcanologists concerned with systems that directly affect society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this project, a thermodynamic model that can appropriately describe the evolution of high-silica systems will be developed, and it will be coupled with new and existing models of the dynamics of the chamber itself and of its walls. Modeling tools developed under this project will be made available to the scientific community as standalone software, web services, and browser-based web clients that will permit users to apply these tools to their own scientific questions and teaching needs. Natural systems to be studied include the Bishop Tuff (CA), Peach Spring Tuff (AZ-NV-CA), and the Highland Range Volcanics (NV), taking advantage of their unique magmatic and eruptive histories to assess some of the first order controls on the eruptive potential of silicic magmas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: A growing number of lines of evidence suggest that silicic magma bodies &ndash; which give rise to hazardous explosive volcanic eruptions &ndash; are characteristic (if not restricted) to shallow levels of the crust. Why is this the case? What controls the depths from which eruptions emanate? Is it possible to generate and erupt silicic magma from deeper levels within the crust? How do magma properties (density, viscosity, etc.) interact with crustal properties (rigidity, elasticity, etc.) to ultimately control the eruption of magmas? These are the scientific questions addressed by the research conducted under this research grant.  In this project, we  developed coupled thermodynamics and fluid dynamics models, and applied these models to selected natural systems. We have developed an improved model to perform thermodynamic calculations of phase relations for silicic magmas (rhyolite-MELTS), we have laid the foundation for coupling thermodynamics and fluid dynamics models, and we have made preliminary applications of existing models to natural systems, particularly the Bishop Tuff (CA), Peach Spring Tuff (NV-AZ-CA), and Cotopaxi (Mexico).  Broader impacts:  Funding was made to OFM Research (P.I. Ghiorso), Vanderbilt University (P.I. Gualda) and Georgia Institute of Technology (P.I. Dufek). Grant related activities have resulted in ten published papers and one paper accepted for publication, five additional papers submitted for publication, and seventeen abstracts presented at national meetings. The grant has funded in part the thesis work of two MasterÆs degree candidates and three Ph.D. candidates, supported the efforts of two post-doctoral associates, and contributed to the involvement of two undergraduate research assistants.  Four members of this group are women.  The grant has resulted in release of new modeling software aimed at providing the community with tools (rhyolite-MELTS and PhasePlot) for calculating phase relations and eruptive potential in magmatic systems.  This software has infused itself into the international research community with well over 500 users of rhyolite-MELTS and 800 downloads of PhasePlot from the Mac App store.  Outcomes:  Our collaborative grant had three principal objectives, all of which have been achieved: (1) To construct a thermodynamic model for hydrous, quartz-bearing, silica-rich magmas that is capable of modeling phase relations, heat content, and the densities of phases as a function of temperature and pressure, (2) To utilize that thermodynamic model as a source of constitutive relations for a fluid dynamical and thermal evolution model of magma bodies embedded in a dynamically deforming crust, with full coupling of the thermal and deformational regimes, (3) To apply both the thermodynamic model and the coupled thermodynamic-dynamical treatment to well characterized natural examples of silicic volcanism in order to illuminate and test the relationship between the evolution of phase relations in magma bodies to their dynamical stability.  The major outcome of this research effort is the ability to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the effect of the interplay between crystallization, volatile exsolution and crustal deformation in controlling eruptive behavior of magma bodies; we conclude that rapid volatile exsolution driven by solid-phase crystallization in near-invariant silicic magmas may be sufficient to trigger volcanic eruption.
