<AbstractNarration>Atmospheric aerosols represent a key uncertainty in understanding the climate system and climate change, and the contribution of primary biogenic aerosols is not included in current global budgets. Recent work indicates that pollen, a primary biogenic aerosol, can break up into fine particulate matter, act as giant cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and influence the formation of ice nuclei.  This project will address three scientific questions to quantify the climatic relevance of pollen in the atmosphere: (1) What are the magnitude and spatial distribution of pollen emissions from the biosphere? (2) What are the processes that allow pollen to act as CCN and how likely are they to occur?  (3) What are the magnitude and spatial distribution of direct and first indirect radiative forcing from pollen aerosols?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop and integrate a pollen aerosol emissions module in a regional climate model, evaluate the ability of pollen to act as a CCN through experimental studies, and assess the direct and indirect effects of pollen on regional radiative forcing through decadal scale regional climate simulations.  The scientific outcomes will provide an estimate of the magnitude of the contribution of pollen to the aerosol budget over fine spatial and temporal scales and their ultimate impact on long-term climate.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the following: (1) An educational program, the Green Roof Project, will establish two meteorological and pollen monitoring stations at middle schools in Detroit public to introduce middle school students to hypothesis development, data collection, and data analysis and interpretation. Data from the Green Roof Project will inform the pollen emissions model development. (2) Integration of the Green Roof Project and research on biosphere-atmosphere interactions with the University of Michigan graduate and undergraduate education, and (3) International education through a partnership with the International Centre for Theoretical Physics to train scientists from developing nations on the role of biosphere-atmosphere interactions. This project will benefit society by assessing the contribution of primary biogenic aerosols like pollen to climate variability, the impact of landscape change on air quality, and the role of pollen emissions and transport in asthma and public health.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Atmospheric aerosols represent a key uncertainty in understanding the climate system, and the contribution of primary biogenic aerosol particles to global budgets is still unknown. This research focused on pollen, one type of primary biological aerosol particle that is emitted in large quantities from vegetation in the mid latitudes. Due to the large size of these pollen grains (about 20-100 microns) and the resulting short residence times, most aerosol emission models have excluded contributions from pollen.  However, field observations show that pollen can be present in the planetary boundary layer and that pollen components are found cloud droplets and fine particulate matter.   Furthermore, recent studies have shown that pollen grains can easily rupture when wet, forming smaller, sub pollen particles (SPP) with sizes less than one micron which may have an important climatic impact.  This study addressed three scientific questions to quantify the climatic relevance of pollen:  (1) What are the magnitude and spatial distribution of pollen emissions from the biosphere?  (2) What are the processes that allow pollen to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and how likely are they to occur?  (3) What are the magnitude and spatial distribution of direct and indirect radiative forcing from pollen aerosols?  To address the first question, we developed a comprehensive pollen emissions model for use in meteorology and climate models (PECM; Pollen Emissions for Climate Models).  This model calculates daily pollen emissions over climatological timescales (e.g., decades) for trees, grasses and ragweed.  For example, Figure 1 shows the average monthly time series of pollen resulting from all types of deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF).  Second, we conducted a suite of laboratory experiments to understand how pollen can influence clouds.  We collected pollen samples from six common anemophilous species in the United States, and found that pollen rupture particles in the size range of 100-200 nm were CCN-active at supersaturations frequently encountered in the atmosphere. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectrometer (EDS) and chemical assays qualitatively indicate that SPP are composed of a large suite of biological macromolecules, including starch, other carbohydrates, and proteins.  To address the final question, we implemented the pollen emissions into a regional climate model to estimate the indirect effects of pollen.  Within a regional climate model, we simulate the emissions, rupture and transport of both whole grain pollen and SPP, and can estimate the contribution of SPP to CCN and the aerosol indirect effect.  Using multi-member ensembles, we find that the average change in the CCN number and regional precipitation in the continental United States is relatively small, while localized precipitation changes can be up to 40%.  The results suggest that the spatial pattern of precipitation can be affected by pollen and the generation of SPP.  Key model uncertainties are the background concentrations of CCN and the number of SPP generated by the rupture mechanism.  Overall, this work provides an important framework for developing accurate estimates of natural aerosols in the present-day and pre-industrial atmosphere.  The findings on the rupture of pollen and formation of subpollen particles (SPP) have increased the understanding of bioaerosol in the atmosphere, which has implications for both climate and health. Our work elucidates the transport and formation of allergenic particles and potential influence on human health. In addition to understanding the role on modern climate, the pollen emissions model could be useful in the paleoclimate and ecology communities to understand the role of pollen in ecosystems.    One master's student and two Ph.D. students have been trained on the role of pollen as a biological particle and its role in the atmospheric system.  International education through a partnership with the International Centre for Theoretical Physics also trained scientists from other nations on the role of biosphere-atmosphere interactions. Additionally, we worked with middle school students in Ypsilanti and Detroit to introduce connections between weather, climate, pollen and ecological feedbacks.
