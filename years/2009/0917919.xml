<AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project--a Type III (A:C) partnership between the University of New Mexico (UNM), an NSF PFI graduate (0227806), and the Institute for American Indian Arts (IAIA), an institution new to the PFI Program (defined as one that has never been a PFI grantee)--seeks to apply UNM's  experience in fulldome technology to formalize already existing informal partnerships and efforts into a consortium that will move fulldome to multi-surface immersive environments through a coordinated set of activities that include research, development, and applications over a range of problems driven by partner expertise, from scientific and information visualization to simulation to the use of novel interactive devices.  The proposed integrated program has three main thrusts:  1) tool development: hardware and software for fulldomes and core research into how these spaces can be used as interactive theaters and extended to multi-surface environments, as visualization tools and as educational and experiential venues; 2) integration and content development: development of key applications areas including visualization, simulation, complex systems, security, and education; and 3) education and workforce development: building an educated workforce for the new industry and bringing in new communities through new ways to communicate science, enhance learning, and expand the missions and services of these new technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the broader impacts of the proposed research is that the consortium will create a new high tech industry within the state of New Mexico, a majority-minority state.  Although New Mexico is home to the national laboratories and other DOD/DOE facilities, it ranks at the bottom of most economic indicators. The University of New Mexico (a Hispanic-serving institution) will join the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA) (one of three congressionally chartered institutions of higher education and an accredited tribal institution) to share the facilities and expertise developed through this project.  The proposed project will leverage the experience with the NSF PFI sponsored 'Digital Pueblo Project' (0227806) which helped to lay the foundation for the growing digital media industry in the state of New Mexico.  Finally, this work will broaden the usability of fulldome technologies to a wider range of spaces that can be used to educate the general population in STEM-related areas.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: University of New Mexico (UNM) (lead institution), Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA); Research Institute: Santa Fe Institute; and Private Sector Organizations: Institute for the Study and Integration of Graphical Heritage Techniques, Santa Fe Complex (Redfish Group and Los Alamos Visual Analytics), and Sky Scan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to explore the potential of digital fulldome and other immersive technologies, such as "multi-surface" displays.  Digital fulldomes (like those we see in planetariums or sometimes in IMAX theaters) are an important technology because they naturally immerse the audience by surrounding their peripheral vision with visual content.  This proposal sought to examine ways to make fulldome technology more effective by trying to make it easier to develop dome content.  One of the key outcomes was the development of the DomeGL API which enables standard OpenGL applications to be mapped fairly easily to dome environments (see attached picture).  We also sought to address the "chicken-and-egg" problem that can afflict new kinds of media technologies: no one makes dome content because there aren't enough users with domes to view the content, and users don't set up domes because there is not enough interesting content out there.  To get around this problem, we began examining (1) ways to make dome technology cheaper, more affordable, and easier to set up, and (2) develop ways to project illumination onto arbitrary surfaces to turn any room environment into an immersive "theater" to view dome content.  By allowing consumers to view dome content in their living room (something we call "multi-surface displays"), it effectively creates an "instant market" for dome productions that would stimulate the growth of this industry.  In order to allow the display of content on arbitrary surfaces, we needed to develop calibration algorithms to adjust the projection of the content so that it would look correct from the user's point of view (see attached picture).  We also developed new hardware interfaces for immersive displays, such as a skateboard interface and an actuated platform (see attached picture).  These interfaces provide more intuitive interaction since traditional interfaces (e.g., mouse or keyboard) do not work well for immersive displays).  In terms of the educational plan, this PFI effort had a strong educational component that integrated the proposed research effort with a set of educational/outreach activities to help disseminate the ideas developed and help train the next-generation of engineers, scientists, and artists that would work on dome technology.  Some of the outcomes here included the development of a new curriculum in dome technology development at our partner institution IAIA which is motivating a new generation of underrepresented students into taking more advanced courses in science and mathematics.  A digital fulldome was also completed at IAIA that is being used to teach courses in immersive technology.  This two year grant was very successful because it ignited a lot of interest in fulldome technology and opened new directions for applications and technologies which we are just starting to explore.
