<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research project implements a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to the design and validation of concept inventories (CIs). The purpose is to braoden and enhance the effective use of concept inventories in STEM education for formative and summative assessment. To accomplish this goal the project will focus on a specific concept inventory, the Thermal Transport Concept Inventory (TTCI). The data will be collected from the varied undergarduate student samples. The research would develop an explicit set of facets of understanding for diagnostic measurement and reporting, would gather multi-level empirical data of student performance on the TTCI (including student protocol and interview studies, and large scale data for psychometric modeling), would revise both the items and facets based upon these empirical data analyses, and would gather further data on the revised instrument. The data on TTCI will be analyzed in terms of the underlying conceptual knowledge and skills that it taps in critical areas of science and engineering. Additional empirical data on student reasoning and performance will be analyzed applying modern psychometric analysis techniques focused on diagnostic modeling. Research outcomes expected are: (1) an improved TTCI available through the web and accompanied by interpretive tools for use by faculty; (2) an in-depth, multi-level analysis of the assessment validity and diagnostic capacity of the TTCI; (3) a comprehensive inventory of possible formative and summative uses of CIs, including what is needed by STEM practitioners to make good use of CIs; and (4) a research and development framework for designing, developing, evaluating, improving, and/or implementing CIs in other STEM areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general, the study will contribute to the better understanding of student learning and more authentic diagnostic and formative assessment, leading to better learning and teaching of important concepts in STEM. The use of the TTCI will elicit student misconceptions in the thermal and transport engineering sciences such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and thermodynamics. The TTCI particularly focuses on concepts deemed important but difficult for undergraduate engineering students. Thus, the proposed research is likely to lead to expanded uses of the TTCI and other CIs for formative classroom purposes as well as for a variety of summative purposes. This project are both an expansion of the psychometric modeling and methods for applying diagnostic models to CIs, and an expanded assessment validity in the area of measurement and assessment of key concepts in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Increasing students' conceptual knowledge is a key goal of higher education. But how does one measure conceptual understanding?  The project?s overarching goal is to implement a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to the design and validation of concept inventories (CIs) that transforms how they can be used in STEM classrooms and enhances their effectiveness and impact. Our multidisciplinary approach integrates disciplinary knowledge of STEM content, experience in STEM area teaching and learning, cognitive science, educational measurement, and psychometric modeling. We have focused our research on two specific concept inventories, the Thermal and Transport Concept Inventory (TTCI) (Streveler, Olds, &amp; Miller, 2003), whose developers Ron Miller and Ruth Streveler are PIs on this project, and the Concept Assessment Tool for Statics (CATS) (Steif &amp; Dantzler, 2004). The TTCI provides an excellent test case for developing the larger research and validation methodology that can be extended to other concept inventories. Earlier diagnostic research had already been conducted on the CATS, and in this project we extended the earlier research by examining in more depth the cognitive and conceptual underpinnings of the CATS and applying diagnostic methods that take account of the information about common conceptual errors or misconceptions that have been linked to multiple-choice distractors. We are effectively "deconstructing" both the TTCI and the CATS in terms of the underlying conceptual knowledge and skills that they tap in critical areas of science and engineering, gathering additional empirical data on student reasoning and performance, and analyzing those data by applying modern diagnostic psychometric analysis.  Primary research questions:  The cognitive and conceptual analyses and the sophisticated psychometric modeling being performed in this research project take advantage of and build upon the extensive conceptual and experimental work that had been done in developing the TTCI and the CATS. The cognitive and conceptual research consisted of student protocol observation and interview studies and large-scale psychometric analyses that include standard unidimensional analyses as well as diagnostic model-based analyses.  The following research questions underlie the expanded diagnostic utility of the TTCI and the CATS, and by extension other CIs as well, and are central for broadening uses of CIs to include formative uses within STEM classes in ways that can have a potentially great impact on STEM teaching and learning:  --What do the CIs really measure relative to their conceptual foundations and the intended and claimed measurement constructs?  --Do items and distractors in the TTCI and in the CATS allow for the determination of a set of conceptual "skills" or facets of conceptual knowledge and understanding for performing diagnostic, profile analysis that reliably identifies robust misconceptions; can new items and distractors be written and tested to improve the diagnostic functioning and utility of the TTCI?  Can rigorous methods be developed to analyze TTCI and CATS data to identify the presence in students of robust misconceptions across domains (e.g., fundamental misconceptions such as "heat and temperature are equivalent")?  --How should instructors think about CIs in light of their instructional practice?  What correspondences are there among the concepts of a CI and the standard list of common or core topics taught in a given STEM discipline?  Does the addition of diagnostic measurement and reporting in fact lead to instructor use of CIs for formative purposes in classrooms?  What impact do such formative uses have on student learning and performance?  Project Outcomes. Concrete outcomes from this work include:   Outcome 1. An improved TTCI that has been made widely available through the web and accompanied by interpretive tools for use by faculty;  Outcome 2. An in-depth, multi-level analysis of the assessment validity and diagnostic capacity of both the TTCI and the CATS, with proposed lists of skills for diagnostic reporting;  Outcome 3. A comprehensive inventory of possible formative and summative uses of CIs in light of their interpretive structure, including what is needed by STEM instructors to make good use of CIs; and  Outcome 4. A research and development framework for designing, developing, evaluating, improving, and implementing CIs in other STEM areas.
