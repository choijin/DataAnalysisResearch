<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Prof. Andrei Tokmakoff of the Chemistry Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his graduate student colleagues will develop two dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy of amide and water vibrations, and use these in combination with nanosecond laser temperature-jumps to study protein and peptide conformational variation and dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the broader scientific impacts of the research being supported, the research students working on these projects will gain experience with advanced laser techniques. Prof. Tokmakoff also maintains a Web site(http://www.mit.edu/~tokmakof/TDQMS/) through which his most recent quantum mechanics course materials are made available. Additional lecture and laboratory course materials are distributed on the MIT OpenCourseWare Web site(http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm/).</AbstractNarration>
