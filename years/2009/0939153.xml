<AbstractNarration>A paradigm shift has occurred in research in the natural and social sciences, but this change has not reached the classroom in a systematic way. Computational modeling has transformed the way science is done and is now a full partner to experimentation and theory in most disciplines. Despite its importance, students in the sciences do not know the basics of modeling, make fundamental errors in application, and are ill-prepared to solve complex, cross-disciplinary problems using modeling as a tool. Oberlin College proposes to change this and is well positioned to do so. By introducing dynamic systems modeling into introductory courses in 11 science disciplines, the College will expose the majority of its eventual science majors to these powerful techniques at least twice in their first two years of study. When coupled with follow-up efforts at the intermediate and advanced level, the College will transform the way that most science students view complex problem solving. Oberlin will be aided in this effort by faculty and graduate students from the Center for the Study of Complex Systems at the University of Michigan, building on a vibrant relationship between the institutions. Established connections with two nationally recognized modeling experts will help to anchor the effort and give it external perspective. More than a dozen Oberlin faculty have been active in this area in recent years, and they will be among the initial cohort through which this systemic change will be accomplished. The group of faculty engaged in computational modeling will expand through the wide range of grant activities. By using dynamic systems modeling, the College will achieve its five goals for this project: integrating computational thinking into the science curriculum; developing a cohort of faculty experienced in teaching and using modeling techniques; developing a new tool for teaching computational modeling; providing cross-disciplinary teaching and curriculum development opportunities for graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher; and assessing, revising, and disseminating the most successful components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the undergraduate institution that leads the nation in students who go on to get Ph.Ds, Oberlin?s project in modeling pedagogy will have a powerful multiplier effect as its graduates enter academia and other high-impact careers, carrying the new modeling paradigm with them.  This cohort of young scientists will have an important effect since computational thinking is the key to complex problem solving in such diverse fields as public health, economics, climate change, and biotechnology. Students who have worked with models throughout their science education will be well equipped to tackle both societal and cutting edge scientific problems. This project will also produce a key piece of publicly available software for use in modeling pedagogy and research. Other products will include pedagogical modeling units across the 11 disciplines involved in this effort, and these will be disseminated through standard channel&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dynamic systems modeling is a quantitative approach to understanding how complex  systems work. It is characterized by its focus on change and the complex interactions  between multiple inputs. Specifically, dynamic systems modeling moves the focus of  attention from how individual elements change over time to the system as a whole. For  example, dynamic systems models focuses attention on the interaction of multiple  elements (e.g., salary structure, profit, and the evaluation of risk) and how changes in each  feeds back into the others. It is ideal for understanding how complex systems, such as interactions between students and teachers, unfold reciprocally over time and how many such dyadic relationships can be embedded in larger contexts, such as classrooms.  For example, dynamic systems models can be used to understand how different constellations of students can influence each other within a classroom, how teacher effectiveness can vary with different configurations of students, and how different types of students will fare in different classrooms. Understanding how such interactions unfold over time in an  analytic way, rather than through analogy, requires strong quantitative models and  powerful computational tools. More importantly, using such tools effectively (e.g.,  identifying and evaluating assumptions, understanding model limitations) requires building  upon standard critical thinking skills and the development of metacognitive skills and  algorithms.    The current research project had two major goals: to foster systems thinking across the Oberlin College curriculum and to develop a software tool that would reduce the barriers to using computational modeling.   Pedagogical accomplishments: This project successfully introduced computational modeling to students taking courses in the social (psychology, sociology, economics), life (biology, neuroscience, environmental studies), and  physical (geology, chemistry, computer science) sciences.  In addition, students engaged in research during two four-week winter term courses, an upper level research methods course, an honors project, and independent research.   A major goal of the five multi-day workshops supported by this grant was to demonstrate techniques for supporting the development of systems thinking and quantitative reasoning skills.  In the final year of the project, the workshop was designed in conjunction with the Oberlin CLEAR Center for Quantitative Reasoning and included participants whose primary interest was in quantitative literacy. Nova: A novel software tool for computational modeling:  Nova is a software platform developed to be suitable for student exercises but powerful enough for serious research applications.  It is unique in its capacity to do different types of modeling.  Unlike all other modeling platforms, Nova is capable of stock and flow, spatial, agent-based, and neural net modeling within the same software platform.   It is a multi-platform tool, and can be used on Windows, Linux, and Apple computers.  Users can also make their models available as internet applets to facilitate teaching and collaborative research (an automated version of this tool is in final development).   Nova is distributed at no cost from novamodeler.com.  We currently have over 1000 licensed users.  This site provides a broad variety of models for use in teaching and research.  It also provides an introduction to dynamic systems modeling, and extensive video tutorials on how to use Nova for different types of applications.   Investigators on this project have presented workshops on Nova in Israel, South Africa, the Netherlands, Canada, and in OH, MI and CA within the United States.  The project has resulted in 4 published papers and chapters, 4 peer reviewed conference presentations, 6 invited presentations at institutions other than Oberlin, and 2 papers distributed through the novamodeler.com website.  The novamodeler.com website was developed to distribute...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
