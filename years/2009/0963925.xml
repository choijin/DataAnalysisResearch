<AbstractNarration>Modern society is increasingly relying on wireless networks. Spectrum is the most valuable resource in a wireless network. How to share this limited resource among different users is one of the main challenges. When different users share the same spectrum, their signals cause interference to each other. Therefore, the most distinctive feature of wireless networks is the phenomenon of interference. In this research, we place special emphasis on practical considerations to ultimately find new ? realistic ? methods to deal with interference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A recent development is the idea of interference alignment which has shown that the capacity of wireless networks may be significantly higher than previously believed. Since higher rates invariably come at the cost of lower reliability, the emerging capacity results present only half the picture. This research is motivated by the need to complete this picture by evaluating the benefits of interference alignment schemes on the performance of wireless networks when both rate and reliability are of concern. The research follows three main thrusts. First, we examine the rate-reliability tradeoff of interference alignment schemes from the traditional coding perspective which places emphasis on low decoding complexity, usually at the cost of a restricted notion of optimality. Second, we examine the rate-reliability tradeoff of interference alignment schemes in the Shannon framework which allows strong definitions of optimality, usually at the cost of unbounded delay and complexity. These two thrusts are the stepping stones to the final thrust to reconcile the findings from the two distinct perspectives and use the collective insights to develop new physical layer schemes that can operate at the frontier of the rate-reliability tradeoff.</AbstractNarration>

The project            has settled a few open research problems in the literature and           have proposed new physical layer schemes that provide           properties that did not exist before. For example:     -        We           have settled the oldest open conjecture on the collapse of           degrees of freedom, also an inaugural Information Theory and           Application (ITA) Workshop open problem, to show that the           degree of freedom do collapse under finite precision channel           knowledge at the transmitters.  -        We have           designed the first            low complexity differential schemes for multi-user           multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.  -        We           have proposed new interference alignment methods that can           maintain the maximum Degree of Freedom gain and improve the ergodic mutual           information in the long-term regime, while for the first time,           provide a diversity gain greater than one in the short-term           regime.  -            We have discovered new ways in which dynamic phenomena such as         channel coherence patterns, and alternating channel knowledge,         whether naturally present or deliberately imposed upon the         network, affect the available degrees of freedom per user.     The project            has produced 18 journal papers and many conference papers and           presentations.  We have            disseminated our research results through these papers and by           presenting them in  invited           talks, keynote/plenary talks, and IEEE Communications            Society Distinguished Lectures in different venues.  One of            the projectÆs journal papers has           received the 2015 IEEE Signal Processing Society Young Author           Best Paper Award. Two of the projectÆs conference            papers have received Best           Paper Awards in IEEE Globecom 2012 and IEEE Globecom 2014.           Another projectÆs conference paper was selected among           the Best of Globecom'14.  We have            advised many PhD students who have done their PhD           dissertations on topics related to this project. The graduate students who worked on the           project became familiar with cutting edge knowledge in the           field. Among students           supported in part by this project, 6 of them have already           graduated with a PhD degree. They are contributing to the           society as technical staff members of different organizations.           We have supervised undergraduate students through UCI undergraduate            research initiatives without extra costs to NSF.
