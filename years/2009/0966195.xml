<AbstractNarration>The Savannah River Scholars Program (SRSP) is increasing the number, quality and diversity of students graduating with bachelor degrees in chemistry, computer science, mathematics and physics. SRSP is offering sixteen scholarships per year, averaging $5,700 each for four consecutive years to academically talented and economically disadvantaged students. In addition to financial support, SRSP students are assigned a faculty mentor and a peer mentor. Undergraduate research is both encouraged and supported, and SRSP students attend monthly seminars on STEM research and graduate school and career opportunities. SRSP hosts a Career Connection panel composed of local industry leaders and alumni in relevant fields. Recruitment efforts focus on high school seniors planning to major in chemistry, computer science, mathematics or physics; ASU students enrolled in gateway STEM courses; part-time students; students showing interest in or engaged in undergraduate research in the targeted disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
