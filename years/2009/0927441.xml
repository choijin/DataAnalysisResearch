<AbstractNarration>This project aims to develop accurate and robust ultrahigh temperature microsensors for in situ measurement of heat-flux and dynamic pressure inside turbine engines for power generation and aircraft propulsion. The proposed sensors are based on a new class of high-temperature multifunctional materials recently developed in PIs? laboratory at University of Central Florida (UCF). The materials, named Polymer-Derived Ceramics (PDCs), possess a unique combination of excellent high-temperature durability, micromachinable capability, and tunable electronic properties, thus suitable for harsh environmental applications. In order to develop the necessary knowledge base, which will lead to the successful development of novel high temperature microsensors and sensing systems for turbine engine systems, the following research tasks will be performed within this three-year project: (i) developing capability for fine tuning the electronic properties of PDCs, (ii) optimally determining micromachining conditions for PDC sensors; (iii) modeling, designing and fabricating heat-flux sensor and dynamic pressure sensor; and (iv) characterizing the performance and high-temperature stability of the fabricated sensor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team consisting of expertise in the fields of materials science, micromachining, and sensor design/characterization. Experts from related local industries will also be involved in sensor performance evaluation&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
