<AbstractNarration>0960306&lt;br/&gt;Shaqfeh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for the acquisition of a high performance, Hybrid CPU/GPU and Visualization Cluster (HPVC) that is designed to serve the needs of 7 working groups where each is involved in HPC research to solve problems of large global and national impact. The unique aspects of the HPVC cluster lies, in the combination of state-of-the art computer visualization, enhanced performance with large datasets via GPU architecture, and the development of computational uncertainty quantification (UQ). These elements, , will be employed in the solution of interdisciplinary, multiphysics transport problems including (a) engineering Nutrient Transport in Oceanographic Coral Reef Flows (to protect our environment and save the reefs), (b) the Development of Trauma and Nanoparticle Cancer Therapies including understanding hemostasis in the microcirculation (impacting human health), (c) Modeling the Dispersion of Biological Agents in Urban Environments (for Homeland Security), (d) using Quantum Chemistry to Design Catalysts for Fuel Cells (toward sustainable energy development), (e) simulating the Molecular Dynamics of Proteins and the Ribosome (for understanding the basic processes of life), (f) developing a fundamental understanding of Jet Noise Creation (to develop effective noise mitigation strategies for jets, fans, etc.), and finally, (g) to create algorithms for Design Optimization for Sustainable Building Development (as a contribution toward the larger issue of sustainability). The HPVC will play a key role in education, via bringing CPU with GPU enhanced acceleration to the classroom in a spectrum of Stanford courses as well as new workshops on GPU computing. The concept of Uncertainty Quantification as applied to large scale HPC problems will be introduced via a new UQ pipeline as a novel software deliverable within the HPVC research program.</AbstractNarration>
