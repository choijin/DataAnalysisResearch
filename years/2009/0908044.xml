<AbstractNarration>This research program will use the multiwavelength data on the COSMOS field to select Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) with a wide range of optical and IR properties. Multi-object spectroscopy with Magellan/IMACS will be used to spectroscopically confirm ~3000 AGNs, reaching the classical Seyfert/quasar boundary at a redshift of 3 and including about 300 quasars with redshift &gt; 3. The deep multiwavelength observations will allow studies of the total AGN energy density in the universe, including a bolometric luminosity function for obscured AGN to redshift ~1 and Type 1 AGN to redshfit ~4.  Time domain data will be used to measure reverberation between the continuum and the lines.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over 13.7 billion years, the universe has evolved from a hot undifferentiated soup of radiation and fundamental particles into a cold place sparsely filled with galaxies sculpted by the action of gravity. It has become clear over the past decade  that black holes are ubiquitous in the center of galaxies and the black hole mass is proportional to the mass of old stars in the host galaxies. Black holes grow and are fueled from the same drizzle of in-falling gas and wholesale mergers that make galaxies grow. The story of galaxies and black holes are parallel story lines of cosmic history. In fact, the connection is even more intimate.
