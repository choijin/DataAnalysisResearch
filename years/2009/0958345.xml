<AbstractNarration>This infrastructure enhancement award expands the Optical Imaging Laboratory (OIL) at Brigham and Women's Hospital through the development of an image database and image analysis toolbox. The developed database integrates data obtained from multiple imaging instruments as well as an image processing toolbox implemented using Matlab. The database manages the dataflow by interacting with the imaging instruments, metadata, and the toolbox. The data model consists of four parts: (1)the raw image data, (2) image descriptor data, (3) metadata definitions from image computations, and (4) associated metadata definitions concerning cell line, reagents, subjects used in the experiment as well as information from genetics, biology, and experimental design. The toolbox features a modular design and includes a versatile graphic user interface and file input/output. Its careful design facilitates the implementation of existing and new computational techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the project serve as the backbone of a computational infrastructure for a wide variety of biology research that is increasingly relying on optical imaging and computational analysis. Broad impact of the work arises from the fact that the database and the toolbox are available to researchers and students in biology, engineering, and mathematics for research and teaching activities. Undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows involved in the work benefit from the training provided by the multi-disciplinary environment.</AbstractNarration>
