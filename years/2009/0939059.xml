<AbstractNarration>This project, InspireCT, employs vertically integrated project teams to expose students to the excitement of computational thinking in action. This vertical integration results in a hands-on, active learning experience that can occur while students are still deciding what to study as undergraduates. InspireCT will revitalize undergraduate computing education by engaging students in team project applications of computing much earlier than is done today. The project includes participants at four levels of computing knowledge: pre-college students in grades 6-12, less experienced undergraduates, advanced undergraduates, and practicing professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the center of the project are advanced undergraduates and team projects typical of computing degree capstone experiences. The less experienced students are integrated into the excitement typical of capstone projects by activities appropriate to their experience level. The professionals provide projects and mentoring to ensure good connection with professional practice and actual applications of computational thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;InspireCT also makes use of mentoring - the project explores the impact of mentoring on student learning, and also examines the positive impact of the younger students seeing the successes of the more advanced students. This is expected to engender a positive attitude among less experienced students toward the study of computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit - This project creates and disseminates a new approach to introducing and engaging students in computational thinking activities. This active learning approach is expected to improve student learning and to create a much more direct engagement with computing by "doing" rather than "hearing about" computational thinking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses upon computational thinking concepts such as problem solving, abstraction, design, and thinking algorithmically. But the project also suggests that definitions of computational thinking need to include team level, collaborative efforts since this is how most professionals engage in computational thinking. Research indicates that understanding the collaborative and social aspects of computational thinking may be central to attracting more women students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses significant challenges including shifts in instructional role, definition of appropriate activities for vertical integration, and changes in instructional role. At the same time, the project builds on a substantial base of theory and prior results in areas such as active learning, capstone projects, and gender equality in computing education. The theory and related work both indicate that the benefits could be very substantial if this project is successful in addressing the challenges and meeting the goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact - InspireCT impacts students at both the pre-college and undergraduate levels. Sparking student interest at that earlier age and improving learning outcomes via active learning constitutes a potentially transformative impact on computing education. The social and applied aspects of this approach also provide key characteristics that research shows are effective in attracting women to computing. The community building aspect of the project includes both pre-college and undergraduate instructors. The InspireCT activities are organized to help identify and establish a series of collaborations between pre-college instructors and undergraduate faculty.</AbstractNarration>

In this direction, the vehicle for interaction was student participation in Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software projects.  These projects provide an opportunity for students to observe and analyze large scale software systems, and to interact with professional developers working on these projects.  The humanitarian nature of the projects selected had the added benefit of introducing students to concepts of professional responsibility to society and computing for social good. To meet a goal of enabling instructors to engage students in computational thinking, the project team conducted professional development workshops for faculty to explain the Inspire-CT concepts and help instructors develop similar approaches for their own institutions.  The team also supported other faculty by conducting some cross-institutional projects where students from two or three institutions interacted with regard to a particular project.
