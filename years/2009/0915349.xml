<AbstractNarration>The project proposes to study which Banach spaces have the class of their &lt;br/&gt;linear subspaces and/or linear quotients closed under uniform or Lipschitz &lt;br/&gt;maps. It also proposes to study the coarse geometry of these Banach spaces &lt;br/&gt;and their subsets. Coarse maps were introduced by Gromov to study the &lt;br/&gt;geometry of groups in the large scale. The particular subsets that the project &lt;br/&gt;will focus on will be discrete metric spaces with bounded geometry, including &lt;br/&gt;expanders. As the project goes along these lines, the geometry of general &lt;br/&gt;metric spaces will be studied as well. The general aim is to extend the &lt;br/&gt;techniques from Banach space theory into the study of metric spaces. One &lt;br/&gt;of the goals will be to understand metric uniform convexity more fully. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonlinear Banach Space Theory is a branch of Banach Space Theory that &lt;br/&gt;studies the geometry of Banach spaces and their subsets under nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;maps. Banach Space Theory is a mature branch of Functional Analysis with &lt;br/&gt;well-developed techniques. The nonlinear theory rejuvenates it by bringing &lt;br/&gt;it into the service of other areas of Mathematics such as Algebraic Geometry, &lt;br/&gt;Geometric Group Theory and Theoretical Computer Science. It is one of the &lt;br/&gt;tools used in the study of the Novikov conjecture, a conjecture that spans &lt;br/&gt;several areas of Mathematics already, by studying the metric geometry of &lt;br/&gt;one object intimately tied to the manifold: its fundamental group. It also &lt;br/&gt;contributes to Computer Science by helping find a simpler geometry for the &lt;br/&gt;many metrics that appear in practice, like in Data Mining for example. In &lt;br/&gt;the meantime, it deepens the understanding of the primary objects of Banach &lt;br/&gt;Space Theory itself. The research proposed in the present project will touch &lt;br/&gt;all of these aspects of Nonlinear Banach Space Theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
