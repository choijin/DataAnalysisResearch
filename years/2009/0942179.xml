    <AbstractNarration>Computer Engineering (32)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing remote access capability for undergraduate computer engineering laboratories where cyber-enabled and hands-on laboratory environments are being created. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three computer engineering undergraduate teaching laboratories are accessible remotely. To enable the transformation of the laboratory experiments into cyber-enabled status the PIs have designed custom hardware interfaces based on programmable logic devices (FPGA units). These custom interfaces provide network functionality to the devices employed in the experiments and to the instrumentation devices such as oscilloscopes, logic analyzers and routers in order to facilitate remote access. Equipped with these new interfaces/faceplates, such devices have been configured by sending commands to the Internet address of the device. The server/client software component is focusing on intuitive user interface development for remote experiments and also facilitates integration of teleconferencing between remote students and the lab instructor and/or teaching assistant for live interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This remote lab facility is helping to attract a large undergraduate student body in computer engineering laboratories and coursework. Apart from providing the capability to allow the remote students to take laboratory based courses in the computer engineering program, this project represents the basis of laboratory transformations within other disciplines and even other undergraduate degree granting institutions.</AbstractNarration>
