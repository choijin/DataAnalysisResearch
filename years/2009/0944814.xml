    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop next generation supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) metalworking fluid (MWF) for metal forming applications. The approach is to deliver specialized environmentally-friendly lubricants containing appropriate additives with supercritical CO2, achieving tool wear rates, forces, and surface finish at least as good as aqueous-based MWFs that are currently in use. It is anticipated that a much smaller amount of MWFs will be required with this technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to enable the application of environmentally-benign MWFs in metal forming applications. At any given time, approximately 2 billion gallons of MWFs are in use in the U.S.A. This represents a massive waste stream that must be treated and remediated. Moreover, the negative effects of MWFs on worker health and safety are also of serious concerns. This technology may lead to increased sustainability and better worker health and safety in metal forming applications and relevant industries.</AbstractNarration>
