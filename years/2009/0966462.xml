<AbstractNarration>This project will produce and use extensive primary documentation (over 100 hours of digital recordings and time-coded transcriptions) to analyze the phonetics, phonology, and morphosyntax of Yolox√≥chitl Mixtec (YM), a little-studied, isolated Mixtecan verb-initial language spoken by 15,000 people in four villages within a 12 kilometer radius in coastal Guerrero, Mexico. The complex phonetics and phonology of Mixtecan languages (floating tones, sandhi, and the diversity of tonal sequences on the bimoraic tone-bearing-unit) is of significant theoretical interest. YM is noteworthy for its inventory of 5 tone levels and 18 sequences on the bimoraic tone bearing unit. Nasalization in Mixtecan languages has also attracted significant interest and here too YM is unusual in that nasal vowels are limited to word-final syllables. Syllable-initial vowels in disyllabic stems are never nasal. Finally, the acoustics of stress has received little attention in Mixtecan studies although the nature of stress in tonal languages is a complex topic of considerable theoretical concern. These and other topics in YM phonetics and phonology will be studied by an interdisciplinary research team, including a native speaker with a masters degree in linguistics and a team of phoneticians and phonologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like other Mixtecan languages, YM is verb initial, a basic word order sequence represented in only approximately ten percent of world languages. This project will provide a detailed morphosyntactical study of this unusual type and address specific research questions, such as the pragmatic and discourse implications of nonbasic word order. The development of both an extensive corpus of transcribed natural recordings and elicitation material targeting specific questions in YM morphology and syntax will provide an unusually rich set of materials for linguistic research.  In sum, this project will provide extensive primary documentation and establish an analytical base for future linguistic studies, particularly in phonetics, phonology, and morphosyntax, areas in which YM is of typological interest.</AbstractNarration>

This is not a trivial task as it is often difficult for the principal investigator of the documentation project to assemble material from a dying language that will be sufficiently complete and transparent to enable other researchers to utilize the archived materials to good effect. The present project has benefited from collaboration with three other NSF-funded projects, all of which utilized the Mixtec material that has resulted from the "Corpus and lexicon development" effort: (1) an extensive corpus of digital audio and video recordings, all transcribed and annotated, and many translated; (2) the framework of a dictionary with over 2,500 entries and double that amount of subentries; (3) grammatical notes on Yoloxochitl Mixtec phonology and morphology. The collaboration took place as the "Corpus and lexicon development" project was active and thus served as a way to evaluate and re-evaluate how language documentation projects need to develop and archive their material results so that other researchers will be able to discover and use them. Included among the collaborations was a project that pioneered automated speech recognition for the endangered language, Yoloxochitl Mixtec, that presented problems not often found in the major languages for which such tools are usually developed. Three US undergraduate students and two graduates participated in these collaborative ventures.</p> <p class="TableContents">In addition to the aforementioned collaboration with other NSF-supported projects, "Corpus and lexicon development" also reached across disciplinary boundaries. With financial support from a Mexican government institution, an extensive study of traditional Yoloxochitl Mixtec knowledge (names, classification, and use) of local plants was carried out over the course of a year. This resulted in over 1,250 collections of plants, many of which were named and used Yoloxochitl Mixtec consultants. A professor of entomology and his undergraduate student also worked on this project, providing the scientific names of insects that they collected, names that are essential to understanding the meaning of Yoloxochitl Mixtec terms for these insects.</p> <p class="TableContents">In sum, the linguistic, ethnographic, and biological material that this project has produced has already had an impact on scientific research in various fields.</p> <p class="TableContents">&nbsp;</p> <p class="TableContents">BROADER IMPACT</p> <p class="TableContents">As already mentioned, the " Corpus and lexicon development" project has worked collaboratively with other NSF-support projects, collaborations that involved the training of both undergraduate and graduate students in linguistics, computer science, and biology.
