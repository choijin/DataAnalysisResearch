<AbstractNarration>This project aims to study systems with dipoles, e.g., atoms or molecules with directional nonlinear electric interactions. One goal is to utilize these nonlinear interactions to import them in a true manner between matter (e.g., atoms) and light (photons), and thus to make very low-intensity light nonlinear, to apply, for example to switches or "photonic quantum information." In addition, "superradiance" in dipole matter that allow laser-like phenomena will be studied in very general setups that allow a multitude of systems, ranging from atoms to spins in semiconductors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four areas of education and outreach will be promoted during this project. (i) Many of the topics attract particular interest from students, and will involve them inside and outside the classroom. (ii) Seminars are regularly organized around the topics. (iii) As a woman, the PI is particularly well placed to attract, and has a history of attracting, specifically female students, and helping them to succeed. (iv) Outreach in undergraduate institutions and through departmental programs for even younger students. These activities will complement efforts to build an active AMO community at the University of Connecticut.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 1. Superradiance:  Superradiance is an effect where natural spontaneous decay strongly increases. It turns out that "optical density," the amount that light interacts with a medium per length, is the most important predictor for the presence of superradiance. We also found that superradiance is most likely a constant presence in most experiments involving transitions of molecular vibrational and rotational states.   2. Nonlinear quantum optics with dipolar arrays and ion crystals  Single quanta of any kind - in our case, photons, single-ion excitations, and phonons (quanta of system vibrations) - are very hard to control by themselves, and even harder to couple to each other in a deterministic way. We suggested a way that (unexpectedly) utilizes the &radic;N factor of an in-between step (in our case, N is the number of ions involved) to increase this coupling, something previously thought fundamentally impossible.  3. Nonlinear optics with quantum dot and diamond NV center nuclear spins  Every diamond has tiny faults, where a carbon atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom. This creates a localized "artificial" atom which can be used for, for example, quantum computing in a similar way as atoms or ions in a trap. The advantage of the NV centers are that no extra trap is needed and the setup works at room temperature. The worst enemy for utilizing this system is the line broadening due to randomly oriented nuclear spins. "Cooling" those spins (i.e., limiting their influence from a random spread of values to one definite one) has been a major goal in the field since years. We have been studying some promising cooling scheme and its dynamics.   4.

For example, the index of water is around 1.3, thus, light bends when going from air to water. Water, glass, and diamond, however, are most of the very few materials where the light both, does not get absorbed but bent considerably.

Quantum information  Two projects in this area: In the first, we investigated the maximal boundaries of the space where quantum mechanics is valid vs. that where causality is valid. This resulted in a new type of inequalities (similar to the so-called "Bell inequalities" that brought one of the most unequivocal proof of the correctness of quantum mechanics) and the finding that the space of causality is indeed slightly bigger than that which quantum mechanics occupies.  The second project showed that (unexpectedly) Dicke superradiance, which is based on the most "entangled" many-particle states, does not create, itself, entanglement.  6. Dynamic Casimir effect  This is an effect where by shaking cavity mirrors photons are created out of vacuum. Since extremely high shaking frequencies are needed, this is extremely hard to demonstrate experimentally. New so-called "optomechanical" schemes, where different types of oscillating membranes, cantilevers, or similar are coupled to an optical field, should allow to explore the Dynamic Casimir regime. We are suggesting such a scheme.       La...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
