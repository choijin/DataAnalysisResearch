<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit. Wolbachia are bacteria that live within cells of invertebrates, are transmitted from mother to offspring, and share a variety of relationships with their arthropod and nematode hosts. As a "reproductive manipulator," Wolbachia interferes with host reproduction by methods that enhance its transmission. Other Wolbachia are mutualists or pathogens that are targets for the control of insect-vectored human disease.  These symbionts fundamentally change the ecology and evolutionary trajectory of their hosts. Here the investigator will use project funds to support the travel and participation of students and postdoctoral associates at the Sixth International Wolbachia Conference, to be held at Asilomar Conference Center, Monterey, CA, June 9-14, 2010.  The conference is moderate in size (75-125), international, and multidisciplinary, including genomicists, cell biologists, ecologists, evolutionary biologists and systematists. At Wolbachia conferences, ideas are exchanged, collaborations are initiated or maintained, students find postdoctoral opportunities, and postdoctoral associates establish the professional network they need to attain a permanent position. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. Although the biennial conference has been held five times already, none have been held within the continental United States. This conference will attract American students and postdoctoral associates for whom previous meetings have been inaccessible.  Students and postdoctoral associates, including women and underrepresented groups, will be recruited to attend the meeting via flyers at meetings, listservs and word of mouth.  Further, the conference will include dissemination of research results and educational impacts beyond the scientific community.  Summer students in a minority access program for undergraduates (MARC) will attend a day of talks, and interact with conference participants.  Further, with the travel funds provided by this project, a teacher with experience implementing a high school science curriculum module featuring Wolbachia will be invited to speak and participate in the meeting.  Dissemination of the meeting results to other scientists will be enhanced by the publication of presentation abstracts in an open-access online journal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary We were awarded funding for graduate student and postdoctoral travel to an international conference "The Sixth International Wolbachia Conference" on the subject of bacteria that live inside insects, the best known of which is the symbiont Wolbachia.  With the funding that we were awarded, we were able to support 19 graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, researchers from developing countries and a K-12 teacher to attend the conference.  These young colleagues were able to present their research, much of it of great interest to the whole community, and learn the latest research findings from other laboratories from 21 countries around the world.  This funding significantly enhanced the quality of the conference because it allowed participation of several young promising researchers.  The conference itself was held for the first time in the continental United States, and attracted many students and new participants from the US.   The topic of the conference Wolbachia are inherited, intracellular bacteria that live in many arthropods and nematodes and have changed the way we view symbiosis.  As a æreproductive manipulator,Æ Wolbachia interferes with host reproduction by methods that enhance its transmission. Other Wolbachia are mutualists or pathogens that are targets for control of insect-vectored human disease.  These symbionts fundamentally change the ecology and evolution of their hosts, and have been implicated in the evolution of sex determination mechanisms and speciation.   The nature of the conference The conference was held at Asilomar Conference Center, June 9-14, 2010.  The conference was moderate in size (~125 people), and was diverse in every respect.  While most of the participants were graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and junior and senior researchers, we also had undergraduate and high school participants.  Researchers came from 21 countries, including Europe, the Middle East and Asia.  The conference was 40% women, and multidisciplinary, including genomicists, cell biologists, ecologists, evolutionary biologists and systematists.  It was designed to foster interaction among all of its participants, with a single oral session, communal meals, breaks for discussion, and highly attended and interactive poster sessions. Who was awarded funding Travel funding was awarded competitively based on the presentation abstract and funding level was based on distance and need.  We awarded funds to 10 graduate students and 4 postdoctoral scholars at US institutions; 8 of these female, 6 male.  We awarded funding to one senior colleague who did not have funding to attend (from Puerto Rico).  We awarded funding to two graduate students and two postdoctoral scholars from developing countries (Ghana, Egypt, Argentina and India), and we awarded funding to a high school teacher, who spoke to us about implementing a curriculum supplement on symbiosis in a high school classroom.
