<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the further development of the inter-disciplinary Nanomedicine Science and Technology doctoral program at Northeastern University. The purpose of this program is to train the next generation of scientists and technologists who are skilled in research at the interface of nanotechnology, biology and medicine, are aware of the path to translate fundamental knowledge to marketplace products, are informed of the ethical and social issues relating to the discipline, and have a strong sense of community involvement as well as a global perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mentored by a team of internationally renowned scientists, technologists, and medical researchers, IGERT Nanomedicine trainees will participate in a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary research program that utilizes revolutionary developments in nanotechnology to develop therapeutic and diagnostic agents of nanometer dimensions with multi-functional capabilities for diagnostics, imaging and therapeutic benefit. The program will create a unique partnership between Northeastern University, minority-serving institutions University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez and Tuskegee University, and Harvard Medical School member hospitals, and is committed to a target goal that a majority of the IGERT Nanomedicine trainees will come from under-represented populations. The interdisciplinary model of graduate education will serve as a model to academic institutions world-wide. The vigorous outreach program will impact a broad segment of K-12 schools in Massachusetts, Alabama and Puerto Rico, and will encourage K-12 students from under-represented communities to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas of higher study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

To implement our program goals, we established a curriculum that combines experiential research, didactic learning, networking, and outreach. Activities specifically created for the Nanomedicine program included 4 specialized courses, a weekly seminar series, formalized co-mentoring for each student, an internship requirement, and outreach activities. Since 2011, the program has recruited 27 doctoral students from 10 STEM disciplines to participate in the 2-year specialization program. PhD students admitted into the program performed a mentored research project in 1 of 9 nanomedicine focus areas.&nbsp; To-date, these trainee research projects have led to publication of 45 peer-reviewed manuscripts, 125 conference presentations, and 5 patents awarded. To ensure an interdisciplinary research experience, each trainee received mentoring from at least two individuals, including faculty members outside the student&rsquo;s home department, faculty members at other academic institutions, and/or clinicians. Trainees attended up to 4 newly created courses in Nanomedicine, including an Introduction to Nanomedicine Course (NNMD 5270), a Research Techniques Course (NNMD 5370), a Bio/Nano Commercialization Course (NNMD 5470), and a year-round Nanomedicine Seminar Series (NNMD 5272 &amp; NNMD 5474).&nbsp; This educational content was provided simultaneously to students at Northeastern University, University of Puerto Rice Mayaguez, and Tuskegee University utilizing online technologies.&nbsp; To ensure that participants acquired depth of knowledge in their core discipline, students continued to complete all degree requirements and defend a dissertation in their home department. Trainees were also provided opportunities to participate in a non-academic internships and K-12 outreach to enhance their communication skills and broaden their career horizons. 15 trainees have graduated to-date (14 with a PhD).&nbsp; 11 graduates have continued to pursue careers in research and of these, 6 (55%) are actively performing nanomedicine research. &nbsp;The success of the Nanomedicine program was made possible in part by its unique academic environment, including Northeastern University&rsquo;s commitment to interdisciplinary scholarship and translational research, as well as its proximity to 8 different research hospitals. This unique academic environment, combined with the programmatic elements developed under the IGERT grant, have allowed us to build a robust and dynamic Nanomedicine program with avenues for continued viability.&nbsp; Most recently, Northeastern University has approved the creation of a Graduate Certificate Program in Nanomedicine which will begin enrolling students in Fall 2017.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/29/2016<br>      Modified by: Srinivas&nbsp;Sridhar</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0965843/0965843_10018176_1481663847516_IGERTphoto--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0965843/0965843_10018176_1481663847516_IGERTphoto--rgov-800width.jpg" title="IGERT Nanomedicine Trainees"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0965843/0965843_10018176_1481663847516_IGERTphoto--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="IGERT Nanomedicine Trainees"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Trainees of the 2011-16 IGERT Nanomedicine Science and Technology PhD Program.</div> <div class="imageCredit">www.northeastern.edu/IGERT</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Srinivas&nbsp;Sridhar</div> <div class="imageTitle">IGERT Nanomedicine Trainees</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
