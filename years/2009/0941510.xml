<AbstractNarration>Ecosystems have changed more rapidly in the past 50 years than at any other time in human history. Lakes are exemplars of change, as a variety of social, landscape and climate factors drive globally pervasive degradation of lake water quality and quantity. National and international ecological networks play a valuable role in monitoring the world?s ecosystems through continuous automated sensing of key environmental variables. The Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) has been amassing data from lake-sensor networks around the world. In this project, GLEON scientists transform ecological sensor networks from data collectors to knowledge generators through integration of the people, data, and cyberinfrastructure of lake-sensor networks. Scientists use three-dimensional lake simulation and advanced signal processing algorithms to exploit information embedded in sensor network data, as well as data from non-traditional sources, such as Web sites that log observations of city and state employees who monitor the lakes. Automated coupling of diverse data sources with simulation models will provide near-real-time prediction of lake conditions. With new data and model integration, scientists will gain new understanding into socially relevant environmental issues, such as the development of harmful algal blooms and the roles lakes play in the global carbon cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaborative efforts of lake ecologists, computer scientists, and information technologists will yield transformations for the scientific disciplines and benefits for the broader community. The use of non-traditional data from the Internet will reveal new pathways for multi-discipline collaborations that study how ecosystems and societies interact. The rapidly expanding field of environmental sensor networks will benefit by use of the data-model integration techniques developed here. The insights into data-model coupling gained by computer scientists will be of benefit to other disciplines, such as the social sciences and biological epidemiology, in which diverse data sources and complex models are applied to complex problems. Finally, the novel and advanced techniques developed will enable the next generation of scientists to study lakes in ways not previously possible. Teams of students from multiple disciplines will participate in the creation of these new technologies, fostering collaborations that will lead to exchange of ideas and the emergence of a new way of studying our natural systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The GLEON Cyber-enabled Discovery and Innovation (CDI) program, funded by the US National Science Foundation, uses computational thinking to advance lake network science. Computational thinking is viewed as tight coupling between advanced methodologies in computer science and ecology that melds rapidly expanding and diverse data sets with novel ecosystem analytical models. Embedding CDI technologies in the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON), an international grassroots network of lake scientists, not only delivers the power of cyber infrastructure to lake scientists but empowers them to guide the rapid evolution of those technologies toward their needs.  Intellectual merit: Important successes of the GLEON CDI fall loosely into the following five categories, and additional information can be found at the GLEON Web site.  (1) Data federation:  CDI has helped GLEON lake observatories stream data from sensor networks to their local repositories; enabled new kinds of ecological analyses through melding modeling skills with distributed computing CI (i.e., HTCondor); and created the network of people, including mutual understanding and trust relationships, necessary to bring data resources together for ecological analyses. (2) Analytical model development: GLEON CDI has helped create an open-source hydrodynamic-water quality model (i.e., numerical simulation) that conforms to æstandardizedÆ data input/output, as well as æstandardizedÆ communication between model components and has brought that simulation capacity to the broader ecological community. The simulation, called GLM AED2, is now in use by eight other funded research projects, including that of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection for its climate change research on NYC drinking water reservoirs.  (3) Cyberinfrastructure development: Through collaborations of the UW HTCondor project, GLEON CDI has improved how ecologists use distributed computing resources to run analytical models.  Where one computer might take days or weeks to run thousands of lake simulations, HTCondor can run those simulations in minutes to hours.  In addition to the use of HTCondor, software to connect GLM AED2 to HTCondor was developed to make it easier for ecologists to access these resources and ecologists were trained in the use of HTCondor. GLEON CDI also developed Web technologies for tracking scientific projects of all kinds within the lakes community.  These technologies give credit to participants, inform the general public and scientific communities of science progress, and track the use of scientific data and the products created with those resources.
