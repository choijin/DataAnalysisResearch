<AbstractNarration>Application of molecular analytical techniques for identifying marine microbes, viruses, specific genes, and gene products is central to oceanographic research, monitoring and resource management practices, but generally such methods require transporting samples to a laboratory for processing. This requirement typically results in delays ranging from many hours to days between collection of material and its analysis. Hence, development of instrumentation that overcomes this impediment is seen as a priority. Previously, the PI's approached this problem through development of the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP). The ESP is a field-deployable system that allows for application of molecular probe methodologies remotely in situ, including DNA and protein probe arrays, as well as real-time PCR. Applications of the ESP are currently restricted to moorings or benthic installations that can be embedded within a larger observatory framework. Since the number of moorings that can be deployed at any given time is limited and because they are fixed geographically, the ability to interrogate the "patchiness" of target communities and to assess their dynamics in response to changing environmental conditions from a remote perspective is limited. The PI's propose to overcome this limitation and compliment existing ocean observing technologies by modifying the ESP to fit on mobile platforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to fit the instrument on a 12" diameter propeller-driven AUV, though the same device could also be integrated on other platforms as well (e.g., profiling mooring or float, drifter). This can be accomplished by repackaging and eliminating some elements of the current ESP, and by combining that device with a field deployable, multi-channel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor. Like the current ESP, the new instrument will be suitable for use with nucleic acid and protein-based assay chemistries, and support sample archiving so that material can be brought back to a laboratory for later analyses. However, its configuration will be aimed at fewer target species/metabolites for a given deployment, consistent with focused AUV reconnaissance operations. Such real-time detection capability will create unique opportunities for oceanographers and resource managers, particularly when placed within an integrated ocean observatory network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational and outreach benefits from numerous undergraduates, graduate students, post docs, technical staff, and senior faculty working with the ESPs through various projects; various summer internship programs provided by WHOI and Biosecurity, Inc. for undergraduates including minority students; Monterey Bay Aquarium has included the ESP in a program that runs twice a day reaching almost 300,000 people a year. Although one reviewer described the broader impacts as somewhat predictable, the PI's have a broad base of resources available to them and their ability to utilize these has been demonstrated in the past.</AbstractNarration>
