<AbstractNarration>As networks move outside professionally-managed environments to end-users become tasked with deploying, managing, securing, and troubleshooting their networks. Evidence shows that end-users cannot manage networks, and their rejection of these technologies represents a significant barrier to the adoption of advanced applications. This research will lower the barrier, by demonstrating how the challenges of human-network interaction must be solved with new technical approaches. Through empirical methods, we will produce datasets detailing the challenges, the needs of the users who both manage and live with such networks, and the opportunities for network design. We will develop an initial architecture that centralizes many network functions. This research will extend this architecture and deploy and evaluate it in people?s homes. The results will produce sound, generally-applicable principles for more usable network design. These principles will be particularly applicable to contexts where no formal network administrator is present. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our work benefits society in three distinct ways. Usable home networking is on the critical path for computing research innovation. Research results will teach the next generation of engineers how to design usable networking. The integration of usability concerns into the core of computing reflects the growing diversity of careers in IT, and opens up the possibility of increasing the participation of women and minorities in computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to investigate ways to improve the relationship between the average user and their home network.  Home networks are generally unmanaged, yet consistitute a significant fraction of the Internet "edge" today, so this is an important problem.  But it requires understanding how people actually use their networks, and there is not much data available to researchers on that topic, in part because of privacy concerns.  The project had 3 main outcomes.    First, software for collecting data on home networks in a manner that preserves privacy, but still allows meaningful comparisons across homes.  Since some users are This code is open source, freely available, and runs on commodity home network routers.  The performance cost of the data collection facility (in terms of normal router functionality) is negligible. Data can be collected on the home router for local use, then anonymized and uploaded to a research server.    Second, another software component:  a "dashboard" that allows the home user to view the collected data about network usage in an intuitive  graphical format.  The dashboard shows which devices on the "inside" home network are connected to which "outside" endpoints (See image labeled "Home Router Dashboard".)  The relative thickness of the bars  indicates the  amount of traffic traveling between the inside and outside devices.    Third, we deployed our data collection software in about 40 homes, and collected data for more than six months.  This data gives us insight into how home networks are used, and also allows us to observe trends over time.  For example, about half the homes in our study had more than 20 different devices connected to the home network during the data collection period.  Our dataset is unique in that it provides visibility into both inside and outside endpoint usage.  (Service providers cannot collect this data; for technical reasons, they cannot distinguish traffic coming from different internal devices behind the same home router.)    The project also had some broader outcomes.  A student produced software for securely managing the home router from a cell phone.  Multiple students developed improved technical and programming skills.  The project provided a topic for a graduate student's PhD thesis.
