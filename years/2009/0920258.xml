<AbstractNarration>PI: Ben Ford Holt III,&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: IOS-0920258&lt;br/&gt;Project Title: "Functional analysis of multi-gene complexes regulating photoperiod-dependent flowering time" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For even the most casual observer, it is well known that plant flowering (reproduction) is coupled to the seasons. This is no accident - like all successful organisms, plants evolved with the unique problems of their native environments and have developed the ability to grow and reproduce under optimal conditions. Because agricultural productivity depends heavily on the timing of developmental events, discovering how plants use changes in their environment to determine when to begin flowering is an important question in plant biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In temperate climates, such as the United States, many environmental variables change throughout the year. As changes in day length (or "photoperiod") are essentially identical between years, many plants use this as an accurate signal to trigger flowering at the correct time. Although scientists are beginning to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms used by plants to determine photoperiod, there is still much to learn. This project is focused on several new genes that are necessary for the appropriate timing of flowering in response to changing photoperiod. Plants with mutant versions of these genes lose the ability to properly use day length as a cue to flower; instead, they flower several weeks or even months later than normal. Although the identity of these genes is known, it is not known how theses genes help plants flower at the right time. These same genes are involved in a second developmental transition - the shift from seed dormancy to germination. Using the combined tools of genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry, this project will address 1) how these genes are acting to turn on flowering in the plant cell, and 2) how they are functioning to simultaneously control seed germination. Because both flowering time and seed dormancy are important agricultural traits, understanding how these processes intersect is essential to enhancing future crop performance.</AbstractNarration>

This is an important question for understanding natural ecosystems in a world with changing climates, as well as engineering improved agricultural crops. How a plant knows when to flower turns out to be a very complex question because plants can perceive many environmental changes. One of the most important environmental cues that triggers flowering is day length (or photoperiod). Photoperiod is a very dependable cue because it is always the same, year after year.

Our task was to determine which particular family members were involved in the process (i.e., previous data pointed in this direction, but did not specifically identify the correct genes). The plant we study, mouse ear cress, is a small annual plant that flowers rapidly when day length exceeds 12 hours. Therefore, we isolated plants with mutations in NF-YC genes and looked for ones that could no longer rapidly flower in long days. Mouse ear cress has 10 NF-YC genes and we eventually discovered that three of them - called NF-YC3, NF-YC4, and NF-YC9 - work together to regulate flowering time. To make this determination, we had to create plants with simultaneous mutations in all three genes and examine when they flowered (Figure 1).</p> <p>We additionally made the exciting discovery that these same NF-YC genes also have a role in the perception of a hormone called abscisic acid. Abscisic acid is involved in many aspects of plant stress resistance, including resistance to the effects of drought. High levels of abscisic acid also prevent seeds from germinating under unfavorable conditions, including drought. Our data showed that NF-YC genes are necessary to prevent early seed germination due to elevated abscisic acid.

Many researchers are currently interested in Brachypodium because it is related to other economically important grasses, such as wheat and barley. In these studies we described all the NF-Y genes in Brachypodium and predicted their likely functions.
