<AbstractNarration>The PI's will study foundational questions that arise in the study of mathematical models inspired by applied science and mathematical research. One of the problems, the so-called third boundary problem, is a mathematical model for real systems with semipermeable membranes. The PI's will develop the mathematical theory of such systems with fractal structure. The quality of approximation of continuous processes by discrete models will be investigated. Simple stochastic processes, such as Brownian motion, can be perturbed in various ways, for example, by inert drift or oblique reflection. These more complicated models require new mathematical tools which will be developed. The PI's will study some multiparticle systems confined to bounded domains. Several mathematical tools will be sharpened, including new versions of the boundary Harnack principle and heat kernel estimates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop theoretical mathematical tools needed in and inspired by scientific application of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;The applied phenomena that gave rise to the ideas under consideration include natural semipermeable membranes, such as human lungs, and man-made objects, such as catalytic converters and car batteries.&lt;br/&gt;Some of the applications are related to computer science, especially approximation of real continuous phenomena with digital models suitable for computer based analysis. The PI's will also study mathematical models describing populations undergoing evolution according to various schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit     The PI's investigated a number of problems in stochastic analysis, its applications and related areas. The contributions include the following.  New techniques were developed to analyze branching processes.  Markov processes indexed by a new class of parameter spaces were defined and investigated.  Archimedes' Principle was proved for a mathematical model. It was shown that the mass density does not have to be harmonic if the particles in the approximating system are not point-like.  Foundations of probability were examined and a new approach was developed.  Couplings of reflected Brownian motions were related to deterministic pursuit problems.  Uniqueness of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations was analyzed.  Stationary distributions for processes with jumps were investigated.  New results were developed for isolated zeros of Brownian motion.  Synchronous couplings of reflected Brownian motions outside 3-dimensional sphere were analyzed.  A new discrete approximation scheme for normally reflected Brownian motion in arbitrary domains was developed.  A type of branching processes were shown to undergo extinction in finite time for any population size. A system of fractal mirrors was developed to emulate random reflections by means of the classical specular reflections.  A class of fractals was constructed with the property of large projections but virtual invisibility in case of reflective coating. Sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates have been established for various stochastic models that exhibit discontinuous sample paths, both on the whole space and in open subsets. Sharp Green function estimates have also been obtained. Equivalence between the analytic and probabilistic notions of subharmonic functions has been established for a large class of Markov processes (or operators).  Sharp two-sided estimates were obtained for stable processes killed upon leaving a domain with gradient perturbation inside the domain. A localization energy formula was found in the theory of Dirichlet forms. L2 and Lp theory for SPDEs driven by Levy processes were developed. A criteria of uniform integrability of exponential martingale was given and the independence of spectral bounds for generalized nonlocal Feynman-Kac semigroup was investigated.  Space-time fractional diffusion on bounded domains was studied. Sharp global heat kernel estimate for relativistic stable processes in exterior open sets was derived.  Stability of Dirichlet heat kernel estimates for non-local operators under Feynman-Kac perturbation was established. A probabilistic approach to mixed boundary value problems for elliptic operators with singular coefficients was developed.      Broader Impacts  Contributions to Other Disciplines  Several contributions to mathematical physics and technology were made, for example, Archimedes' Principle was proved for a mathematical model; it was shown that the mass density does not have to be harmonic if particles in the approximating system are not point-like; sharp heat kernel and Green function estimates have been established for relativistic stable processes, which arise naturally in quantum Hamiltonian systems; systems of mirrors were developed to create arbitrary reflection directions (limited only by a conservation law) - these may serve to construct new solar energy power plants.  A contribution to statistics and philosophy was made: Scientific foundations of probability theory and statistics were examined and a new theory was developed.   Contributions to Human Resource Development  The PI's supervised seven doctoral students, one post-doc and two visiting graduate students. The students learned mathematical techniques, writing skills and improved their communication skills. The research findings were presented at multiple conferences with audiences consisting of established researchers, graduate students, junior faculty and researchers (statisticians) based outside academia.
