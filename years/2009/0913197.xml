<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  OISE-0913197&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Ali Nayfeh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Virginia Polytechnic Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: US-Jordan Workshop on Middle Eastern Research and Educational Advances in Structural Health Monitoring and Control&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to hold a workshop on structural health monitoring and control (SHMC) at Jordan University in the spring of 2010.  The objectives of the workshop are threefold: (1) to host a three-day workshop in Amman, Jordan to discuss research and educational issues and trends related to SHMC, (2) to offer opportunities for the initiation of collaborative research projects between the American and Middle Eastern participants, and (3) to address issues related to the needs of local industry in SHMC.  The workshop will be focused on theoretical, numerical, and experimental developments in SHMC and their application to many types of structures. The workshop will provide a forum to disseminate new scientific, technical, and experimental concepts in SHMC.  The workshop is expected to have a broader impact on the advancement of SHMC education and to help young faculty initiate SHMC programs. This workshop will bring together many experts in the field of SHMC to discuss current issues and trends related to new theoretical, numerical, and experimental methods.  This interaction will create synergy between American faculty and partners from Middle Eastern countries. They can mutually benefit by establishing collaborative research work in the field of SHMC with an international dimension. It is anticipated that this workshop will give the SHMC education issues greater international exposure.  The funds requested will provide travel support for US participants who will meet with participants from Middle Eastern countries including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Palestine, and Lebanon.  Among the benefits to the US are (1) familiarizing the regional participants with US practices, software, actuators, instrumentation networks, and sensors produced in the US, and (2) advancing the knowledge and expertise of US participants in the area of applying SHMC techniques to historical monuments and archeological sites.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
