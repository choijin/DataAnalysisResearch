<AbstractNarration>This project will continue work on the development of methods for the formation of C-C and C-N bonds by facile oxidative reactions.  While dimerizations of phenol derivatives are well-recognized processes, little progress has been made in the development of catalytic asymmetric methods for the formation of chiral biaryls via oxidative dimerization.  Studies to further elucidate the mechanism of the complex catalytic cycles involved will be undertaken.  Hypothesis driven screening of ligands with transition metal oxidants will be carried out to identify new useful catalysts.  The developed catalysts will also be used to discover new oxidative reactions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Marisa Kozlowski of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania.  Professor Kozlowski's research efforts revolve around the development of facile oxidative methods for the formation of C-C and C-N bonds.  Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as oxygen is used as the terminal oxidizing agent.  Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and materials science industries.</AbstractNarration>

This type of process is highly attractive due to use of O2 as a reagent.  In addition to low cost, oxygen is a stable, environmentally benign oxidant the reactivity of which is readily controlled by dilution.  The only byproducts with O2 as an oxidant are water. While oxidation catalysts to manage functional groups are well established (i.e., hydroxyl to ketone), reactions involving union of components in an oxidative manner are much less explored.

This project has resulted in the development of methods for the formation of C-C and C-N bonds by facile oxidative reactions. Ten publications have arisen to date.         Broader Impact:  The broader impact of this work includes the development of environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis.  Specifically, the combination of simple, inexpensive base metal catalysts with oxygen as terminal oxidant will decrease toxicity and costs.  As part of a long-range goal, we intend to identify conditions utilizing low concentrations of oxygen which are compatible with organic solvent, even on a manufacturing scale.  New methods that provide simple and selective routes to known and new chemical entities are critical to the advancement of modern science.  The research activities described in this proposal are interdisciplinary.  As such, students engaged in these research projects learned to apply concepts from several different areas.  They acquired knowledge and experience needed for advanced study or employment in technological/scientific sectors of our economy. While the research program focused primarily on the efforts of graduate students, components of the program are amenable to inexperienced coworkers and were explored by undergraduates including those in the University of Pennsylvania NSF-REU program. Significant training opportunities were afforded to 7 undergraduate students (3 women), 7 graduate students (4 women, 2 minority, 1 disabled), and one visiting scholar.
