<AbstractNarration>0946297 &lt;br/&gt;Spero&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding over 24 months to acquire an excimer laser and quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) for high-resolution paleoclimatological elemental and isotopic measurements. The requested configuration will allow analyzing a broad suite of elements and isotopes. Various geological materials can be analyzed and the instrument offers a rapid (&lt;0.5 sec/analysis) sample throughput. The laser will offer ultra-high resolution (micron to nanometer spatial scale), and the system will have minimal inter-sample memory problems. Accuracy and precision will be comparable to wet plasma ICP-MS systems. The system will especially useful for measuring  Metal/Ca (e.g. Mg/Ca, Ba/Ca, B/Ca etc.) and stable isotopes (carbon and oxygen). Research will focus primarily on paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic questions but the instrumentation will be applicable to many geoscientific-related themes. The new instrument will be a valuable training tool for graduate students, post-docs and exceptional undergraduates. The instrument will be used for teaching by the PI and Co-PIs in graduate and undergraduate geochemistry courses and undergraduate research projects and senior theses. This state-of-the-art instrumentation, unique in the US will allow the PIs, students and postdocs to remain at the forefront of new research areas and techniques. The instrument will be moved into a recently-renovated laboratory space. The PIs will collectively be responsible for operation and maintenance. Grant income and recharge funds will be used to maintain the instrument and support a technician. The administration will fund major repairs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
