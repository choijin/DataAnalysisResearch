<AbstractNarration>Mantle plumes are thought to be responsible for creating ocean archipelagos including Hawaii, Easter, and Galápagos. Similarly, mid-ocean ridges are an essential driving force in plate tectonics. The Galápagos Archipelago is one of the few places on the planet where mantle plumes and mid-ocean ridges interact, providing a rare opportunity to improve our understanding of Earth's important dynamic processes.  This research  develops a multi-disciplinary perspective on plume-ridge magmatic and tectonic interaction using geophysical data and geochemical analysis of rocks collected from the seafloor.  Work includes carrying out a detailed bathymetric and gravity survey of the North Galapagos seafloor.  Deep-sea camera traverses and rock dredging also provide essential data to resolve seafloor structural fabric and information about the crust and upper mantle. Geochemical analyses of collected lavas provide essential information for determining mechanisms by which plume material is transported between the archipelago and the mid-ocean ridge.  This project is a fully integrated research and teaching collaboration between undergraduate (Colgate University) and research institutions (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of Idaho). Undergraduates participate fully in the project including the cruise and subsequent extended research projects during which they develop cutting edge analytical skills and present their work at international conferences. Broader impacts also include post-doctoral fellow support and training of students from Ecuador and marine biologists from the Charles Darwin Research Station, the primary institution responsible for conservation and research in the archipelago. Impacts of the work will assist in ongoing conservation efforts in the Galapagos.</AbstractNarration>
