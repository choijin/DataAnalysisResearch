<AbstractNarration>SES-096662&lt;br/&gt;Ross Matsueda&lt;br/&gt;University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses a crucial social problem facing contemporary America: criminal violence in local communities. An innovation of the project is the specification of a multi-level model, in which individual choices produce community social capital, which affects crime rates. The direction of this effect depends on how social capital is used--either to facilitate or control crime.  Crime rates are hypothesized to be high when organization in favor of crime is strong and low when organization against crime is strong. The project studies organization against crime by examining how neighborhood social capital and collective efficacy are produced. Residents are hypothesized to act rationally: they exchange favors and information when they have an incentive to do so (e.g., needing help fixing a car) and are free of constraints (e.g., they have the time to reciprocate). In turn, these incentives and constraints are hypothesized to be a function of broader community structures and resources. Exchange among residents has a positive externality--the  creation of neighborhood social capital, including trust, social ties, obligations, and norms. The resulting social capital provides resources for collective efficacy, the ability of a neighborhood to solve local problems, such as crime. Collective efficacy is, in turn, hypothesized to reduce neighborhood criminal violence. A final hypothesis to be tested is that the correlation between neighborhood disorder and violence, based on the broken windows hypothesis, is actually spurious because collective efficacy explains both disorder and violence. The project also investigates organization in favor of crime by testing the hypothesis that a violent street culture based on the code of the street develops in structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods. Residents, particularly young black males, are hypothesized to have less human capital, poor labor market prospects, and few resources, leading to alienation from society. This alienation is hypothesized to be exacerbated by observations of racial bias and profiling by police, which leads to distrust, and in turn, increases the likelihood of turning to the streets to resolve disputes and gain respect, status, and credibility. It is hypothesized that when such alienated residents reach a critical mass in the presence of social capital, their frustration is translated into a neighborhood system of achieving status through a code of the street (e.g., never back down from a fight, always retaliate when a peer is disrespected, project a tough image on the street). Finally, collective efficacy and neighborhood street codes are hypothesized to interact in their effects on violence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To test the hypotheses, the project will use survey data collected on nearly 6,000 households across 123 census tracts in Seattle, along with neighborhood census data and police crime data. The nested design will be used to estimate multilevel generalized linear models, including individual-level rational choice models of reciprocated exchange and distrust of police and neighborhood-level models of collective efficacy and codes of the street. To explore further the possible mechanisms by which individual action translates into macro-level outcomes, the project will sample neighborhoods on and off the regression lines, and conduct in-depth qualitative interviews of residents. This exploratory analysis will help identify causal mechanisms specified in the model, and by examining outlier neighborhoods, provide insights into mechanisms not measured in the survey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project is a key feature of the Racial Democracy, Crime, and Justice Network, an NSF-supported research network for fostering the study of race, crime, and justice and increasing diversity in the academy by mentoring junior faculty of color. The PI and several members of the project team (faculty of color) are core members of RDCJN. The project incorporates a gender and racially diverse set of graduate and undergraduate students into the research process. The PI will incorporate his research findings Into both undergraduate and graduate teaching, and make data available to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examines an important question facing social scientists, policy-makers, and citizens:  What do local communities do to make their streets safer?  Building on a long history of research in sociology and criminology on community disorganization, this project examines the concepts of social capital, collective efficacy, and informal social control.  By social capital, we mean the structure of social ties that local residents create by exchanging favors and information.  By collective efficacy, we mean the ability of a neighborhood to solve local problems.  By informal social control, we mean the ways in which neighborhoods are kept safe when residents are willing to intervene when safety is threatened.  This project asks the question of how does social capital, collective efficacy, and informal control make streets safer?  The project capitalizes on a survey we conducted in 2003, which interviewed nearly 5,000 residents residing in 123 census tracts in Seattle.  The survey collected information from residents about social capital, collective efficacy, and informal social control.  The first question we asked was whether we could measure informal social control with survey measures.  The key measures ask residents, "In this neighborhood if children are spray painting graffiti, getting into fights, etc., will your neighbors do something about it?"  Recent advances in models for measurement suggest that the reliability and validity of survey measures can be assessed at multiple levels, such as the level of the individual and the level of the neighborhood.  We found that our measures of informal control appear reliable and valid at multiple levels.  We then addressed an important question in the social sciences:  how does individual behavior produce macro-level outcomes, such as neighborhood empowerment and organization?  We examine this general question by looking at social capital, collective efficacy, and informal control.  Following rational choice economic models, we assume that residents exchange favors with neighbors for instrumental reasons:  One family agrees to watch over the children of another family in exchange for help with repairs on their home.  We find support for this proposition:  those residents who have greater needs&mdash;such as having children&mdash;and more opportunities for exchange&mdash;such as having lived in the neighborhood longer, are more likely to invest in social capital.  We hypothesize a positive externality in which neighborhoods rich in social capital can use these social ties to intervene when control problems arise.  We find support for this hypothesis:  neighborhoods rich in social capital report greater informal social control and less criminal violence.   We have also conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with local residents sampled from select neighborhoods to learn more about their perspectives and the more nuanced mechanisms of neighboring and developing community cohesion.   Our research results have implications for policy designed to create safer neighborhoods.  By encouraging local residents to develop stronger ties and invest in community, neighborhoods may have greater collective efficacy and respond more effectively to stem the tide of delinquency and crime.  Along these lines, an intervention program based on the idea of collective efficacy is currently being conducted by the city of Seattle to intervene in select crime "hotspots."
