<AbstractNarration>This award supports planning for the Sanford Center for Science Education (SCSE) which will be the exhibition and education component of the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) at the former Homestake Gold Mine in Lead, South Dakota.  In particular, the award supports  the design of what will go into the SCSE -- key program components and a preliminary design of its exhibit space. This request will also support the development of the SCSE's organizational structure and a transition plan for getting from preconstruction through Opening Day.   This science education center is planned to provide exceptionally innovative and cutting-edge exhibit experiences, expand educational opportunities for a wide array of students and teachers, and generally enhance the efforts of Homestake-DUSEL.</AbstractNarration>

Broader impacts were realized through the implementation of numerous education programs reaching tens of thousands of students, educators, and members of the general public, building understanding about the science and engineering of Sanford Lab and about science and engineering more broadly.

When "Education &amp; Outreach Planning for DUSEL" was originally awarded, a single new education facility was envisioned onsite at the underground laboratory.

The second is the Sanford Lab Homestake Visitor Center on Main Street in Lead, South Dakota (about a kilometer from Sanford Lab) that serves general public and tourist audiences and also school groups. This visitor center, which celebrated its grand opening in June of 2015 (in Year 5 of this award), features both the science of Sanford Lab and the history of Homestake Mining Company. Visitors learn through touch-screen displays, 3-dimensional models, explanatory panels, and trolley tours that include a stop at the lab. The third facility is a fully renovated Jonas Science Building at Black Hills State University (BHSU), about 30 kilometers from the lab. The Sanford Science Education Center at BHSU celebrated its grand opening in May of 2016 (in Year 6 of this award).

By capitalizing on the strengths of each partner institution and by having three distinct facilities, the Sanford Science Education Center is able to stretch limited fiscal resources and still make a sizeable impact. The SSEC touched over 15,000 K-12 students, undergraduates, and teachers and over 65,000 members of the general public during the seventh and final year of this planning award (2016-17). The host institutions for each facility pay their own general operating and maintenance costs as part of the partnership agreements, and they contribute human resources at each site to complement the core staff of the Center. Furthermore, the three-site model allows for program delivery where audiences exist naturally or have ready access.
