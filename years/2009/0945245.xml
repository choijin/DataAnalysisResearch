<AbstractNarration>This research involves one of the key challenges in wireless networks: how &lt;br/&gt;to take advantage of new advances at the physical layer to push for new &lt;br/&gt;design at the upper layers. The approach used is hitchhiking-based cooperative &lt;br/&gt;communication (CC) that takes advantage of the physical layer design that &lt;br/&gt;facilitates the combining of partial information. A node can receive several &lt;br/&gt;partial signals and combine these signals to retrieve the complete signal. &lt;br/&gt;Through effective use of partial signals, a packet can be delivered with fewer &lt;br/&gt;nodes and/or less transmission power at each node. The investigator proposes &lt;br/&gt;a new weighted graph model that can capture the nature of CC. One key concept &lt;br/&gt;proposed is the new notion of  ?link? and ?path? on which other graph &lt;br/&gt;terminologies can be defined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on this new graph model, the research focuses on two types of &lt;br/&gt;power-efficient design under CC: (1) Power saving protocols that put wireless &lt;br/&gt;nodes into periodical sleep states while maintaining global ?domination? of &lt;br/&gt;active nodes. (2) Power control for transmission energy consumption by &lt;br/&gt;adjusting transmission ranges while maintaining global ?connectivity?. &lt;br/&gt;With these, this research presents a promising and unique way of applying this &lt;br/&gt;graph model to energy-efficient design in wireless networks. This research also &lt;br/&gt;involves the design of a general methodology of localized solutions and applies &lt;br/&gt;it to address various energy-related optimization problems under CC. The central &lt;br/&gt;theme of this research fits well with the objective of the SING program on &lt;br/&gt;fundamental theoretical and algorithmic studies involving coordination and &lt;br/&gt;communication. The insights and results of this research are expected to &lt;br/&gt;provide guidelines for energy-efficiency for a wide range of wireless network &lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
