<AbstractNarration>2009 Fall Workshop on Computational Geometry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational geometry has rapidly emerged as a field of intense&lt;br/&gt;research in computer science and many related disciplines. Since many&lt;br/&gt;of the computations associated with both real and simulated physical&lt;br/&gt;systems are geometric in nature, research in computational geometry&lt;br/&gt;has been fueled by applications in numerous fields, such as computer&lt;br/&gt;graphics, geometric modeling, molecular biology, sensor networks,&lt;br/&gt;engineering design, robotics, machine vision, data mining, and&lt;br/&gt;statistics, to mention just a few.  All of these areas are on the&lt;br/&gt;forefront of current research activity in computational geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fall Workshop in Computational Geometry will be organized at the&lt;br/&gt;Department of Computer Science of Tufts University, Medford, MA,&lt;br/&gt;November 13-14, 2009.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers from academia&lt;br/&gt;and industry, to stimulate collaboration on problems of common&lt;br/&gt;interest arising in all areas of geometric computing.  The proximity&lt;br/&gt;to many universities in the Northeast will facilitate student&lt;br/&gt;involvement; requested funding is targeted particularly at making the&lt;br/&gt;workshop accessible to students, both graduate and undergraduate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the tradition of the previous workshops on Computational&lt;br/&gt;Geometry, the format of the workshop will be informal, extending over&lt;br/&gt;two days, with several breaks scheduled for discussions.  There will&lt;br/&gt;be a few (three to four) invited speakers, selected to speak on topics&lt;br/&gt;of mutual interest in computational geometry, computer graphics, and&lt;br/&gt;robotics. A key focus of the workshop will be an Open Problem Forum in&lt;br/&gt;order to promote a free exchange of questions and research challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will have broader impact in its education and involvement&lt;br/&gt;of students and young researchers, who will be exposed to the latest&lt;br/&gt;developments in the field and will be given opportunities to present&lt;br/&gt;talks and posters on their own work.  The workshop is designed to&lt;br/&gt;promote collaborations between computational geometry specialists and&lt;br/&gt;other experts in mathematical sciences and related scientific and&lt;br/&gt;engineering disciplines, in hopes of forming new alliances between the&lt;br/&gt;field of geometric algorithms and the many application domains in&lt;br/&gt;which geometric problems and issues arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information, announcements, and the workshop program will be&lt;br/&gt;available on the workshop website:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.tufts.edu/research/geometry/FWCG09/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
