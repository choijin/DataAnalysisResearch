<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate miniature radiometric sensors that conform to a surface under test and are capable of thermal imaging to varying depths via frequency adjustment.  The approach is based on the use of flexible microwave antennas within which integrated circuits are embedded to detect thermal radiation in the microwave frequency range, and dynamically adjust the sensor characteristics to account for variations in the properties of the contacting surface, such as human skin. The sensors can be applied for mobile monitoring of internal body temperature, wound healing, and other physiological phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in advancements in antenna design, nanoscale ferroelectric devices and radiometer design, enabling a transformative change in passive microwave sensing. Specific advances targeted in this research include: conformable and frequency-agile antennas; impedance-sensing integrated circuits with embedded tuning networks; and a chip-scale radiometer that can be directly integrated into the antenna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include advancements in the general field of microwave sensor design, yielding fundamentally new approaches for subsurface biomedical monitoring. Applications extend beyond biomedical systems and include uses such as wireless sensors for structural monitoring and communications devices. The industry partnerships will enable the research team to broadly disseminate results beyond the academic and research community.  The project will also engage undergraduate students, while leveraging ongoing university programs that attract underrepresented students to engineering. A new senior/graduate-level project-based course that integrates research outcomes, and includes microwave integrated circuit design and fabrication, will be developed.</AbstractNarration>
