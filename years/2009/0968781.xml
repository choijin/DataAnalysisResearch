<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wax esters are a highly valued class of lipid utilized in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, as fine lubricants, and as fuels. The study of the pathways utilized by different organisms to produce and accumulate energy storage compounds such as lipids has tremendous importance towards pursuing new routes in the production of sustainable fuels to meet growing energy demands. The wax ester is a unique biological lipid that is found in many higher plants and animals, and among a small niche of bacteria. The goal of this research program is to characterize a set of bacterial enzymes that are responsible for the synthesis of natural wax esters. The terminal enzyme in this pathway can utilize a large array of substrates to produce either wax esters, or smaller esters with properties similar to biodiesel, while relatively little is known about the other enzymes involved in producing these compounds. This work will explore the chemistry involved in these biological processes, and further aim to develop systems that alter the composition of or enhance wax ester production using model organisms. The results of these experiments will provide timely and important insights into the small array of proteins involved in these biological pathways, and the broad diversity of products that can be produced utilizing sustainable biosynthetic routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program has been developed around the emerging field of biofuels production, and encompasses a variety of approaches that make it ideal for the training of both graduate and undergraduate students alike. The studies contain both basic and applied components that will provide opportunities for advanced enzymatic characterizations for graduate students and direct analytical approaches with defined outcomes for undergraduates. Additionally, the project will include several summer internships to high school students to promote interest in science and basic research. Most commercial wax esters are synthesized from fossil fuels, and thus there is a growing interest in developing biological systems for the sustainable production of wax esters. This research is essential in further developing the field of sustainable energy to address the significant problems and global impacts associated with the continued burning of fossil fuels.</AbstractNarration>
