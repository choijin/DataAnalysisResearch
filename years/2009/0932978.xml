<AbstractNarration>0932978&lt;br/&gt;Olsen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The production of uniform-sized nanoparticles from hydrophobic organic compounds by an economical, scalable process is very challenging. One of the most advanced processes to produce functional nanoparticles of precisely controlled size is Flash NanoPrecipitation, which requires very fast mixing of two or more streams to create uniform supersaturation. Presently, Flash NanoPrecipitation has only been demonstrated in microscale reactors with small production runs. This limitation is only suitable for selected applications, such as the production of high-value pharmaceutical agents. Other applications, such as the manufacturing of nanoparticles used in pesticides and cosmetics, will require much larger production runs, making microscale reactors economically unrealistic. For this reason the fluid dynamics and scalar transport processes associated with scale up Flash NanoPrecipitation to macroscale reactors capable of generating large quantities of functional nanoparticles will be investigated using a combined experimental and modeling approach in this research project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental understanding of rapid precipitation requires a detailed knowledge of the roles of macro, meso- and micromixing on the development of supersaturation, and the scalability of the processing conditions needed for Flash NanoPrecipitation (e.g. millisecond micromixing) is an open question that will be addressed here. To answer this question, turbulent reactive mixing in a macroscale multi-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM) reactor will be studied using non-intrusive optically based measurement techniques, and the results from these experiments will be used to develop and validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of the mixing and reaction processes. The experimental techniques will include time-correlated (high-speed) stereo particle image velocimetry (SPIV), passive scalar and reactive planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF), and simultaneous PIV/PLIF. The CFD models will be based on large eddy simulations (LES) and transported probability density function (PDF) models solved using the direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM). Once developed and validated, these CFD models can be used by the chemical process industry as engineering tools for optimizing reactor design and operating parameters to produce customized functional nanoparticles in plant-scale MIVM reactors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The development of computational models of turbulent reacting flows, especially in complex swirling geometries such as in a vortex reactor, is an important technical and intellectual challenge. For example, none of the subgrid scale closures for the chemical source term in CFD models of turbulent reacting flows have been fully validated for complex liquid-phase reacting flows due to a lack of detailed experimental data for the local velocity and concentration fields in well-defined reactor geometries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Flash NanoPrecipitation shows promise for producing uniform-sized functional nanoparticles of organic compounds. However, this process has only been demonstrated in microscale reactors capable of producing only very small production runs. Scaling up the Flash NanoPrecipitation process to a macroscale MIVM reactor could greatly increase the commercial viability of this process for manufacturing a wider range of valuable end products. This project will also train students in state-of-the art engineering tools for scale up and design of chemical reactors.</AbstractNarration>

However, current techniques and processes used to manufacture functional nanoparticles suffer from process inefficiencies that make them uneconomical for widespread application and use. One method for producing functional nanoparticles is flash nanoprecipitation, which requires very fast mixing of two or more streams to create uniform supersaturation, followed by precipitation, aggregation, and particle coating to produce uniformly sized functional nanoparticles. Presently, this technique has only been demonstrated in microscale vortex reactors with small production runs. The technique also suffers from process inefficiencies due to a high concentration of unused reactants that must be separated out and discarded.  In this research project we investigated the feasibility of scaling up the flash nanoprecipitation process to macroscale reactors to increase process efficiency.  To accomplish this, we performed non-intrusive laser-based flow measurements in a prototype scaled up flash nanoprecipitation vortex reactor and developed computational fluid dynamics tools to aid in the design and optimization of vortex reactors used in the nanoprecipitation process.  The experimental work was performed using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (stereo PIV) and planar laser induced fluorescence, and the results suggest that the objective of scaling up vortex reactors for nanoparticle precipitation can be achieved.  The stereo PIV results have shown that although the Reynolds number in the scaled up vortex reactor is 35 times greater than in the microscale vortex reactor (8400 vs. 240), the normalized flow characteristics such as mean velocity and turbulent Reynolds stresses are remarkably similar.  This finding is crucial, because the success of the flash nanoprecipitation process is highly dependent on fluid mixing.  The characteristics of the flow and fluid mixing in microscale vortex reactors have proven to be ideal for the generation of functional nanoparticles.  The fact that the flow and turbulence characteristics of the macroscale vortex reactor are similar to the microscale version suggest that the scaled-up reactor can also effectively produce functional nanoparticles, but with greatly increased throughput.  Another significant finding is that over the entire range of Reynolds numbers investigated, the flow field inside the vortex reactor can be very accurately described by an analytical model consisting of two superimposed Batchelor vortices.  This finding means that reactor designers can determine what the mean flow field inside the reactor looks like without resorting to experiments or simulations.  Should designers require more detailed information on the flow within the reactor, perhaps by performing computer simulations, the results from this simple analytical model can provide them with a tool to validate the accuracy of their simulations.  The computational work has been similarly enlightening.  Simulation this swirling, highly complex, turbulent flow is a very difficult undertaking.  Our results have identified a simulation strategy that can achieve accurate results in a computationally inexpensive manner. The large eddy simulations (LES) led to the discover that while LES can very accurately reproduce the velocity and turbulence characteristics within the reactor, doing so can only be achieved by using incredibly fine computational grids.  Solving the flow on such fine grids, while possible, requires significant high performance computing time and even so, requires weeks or months to acquire a solution.  This makes LES unrealistic to use as a design tool.  Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations were also performed, but while these are computationally inexpensive, they were found to be unable to accurately model the complex flow inside of the vortex reactor.
