<AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of our proposed theoretical research is to model and simulate the quantum many-body entanglement of excitons, photons, and polaritons in semiconductor structures by means of new analytical and numerical quantum-field theoretical techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;We plan to investigate the entanglement among excitons produced by ultrashort laser pulses and the mapping of this entanglement onto photons. We plan to develop perturbative and non-perturbative theories that can account for the entanglement of excitons and photons.  As a perturbative method, we have derived a new quantum-field theoretical diagrammatic technique to describe polarization and many-body entanglement of excitons and photons in arbitrary order of the electric field or the number of excitons and photons. Our calculations take all electron and hole correlations into account, i.e. we do not treat the excitons as bosons. As a non-perturbative method, we plan to generalize the semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs) in that we additionally consider the time evolution of the two-particle correlation functions. &lt;br/&gt;Since SBEs are formulated in terms of a density matrix, decoherence due to Coulomb exchange, disorder, phonons, nuclear spins, etc. can be studied in the same framework. Taking into account the entanglement of photons with localized spins in e.g. quantum dots, we will develop a new method for quantum teleportation and quantum computing based on many-body theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational activity:&lt;br/&gt;It is our goal to provide undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of analytical and numerical quantum field theory with a personalized e-learning system that is able to adapt to the individual needs of a student by means of a back-end program code made of an artificial neural network. The front-end of our program code will teach the students the basics of quantum many-body correlations and entanglement by means of interactive visualization and game-play. Key applications based on quantum teleportation and quantum computing will ignite the curiosity of the students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact:&lt;br/&gt;Our theoretical efforts aim at producing a global quantum network over optical fibers and satellites, which requires a many-body theory for the thorough description of many-body entanglement in our semiconductor structures. Our research will create a need of scientists trained in quantum many-body physics. Consequently, teaching graduate and undergraduate students the basics of quantum many-body effects becomes essential. Our education program is the basis for boosting research in this promising field with multidisciplinary applications, such as quantum teleportation, quantum communication, optical computers, optospintronics, and quantum computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
