<AbstractNarration>Wireless system performance is known to be highly dependent upon the characteristics of the environment.  Despite the increasing ability of wireless devices to sense their surroundings, wireless systems have yet to fully leverage contextual data to improve performance. To this end, the Dallas-ARea Testbed for Context-Aware, Cognitive Research (DART-CARs) allows the study of wireless performance in a broad class of mobile and static environments from indoor labs to outdoor high-way speeds within a single testbed. Our hardware platform functions across many different wireless bands to enable real-time, multi-band operation. Such a first-of-its-kind infrastructure is critical for designing context-aware and cognitive algorithms that utilize multiple frequency bands to adapt to dynamic environmental settings. Our project has three major initiatives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Deploy a wireless research testbed to enable study across a vast array of urban environments &lt;br/&gt;-Design multi-band wireless hardware and reconfigurable embedded software tools that enable context-driven, cognitive switching across frequency bands to improve performance in the aforementioned environments&lt;br/&gt;-Develop an open-access data repository of wireless performance in multiple urban scenarios and across frequency bands&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project incorporates topics across disciplines such as wireless theory, embedded programming, hardware design, and ubiquitous computing.  Student involvement in courses and research will allow cross-disciplinary intellectual growth.  Further, field measurements will be made available to the research community.  Finally, handheld mobile devices are increasingly being used as the primary method for under-represented groups to access the Internet.  This infrastructure and resulting research will improve the performance these devices.</AbstractNarration>

Despite the increasing ability of wireless devices to sense their surroundings, wireless systems have yet to fully leverage contextual data to improve performance. To this end, DART-CARs is an NSF-funded infrastructure (NSF CISE CRI) that allows the study of wireless performance in a broad class of mobile and static environments in and around the Dallas area from indoor labs to outdoor high-way speeds within a single testbed. Our hardware platform functions across many different wireless bands to enable real-time, multi-band operation. Such a first-of-its-kind infrastructure is critical for designing context-aware and cognitive algorithms that utilize multiple frequency bands to adapt to dynamic environmental settings. Hence, the major goal of the project is to establish the infrastructure to leverage an awareness of a wireless transmitters contexual settings and improve wireless performance. To define a "context," a channel type is defined as a wireless channel that shows unique link level performance from other types of environmental settings. The channel type, velocity, and signal quality is then directly used to adapt modulation, coding, and frequency band used in order to optimize the througput of a given sender to receiver pair.

Second, a key thrust for outcomes in this project was context aware wireless research which included: (i) wireless channel classification and inference, (ii) leveraging context information to build a decision structure for rate adaptation, (iii) training and updating the decision structure on the fly in the field, (iv) multiband link adaptation, and (v) exploiting sequences or expunging anomalies within the data to improve the rate-adaptation decision structure.&nbsp; To disseminate these ideas, we have published 11 conference papers and 2 journal papers.
