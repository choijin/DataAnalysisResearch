<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the detailed study of a novel thin-film silicon solar cell fabrication process that uses significantly less energy than current processes. The silicon will be delivered via a low temperature deposition onto a metal layer; the stack will then be crystallized in the solid phase using a novel pulsed rapid thermal annealing process. This study includes an in-depth investigation of the fundamental process-structure relationship that influences the solar cell performance. The experimental study will elucidate the crystallization mechanism by exploring the effects of crystallization rate, concentration profile and grain structure. Optimization of the multi-layer polycrystalline structure and properties will be a goal of the study as well. Although the primary focus is on the single-junction solar cell structure, multiple-junction cells will be fabricated using the same kind of process. Commercial low-temperature glass will be used as the substrate for the solar cell fabrication.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the result of this research will provide a viable solution to the photovoltaic industry, i.e., a low-cost mass production process on the large-area glass substrate with high throughput. The primary goal of this work is to understand the key process factors that affect the bulk and interface polycrystalline thin-film structure and material properties for optimum solar cell performance. The same principle is applicable to the fabrication of a wide range of polycrystalline semiconductor thin films for solar cells and other nano- and micro-electronic devices. This work will also contribute to the advancement of solid-state material science, device fabrication, and rapid thermal annealing processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we demonstrated the feasibility of using the pulsed rapid thermal annealing (PRTA) method in combination of an ultra-thin Ni seed layer to crystallize intrinsic and doped a-Si thin films in the vertical direction. The glass substrate was not damaged during the thermal budget process due to the short period exposure to the high temperature pulse. The mechanism of the low thermal budget crystallization process is understood. We have made detailed investigation on critical issues in preparing the poly-Si thin film solar cells using the PRTA method.     Influences of the p+ thin film deposition process on solar cell performance including the dopant gas concentration, plasma power, post deposition annealing, pin vs. nip stack structure, electrode material on internal light reflection, ITO electrode and contact resistances, and chamber passivation have been investigated. The high performance cell can be achieved by controlling factors that can slight dope the intrinsic silicon layer with the p-type dopant to enhance the hole-collection efficiency. Using the PRTA crystallization process, the crystal size and volume fraction of the crystalline phase in the final film is in the order of intrinsic film &gt; n+ film &gt; p+ film.  The high conductivity poly-Si n+ or p+ film may cause the inferior electron- or hole-collection efficiency probably due to the high defect densities in the composing films, high interface resistances, or large contact resistance. However, the poly-Si p+ film can be used in tandem with the a-Si:H pin stack to achieve the high conversion efficiency after pretreatment with a hydrogen plasma exposure step. For the solar cell made of the poly-Si n+ layer, the crystallization direction, e.g., upward vs. downward,  and the hydrogen plasma, e.g., with H2 or B2H6 gas, and treatment of the interface, not the small film thickness difference, are important to the conversion efficiency. Solar cells made of single- or multi-layer PRTA crystallized film stack have been systematically fabricated and characterized. The cell with part of the poly-Si film, e.g., p+ or n+, and proper interface treatment, e.g., native oxide removal with a plasma, can have good performance. However, the cell with the complete poly-Si stack suffers from the low shunt resistance and high series resistance due to several possible reasons: Ni residue, poor interfaces, or high bulk defects. The tandem structure of the poly-Si p+ film with the a-Si:H pin stack shows good solar cell characteristics. The good lifetime of the tandem cell has also been obtained. In the long term, the poly-Si film should be less prone to the photo damage than the a-Si:H because of the formerÆs strong chemical bonds. The chamber treatment is critical to the prevention of the unintentional cross-contamination of the dopant from the previous process, which is necessary for the high solar cell performance.     In summary, it is possible to fabricate the high performance and high reliability poly-Si thin film solar cell on the glass substrate using the low thermal budget PRTA process if the number of Ni atoms in the seed layer is tightly controlled, e.g., to the monolayer level, and the defects in the structure are reduced, e.g., with a thermal annealing step.
