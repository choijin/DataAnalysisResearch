<AbstractNarration>0954243&lt;br/&gt;Carmena&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brain-machine interface technology has the potential of improving the quality of life for millions of patients suffering from paralysis due to lesions of the central nervous system or other neurological disorders. Our previous findings showed that monkeys can learn to reach and grasp virtual objects by controlling a robot arm through a brain-machine interface using visual feedback, even in the absence of overt arm movements. This proposal aims at bringing the field one step closer towards the ultimate control of neuroprosthetic devices through an effortless recall of a motor memory in a manner that mimics the natural process of skill acquisition and motor control. This goal will be pursued through the following specific aims: 1) To investigate the formation and stabilization of a prosthetic motor memory; 2) To investigate the neuron-behavior relationship for prosthetic function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish a scientific basis for understanding how the brain controls movement of disembodied devices, and will drive the development of the next generation of neural prosthetics that will restore motor function in millions of neurologically impaired patients.  The strong educational component of this proposal relies on brain-machine interfaces as an ideal platform for interdisciplinary education in science and engineering. The proposed efforts aim to address the nations current talent shortage of science and engineering majors which could have a severe negative impact on economic growth. This will be pursued through a mentoring program aimed at increasing the number of underrepresented and women students entering careers in engineering. The program will also involve undergraduate and graduate students, academics, and the industrial community in brain-machine interface research through teaching, collaborations, data sharing, workshops and tutorials.</AbstractNarration>
