<AbstractNarration>In order to flower during favorable conditions, plants use information from multiple environmental signals, such as day length, temperature, and winter chilling. However, global warming will alter not only temperatures, but also the timing and length of the growing season, and may thus create a mismatch between formerly accurate cues and the actual timing of those events. For example, warmer winters may not allow sufficient chilling to trigger flowering, resulting in delayed flowering despite earlier spring warming. This project will therefore explore the sensitivity of seasonal timing to genetic and environmental change. The study will take advantage of information and tools available for the genetic model species Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy annual relative of crops such as canola, cabbage, broccoli, turnips, and mustard.  It will combine a predictive mathematical model with field and controlled chamber experiments. The research will ask: 1. How does genetic variation in winter chilling requirements affect flowering time in natural seasonal environments? 2. How does natural selection act upon this variation in natural environments? 3. How will higher temperatures predicted by global warming scenarios affect seasonal timing of flowering? Predictions of the model will be tested experimentally in controlled chamber environments simulating effects of warming temperatures predicted for the end of the 21st century. If the model is accurate, warming temperatures and reduced winter chilling will alter seasonal timing and the relative timing of different genetic variants.&lt;br/&gt; Accurate timing of plant seasonal events - such as leaf emergence, flowering, fruiting and senescence - is critical for crop and forestry yields, as well as for the survival of wild species in the face of climate change. The results of this study will therefore be important for predicting how crops, weeds, forest trees, and wild plant communities will respond to global warming. The modeling approach will be a significant advance from traditional crop models and may improve their generality and predictive ability. This project will provide career opportunities and training for two female scientists: a postdoctoral researcher and a Ph.D researcher returning to the workforce after a career interruption. It will also provide research opportunities to several undergraduates, and will support development of a classroom module on plant responses to climate change for Rhode Island high school teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The seasonal timing of flowering is critical for plant reproductive success and crop yields.  In order to flower during favorable seasonal conditions, plants integrate information from multiple environmental signals, such as day length, temperature, and winter chilling ("vernalization"), through genetic signaling networks. However, climate warming will alter the timing and duration of the growing season, as well as the temperature signals controlling plant development.  For example, warmer springs may promote earlier flowering, but flowering may also be delayed if winters are too warm for plants to meet their chilling requirements.  To predict how flowering time will respond to climate change, it is necessary to understand the effects of natural variation in genetic signaling networks in different seasonal environments. This project examined the sensitivity of flowering time to perturbations in environmental signals and the genetic networks that sense them.  The study species was genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy annual closely related to crops such as canola, cabbage, broccoli, and mustard.    The research team combined field experiments, controlled chamber experiments, and computer modeling to study the effects of mutational loss of function and/or natural genetic variation at specific genes involved in vernalization signaling.  Major findings include the following:   1.   Under natural field conditions, the vernalization genes FLM and MAF2 have much more important effects on flowering time than previously recognized from laboratory studies.  These effects also depend strongly upon the seasonal environment in which a seedling germinates.  2.  Different genotypes responded very differently to controlled chamber treatments simulating climate warming.  Warm winters delayed flowering of genotypes with strong chilling requirements, but accelerated the flowering of other genotypes. Thus, patterns of genetic variation will be crucial for determining how plants respond to climate change.      3.  Computer models based upon the experimental results suggest that different genotypes will be most successful under different scenarios of climate warming or assisted migration to northern sites.    These findings contribute to understanding how crops and wild plant populations will respond to climate change, and will be of interest to plant breeders and conservation managers.  This project contributed to the research training and professional development of several postdoctoral researchers, "postbac" research assistants, and  undergraduate students.
