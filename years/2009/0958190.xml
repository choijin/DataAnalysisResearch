<AbstractNarration>SES#: 0958190&lt;br/&gt;PI: Louise M. Roth&lt;br/&gt;University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will examine the effects of medical malpractice suits, tort laws, health insurance, and reproductive regulations on birth practices in the United States. The research will test organizational theories about how legal regulations and insurance practices affect practices in health care. The study will focus specifically on cesarean sections because many healthcare industry insiders view cesareans as a form of defensive medicine, although the effects of malpractice and health insurance on cesareans are unclear. The research design combines quantitative analysis of how cesarean deliveries vary across states and over time in relation to malpractice, health insurance, and reproductive laws, with qualitative analysis of 30-40 interviews with important stakeholders in maternity care (providers, liability insurers, health insurers, and malpractice attorneys). The study's broader impacts include uncovering any non-medical influences on maternity care which may reveal ways to reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, and offering insights into the cost of maternity care. The results will have policy implications for improving maternity care and lowering healthcare costs.</AbstractNarration>

Theoretically, the study finds that the obstetric profession, expert witnesses, and attorneys jointly define what malpractice is.

Women with low-risk first pregnancies who give birth in states where obstetricians are the most vulnerable to malpractice litigation are 2.05 times more likely to have a c-section than those in states where obstetricians are the least legally vulnerable. Obstetricians also believe that patients may sue them for relatively minor problems or dissatisfactions, even if they follow the Standard of Care (SOC). Interviews with medical negligence attorneys revealed that the number of medical malpractice lawsuits has actually declined over time. However, obstetricians&rsquo; perceptions of medico-legal risk are often out-of-proportion to actual risk, partly because of the emotional toll of experiencing a lawsuit, and the very high cost of malpractice insurance.</p> <p>Misperceptions in obstetricians&rsquo; understanding of legal vulnerability may be a source of professional anxiety and costly defensive interventions against a legal threat that is far smaller than most obstetricians believe it is, since the risk of being sued for malpractice has been going down at the same time as the cesarean rate has been going up. The rise in cesareans is also not responsible for the decline in malpractice legal activity. Malpractice lawsuits have declined because the cost of litigating is very high due to expert witness requirements. The decline is not due to improvements in medical safety, reduction in errors, or increases in defensive practices. However, while litigation cannot fully explain the rise in cesarean rates or variation across states, the study results show that legal concerns contribute to some cesareans.</p> <p>Legal considerations also influence other practices like the routine use of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM), which has not demonstrated benefits for fetal outcomes in comparison to intermittent monitoring of the fetal heartbeat. Births in states where obstetricians are the most legally vulnerable are 7.26 times more likely to report the use of EFM than births in states where obstetricians are the least legally vulnerable. While obstetricians know that routine EFM use lacks scientific support and can cause undesirable effects, they believe that they must do it to retain legal legitimacy. Reinforcing this, most medical malpractice attorneys view EFM tracings as a source of reliable documentation and are less aware of EFM&rsquo;s fallibility, especially if they are plaintiffs&rsquo; attorneys. The views of legal practitioners thus reinforce routine EFM use.</p> <p>The study also found racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in cesarean deliveries, finding that cesarean deliveries are more common among Black, Hispanic, and low-income mothers.
