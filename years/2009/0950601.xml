<AbstractNarration>Infants and children are remarkably adept at learning language, much more adept in fact than their parents. Until recently, two theories competed to explain the language learning skill of young children. In one view, infants and children are like sponges, soaking up every detail of their environment, including the linguistic environment. In a competing view, infants come into the world with the range of human languages (or grammars) already "built-in." Their linguistic environment serves only to allow them to select the particular grammar of their native language, such as what speech sounds will be used, whether verbs come in the middle or the end of sentences, etc. Recently, a third view has begun gaining support. This view shares the position of the first view that infants and children are highly sensitive to every detail of their environment. It shares the position of the second view that infants and children have as their goal determining the particular linguistic system or grammar of their community. One way to discriminate among these three theories is the amount and kind of input required for optimal language learning. The first "sponge" view (or Associative theories) suggests that a great deal of input is needed and that it does not matter much whether that input consists of many repetitions (tokens) of the same example (type; e.g., hearing the word dogs as the plural of dog multiple times) or different examples (e.g., hearing dogs, pigs, and mugs as the plurals of their respective singulars). The second "built-in grammars" view (or Innate Domain theories) suggests that extremely little input is needed and that even a single repetition of a single example is sufficient for the infant or child to learn a particular component of the native language. The third "grammar-seeking sponge" view (or Hypothesis Selection theories) suggests that a very small number (e.g., three) of different examples are needed for learning and that different examples are much more helpful than repetitions of an example. This project will compare these three theories by asking about the amount of input needed for language learning. It also attempts to embed the third theory in a more realistic model of human learners by asking if learning always improves as the number of examples increases, or whether there is a trade-off between the number of examples and the number of repetitions of each example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to our scientific knowledge by asking whether humans are reflections of their environment, their biology, or whether and how the mind is a product of a biological brain with a primary goal of "making sense" of the environment. Moreover, because the research draws on existing studies of infant vision and infant social interaction, it places the study of language development in a broader developmental context. Finally, the research explores the specific kinds of input that maximize learning. Therefore, it has the potential to ultimately inform how we present linguistic and other information to infants, school children, and even adults in order to result in the best possible learning in the shortest possible time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Philosophical investigations of how humans acquire knowledge have generally focused on two possibilities: One is that we are born with most or all of the knowledge we will ever have, and what appears to be learning is just the discovery of pre-existing knowledge.  For example, what we call the Socratic method is not teaching, but helping students discover what they already know. The other phiosophical approach to human knowledge says that we are essentially blank slates to be written on by the environment.  The modern version of this approach says that our minds come to mirror our environment through many examples from a particular domain (e.g., language).   The research funded by NSF explored a third approach in which humans do learn from examples in our environment, but we are born expecting order in that environment, and therefore we are motivated to seek patterns. This approach is often called "abduction" in philosophy and rational constructivism in psychology and cognitive science.  On this view, learners look for patterns in their language input, particularly when they find some aspect of their input surprising.  They try to explain these patterns by implicitly testing hypotheses or guesses as to what the underlying structure of language (or grammar) might be such that they would encounter this pattern of input.   The funded research explored the viability of rational constructivism in two ways.  First, we pushed the limits on how few examples infants need to learn a rule of language.  We found that when the rule was surprising given the infant's prior experience, infants could learn from a single example (repeated multiple times).  We also found that when the rule was not particularly surprising given the infant's prior experience, they needed only four examples (not repeated). The speed with which infants are able to learn poses a real challenge for the view that their minds come to reflect their environment only by experiencing multiple examples.  The second way that we explored the viability of rational constructivism was to ask whether infants are strongly biased toward discovering rules of one kind vs. another.  We found that infants appear to be influenced by the particular input they receive and are not biased to discover only certain types of pattersn.  The latter finding is evidence against the view that we are born with all or most of the rules of language already in place.  In summary, the completed research suggests that the third approach to knowledge is worth pursuing.  We are currently following up on these studies to determine how the very rapid learning we have observed in the lab over the course of the grant hold up under different types of delay.  These follow up studies will help us to understand whether rational constructivism is just a theory about how infants learn in the lab or whether it can be imbedded in a more realistic model of how infants learn in the real world.
