<AbstractNarration>Researchers at Harvard University, the University of Michigan, and Brigham Young University are conducting research on the relationship between mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT), teaching practice, and student outcomes.  The study of MKT is embedded in a study of the effectiveness of the Math Solutions professional development model.  Math Solutions is a widely used professional development provider started by Marilyn Burns.  The study builds on work of the research team and differs from earlier work in that 80 fourth and fifth grade teachers in twelve Albuquerque, NM schools are randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group. Randomization occurs within grades within schools. Math Solutions provides teachers in the treatment group professional development that has a strong focus on MKT.  Teachers in the control group receive the typical professional development offered by the district.  This consists of a combination of summer mathematics institutes and three-to-six hour introductions to Everyday Mathematics, the instructional materials used by the schools in the study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research questions are as follows. How effective is Math Solutions as compared to typical ad-hoc mathematics professional development?  Does Math Solutions improve teachers? MKT, the quality of their instruction, and/or their students? outcomes? How are different aspects of teachers? mathematical knowledge and instruction related to student achievement?   Teacher MKT is measured by Learning Mathematics for Teaching (instruments developed by the PI and colleagues) and student achievement is measured by assessments developed recently by the PI with NSF support.  Classroom observations and video provide data on classroom instruction.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
