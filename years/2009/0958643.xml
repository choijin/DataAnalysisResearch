<AbstractNarration>Funds are being provided via an interagency transfer to provide support new projects being conducted under the auspices of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP). FY09 funds are requested for the following projects: 1. support for a new NOPP project entitled "Generation of Advanced Laser Fluorescence Technology for Characterization of Natural Aquatic Environments", principal investigator: Dr. Alex Chekalyuk, institution: Columbia University. 2. "Development of An Integrated ISFET pH Sensor for High Pressure Applications in the Deep-Sea", principal investigator: Dr. Kennith Johnson, institution: Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. 3. "Integration of an Emerging Highly Sensitive Optical CO2 Sensor for Ocean Monitoring on an Existing Data Acquisition System SeaKeeper 1000TM" and 4. "Development of Autonomous Ammonium Fluorescence Sensor (AAFS) with a View Toward In Situ Application", principal investigator: Dr. Peter Ortner, institution: University of Miami.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Office of Naval Research continues to be the lead agency to implement and fund many NOPP research and education programs. This arrangement helps to centralize and better control fiscal management, using cost sharing funds provided by other partnering agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid development of sensor capabilities is critical because of maturing plans forimplementing ocean observatory systems such as the Integrated Ocean Observing System and the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), for better equipping global in situ observing systems like Argo and to provide critical sea-truth data required for the interpretation of satellite-based biological, chemical, and biogeochemical observations of the ocean.  Moreover, development of biological, chemical, and bio-optical sensors for use in the ocean is critical to better understanding of aquatic ecology and ecosystem health, as well as the impact of a variable and changing climate on Earth?s ecology and the health of humans who depend on the sea for commerce, food, and recreation.</AbstractNarration>
