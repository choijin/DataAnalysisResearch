<AbstractNarration>This project will create a web-based, spoken dictionary of Eastern Pomo with a Pomo elder who is the lone fluent native speaker, to meet the speech community's need for modern documentation of this fast disappearing language. One of seven distinct Pomoan languages, Eastern Pomo fills a unique gap in this family of languages and is seriously under-documented. The spoken dictionary will be constructed within the Pomo Language Repository, an existing, password-protected, web application that features a searchable database of digital Pomo language resources. In creating the first digital spoken dictionary of Eastern Pomo, this project will model methods for contextualizing Pomo language documentation within a modern conversational learning framework, while providing an accessible resource for Eastern Pomo learners, teachers and scholars.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team for this project will consist of a linguist, Pomo community members who staff the California Indian Museum and Cultural Center (CIMCC) Pomo Language Preservation Program, and the speaker of Eastern Pomo. The team will begin the project by working with CIMCC's database specialist to create a lexical database, the structure of which will guide the subsequent fieldwork. The team will then work together to record 80 hours or more of the language data needed to create the dictionary. Modern documentation of Eastern Pomo is scarce. With only one fluent speaker remaining, it is vital to create a modern record of the language practices characteristic of Eastern Pomo to inform on-going conversational growth in the language as conversation is the heart of language revitalization and cultural development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project resulted in the creation of the first audio dictionary for the Eastern Pomo language.  The dictionary is presented in the form of a digital online database and engages active language learning. Project staff conducted documentation activities with Eastern Pomo speakers and constructed a searchable database.  The activities were driven by an existing shell curriculum for a ten unit conversational Eastern Pomo course and associated language resource lists.   Several individuals worked in collaboration as project staff, consultants and advisors.  An eight person "Pomo Language Preservation Committee" provided oversight to the development of the documentation, subsequent production of resources and community outreach.  The group represents the interests of local tribes, organizations and language revitalization programs.  Documentation activities are central to Eastern Pomo preservation and revitalization efforts.  Digital video and audio master recordings were created and sessions were transcribed.  The recordings were reviewed by project staff and consultants to determine their alignment with curriculum resource needs.  Edits were made to the recordings and presentation copies were finalized.  The transcription and presentation files were integrated into a searchable digital dictionary database for the California Indian Museum and Cultural Center's web based Pomo Language Repository. The dictionary supports 380 digital files and provides increased accessible resources to support widespread language learning throughout Pomo tribal communities.  The Eastern Pomo language is at critical cross roads.  Community members often debate the issue of preserving Eastern Pomo in its traditional form versus integrating other dialects and creating a modern/academic reflection of the language.  It is inevitable that native speakers and resources will be lost; and the language will be impacted by change. Innovative strategies must be adopted to integrate Eastern Pomo into a modern context.  The digital dictionary is a significant contribution to language preservation and revitalization efforts, because prior to its creation, the only dictionary type resources available were in the form of written publications.  While written publications are valuable, guidance from a native speaker and/or linguist are needed to advance conversational language instruction.  The majority of potential and active eastern Pomo language learners do not have access to instructors and/or mentors to guide them in the learning process. Language learning needs to be facilitated through broad accessibility and user friendly applications.  The digital dictionary created an accessible and expandable resource for language instruction and learning in a forum that eliminates many obstacles.  This resource will enhance linguistic research and foster innovative approaches to creating Eastern Pomo learning tools.   The California Indian Museum and Cultural Center will use the digital dictionary to create an introductory Moodle course for the Eastern Pomo language.  The resources will be shared with community and university partners who are pursuing the development of Pomo and other native language courses that serve tribal communities.
