<AbstractNarration>This project at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is creating a central Indiana pipeline to increase the number of students from the greater Indianapolis region (central Indiana) obtaining STEM degrees. Several activities involve Ivy Tech Community College Central Indiana and Butler University. The goals of this project are to increase the numbers of students of all demographic groups who pursue STEM academic and career pathways; participate in STEM research, industry internships, and honors activities; graduate with an undergraduate degree in STEM fields; and transition into industry, graduate and professional programs. The program has set a target of increasing the number of STEM graduates at IUPUI by 10% per year to produce an estimated 279 additional STEM graduates in the year 2015.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project employs and assesses the impact of several program-wide intervention strategies on student success. These intervention strategies include Summer STEM Bridge Academies, peer-mentoring and academic advising support for transfer students, Peer-led Teaching and Learning and Just-in-Time Teaching, Honor seminars, and Career Development services and internships. Numerous support services already are in place to assist with this initiative, making it possible for the project to integrate research and education on effective strategies for student learning in STEM disciplines. Additionally, the evaluation plan includes mechanisms for measuring the impacts of the individual initiatives and the effectiveness of the program as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project takes a coordinated and systemic approach to increasing undergraduate success in STEM at all levels, from pre-college, to the important first year experience, to the sophomore year and onto graduation, through leadership and career development. Dissemination of the project's results will occur through the web, peer-reviewed publications, and presentations to the local and national STEM community. A national conference will be hosted at IUPUI during the fourth year of the project, which will bring national leaders on STEM education, to share their knowledge of research and best practices, and for this project to showcase the work being done at IUPUI and other institutions on increasing the number of students completing STEM degrees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Central Indiana STEM Talent Expansion Program  The Central Indiana STEM Talent Expansion Program at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) continues to create a central Indiana pipeline to increase the number of students from the greater Indianapolis region (central Indiana) obtaining STEM degrees.  The goals of this project were to increase the numbers of students of all demographic groups who:              (1) pursue STEM academic and career pathways;              (2) participate in STEM research, industry internships, and honors activities;              (3) graduate with an undergraduate degree in STEM fields; and              (4) transition into industry, graduate and professional programs.  The program reached its target of increasing the number of STEM graduates at IUPUI by 10% per year over a 5-year period.  Starting in 2009 with 450 STEM students graduating, to 2016 with over 700 STEM students graduating per year.  The primary intellectual merit of the Central Indiana STEM Talent Expansion Program was to employ and assess the impact of several program-wide intervention strategies on student success, leading to higher numbers of students graduating with STEM degrees.  CI-STEP initiated a series of new activities and funded a series of STEP mini-grants to expand, extend, or develop new programs at IUPUI based on successful existing high-impact practices.   These initiatives and activities fall under one of four broad categories:   (1) Articulation with IVYTech CC in Indianapolis (Program and Course Alignment)    (2) Student Success Programs (STEM Bridge and Peer Mentoring)    (3) Student Centered Pedagogies (Classroom Curriculum and Instruction)    (4) Career Services (Internships and Job Placement)   Intellectual Merit: IUPUI, with its nationally recognized commitment to improving educational success for all students, has numerous support services in place to assist with this initiative, making it possible for us to integrate research and education on effective strategies for student learning in STEM disciplines. Additionally, the evaluation plan included effective mechanisms for measuring the impacts of the individual initiatives and the effectiveness of the program as a whole.  Successful programs in student learning and retention benefit all involved, and have the additional intellectual merit of upgrading the academic reputation of the university.  Broader Impact:  This program took a coordinated and systemic approach to increasing undergraduate success in STEM education at all levels, from pre-college, to the important first year experience, to the sophomore year and onto graduation, through leadership and career development.  The results of this project are of interest to all who wish to increase student success in STEM disciplines, and dissemination of the project's results have occurred through the web, peer-reviewed publications, and presentations to the local, national, and international STEM community.  By blending research on teaching and learning, with the participation in teaching and training by students from diverse backgrounds, including underrepresented minorities, IUPUI has significant increased both the knowledge of "what works" in successful STEM education programs, and used this knowledge to increase the numbers of talented graduates.  It is imperative, for continued intellectual leadership and economic prosperity as a nation, that we make efforts to increase the quantity, quality, and diversity of STEM graduates as one of our highest national priorities.
