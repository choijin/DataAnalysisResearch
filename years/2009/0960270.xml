<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isotopic measurements provide natural sciences with a quantitative tracer of chemical processes and sources. Improvements in the precision of isotope measurements open up new avenues of scientific inquiry and significantly enhance our understanding of natural processes. Multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometery (MC-ICPMS) is a relatively new technique for the measurement of isotopic compositions at high precision and as such this instrumentation has important implications for earth, ocean, and environmental sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation funding will be used to purchase a state-of-the-art multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer to pursue diverse geochemical, environmental and geochronological research at the University of Wyoming. Housing an MC-ICPMS will lead to a substantial improvement in the University of Wyoming?s capabilities to conduct cutting-edge research. This MC-ICPMS will provide essential research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students using state-of-the-art facilities, as well as serving other regional, national and international researchers.</AbstractNarration>
