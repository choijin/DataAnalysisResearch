<AbstractNarration>This project is to develop new, effective distance metrics for comparing two images.  These metrics account for two effects.  First, pixels can change their position, deforming from one image to another.  Second, pixels may change their intensity.  In many vision problems, intensity changes are primarily due to lighting variation.  The research team first addresses the effect of illumination changes, which enables to develop a new, powerful, robust distance for measuring the effects of lighting variation in an image.  The research team combines this with both existing and new methods to develop a robust distance that accounts simultaneously for image deformations and intensity variations.  Computing this distance separates these two effects, providing a correspondence between images.  This can be used to track objects moving relative to a light, to match images taken at different times of day, or to recognize objects seen under different lighting, from different viewpoints, with variations in their shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new metric provides a theory of computation for deformation and lighting that encodes our notion of image similarity.  However, it is still a considerable challenge to find ways to effectively compute with such an image metric.  Therefore, the research team also develops computationally effective algorithms based on this new metric.  These algorithms improve performance in numerous applications such as face recognition, autonomous navigation, and optical flow and tracking, in which variations in lighting and shape cause significant challenges for existing methods.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our work attempts to understand how we can model the way objects deform and otherwise vary in shape, and the effect that these shape variations have on the appearance of objects.  Using these models, we can build algorithms that better recognize these objects when they are seen in images.  Objects change shape all the time.  For example, people have arms and legs that move, and expressions that affect the shape of their face.  Shape also varies between different objects of the same visual class.  For example, different leaves from the same species of tree can have different shapes.  Even when an object is rigid, when we look at it from a new viewpoint, its apparent shape changes.  Our work has developed new ways of matching two images to judge their similarity in situations in which there have been variations in shape.  Using mathematical tools based on Riemannian geometry, we have developed algorithms that measure the total amount of change that occurs as one shape morphs into another.  We have particularly focused on the interaction between changes in shape and illumination, and have developed a surprisingly efficient algorithm for comparing images when both lighting and shape vary.  This has allowed us, for example, to develop new, effective algorithms for recognizing a face when it is seen with a new expression under new lighting conditions.  We have also developed algorithms for comparing two images of the same object when seen from different viewpoints, allowing us to recognize a face, for example, when we see it from a new viewpoint.  Some of our work has been motivated by problems in studying biodiversity.  For example, in parallel work we have been developing algorithms for comparing images of plants and animals.  These algorithms can compare two leaves to determine whether they seem to come from the same species of tree even though their shape is somewhat different, or to compare images of two birds, to determine whether they belong to the same species, even if their heads or legs are in different poses.  By developing a new understanding of shape, we can not only address fundamental problems in vision and mathematics, we can also develop tools that are useful in the study of the natural world.
