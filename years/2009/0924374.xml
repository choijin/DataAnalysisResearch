<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering, Stephen O. Hill of Florida State University will collaborate with Euan Brechin of the University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom to study the effect of high pressure on the magnetism of mononuclear and polynuclear complexes via the combination of x-ray structural data and high frequency EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) data.  The application of high pressure to complexes will allow the researchers to correlate structural changes with magnetic properties within the same molecule.  The determination of such magnetostructural correlations will provide a fundamental insight into the electronic properties of monomeric and polynuclear complexes that form the basis for molecular magnetism studies.  The PIs also propose to conduct workshops on high pressure, high field magnetic resonance techniques.</AbstractNarration>
