<AbstractNarration>In this project the principal investigator will  study  scattering and inverse scattering  on asymptotically Euclidean and  asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds.  Examples of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds include quotients of hyperbolic space by certain groups of motion. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild model of the exterior of a black hole can  be viewed as an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold with two ends, while the Schwarzschild model of the exterior of a black hole can be viewed as a manifold with two ends that is asymptotically hyperbolic on one end and asymptotically Euclidean on the other. The principal investigator will study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the wave equation on nontrapping asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds and the Schwarzschild model of a black hole. In both cases the long-time behavior of waves is associated with the distribution of resonances, or scattering poles, and the project will address this question as well. The principal investigator will also study inverse scattering, including the question of determining an asymptotically Euclidean manifold from the scattering matrices at all energies. This requires the proof of a support theorem that generalizes to this setting the well-known support theorem for the Radon transform in Euclidean space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One central problem in the study of partial differential equations is to understand how geometric properties of a medium influence the way waves propagate on it. The principal investigator will study the long time-behavior of solutions to the wave equation on spaces that are motivated by examples from physics. The "inverse problem" consists of using measurements obtained from waves that propagate on a certain medium to determine some of the medium's geometric properties. For example, by knocking on the surface of an object and listening to how it responds to this signal, one can obtain information about the object's interior; by measuring the time a wave travels between two points on the surface of the object one would like to obtain information about the variable speed of propagation of the waves in the interior of the object. The principal investigator will study problems of this nature in the spaces indicated above. The techniques that need to be developed might also have applications in other areas, such as tomography.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The wave equation is a mathematical model,  given in terms of a partial differential equation, that describes the propagation of waves in a medium.  This equation contains information about the speed of the waves, and physical properties of the medium.  First,  given the wave equation,  one wants to find its solutions.  It is very rare that one can explicitly find solutions of the wave equation in an arbitrary medium. In general one can only hope to describe certain properties of its solutions.  One can also ask the opposite question, which is called the inverse problem: describe a medium from information about how waves propagate in it.  This project dealt with  questions related to these two problems.  We worked with particular types of media, which are not bounded and obey certain models at very large distances.  We described a number of properties regarding the propagation of waves in these types of media. We also showed that  in some cases, properties of the solutions of the wave equation for very large times can be used to completely describe the medium in which they travel.    The solutions of these problems required the use of known techniques from several areas of mathematics, but it also required new mathematical methods and ideas.  Hopefully these new methods and ideas discovered during these investigations will be useful in other settings.  The research done in this project also helped train three graduate students who worked on it.  The principal investigator also taught courses and gave seminars for graduate and undergraduate students,  where he presented the outcomes of this project.
