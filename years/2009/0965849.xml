<AbstractNarration>Character varieties lie at the confluence of many important areas of mathematics including algebraic geometry, hyperbolic geometry and three dimensional topology, Kleinian groups, Teichmuller theory, dynamical systems, gauge theory, and number theory. Their study reveals many deep and rich connections between these fields. Software developed by some of the investigators has been useful in studying these problems.  Participants will also profit from the opportunity to interact and experiment with computer experts during the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program brings together leading experts from these different backgrounds to lay the foundations, explore inter-connections, report recent developments and to chart new directions.  Furthermore graduate students and young researchers will be exposed to this field.  This meeting will bring together researchers in diverse, but related areas, from all over the world. Graduate students and postdocs especially will benefit from the minicourses being offered in the summer school. Researchers working in the Australasia region, especially Japan, China, Korea, India, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand will have a chance to interact with their counterparts in Europe and America.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
