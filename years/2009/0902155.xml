<AbstractNarration>Re Proposal: 0902155&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Mitrea, Irina&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Virginia&lt;br/&gt;Effective period of award: 05/01/2009 -- 07/31, 2009&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide support to defray expenses of researchers participating in the Conference on Recent Advances in Harmonic Analysis and Elliptic Partial Differential Equations that will take place May 8-10, 2009  at the University of  Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.  Support will be provided to participants who do not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions made for plenary speakers. It is understood that much of the funding will be directed to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty but that certain senior participants will be funded as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program of the event will feature about eight plenary speakers, who will deliver one-hour lectures, and a number of contributed talks. The main aim of the conference is to give a chance to young analysts to learn about  the advances  in the field of Harmonic Analysis and PDE from well established experts in the field and also to present their research work in front of an expert audience. Special attention is paid in involving women mathematicians, ranging from graduate students to senior researchers, in all aspects of the event. Several graduate students as well as an undergraduate student will participate at the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
