<AbstractNarration>TransPAC3 is a continuing project building on the existing TransPAC2 cross-organization project. It will provide multi-gigabit bandwidth and services connecting researchers in the US with their counterparts in Asia and utilizing the current technological advances in those areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and education networks included in the TransPAC3 collaboration cover all of Asia excluding only North Korea, Brunei, Myanmar, and Mongolia. Indiana University will lead the TransPAC3 Collaboration in a cooperative partnership with the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN), Delivery of Advanced Network Technology to Europe (DANTE), and in coordination with Internet2 and other research and education networks that are interconnected through the project. The collaboration in Asia will connect to the APAN XP in Tokyo directly, and from there to 15 countries in Asia. TransPAC3 will connect to China via Hong Kong and the CNHI Exchange Point and to the Trans-Eurasian Information Network (TEIN3) network via Singapore.  The TEIN3 network currently provides connectivity to 12 Asian countries and Europe with 7 additional countries soon to be connected. DANTE is the operator of the TEIN3 network in North, South East, and South Asia and connects almost all countries in those parts of Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TransPAC3 will initially deploy 20 Gbps of bandwidth between Asia and the US using 10G carrier service offerings. TransPAC3 will deploy one 10 Gbps link between Pacific Wave and Tokyo in years 1 and 2. A second 10 Gbps link will be provided by NICT, Japan, at no cost to NSF.  In Year 3 of the award this will be expanded as demand and pricing evolve.  As 40Gbps and 100Gbps become available and affordable at trans-Pacific distance they will become part of the provided service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This proposal rests well within the guidelines of the IRNC solicitation and will expand and enhance services in security, identity management, measurement, and operational integration.  US ? Asia connectivity requires close cooperation between the participants, and this project will consist of a collaborative team.  Security is a major issue for all concerned and is a focus of the proposal.  The PI has proposed and intends to provide deployment of accurate and useful measurement technology as well as leading edge circuit services to meet high bandwidth applications.  Eliminating duplication of expensive links should decrease overall costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;As with the previous IRNC award, it is expected that the awardee?s TransPAC3 collaboration will provide highly expanded opportunities for US researchers to interact and collaborate with their fellow researchers in Asia.  The PI?s recent cooperation in connecting Pakistan to the global R&amp;E infrastructure continues to show fruitful results.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating diversity in research and education is a strong component in this proposal.  The PI has plans to partner with the Gerald L. Bepko Internship Program at Indiana University to extend educational outreach and integrate diversity into the TransPAC3 project, with the goal to identify, connect, and work with underserved students and advance their knowledge and ability in information technology.</AbstractNarration>
