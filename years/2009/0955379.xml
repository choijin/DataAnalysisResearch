<AbstractNarration>The project will investigate lightning as a source for high-altitude optical emissions known as transient luminous events (TLEs).  The objectives of the investigation are to quantify the plasmochemical and photochemical effects of TLEs in the upper atmosphere and to reveal possible pathways of atmospheric species upon impact by short, impulsive external forces.  These goals will be achieved by developing and applying a self-consistent plasma chemistry and photochemistry model for TLEs, remote sensing of TLEs through optical spectroscopy, continuous data acquisition by building and maintaining a TLE observation site at Florida Tech, and comparing modeling results with satellite measurements and high-speed video observations from ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational objectives of the project are to train the next generation of researchers in the areas of aeronomy and to foster the interest of high school students and general public in atmospheric sciences.  The education activities include: 1) graduate and undergraduate student training, 2) curriculum development by incorporating elements of the research into classroom, 3) building a TLE website for data sharing and public outreach, and 4) improving high school science education by participating in the Florida Tech InSTEP program, an NSF-funded GK-12 program.</AbstractNarration>
