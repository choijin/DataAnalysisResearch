<AbstractNarration>This institutional infrastructure project will build on two previous CRI grants in order to significantly enhance the current shared high performance computing infrastructure in order to keep up with rapidly increasing research demands. The resulting world-class computing facilities will be shared with all Computer Science (CS) faculty researchers, Binghamton collaborators, external collaborators, and students.  Specifically, the requested infrastructure consists of high-end PowerEdge Blade servers along with a robust and high performance storage subsystem. These systems address the computational and storage needs common to research projects in microarchitectural-level power and performance assessment tool design, data center energy optimization techniques, parallel discrete event simulation, multimedia senor networks, Grid and cloud scheduling, data reduction of scientific datasets, large scale web database integration systems projects, virtualization, real-time data services, and I/O intensive simulation projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting world-class computing facilities will benefit students, faculty, and collaborators. It will be used to enhance a wide variety of courses, and the project includes a coordinated education and research program that enhances the department's instruction and student training efforts.  Results will be disseminated to a wide audience through research publications and also on a Web page devoted to the project to advertise how the facility is being used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CS Department where the equipment is housed is committed to increasing the enrollment of women and students from traditionally underrepresented groups, and its involvement of undergraduates in research (as evidenced, e.g., by a current CISE REU Site).  This equipment will help the department to advance these efforts by driving research that will be attractive to the best students from these groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computing infrastructure in the Computer Science Department at  Binghamton University supported a range of experimental computer systems  projects in a variety of research areas. In particular, the  heterogeneous high performance computing  cluster has enabled the  following outcomes at Binghamton:    We developed techniques to study Web data quality, including a method to  verify the truthfulness of fact statements, an in-depth study of data  quality in the flight and stock domains, and a method to speed up the  detection of copying between data sources.    We conducted research on providing integrated access to multiple  structured data sources on the Web, including a method to annotate data  retrieved from Web databases, methods for identifying records  corresponding to the the same entity, and a book on query interface  understanding and integration.    We made contributions to research on sentiment analysis of Web textual  content such as news and user posts, including a method to measure the  quality of sentiment word dictionaries, a method to extract topics from  text, and a method to perform topic-based sentiment analysis.    We investigated enhancing the performance of the ubiquitous  microprocessors found in PCs, servers, and tablets; a new technique that  demonstrates a 15% performance boost was proposed and evaluated.    We proposed and evaluated hardware infrastructures that validate the  correct execution of software, as a basis for building trustworthy  computing systems.  Building inherently trustworthy computing systems is  a grand challenge and generally requires specialized hardware support.  Our proposed hardware support detects and deals with cyberattacks that  alter the behavior of programs as they execute.  Specifically, the  mechanism detects and deals with both known and not-yet-known attacks  that compromise program behavior at run time.    We enhanced and supported the deployment of a simulator for a multicore  processor  and computing system; our simulator is widely used in the  academic community and also in industrial research laboratories.  (www.marss86.org)    We developed several hardware supported defenses to protect against  "Code Reuse Attacks": a new and dangerous exploitation technique that  attackers are increasingly relying on to bypass existing security  defenses.    We developed Parallel Discrete Event simulation algorithms and  optimizations for emerging multi-core architectures.  Simulation is used  pervasively in the design and evaluation of systems across a range of  scientific, engineering, medical, industrial and military domains.  Parallel simulation is used to improve the performance and capacity of  simulation by using multiple machines in parallel, allowing the  simulation of larger, more detailed models, for more scenarios.  The  developed algorithms, which were released to the public, result in over  10x improvement in the performance of parallel simulators for multi-core  environments.    We evaluated MongoDB for scalability, sharing configurations,  fault-tolerance, and performance as the underlying input and output  source for the Hadoop framework.     We designed a MapReduce implementation to make full use of computational  resources in HPC environments, wherein the compute nodes do not have  local disk access.     We designed a streaming MapReduce implementation capable of running not  only Java applications, but also executables used in scientific  applications.     We compared, contrasted, and reported on the performance of several MapReduce  implementations for different workloads including data-intensive,  CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, and iterative.
