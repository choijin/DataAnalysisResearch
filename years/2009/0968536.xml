<AbstractNarration>This project will develop and evaluate software to support people engaged in online social deliberation, especially as it relates to dispute resolution and collaborative inquiry. The software will model and monitor deliberative processes skills while people are either in collaboration or involved in settling disputes. Applications will be in three domains that already support online conversations: 1) online dispute resolution (e.g., eBay and the U.S. National Mediation Board); 2) collaborative learning in open-ended inquiry learning environments; and 3) dialog and deliberation on civic and ethical issues. The project will scaffold situations, adding structure or focusing attention on social processes, support improvement of individual skills, and facilitate a.  Wisdom of crowds that enables participants to produce improved results. This project involves faculty across five departments: legal studies, psychology, political science, computer science and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. This research advances social issues (collaboration, dispute resolution, and critical thinking) and computation techniques (online dispute resolution, argumentation and collaboration). It furthers research into building social communities, explores issues of coaching and collaboration and develops evaluation tools for measuring the effect of online support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Societal Impact. This project advances the understanding of online human-human communication. It will enable more people to access social deliberative tools, promote interest in discussion among more people and improve the quality of on-line disputes as well as collaborations. The project lays the groundwork for more intelligent communication in online communities, creates new understandings of the complexities of collaboration and produces new modes of synergistic online discussions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ People are increasingly engaged in online dialogue, deliberation, and collaboration. The Internet provides opportunities for increased exchange of ideas, particularly with others who we may not have a chance to engage face-to-face.  There is under-explored opportunity for online systems and tools to directly support participants in having higher quality and more skillful engagements. The overall goal of the project is to support higher quality online deliberation, especially by supporting number of "social deliberative skills" such as perspective taking, empathy, self-reflection, tolerance for uncertainty, listening and question-asking skills, and meta-dialogue&mdash;in online contexts.                We attempt to do this through software tools and features, some of which directly support participants, and others which support a facilitator or mediator as they engage with participants. To support participants we implemented unobtrusive scaffolding features, and to support facilitators we implemented a "dashboard" visualization tool.  We also investigated using state-of-the-art text analysis and machine learning to measure important properties of deliberative dialogue.  In addition to the development and formative evaluation of these tools, we conducted experimental trials that showed, for a population of college students engaged in online discussion of controversial issues, that our "reflective tools" did indeed lead to deeper, more skilled, and reflective dialogue.  Our work with text analysis had given early indications that automated methods for assessing the quality of online dialogue can be used productively to support higher quality communication (for instance through visualizing this information in the Facilitator's Dashboard).              WIder potential impact:  Our unobtrusive scaffolding methods and facilitator dashboard concepts will transfer to use in collaborative work, civic engagement, and online dispute resolution.  Discussion forums and commenting features are widely used in educational contexts and social media, but little exists to support higher quality deliberation in these environments. Our methods should also be applicable to "flipped" classrooms and MOOC (Massive Online Open Course) environments, which are in need of better tools for interaction, dialogue, and management.
