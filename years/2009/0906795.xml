<AbstractNarration>The research program will develop and explore new methods, both parametric and nonparametric, for solving a variety of problems in multivariate and high-dimensional statistics.  In particular it will study models for the stochastic fluctuations of rankings and for assessing the reliability of rankings.  It will develop nonlinear methods for variable selection, and for quantifying the association among variables, in very high-dimensional problems.  And it will take up in detail the problem of defining and accessing, in an empirical way, the notions of probability density and mode for functional data.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problems involving rankings arise in a very wide variety of contexts.  Examples include the ranking of universities or other institutions on the basis of measures their performance.  However, relatively little is known about the reliability of rankings, which after all are based on empirical evidence which is subject to error.  The research program will study this matter in depth.  Methods for variable selection are required in an increasingly wide range of practical problems, for example the selection of genes in terms of their apparent influence on disease and mortality.  The research program will focus on this problem in relatively complex cases, where the relationship between the variables and health issues is unusually complex.  Functional data, for example where the data are recorded in the form of curves rather than numbers, are encountered in fields as diverse as assessing the protein content of wheat to exploring ways in which the characteristics of climate change over time.  However, the extent to which conventional statistical notions, such the concept of the `most likely data value,' are valid for such data is not well understood.  The research program will remove this obscurity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research program addressed a range of problems, of which we briefly discuss four.     1. Perfect classification.  When training data, in the form of random functions, are available from two classes, it is possible, in practically interesting and nondegenerate cases, to build a classifier whose success becomes perfect as the training sample sizes diverge.  This sort of phenomenon is not ever seen in classical multivariate problems, and opens the door to related advances, for example methods for clustering data that are almost perfect.   2.  Partial least squares for functional data.  In this project we developed a transparent account of theoretical issues that underpin partial least squares (PLS) methods in linear models for prediction, and showed that they motivate an alternative approach to PLS for functional data.  This alternative PLS (APLS) has the advantage that it is easier to compute.  In addition this work leads to a much better understanding of PLS for functional data.   3.  Choosing the best data type when classifying, or predicting from, functional data.  In some problems involving functional data it is desired to choose among different data types and undertake prediction or classification before the full trajectory of a function is observed.  We developed a method for determining when a classification decision can reasonably be made, using only part of the trajectory so as to enable an early decision, and we showed how to use the method to choose among data types.     4.  Inference for non-stationary self-exciting point processes, with applications. Self-exciting point processes (SEPPs), or Hawkes processes, have found application in a wide range of fields, such as epidemiology, seismology, neuroscience, engineering, financial econometrics and social interactions. In traditional SEPP models the baseline intensity is assumed to be constant. This has restricted the application of SEPPs to situations where there is clearly the self-exciting phenomenon but a constant baseline intensity is inappropriate. In this work we considered SEPPs with varying baseline intensities and developed an asymptotic theory for maximum likelihood (ML) based inference for parametric SEPP models. Theory and applications are explored, the applications being to ultra-high frequency financial data analysis.       Last Modified: 07/17/2014       Submitted by: Peter Hall]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
