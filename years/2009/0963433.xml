<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds the redesign, renovation, and upgrade of the ground floor of the Science Building complex on the campus of Calvin College to create the Integrated Science Research Experimental Laboratory  (ISRx).   The ISRx will place student and faculty researchers from a variety of disciplines in the same physical environment. The science that emerges from research performed in this space is expected to be highly interdisciplinary. Of particular note will be collaborations between chemistry/biology and computer science/mathematics researchers.   The affected chemistry research areas include genomics, proteomics, biofuels, biomolecule binding, structure, and imaging.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The renovations will improve conditions for research training of students, and will promote interdisciplinary research by providing a common research area.  Calvin provides a variety of science outreach activities to the Grand Rapids area, focusing primarily on sections of Grand Rapids that have significant ethnic minority populations, and these activities will be enhanced by the proposed renovations.</AbstractNarration>
