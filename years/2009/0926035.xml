<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: This project is aimed at experimental and theoretical investigations of linear and nonlinear optical phenomena in the presence of multiple scattering and photon localization in random media. The amplification of weak optical signals, such as linear and nonlinear Raman scattering, due to greatly elongated wave trajectories in strongly scattering optical samples will be explored. Disordered nanostructures in GaP and InP exhibiting controlled microscopic/ mesoscopic disorder and light scattering efficiency will be employed to study their linear and nonlinear optical response. The precise material and structural characteristics in these samples will be optimized to achieve the enhancement of Raman signal that is comparable to the state-of-the-art techniques and is enough to detect environmentally significant concentrations of hazardous chemicals in water solution. The ultimate design of Raman sensor developed in this proposal will be implemented as a prototype that will be tested at the sewage facilities for continuous monitoring of the water quality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research brings together collaborators from optical and material sciences to create a unique climate for the active student participation in research and science/engineering education and for the preparation of the future scientists, engineers and educators. Students from the largest and diverse urban centers in Texas and Wisconsin, including those of underrepresented groups, will be able to gain interdisciplinary experience and training in optics, materials, biological and chemical sciences. The significant improvement of chemical sensor architecture, aimed as a part of the proposed research, will have an immediate impact on society and economy through established partnerships with local industrial companies and communities.</AbstractNarration>

When a beam of light enters a complex medium such as white paint or living tissue, random inhomogeneities cause light to be strongly scattered. Light scattering prevents photons from propagating ballistically, i.e., along straight lines, transforming their trajectories into ærandom walksÆ. Since the photon trajectories are greatly elongated within the medium, the photonÆs dwell time (i.e., the time that a photon spends in the medium) extends considerably thus promoting light-matter interactions, such as Raman scattering. Raman spectroscopy is a simple analytical tool, which allows in situ recognition and quantitative concentration measurements of multiple chemical species. The main disadvantage of Raman spectroscopy is extremely low level of Raman signal. The amplification of Raman signal by multiple light scattering will allow detection of environmentally significant concentrations of hazardous chemicals in water solution.   Intellectual Merit: The propagation of light through disordered media can be described by way of transmission channels, which connect incoming and outgoing external propagating waves.

We have demonstrated that in strongly localizing media, the dominant transmission channel is formed by a photonic localized mode or by a unique superposition of localized modes giving rise to a so-called ænecklace stateÆ. These internal spectral modes are the principal electromagnetic excitations of the random media. To establish the connection between the channel and mode pictures of transport, we investigate random samples with lengths significantly greater than the scale at which photons are localized. The numerical and experimental results that we obtain in this deeply localized limit allow us to identify both the characteristic signatures of the single-channel transport as well as its connection to the internal modes of the disordered sample. We find: First, the single-channel regime has unique statistical properties such as, for example, a æfrozen-speckleÆ pattern of transmitted intensity; that is, altering the incident wave has little or no effect on the positions and relative intensities of light speckles, affecting only the apparent brightness of the speckle pattern.

These results are fundamental to understanding the static and dynamic behavior of waves in random media and can be useful in energy transfer through strongly scattering complex systems.  Broader Impact: The NSF grant helped in the course of the project to train PhD student, Abe Pe&ntilde;a, and undergraduate student, Christian Trevi&ntilde;o. Abe Pe&ntilde;a received his PhD in 2014 and went to work in a local Houston-based R&amp;D company. Christian Trevi&ntilde;o is expected to graduate from the Honors College of the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) in 2015. Their research results were published in high-impact physical journals, Nature Communications and Physical Review, and were presented at major...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
