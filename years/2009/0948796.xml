<AbstractNarration>Animal studies show that estrogens can significantly enhance learning and memory; however, the mechanisms that underlie these effects are very unclear. Studies suggest that neurons that project to the hippocampus and frontal cortex, and that use acetylcholine as their neurotransmitter, play an important role in these effects.  The purpose of this project is to study whether a novel estrogen receptor protein, GPR30, plays an important role in mediating effects on the function of the cholinergic neurons as well as on learning and memory.  Studies will be performed in rats that have had their ovaries removed.  Histochemistry, behavioral pharmacology, and in vivo microdialysis will be used to evaluate the effects of drugs that act on the GPR30 receptor.  It is predicted that selective activation of the GPR30 receptor will significantly enhance the function of the cholinergic neurons of interest, as well as cognitive performance.  In addition, it is predicted that drugs which block activation of the GPR30 receptors, or that destroy the cholinergic neurons of interest, will block the effects of estradiol as well as effects associated specifically with GPR30 activation.  This would demonstrate that GPR30, which is expressed by the cholinergic neurons, plays an important role in mediating the effects of estradiol.  Cell culture studies also will be used to evaluate effects on signaling pathways within the cholinergic neurons. These studies will provide much new and valuable mechanistic information about the role of GPR30 in mediating estrogen effects on the cholinergic neurons and on cognitive performance.  This information will add significantly to our understanding of how loss of ovarian function as well as estrogen replacement influences cognition. Doctoral and undergraduate students will benefit by receiving training in methods of behavioral pharmacology, histochemistry, and in vivo microdialysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Intellectual Merit Much research has shown that estrogens influence brain function and cognitive processes, and that the loss of estrogens can contribute to age-related cognitive decline in women.  The mechanisms that account for these effects are not very clear.  Recent studies have identified a novel membrane-associated estrogen receptor (GPR30) which is capable of conferring estrogen signaling on a rapid time-scale.   This project focused on examining GPR30 expression in the brain, on determining whether GPR30 is expressed by specific subgroups of cells in the brain, and on studying the effects of GPR30 activation on specific measures of brain function and cognition. The results of these experiments clearly show that GPR30 is expressed in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons located in the medial septum, diagonal band of Broca, nucleus basalis magnocellularis, and in the striatum.  Hence GPR30 is positioned to mediate estrogen effects on cholinergic function in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and basal ganglia, which are known to play important roles in learning and memory processes. In addition, our results show that activation of GPR30 significantly affects cholinergic function in the hippocampus with corresponding effects on cognitive performance.  Studies suggest that some of these effects may be mediated indirectly via orexinergic neurons located in the hypothalamus that project to and influence cholinergic function.  These studies have led to the development of a novel hypothesis explaining how/why estrogen treatment can influence learning.  Specifically, we hypothesize that estradiol, acting via GPR30 receptors located on orexinergic neurons projecting to the medial septum, can improve learning by increasing acetylcholine release in the hippocampus in association with food reward, thus increasing the salience of relevant sensory cues, thus enabling animals to incorporate those cues into a more efficient learning strategy.

This provided a rich environment for students to get a broad-based exposure to preclinical research. A total of eight students participated in the project.  All students received formalized instruction in research integrity, laboratory safety, conflict of interest, and the use of animals in research.
