<AbstractNarration>PI: Cynthia Weinig (University of Wyoming)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs:  Sanjoy Das (Kansas State University), Julin N. Maloof (University of California - Davis), C. Robertson McClung (Dartmouth College), Stephen M. Welch (Kansas State University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Collaborators: Doina Carragea and Gerard Kluitenberg (Kansas State University), and Paula X. Kover [University of Manchester (United Kingdom)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will examine plant responses to vegetation density, which are commonly referred to as "shade-avoidance" and which greatly affect yield in crop species.  Two plant species, Brassica rapa and Arabidopsis thaliana, are used in this research as models for developing computational approaches that will enable both reconstruction of gene networks that regulate density responses and prediction of different traits (such as flowering time, height, and fruit set) from complex genotypes.  Data collection will include 1) quantifying the developmental, morphological, and transcriptional responses of experimental genetic material (such as mutants and segregating progeny) to realistic density treatments and controlled manipulations of light quality indicative of high- and low-density; and 2) recording near-plant environmental conditions in the field, including soil and atmospheric variables, and incident spectra at 15-min intervals.  Field studies will provide an agroecologically relevant picture of gene function.  In modeling, the project will integrate genetic and environmental data to generate a more complete gene network than is possible from mutant or laboratory studies alone.  Finally, because yield and other phenotypes serve as model outputs, the computational approaches will enable the prediction of diverse traits from plant genotypes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will 1) develop evolutionary genetics modules to educate teachers on evolutionary theory and basic molecular genetic approaches and 2) provide seed "kits" to be used in age-appropriate, inquiry-based exercises.  Approximately 75 teachers will be hosted annually in Wyoming, and this educational outreach should ultimately reach between 60-70% of all biology teachers in the state.  As a further outreach component, the computational technology to be used involves a network of computing volunteers.  Via the project website, this network provides another venue to distribute educational materials.  Finally, long-term, high-sampling-rate time series of incident irradiance spectra are extremely rare but of interest to communities ranging from plant scientists to solar energy researchers.  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory will web-deliver the wide-band spectral measurements made as part of this research.  DNA sequence and gene expression information will be deposited in the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) SRA and GEO databases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching objective of this project is to describe dynamic aspects of growth and development in response to crowding in agroecologically relevant environments.          The effects of many genes vary depending on genetic background, environment, and stage of organismal development.  To understand gene function and the role of specific loci in determining yield, it is critical to use natural variants and agroecologically relevant growth settings. Further, many important traits are process endpoints, whose phenotypic expression is determined over weeks by varying genetic and environmental factors.  Single-point measurements cannot capture the ontogenetic contingency of these traits, and therefore provide a poor link to the underlying biological mechanisms.  An alternative is to make time-course measurements of plant growth and construct mathematical functions to capture relevant biological parameters (known as function-value traits, FVT). This work contributed to genotype to phenotype prediction in diverse genotypes grown over environmentally variable ranges, a topic of relevance to agronomists across the nation.  This research made advances in 4 areas:  High-throughput phenotyping: Methods for high-throughput measurement of plant size were completed under this project, including 1) a low-cost imaging-based pipeline for both growth-chamber and field settings, 2) novel image processing algorithms for measuring leaf length and 2D rosette area, 3) an additional pipeline to collect overhead plant images and analyze resulting time-series of 2D and 3D rosette areas, plant nastic movements, diurnal cycles, and plant growth; this platform allowed rapid throughput of &gt;1000 unique genetic lines of the model system, Arabidopsis (mouse-ear cress). A second imaging platform and MATLAB-based program were developed to specifically ascertain circadian rhythms, which control many aspects of plant growth and affect plant yield. This method was validated in diverse species, including Brassica rapa (turnip, cabbage, and oilseeds), Glycine max (soybean), Mimulus guttatus (monkey flower), Boechera stricta (Drummond?s rockcress, a Wyoming native plant), and Arabidopsis, highlighting the broad applicability of this method. High-throughput spectral data were collected and successfully applied as a proxy for plant physiological traits. High-throughput phenotyping is central to characterizing the genetic bases of and environmental effects on diverse traits, including dynamic growth traits that were the focus of this project.  Function-value trait and predictive modeling: This project developed a Bayesian modeling framework for FVT that better estimated trait values in comparison to frequentist approaches. (Bayesian statistics assign probabilities based on the state of knowledge, which is updated as information is gained, and frequentist statistics define the probability of an event by the relative frequency in a large number of trials). In short, Bayesian approaches leverage global information in a dataset whereas frequentist statistics do not. For multiple traits, including maximum leaf size, maximum plant height, duration of time by which 95% of growth was complete, and leaf allometry, heritability estimates and genomic mapping were improved using trait estimates from Bayesian modeling. The initial model was extended to include controls for differences in resource (carbon) pools among plants and to apply remotely-sensed and high-throughput proxies for resource levels. Function-value trait modeling and genomic mapping clearly demonstrated that continuous measurements over time capture dynamic aspects of growth and relevant genetic controls not obtained in single-time point measures, and Bayesian modeling of these traits improved precision of genomic mapping.   Genomic analyses and applications:  Transcriptomic (RNAseq) data in Brassica rapa crosses were analyzed to achieve several aims: 1) produce a high-density genetic map (map available at https://github.com/rjcmarkelz/brassica_genetic_map_paper), 2) perform comprehensive mapping of quantitative trait loci that affect expression patterns (eQTL), in which eQTL identified a strong candidate gene underlying spectral absorbance and this candidate was validated through biochemical analyses, 3) identify candidate genes for height FVT, and 4) re-construct regulatory networks determining Brassica rapa responses to crowding that can affect yield in agricultural settings. Genetic maps are a fundamental resource in Brassica and other species, and successful genomic mapping of a remotely-sensed trait suggests a new avenue for connecting traits to genes.  In addition, our very deep RNAseq data allowed us to substantially improve the annotation and gene models for the B. rapa genome, and our dense genetic map allowed us to fix multiple assembly errors.  Translational research from Arabidopsis: Transcriptomic data in Arabidopsis was used for re-construction of leaf-expansion and inflorescence-elongation regulatory networks. Transcriptomic analyses of light-signaling mutants raised under Red:Far-Red light manipulations showed early growth-hormone responses followed by changes in defense and then metabolism.  They revealed a pervasive and unexpectedly strong connection between growth and defense pathways and identified a defense hormone pathway as essential for growth response to shade. These Arabidopsis networks can be compared to network topologies developed from transcriptomic data collected in B. rapa or in additional crop species.  Genomic analyses have identified new and shared components of adult shade-avoidance and thereby refined the annotation of shade-avoidance genes and description of regulatory networks; these findings have been applied in regulatory network re-construction in the crop species Brassica rapa.
