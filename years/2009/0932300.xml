<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title:  Next Generation Composites CREST Center, NextGenC3&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Southern University and A&amp;M College, Baton Rouge (SUBR)&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date:  7/27/09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With NSF support, Southern University and A&amp;M College, Baton Rouge (SUBR) will undergo the development of strong collaborative, innovative, and self-sustaining research and education in the establishment of the proposed Next Generation Composites CREST Center (NextGenC3). This Center will be a leading entity that promotes the creation of new knowledge in collaboration with scientists and researchers in institutions, research centers, national labs, and industry, and will serve as a beacon for the education of future scientists and engineers with diverse, competitive, and well-trained populace in the area of next generation composite materials and technology. The major objectives of the CREST Center will be to provide excellent educational opportunities to traditionally underrepresented students in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines and to produce synergistic understanding of next generation composites through the development of integrated and pioneering research. The NextGenC3 CREST Center will investigate three research focus areas: Development of Multifunctional Composites and Structures: Sensing, Damage Tolerance, and Vibration Damping; Grid Confined Shape Memory Particulate Composites for Impact Mitigation and Self-Healing; and Synthesis of the Next Generation Composites: Cure-On Demand Coatings, Self-healing, and Sensing Polymers. The development of NextGenC3 will yield new opportunities by providing researchers at SUBR with infrastructure and resources that will immeasurably enhance their research capabilities. The NextGenC3 will play an important role in the training of minority students to become future Materials Scientists and Engineers. The research and educational activities of the center includes stress-strain analysis, optimization, and failure criterion of multifunctional composites; kinetics of new resin systems, interfacial bonding strength development and evaluation, damage mechanics based structural analysis, integration of sensing and healing ability to composites, failure criterion, development of high damage tolerance; and thermo-electro-mechanical response of polymer composites, and design and modeling for optimum properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed NSF CREST Center will have broader impacts on research, research productivity and capabilities, and education in material sciences &amp; engineering at Southern University. The development of cutting edge interdisciplinary research based on next generation composites and educational activities through this Center will provide students traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines with more meaningful research experiences at a readily accessible advanced research facility. The Center will help develop the necessary technical knowledge and skills so that qualified minority students will be produced to fill positions in the field of materials science and engineering. The increasing use of composites in applications, such as automotive, naval, aerospace, energy generation, and transportation structures, where light weight, damage tolerance, and multifunctionality are major factors, has highlighted the need for better materials research. The innovation and research at this Center will provide new and more durable multifunctional materials to advance the infrastructure of our nation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Overview: Southern University and A&amp;M College (SU) in collaboration with Louisiana State University (LSU) and supported by from the National Science Foundation Center of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (NSF CREST) established the Next Generation Composites CREST Center (NextGenC3). This research and educational thrust focused on scientific understanding and technology development in next generation composite materials, and associated educational activities that provided students traditionally underrepresented minorities (URM) in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) with excellent educational and training opportunities. &nbsp; Three subprojects anchored the center: I. Development of Multifunctional Composites and Structures: Sensing, Damage Tolerance, and Vibration Damping; II. Grid Confined Shape Memory Particulate Composites for Impact Mitigation and Self-Healing &ndash; and III. Synthesis of the Next-Generation Composites: Cure-On Demand Coatings, Self-Healing and Sensing Polymers.Intellectual Merit exemplified in the following: &nbsp;(1) Self-healing composite. We proposed the idea of two-step biomimetic self-healing strategy &ndash; close then heal (CTH), and proved that wide-opened cracks can be healed repeatedly, timely, and molecularly based on shape memory effect and dispersed healing agent; (2) Traction-separation laws. We developed analytical modeling and proposed test protocols for determining energy release rate and traction-separation laws under Mode I, Mode II, and mixed Mode I&amp;II fracture load in adhesively bonded composite structures; and (3) Smart composite. We deepened understanding in chemical reaction kinetics and thermo-electro-mechanical response, and integrated sensing and healing ability into polymer composites.Broader Impacts exemplified in the following:Publications: The Center has published 1 book, 1 book chapter, 45 peer-reviewed journal papers, and 30 conference proceedings in some lead solid mechanics and polymer composite journals. Research Products: US Patent awarded to &ldquo;Thermosetting Shape Memory Polymers with Ability to Perform Repeated Molecular Scale Healing&rdquo;; (US9, 493,643 B2). US Patent Applications (1) #13/445,127 on &ldquo;Freestanding Network of Carbon Nanofibers;&rdquo; and (2) #62/134,254 on &ldquo;Biosensor Including Carbon Nanofibers.&rdquo;Human Resource Development: NextGenC3 directly supported 141 students, 9 Post docs and has impacted over 300 students through courses and organized STEM conferences. Twelve faculty researchers were also supported. 137 of the supported students are from SU, 84 are undergraduates and 53 are graduate students; 86 are African American; 38 are women. Of the 54 women, 32 are African American of whom nine are master&rsquo;s students and 2 are doctoral students. Graduates include 7 African American PhDs (5 males, and 2 females). The disciplines impacted are Material Science and Engineering (4), Environmental Toxicology program (1), Science and Mathematics Education (2). NextGenC3 has also been very instrumental in streamlining students and post-doctoral associates into the workforce. &nbsp;Center Graduates and Post-docs have secured engineering and technical positions in more than 15 highly reputable companies such as Honda, Shell, Ford, etc., and in the academia. Post-Docs: Drs. Stephen Akwaboa, and Fareed Dawan (SU ME Assistant professors), Ali Ghamsari, Scott Wicker (SU Chemistry Assistant professor), Ephraim Zegeye (Assistant professor, Maryland University), and Emmanuel Gikunoo (Ghanaian professor). &nbsp;Highlights of Leveraging NSF CREST Resources with Other NSF Funded Projects: NextGenC3 collaborated with NSF funded projects at SU as follows: 1) NSF RII Track I &nbsp;- Louisiana Alliance for Simulation Guided Materials Analysis (LaSIGMA); 2) NSF HBCU-Achieving Competiveness and Excellence (ACE) Program; 3) NSF HBCU-Research Infrastructure in Science and Engineering; 4) NSF IRES&ndash; an international water purification project. 5) More than $4 million in research funding from other funding agencies such as NASA-EPSCoR and DOD(ARO).&nbsp;Infrastructure Improvement included acquisition of equipment, and enhancement of research laboratories at SU. Major research equipment such as a Transmission Electron Microscope, Phantom Scanning Electron Microscope, FTIR spectroscope, 3-D Printer, Nanoindenter with AFM capabilities, optical fiber spectrometer were acquired. A wet chemistry lab with chemical synthesis and analytical chemistry instrumentation tools was also established. &nbsp;Courses Developed and Taught to over 300 minority students on &ldquo;Micro- and Nano-Fabrication and Applications,&rdquo; &ldquo;Materials Processing,&rdquo; &ldquo;Composite Materials,&rdquo; &ldquo;Topics in Materials Science,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fundamentals in Engineering Materials&rdquo; (graduate course).Outreach Activities included 11 seminars, and one organized national STEM conference at SU for undergraduate and graduate students (76 registered participants from various national institutions, 27 submitted abstracts, 16 oral presentations, and 17 poster presentations). SU URM students participated in the Research Experience for Undergraduates at University of Delaware. Active outreach to K-12 included supporting, and mentoring high school students designing sustainable houses for a national competition, middle school students trip to NASA Kennedy Space Center, judging science and engineering fairs at local high schools, and readings to a third grade class at elementary school.&nbsp;Dissemination of Outputs: NextGenC3 activities were disseminated through center&rsquo;s active website, and social media outlets such as Facebook&reg;, Twitter&reg;, and YouTube&reg;. Participants attended more than 15 national, and 9 international conferences with acclaimed presentations of research work. &nbsp;Eleven seminars organized by NextGenC3 at SU.

Stephen Akwaboa, and Fareed Dawan (SU ME Assistant professors), Ali Ghamsari, Scott Wicker (SU Chemistry Assistant professor), Ephraim Zegeye (Assistant professor, Maryland University), and Emmanuel Gikunoo (Ghanaian professor).  Highlights of Leveraging NSF CREST Resources with Other NSF Funded Projects: NextGenC3 collaborated with NSF funded projects at SU as follows: 1) NSF RII Track I  - Louisiana Alliance for Simulation Guided Materials Analysis (LaSIGMA); 2) NSF HBCU-Achieving Competiveness and Excellence (ACE) Program; 3) NSF HBCU-Research Infrastructure in Science and Engineering; 4) NSF IRES&ndash; an international water purification project. 5) More than $4 million in research funding from other funding agencies such as NASA-EPSCoR and DOD(ARO). Infrastructure Improvement included acquisition of equipment, and enhancement of research laboratories at SU. Major research equipment such as a Transmission Electron Microscope, Phantom Scanning Electron Microscope, FTIR spectroscope, 3-D Printer, Nanoindenter with AFM capabilities, optical fiber spectrometer were acquired. A wet chemistry lab with chemical synthesis and analytical chemistry instrumentation tools was also established.  Courses Developed and Taught to over 300 minority students on "Micro- and Nano-Fabrication and Applications," "Materials Processing," "Composite Materials," "Topics in Materials Science," and "Fundamentals in Engineering Materials" (graduate course).Outreach Activities included 11 seminars, and one organized national STEM conference at SU for undergraduate and graduate students (76 registered participants from various national institutions, 27 submitted abstracts, 16 oral presentations, and 17 poster presentations). SU URM students participated in the Research Experience for Undergraduates at University of Delaware. Active outreach to K-12 included supporting, and mentoring high school students designing sustainable houses for a national competition, middle school students trip to NASA Kennedy Space Center, judging science and engineering fairs at local high schools, and readings to a third grade class at elementary school. Dissemination of Outputs: NextGenC3 activities were disseminated through center?s active website, and social media outlets such as Facebook&reg;, Twitter&reg;, and YouTube&reg;. Participants attended more than 15 national, and 9 international conferences with acclaimed presentations of research work.  Eleven seminars organized by NextGenC3 at SU. Two widely attended workshops are NDT workshop at LSU and Nanoindenter equipment training at SU.       Last Modified: 01/30/2017       Submitted by: Patrick F Mensah]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
