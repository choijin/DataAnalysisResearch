<AbstractNarration>This award supports a student session at the 2nd Workshop on Question Generation. The aim of the workshop is to strengthen the Question Generation (QG) research community and create consensus with respect to QG as a shared task. The 2nd Workshop on Question Generation is a 1-day workshop organized into two sets of sessions. In the morning sessions, regular paper presentations on general topics related to QG are scheduled. The afternoon sessions are dedicated to discussions and presentations related to QG in Intelligent Tutoring Systems, one category of shared tasks identified at the previous Workshop on The Question Generation Shared Task and Evaluation Challenge. As part of the afternoon sessions we have a student session. Attending the workshop will greatly impact the scientific awareness and skills of students. It will allow students to become real contributors and leaders of the QG research community by engaging in discussions at the workshop about important research issues in this area of research. The workshop is a great venue for student to be exposed to interdisciplinary research which will definitely strengthen their skills. The broad implications of QG research will increase students? motivation to do research in this area. The students attending the workshop will be among future leading scientists who could boost our national STEM education, a mission of particular interest to the National Science Foundation, due to the importance of QG in learning technologies. We will encourage participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering, including minorities, women, and persons with disabilities.</AbstractNarration>
