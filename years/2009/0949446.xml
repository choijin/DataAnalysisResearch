<AbstractNarration>The Computational Infrastructure of Geodynamics (CIG) will develop, support and disseminate community-accessible software for the greater geodynamics community from model developers to the broad spectrum of end-users.  Software will support a tremendous variety of geodynamic research from mantle and core dynamics, to crustal and earthquake dynamics, to magma migration and seismology.  To be successful, the CIG will develop and maintain a high level of community participation across this research spectrum to ensure:&lt;br/&gt;?  Reusable, well-documented  geodynamics software that can be demonstrated to be keeping pace with developments in hardware.&lt;br/&gt;?  Basic software building blocks from which state-of-the-art modeling codes could be quickly assembled;&lt;br/&gt;?  Extension of existing software frameworks to interlink multiple codes and data through a superstructure layer;&lt;br/&gt;?  Strategic partnerships with the larger world of computational science and geoinformatics to ensure ?best practices? community-specific tool kits for scientific computations in solid-Earth sciences;&lt;br/&gt;?  Specialized training and workshops for both the geodynamics and larger Earth Science communities; and&lt;br/&gt;?  Hardware resources sufficient to support and facilitate software development and community use.</AbstractNarration>

The community coordination and community building fostered by CIG has changed the culture in computational geophysics research by improving scientific software development practices and has influenced the education of hundreds of geodynamicists. CIG's approach towards writing and disseminating scientific software has become indispensable to the geophysics community and has established and sustained deep ties to computational sciences.  Hundreds of high-quality, peer-reviewed scientific publications have used this software and are available from a database maintained on the website geodynamics.org. CIG has promoted scientific reproducibility in computational modeling by developing tools and best practices for citation of scientific software as an intellectual product.  CIG training and workshops have brought state-of-the art computational methods to many researchers, especially early-career scientists, helping to prepare a diverse STEM workforce who are qualified to both use and develop computational methods in geosciences and beyond. By investing in the development of scientists into world-class computational geophysicists, CIG has contributed to a workforce that is well prepared to address societal needs using computational geophysics methods in their own work in academia, industry, and government careers.  Intellectual Merits:  The intellectual merits of this project include (1) scientific advances in research into the geodynamo, seismology, deformation of the Earth?s crust, convection in the Earth?s mantle, dynamics and structure of subduction zones, spreading centers, mantle upwellings, origins and evolution of Earth?s topographic features, magma formation and migration in the Earth, the implications of equations-of-state for interpretation of Earth?s structure, and related scientific questions (2) advances in  mathematical and computational methods for geoscience and improved performance and accuracy of computational methods in the geosciences (3) understanding of how scientific communities use and develop computation for scientific innovation and improved methods for training and education in computational thinking, numerical methods, and best practices for scientific software.  Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of CIG includes (1) preparation of a diverse STEM workforce that is able to use, develop, and advance computational science and computational thinking for the solid-earth sciences; (2) development of improved cyberinfrastructure in the form of software, documentation, repositories, and associated materials; (3) establishment and dissemination of best practices in development, implementation, and dissemination of scientific software; (4) development of an engaged scientific community that uses and improvises scientific software for modeling in the geosciences; (5) interagency partnerships to promote cooperation on the use of scientific computing for critically important research and applications; (6) improved use of high performance computing for the geosciences; (7) international collaboration in computational geophysics research and education, and (7) outreach to the public about scientific discovery.
