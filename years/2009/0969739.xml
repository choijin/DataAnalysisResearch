<AbstractNarration>This is a renewal award for the support of the High-Energy Theory group at the C.N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics (YITP) at SUNY Stony Brook.  Professors covered under this award are Maria (Concha) Gonzalez-Garcia, Martin Rocek, Robert Shrock, Warren Siegel, and George Sterman.  Collectively, this group conducts research in a variety of areas in theoretical physics, including the phenomenology of high-energy colliders, extensions of the Standard Model, electroweak symmetry breaking, neutrino and astroparticle physics, leptogenesis, superstrings, the geometry of supersymmetric gauge theories, quantum chromodynamics and field/string dualities.  As such, their work is both phenomenological and formal; likewise, their phenomenological work involves both electroweak physics and strong-interaction physics.  Together, they are proposing to tackle some of the outstanding questions in these disciplines, many of which will have direct relevance for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include advancing our knowledge of the laws of Nature and contributing toward a better understanding of the physical universe.  The research outlined in this proposal will also serve in the training of graduate students and mentoring of postdoctoral fellows.  The faculty to be supported under this proposal also plan outreach efforts to reach a broader public, and indeed one of the faculty members supported by this grant organizes a major summer school in string theory  each year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The award "Theoretical Physics" resulted in significant scientific advances and substantial career development through doctoral research.   Its five senior faculty carried on research in a broad area of the physics of elementary particles and the fundamental forces of nature.    Intellectual Merit:  In this period, results regarding elementary particles included insights into the production of the newly-discovered Higgs boson, of neutrinos from space and the earth.  The research led to improvements in our ability to predict the outcomes of collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, which is where the Higgs boson was discovered, and where searches for new fundamental laws of nature will be carried out for decades to come.   Research was carried out into the mathematical structure of quantum field theories, which underly our current understanding of the universe as a whole, and serve as the basis of our ability to create new materials and devices.  This included the identification of entirely new quantum field theories, not yet seen in nature, but with deep connections to modern mathematics.  Other connections with mathematics and the physics of solids were made through the study of the mathematics of diagrams.  New results were derived on the connection between quantum fields and their cousin string theories, which may serve to provide an even more fundamental basis for our description of nature.    Broader Impact:  Much of this work was carried out with doctoral students, as an integral part of their professional training.   The senior facutly all engage in teaching at the graduate and undergraduate level at Stony Brook University, and are active in outreach and training outside the university, including lectures at advanced schools.   The scientific progress described above contributes to our understanding of our physical world at its most fundamental level.
