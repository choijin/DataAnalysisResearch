<AbstractNarration>Haemosporida, malaria blood parasites, are diverse and widespread and are major parasites and pathogens of birds, reptiles, and mammals, including humans and domestic animals. Despite their ecological, evolutionary, and public health importance, these parasites, their distribution, and their evolutionary biology are poorly known, in large part owing to the dearth of trained investigators familiar with the molecular techniques required to identify infections in wild populations. Additionally, Haemosporida form a model group for study of host-specificity of disease organisms and the emergence of novel diseases through such mechanisms as host-switching.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Coordination Network (RCN) will improve understanding of malaria blood parasites, and of the disease risks they entail, through an integrated set of actions. The RCN will establish and operate a website to provide information, sources of data, and tools for parasite identification, and will contribute to advancing ability to classify these single-celled blood parasites that are known primarily from DNA sequences obtained from the blood of infected hosts. A major feature of the RCN will be the establishment of one-week summer schools with intensive training for young investigators, particularly from developing countries, in the techniques of working with malaria parasites, from collecting blood samples in the field to the molecular lab techniques for obtaining DNA sequence data and using the analytical tools to interpret their findings. The Network will be completely open to interested individuals and will serve as a forum for promoting research and collaboration on these model disease organisms.</AbstractNarration>

During the past grant year (April 1, 2015&mdash;March 31, 2016), which has been the fifth year of the Malaria RCN project, our principal activities were to hold the Fourth International Workshop on Malaria and Related Haemosporidian Parasites of Wildlife, September 28-October 1, 2015, at the National Conservation Training Center (NCTC) in Shepherdstown, West Virginia. The workshop was led by seven internationally known researchers on haemosporidian parasites, who are also members of the RCN steering committee and co-PIs on the supporting NSF grant: Carter Atkinson, USGS Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center; Staffan Bensch, Lund University, Sweden; Robert Fleischer, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute; Susan Perkins, American Museum of Natural History; Robert Ricklefs, University of Missouri, St. Louis; Ravinder Sehgal, San Francisco State University; Gediminas Valkiunas, Nature Research Centre, Vilnius, Lithuania. The teaching assistant for the workshop was Leticia Soares, a Brazilian doctoral student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. The workshop covered field and laboratory techniques for capturing birds, obtaining blood samples, making blood smears, mosquito salivary gland preparations, vector identification, parasite identification and taxonomy, and a discussion of parasite evolution and systematics. All students and faculty presented brief talks on their work. Web resources (Genbank, Malavi database) were discussed and students carried out DNA sequence alignments and phylogenetic reconstruction techniques.
