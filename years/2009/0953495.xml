<AbstractNarration>The research focus of this project is to develop a novel evolutionary computation-based approach for identifying candidate modules in non-coding DNA that respond to environmental toxins (such as arsenic) and that alter gene expression. These modules are composed of short pieces of DNA that are binding sites for proteins; the cooperative and combinatorial interactions are believed to contribute to the inducibility and specificity of environmentally responsive genes. Since each gene has an enormous number of possible modules, searching for them in the laboratory is untenable; even an exhaustive computational search for candidate modules is impractical, given the large space. Thus, the development of artificial intelligence techniques is called for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an interdisciplinary proposal that makes contributions in both computer science and biology. The computational contributions include designing an effective search through the large and complex space of possible modules. While a few existing tools have been designed to search the thousand base pair region immediately upstream of the gene, the work here is designed to search significantly longer sections, 1 million base pairs and longer in length. The existing approaches cannot be expected to scale to the larger search, requiring the development of a novel approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has plans for introducing undergraduates to research, both through coursework and in supervised research projects. This proposal will support and encourage the creation of a new upper-level course in informatics as well as the development of informatics-themed exercises to be incorporated at the introductory level. The project will further directly support undergraduate researchers who will contribute to the core research project.&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in a well integrated program of research and teaching for the PI, contribute to the available tools and our understanding of evolutionary computation approaches for informatics work, and introduce scores of students to this work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merits: Over 95 percent of our DNA does not directly code for genes. Formerly called "junk" DNA, it is now understood that some of these noncoding regions are functional; however, determining which regions are functional is a complex biological problem. Computationally, we are able to identify promising candidates for biological investigation, thus hastening the process of scientific discovery. Using the heuristic that motifs (patterns) in noncoding DNA that have been conserved across evolutionary time are more likely to be functional, we have developed a computational tool, GAMI (genetic algorithms for motif inference), that searches for highly conserved motifs in noncoding DNA. GAMI is able to search for patterns in large datasets, avoiding computational bottlenecks found in some other tools. Using GAMI and supporting tools and working with biological collaborators, we have investigated regulatory regions for several genes of interest. We have additionally validated our computational findings by conducting biological assays for the FOXJ1 gene using an urchin model. Additionally through this project, we have created a complementary tool, GPS (genome pattern scan), which will identify sites in the human genome (or another genome) where a regulatory element might bind to the DNA. Whereas GAMI finds candidate regulatory elements for a gene of interest, GPS finds candidate genes that might be regulated by a regulatory element of interest. Using these tools together, one can investigate genetic regulation on multiple levels.   Broader impacts:  &bull; GAMI and GPS enable us to make scientific discoveries about genetic regulation by filtering large amounts of genetic data to produce high-quality hypotheses to be investigated in the biological laboratory. &bull; Upper-level computer science majors have been trained in computer science research and introduced to multidisciplinary work through research experiences and the courses pursued in this project. &bull; Early-stage computer science majors and high school students have been exposed to artificial intelligence and bioinformatics research. &bull; There is evidence that applied and interdisciplinary work, such as bioinformatics, is often more appealing to female students. This project has supported a high proportion of female students as well as others from groups traditionally underrepresented in computer science, such as students with learning disabilities, racial minorities, first-generation college students, and low-income students.
