<AbstractNarration>MODELING THE MECHANICS OF LIGHT ACTIVATED SHAPE MEMORY POLYMERS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Light activated shape memory polymers are novel materials that can undergo large changes in shape on exposure to specific frequencies of light. These materials are being utilized in a variety of technologically challenging applications. To hasten their use, it is essential to have models that can predict the behavior of light activated shape memory polymers under a variety of different conditions.  To answer this need, this research focuses on developing constitutive models that can describe the mechanical response of light activated shape memory polymers. This is accomplished using the theory of multiple natural configurations within a consistent thermodynamic framework. The accuracy of the models is validated by comparing the predictions of the model against experimental data. The validated models are then used to generate computational tools capable of simulating the behavior of these materials undergoing complex three dimensional deformations.&lt;br/&gt;Due to their unique properties, light activated shape memory polymers are finding use in a variety of areas ranging from implantable biomedical devices, actuators to aerospace applications. These materials can result in the invention of groundbreaking new devices. To assist in creating and developing these applications to their fullest extent, and in an efficient manner, it is critical to calculate accurately the behavior these materials. The results of this research will enhance the understanding of these materials and directly enable engineers and designers to simulate and model applications computationally with confidence. In addition undergraduate students will participate on the project, giving them hands on research experience. The results obtained will be used to improve active and cooperative learning in the mechanics classes taught by the principal investigator at both the undergraduate and graduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
