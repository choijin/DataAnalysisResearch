<AbstractNarration>In this CAREER project the PI will study pre-clustering of the IgE receptor system. The proposed approach is to use the intermittent and independent fluctuations of fluorescent probes that are either photo-switchable or naturally intermittent to extract individual trajectories even when there are clusters of fluorophores with sizes below the diffraction limit. The approach is based on finding parameters and states in hidden Markov models and this approach will be further developed. The specific aims of this project are (1) to use fluorescent probes that are either photo-switchable or naturally intermittent to find single membrane protein trajectories of high density membrane components; (2) to use the trajectories of closely spaced proteins in conjunction with physical models to extract the binding kinetics between single molecules and to map out the energy landscape of the cell membrane; (3) using the developed techniques, to characterize the behavior of the IgE binding receptor of RBL-2H3 cells. The project will provide multidisciplinary training for a graduate student as well as undergraduate students and offer annual, paid research mentorships to high school students in the Albuquerque, New Mexico area. A student exchange program with the Quantitative Imaging group at Delft Technical University, Netherlands will allow up to 3 months annual international study for graduate students or promising undergraduates. An upper level Biophysics course will be developed based on the research interests of the PI's department. Speakers will be invited from within the U.S. to give talks on related research in a biophysics seminar series.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goals of this project were to develop instrumentation and analysis techniques capable of exploring the dynamics of membrane proteins at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The major direct scientific outcomes of this project were:     (1) The development of a fast GPU-based, multiple-emitter fitting algorithm for super-resolution and single particle tracking that we subsequently used in hyperspectral multi-color tracking analysis and super-resolution imaging of podosomes in dendritic cells. This analysis method has been used by other researchers as part of a live-cell super-resolution method.        (2) The development of a maximum likelihood method to estimate the diffusion constant from single particle tracking trajectories. This method takes into account the often encountered experimental effects of finite camera exposure time, variable localization precision, and intermittent trajectories.      (3) The development of a hidden Markov model method for identifying membrane protein dimerization from multi-color single particle tracking data.  This method was used to study dimers of the membrane proteins Erb1, Erb3 and Erb1 mutants that are linked with certain cancers.     (4) The development of a resolution measure for super-resolution imaging that takes into accounts both localization precision and localization density.  Recent super-resolution techniques are able to circumvent the diffraction limit and therefore the resolution does not have a hard bound and may vary between instruments and experiments.  This method has become the de-facto method for quantify the resolution achieved in super-resolution images.         Additional results included the development of a method for using phase-retrieved pupil functions to generate 3D PSF models leading to more accurate 3D particle tracking and super-resolution; development of single particle tracking and localization based super-resolution using fluorogen activating proteins; development of methods for analyzing structures and clusters from super-resolution data.       This project supported the training and development of several high-school students, undergraduate students and graduate students.  Two UNM graduate students were directly supported and have successfully completed their PhD degree programs. Two additional graduate students from Delft Technical University were hosted at UNM for several months as a part of a Delft-UNM exchange program.  This project supported undergraduate research for 5 UNM undergraduates who each contributed for about 1 year in the lab.   Four high-school students were supported by two-month summer internships.             Last Modified: 03/07/2017       Submitted by: Keith Lidke]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
