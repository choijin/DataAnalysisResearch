    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide support to defray expenses of researchers participating in the 33rd Summer Symposium in Real Analysis to be held June 23-27, 2009 at Southeastern Oklahoma State University. This conference has been held annually since 1978, twice in 1982, and is considered to be a major meeting of its type for the real analysis community. Support will be provided to participants who do not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions made for some senior researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will feature three invited speakers and a number of contributed talks. The principal objective of this meeting is to introduce young mathematicians to the field, as well as to provide a forum for presentation of the current state of the art of the theory. The organizers intend to actively involve young mathematicians, female mathematicians, and mathematicians from other under-represented groups, to which much of the funding will be directed. Graduate students are expected to participate at the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
