<AbstractNarration>With the advances of modern computer architectures, interconnects are playing an ever increasingly important role for providing an effective communication medium. Advanced optical switching technologies, such as optical packet switching and wavelength-division-multiplexing, provide a platform to exploit the huge capacity of optical fiber to meet the increasing needs.  This research proposes a new switching paradigm - optical cut-through with electronic packet buffering, and systematically investigates the fundamental and challenging issues in the optical interconnect under this switching scheme, with the objective of designing cost-effective, ultra-low latency and pragmatic interconnects for future high-performance computing and communications systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique feature of the proposed interconnect is that those packets that do not cause contention can pass the interconnect directly in optical form and experience minimum delay, while only those that cause contention are buffered. This research proposes to combine optical packet switching with electronic buffering, such that the interconnect will enjoy both fast switching and large buffering capacity.  This research will (1) design the switching fabric and packet scheduling algorithms, (2) design practical Forward Error Control (FEC) for the interconnect, and  (3) conduct extensive performance evaluations by means of simulation and emulation tools and analytical models. The outcome of this project will have a significant impact on fundamental design principles and infrastructures for the development of future high-performance computing and communications systems. The PIs will integrate graduate and undergraduate students into the project and promote the participation of female and minority students. The findings will be disseminated to the research community by way of conferences, journals, and web site access.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It has become consensus in recent year that optics plays an important role in ultra-high speed interconnection networks. This project studies a new switching paradigm - optical cut-through (OpCut)  with electronic packet buffering, and systematically investigates the fundamental and challenging issues in the optical interconnects under this paradigm with the objective of designing cost-effective ultralow latency and pragmatic interconnects for future high-performance systems.  Our major findings in this project can be summarized as follows.    By combining optical fiber delay lines (FDLs) with switches, it is possible to achieve flexible buffering delay in optical switches. Given that virtual output queues (VOQs) are difficult to implement due to the absence of optical RAM, optical switches and interconnects can benefit from such flexible buffering fabrics.    A basic scheduler decomposes packet scheduling in the OpCut switch into three stages, namely, a matching between switch input and output for newly arrived packets cut-through, a matching between switch input and electronic buffer to pick up packets that cannot cut-through, and a matching between electronic buffer and switch output for transmission of buffered packets.    For the single-wavelength OpCut switch, the system performance can benefit from a pipelined scheduling mechanism. By pipelining multiple sub-schedulers and let each of them work on a subset of the packets to be scheduled, the complexity of the schedulers can be reduced and the system throughput can be increased. The pipeline mechanism can be further made adaptive to better support varying traffic intensity.  For the WDM OpCut switch, finding a schedule that sends the maximum number of packets to the switch output without violating packet order is NP-hard and inapproximable in polynomial time within any constant factor, which can be proved through the reduction of the set packing problem.    The Longest-or-Heads algorithm approximates the optimal schedule in WDM OpCut switches within a factor of 2Nk with regard to the number of packets transmitted, where N is the switch size and k is the number of wavelengths multiplexed on each fiber. The result is consistent with the best known approximation algorithm for the set packing problem.    Our model shows that very few optical transmitters need to be added to the OpCut switch to ensure that the non-local packets will not overflow the buffer under Bernoulli traffic. Moreover, no additional optical receivers need to be added to reduce the packet loss of non-local packets to 10^(-6). The model also reveals that very few optical transmitters are required to keep the average packet delay at very-low level (less than 0.5 time slot).
