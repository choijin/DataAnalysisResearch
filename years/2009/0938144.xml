<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates the ways that citizens and policy makers attend to stimulus funds under the Recovery Act of 2009. The research develops new methods to estimate the impact of stimulus funds on the perceptions of citizens and the choices of local community decision makers. The project leverages another research design that is preparing to go into the field. That project draws a sample of citizens and public officials across matched communities and builds a panel. The research added here will increase the size of the panel of subjects, changes how often we return to the communities and allows us to study expectations for stimulus spending and, subsequently, the short-term impact of stimulus spending under the Recovery Act of 2009. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Substantial research will debate the economic effects of the Recovery Act of 2009. The social and political aspects of the influx of money into government institutions will be less understood. This research will enable us to understand how citizen trust in government is related to stimulus spending and the actions of public officials. This relates to broader questions of citizen confidence in democratic institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project overview:  This project addressed three questions: First, to what extent are the expectations of citizens distorted with respect to the amount and impact of ARRA stimulus spending in their local communities?  Second, how is trust in local public officials affected by expectations that turn out to be inaccurate?  Third, to what extent do citizens blame officials at different levels of government (federal, state, local) for failing to obtain a large influx of stimulus money?  The research design leveraged the infrastructure of another study in two small communities in Texas.  We utilized a sample that included citizens as well as elected and civil service employees within each community.  The sample was surveyed twice, in June-September 2009, and again in May and June 2010.   Measures of expectations about stimulus funding and responsibility of government officials were implemented using survey questions.  Trust was also assessed with survey measures, but also by using an incentivized behavioral measure.  The behavioral measure &ndash; the Trust Game &ndash; is an established lab experiment which we adapted for use in the field.  All measures were conducted at both visits.   Our study included a plan to collect voting data in order to assess the impact of expectations on candidate support.  However, voting data were collected in one locality; the other locality decided not to hold an election as none of the offices were contested.  This limited our ability to determine the impact on elections.     Key Findings:  The project occurred at an opportune time for asking about citizen expectations for stimulus money going into their communities.  The project has three findings.   First, we found that citizen expectations were not distorted.  Slightly over half our sample thought that stimulus money would come into their community.  We returned to the same communities (and many of the same people) between nine and ten months after the first part of the study.  We found that expectations were in line with what the communities received.   Second, trust did not markedly change across time for citizens.  Most citizens exhibit high levels of trust in local officials and moderate levels of trust in Federal officials.  That there are high levels of trust in local officials was confirmed using an experiment that matched citizens with public officials.  The experiment resembles a trust problem in which citizens must decide how much to trust their local officials.  The local officials, in turn, are asked to what extent they are willing to reciprocate that trust.  Third, we find that trust in local city government officials declines slightly when citizens believe their community has received very little or no stimulus money.  Trust does not decline for Federal officials or for State officials.  Despite this slight decline in trust local officials are not blamed for not bringing more stimulus money into their community.  Consistent with previous research, if stimulus money came in, citizens were more likely to give credit to Federal officials (the President and their Congressperson) and the Governor.  If the money did not materialize, our sample also held Federal officials and the Governor as responsible.  In both instances local public officials are neither given credit nor blamed.  These findings are similar to those reported for other kinds of government activity &ndash; that is citizens have clear ideas about how to allocate responsibility.     Broader Impacts:  Substantial research has debated the economic effects of the Recovery Act of 2009, and will continue to do so for years to come. For example researchers have addressed the impact of stimulus money on the general economy, or on job creation in specific business sectors.  The political aspects of the influx of money into government institutions has been less studied (and is only vaguely understood). This research enables us to understand how citizen trust in government is related...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
