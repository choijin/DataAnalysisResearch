<AbstractNarration>Dynamic visualizations - interactive, computer based models, simulations, and virtual experiments of scientific phenomena - provide alternative pathways for students to understand science concepts.  Of special interest are those visualizations that make unseen processes visible and those that support inquiry around complex phenomena.  Research concerning the educational values of dynamic visualizations has been contradictory and inconclusive.  This study provides modules and assessments to obtain evidence for how students process dynamic visual data and integrate what they see with what they know.  The project proceeds in three phases.  The first 18 month phase is to study how visualizations can improve science learning for students with a wide range of disciplinary knowledge, background, beliefs, and spatial experience.  The second phase lasting 24 months investigates successful strategies to embed visualizations, combined with hands-on activities, in curriculum materials to enable all students to learn complex science topics.  The last phase of 18 months works to show how practices and cyberlearning tools can be generalized to be more easily used in different environments by developing visualizations for new topics and curricula.  Forty middle and high school science teachers and their students in five diverse districts participate in the study of visualizations applied to the learning of physical science.  The studies build on existing work and tools, but new tools and materials are to be developed as needed.</AbstractNarration>

Visualizations make unseen or abstract phenomena (such as chemical reactions, microscopic processes or planetary motion) visible for further inspection, investigation and inquiry. They provide the opportunity for virtual experimentation and observation by allowing the user to interact with the model (for example, changing variables and running different scenarios).

Using computer technologies we illustrate unprecedented opportunities to design curriculum and assessments using visualizations including games, and to explore them in research, teaching, and learning.  The primary objectives of VISUAL are two-fold: (1) to conduct research that illuminates when and how visualizations can be used to benefit student learning, and (2) to develop technological tools that allow researchers and authors to build upon VISUALÆs research findings when designing visualizations and curriculum scaffolds to support learning from visualizations.  Two main strands of research activities yielded key insights that addressed our specified objectives for this project:  Published meta-analysis study that investigates when and how dynamic visualizations are effective for student learning. This work reviewed and examined the existing body of research on visualizations to clarify the impacts of dynamic visualizations in comparison to static materials (for example, a sequence of non-dynamic images or frames) and to identify successful supporting instructional scaffolds. The meta-analysis revealed that dynamic visualizations are better than static visuals at promoting conceptual inferences about science. Further, the careful design of instructional scaffolds to support learning from visualizations is key. The most successful scaffolds identified include: curriculum prompts that promote reflection on how the visualization differs from prior knowledge, prompts that encourage making distinctions between different parts of the visualization, visual cues that help users to identify salient features, the sequential presentation of multiple visualizations, and interactive features that govern the pacing of activities.  Design, development, implementation and iterative re-design of the Idea Manager, a dual-purpose technological tool that supports both student learning and research.
