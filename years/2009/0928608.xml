<AbstractNarration>This MSP-Start project on global environmental change and local ecosystems is working to enhance science education through the use of the Kansas Area Research and Education Site (KARES), which provides an outdoor learning forum for P-20 students in the Topeka Public school district. This project includes partners from the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, USD 501 (Topeka public schools), community leaders, and state policy-makers. The long-term goal of the Start project is to develop a full MSP Targeted proposal for 2011. The short-term goals of this MSP-Start grant are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To analyze the efficacy of a state-wide collaborative model for improving science education in Kansas.&lt;br/&gt;2. To develop strong collaborative partnerships for meeting the long-term goal of a strong MSP proposal &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this MSP-Start grant is in promoting strong partnerships between public school teachers, university researchers, and government and community leaders and then using these partnerships to develop a world-class education project for students in P-20 that focuses on global environmental change and local ecosystems in Kansas. The leadership team believes it is critical that these students develop an awareness of environmental changes that are occurring on a global scale, as well as that they understand how these changes may influence the local ecosystems in which they live. Such concepts can most effectively be conveyed through inquiry-based learning methods, while simultaneously being age appropriate and meeting the Kansas Science Education Standards. The key school district, USD 501, is a minority-serving district, which commits to work with the university and the state to enhance science education in the state through the development and study of an outdoor learning center where students can engage in inquiry-based learning methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of our MSP-Start grant are the following:   a.     To enhance science education in Kansas through a state-wide partnership focusing on inquiry-based learning methods in ecology   b.    To fully develop a Targeted MSP project entitled: Kansas MSP: Engagement of Student-Teacher-Scientist Partners in Authentic Ecological Research  We have made major progress in accomplishing these goals, and milestones are highlighted below. We will continue to lead these efforts in the state over the long-term:  (1)   Produced ongoing interactions between K-12 teachers/students and university scientists: Scientists and science educators from the University of Kansas (KU), Kansas State University (K-State), and Washburn University have been collaborating with USD 501 to develop the vision for Kansas MSP. They have been working with teachers, students, parents, and administrators to determine effective mechanisms for engaging teachers and students in authentic ecological research in order to enhance K-12 education. University scientists have also provided advice on best practices for maintaining the ecological integrity of the MSP field site. These efforts led to an exciting Teachers Workshop entitled, "Summer on the Prairie", from July 11-14, 2011 and on June 5-7, 2012 that involved Topeka teachers and university scientists. The goals of that workshop, which were achieved, included activities (a) to facilitate "student focused" research that involved observing, identifying, and cataloging the plant and animal life above and below the surface of the prairie; (b) to develop collaborative partnerships among groups of researchers (e.g. students and teachers, university researchers); (c) to study the prairie ecosystem by employing inquiry techniques and authentic research practices, using the collaborative partnership approach; and (d) to learn about and initiate a prairie restoration project that involves learning biological and ecological principles with K-12 students and teachers.   (2)  Established an active Curriculum Team (CT): The Curriculum Team is a cross section of educators from USD 501, KU, KSU, Washburn University, and the business community with an interest in enhancing ecology education in USD 501 and throughout the state. The curriculum team has been linking state and local ecology education standards to the proposed activities of the grant. This team has developed sample hypotheses-driven lessons plans for the Targeted Partnership that can eventually be used by teachers and students during the larger MSP project.   (3)  Generated community support and resources: The PI and Co-PIs met with the Board of Education (USD 501), the Topeka Chamber of Commerce, and private sector leaders to create a common vision for Kansas MSP. There were approximately 20 of these meetings over the last three years. In addition, the USD 501 Superintendent and the Topeka School Board have donated a 60-acre field site for Kansas MSP and will provide an on-site building to serve as the MSP Learning Center. Although this land could have been used for commercial development, all parties involved felt that it would better serve the community in the role of an educational site for local schools, as well as others throughout the state in the long-term.  (4) Gained university support for MSP: The University of Kansas and Kansas State University have reaffirmed K-12 educational partnerships as a top priority. Engaged scholarship in public service is a major initiative for both universities, and such scholarship is recognized within their respective reward systems (e.g., tenure &amp; promotion, awards). Service to Kansas is a major part of the strategic plan for both universities, including engagement with K-12 education. Kansas MSP-Start serves as a lighthouse project for this area. In addition, the Provost of the University of Kansas (Vitter) has just released one of his major initiatives for the next 5-10 years: "Powering the World, Sustaining the Planet....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
