<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to investigate the origin of the slow solar wind and the magnetic flux budget as the Sun reverses its field in the course of the 11-year sunspot cycle. Using a blend of data analysis and modeling, the PI's investigation will focus on the boundary between the slow and fast solar wind. The PI will test predictions of a widely published model of magnetic footpoint circulation on the Sun, where slow solar wind arises from the release of plasma on closed loops. This project will also use measurements taken during the current unusual minimum of solar activity to test the idea that open magnetic flux is conserved throughout the course of the solar cycle. Finally, the PI will determine to what degree the slow solar wind arises from regions on the Sun that are not associated with the coronal streamer belt and its extension into space as the heliospheric current sheet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses problems central to the interdisciplinary fields of solar and heliospheric physics. The results will be significant because they will test various existing hypotheses that have important consequences for our understanding of the evolution of the heliospheric magnetic field and the source of the slow solar wind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed set of tasks will also advance our basic understanding of the space weather domain, in which better space weather predictions will benefit society. The PI will mentor students and promote a web-based program of scientific exchange. These research objectives will be aided by using global model predictions obtained from the Community Coordinated Modeling Center at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The purpose of the research supported by the grant was to test new ideas about the SunÆs magnetic field and the extension of the field into space.  The SunÆs magnetic field is carried into space by its ever-expanding atmosphere.  Unlike EarthÆs stable atmosphere, the SunÆs atmosphere expands because it is very hot.  The expanding atmosphere is known as the solar wind. The solar wind travels at supersonic speeds because the pressure of interstellar space is so low.  The SunÆs magnetic field behaves as if it were frozen to this supersonic flow and, consequently, is drawn out into space.  Together the solar wind and its magnetic field form the heliosphere, which permeates the solar system.   Challenges to our understanding of the configuration and evolution of the solar wind and its intrinsic heliospheric magnetic field arise from at least two complications.  The first is that the solar field continually changes in strength and configuration, waxing and waning with the 11-year sunspot cycle.  The second complication is that the speed of the solar wind varies in both time and space.  Flows are much faster from regions on the Sun known as coronal holes.  To better understand these complications and their impacts on the heliosphere, the reported research proposes and tests some new ideas, specifically those regarding patterns of magnetic flux transport across coronal hole boundaries, the heliospheric magnetic flux budget as a function of solar cycle, and the source of the slow solar wind.  Eight papers were published in refereed journals, each moving the field forward by presenting succinct results about various aspects of these problems.  The most important result, described below, concerns the longstanding problem of the source of the slow solar wind.    Until recently our concept of the pattern of solar wind flow from the Sun was simple.    During most of the solar cycle, it was thought that fast wind came from coronal holes in the polar regions of the Sun and slow wind came from a band centered on the SunÆs magnetic equator, known as the streamer belt.  But the recent solar cycle, with unusually weak magnetic fields, proved otherwise.  While slow wind still came from the streamer belt, additional slow wind came from elsewhere.  The most important result supported by the grant was recognition that the additional slow wind forms intriguing patterns made up of a web of belts connected to the streamer belt.     The figure displays these patterns in blue, in a stack of synoptic maps of solar wind speed, where blue represents the slowest speeds and red represents the fastest speeds.  Each map was generated from an empirical model using data from the solar surface during the course of a solar rotation, or Carrington Rotation (CR), which covers about 27 days.  Maps for every other successive Carrington Rotation are shown using data from November 2002 through August 2003.  The maps are like rectangular maps of the world, where the world, in this case, is a sphere centered on the Sun but much larger than the Sun, with its radius located at the distance where the solar wind reaches supersonic speeds.  The streamer belt traces a blue sinusoidal wave across each map, following the magnetic equator; but attached to it are other blue belts and areas with evolving shapes, together forming a web of slow wind, sometimes looking like links in a chain.      Recognition of this pattern of an evolving web of slow wind sources rather than a single belt is important for several reasons.  Theoretically, the configuration follows directly from an axiom that all coronal holes of the same magnetic polarity must be magnetically connected.  Also, the pattern ties together the streamer belt with previously identified solar features called "pseudostreamer belts," heretofore treated as separate phenomena.  Pseudostreamers turn out to be a source of slow wind, as expected, and as confirmed in additional analysis supported by the grant; but the analysis also show...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
