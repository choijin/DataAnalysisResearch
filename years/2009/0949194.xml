<AbstractNarration>Ticks are obligate blood feeders and transmit serious diseases to humans such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease. Compared to insects, however, little is known about the hormonal regulation of feeding, development, and reproduction in ticks or related chelicerates (e.g. mites, spiders, centipedes). This research project will determine the role of the male reproductive system in initiating blood-feeding and egg production in female ticks. In addition, the role of hormones in the brain of the female tick that regulate female blood-feeding and egg production will be elucidated. The general approach to accomplish these goals involves using  parallel sequencing of tick nucleic acids, employing computer-assisted bioinformatics to identify the function of these sequences, and selectively inhibiting the expression of genes to assess their physiological function in ticks. From these studies, the identification of  new pesticide targets for tick control, vaccine development, and the regulation of the diseases transmitted by ticks is possible. This work also provides research training for undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in entomology and biology at two different universities. In addition, the new information generated in this project will be incorporated into a course in Physiology required for all graduate students obtaining degrees in Entomology at North Carolina State University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Reseach was conducted to identify and understand the function of the hormones found in ticks that regulate their blood feeding, growth, metamorphosis and reproduction.  One focus of the research was the American dog tick which transfers the organism that causes Rocky mountain spotted fever in humans in the United States with comparative studies with the Lyme disease tick.  This research describes how female ticks control egg production (a potential lead for a tick birth control pill), how ticks smell and bite (leads for the development of tick traps and repellents) and the function of the tick brain (providing leads for new pesticides for tick control).  The research has led to the discovery of a natural, tick and insect repellent (BioUD) now on the market with additional applications as a natural herbicide and insecticide, a tick robot for tick control (in development), a free for download phone App to help the public prevent tick bites and tick-borne diseases (TickID), and a two volume textbook, Biology of Ticks.  A new startup company was also formed with the goal of developing a brand of natural products as effective as those based on synthethic chemistry to protect people from insect and tick pests.  A new basic understanding of how ticks work and the first tick genome sequenced will continue to have an impact on a better understanding of ticks and insects in the future.
