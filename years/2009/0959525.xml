<AbstractNarration>0959525&lt;br/&gt;Campagnola&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problems of overlapping spectra, photobleaching, low signal to noise and light scatter pose serious limitations on what can be achieved in practice in imaging tissues by fluorescence. Over the last 10-15 years nonlinear optical microscopy techniques have been developed and adopted widely, largely due to their ability to overcome many of these limitations. Most current nonlinear optical microscopes use excitation wavelengths between 700-1000 nm, as this is the standard tuning range of the widely used Ti:Sapphire femtosecond lasers. While these near infrared (NIR) wavelengths provide significantly deeper penetration (few hundred microns vs. 10 s of microns) into tissue than achievable with confocal laser scanning microscopes using visible excitation sources (e.g. 488, 514 nm), it would be of great biological and biomedical benefit to further improve upon this limit to achieve about 1 mm for imaging the collagen structure associated with tumors and other pathologies. To address this need, this proposal will engage researchers from biomedical engineering, physics, plant biology, cancer biology, and biophotonics to build a nonlinear microscopy platform capable of exciting intrinsic and extrinsic fluorophores from 680nm to 1300 nm. The instrument will be constructed from a Ti:Sapphire oscillator/ optical parametric oscillator (OPO) and a homebuilt laser scanning microscope optimized for longer wavelength excitation. When complete, the instrument will afford detection of 2 and 3-photon excited fluorescence, Second Harmonic Generation and Third Harmonic Generation. We anticipate that using the 1000-1300 nm tuning range provided by the optical parametric oscillator will provide an additional 2-3 fold increase in imaging depth in tissues. The successful construction and implementation of the instrumentation will enable a wide range of dynamic cell studies ranging from plant and cell models to animal models of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. These studies will thoroughly examine the potential of long wavelengths for deeper imaging and improved excitation of fluorophores that naturally excite  further into the NIR. This construction will lay down the experimental framework for future biological studies that may benefit from longer wavelength based nonlinear optical approaches.</AbstractNarration>
