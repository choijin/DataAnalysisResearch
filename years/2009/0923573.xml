<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation has awarded San Jos√© State University (SJSU) funds to develop a proteomics facility. The goal of this project is to transform and expand the molecular life sciences research capabilities at SJSU. This is a collaborative effort between faculty in the Departments of Chemistry and Biology to foster institutional linkages between the two departments in addition to the one-on-one linkages that currently exist. This goal will be accomplished through the establishment of the PROTEIN Lab at SJSU, developing faculty expertise in molecular life science research, and training SJSU students in proteomics research.  This program will enable a variety of scientific advances, including identification of novel proteins in biological signal transduction pathways, characterization of novel proteins from diverse biological sources such as uncultivable bacteria to humans, purification of proteins for biophysical studies of protein crowding and hydration effects, and characterization of small molecules. This program will enhance the research capabilities in the Departments of Biology and Chemistry, stimulate collaboration amongst researchers who use the PROTEIN facility, and prepare graduate and undergraduate students for transition to graduate/professional programs or the biotechnology work force in the Bay Area.  Results from the research projects will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and disseminated through presentations by students and faculty at regional or national meetings.</AbstractNarration>
