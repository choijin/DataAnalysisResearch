<AbstractNarration>Erosion and sedimentation constantly re-shape the Earth's surface. Over geologic time, these processes wear down mountains and move vast quantities of broken rock to the sea. On human time scales, the rates are often so slow as to be barely perceptible. But when disturbance strikes a landscape such as in the form of wildfire, flooding, earthquakes, livestock overgrazing,or climate change, the pace of erosion and sediment transport can be altered dramatically. Geologists and engineers have long sought to develop mathematical models of landscape evolution that can predict how a given landscape will response to disturbance. Such models are crucial to understanding how the geological cycle operates and, on shorter time scales, for predicting how landscapes are likely to react to environmental changes. However, these models need to be tested rigorously against actual field data. This project will measure historical and contemporary erosion and sedimentation at two sites in Colorado to provide case studies with which to test models. The first site, located on the High Plains east of Denver, has shown unusually rapid gully growth during the 20th century.  The history of the channel network will be reconstructed using a combination of historic aerial photographs, measurements of the volume of sediment trapped behind earthen dams built in the early 1960s, dating of sediments within the valleys, and measuring the concentration in soils of exotic radionuclides that were released by Cold-War era nuclear weapons testing. In addition, the new technology of high-precision ground-based laser scanning will provide images at unprecedented resolution of the year-by-year growth of channel heads. The second site lies in a drainage basin in the Colorado Rockies where intense wildfire followed by heavy rainfall in 1996 triggered dramatic erosion and sedimentation. Repeated field measurements following the fire provide a detailed record of dramatic changes in the watershed area. These original measurements will be supplemented with airborne and ground-based laser-derived maps of the terrain. Data from both sites will be used to test one of the leading computer models of landscape response. The databases will provide a resource for the scientific community now and into the future as models continue to become more sophisticated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Erosion and sedimentation are natural processes that have helped shape our planet throughout its existence, and they have direct and wide-ranging impacts on society. The constant flow of sediment from mountains to the sea fills in hydropower reservoirs, decreasing their generating capacity and operational lifespan. Sedimentation within river channels can increase flood risk to surrounding communities, while incision along streams and gully networks can damage roadways and other infrastructure and reduce the quality of agricultural land. Changes in the amount or size of sediment carried by streams will alter the health of river ecosystems. Erosion can even exhume buried hazardous wastes, releasing them to stream networks where they can contaminate water supplies. All of these processes are often affected by human development. For this reason, computational models of landscape response to both natural and human disturbance are needed to support careful planning that mitigates the potential effects of future changes in land use and climate. This project supports the continued development and refinement of these models and will result in field-based tests that will contribute to sustainable living in an ever-changing landscape.</AbstractNarration>

The eroded sediment can reduce water quality and fill reservoirs, while the erosion process itself degrades land and sometimes undermines infrastructure. Managing the risks and costs associated with soil erosion requires a good scientific understanding of the processes involved. This project contributed to such an understanding by studying rapid erosion in two types of situation that are common throughout the western United States: gully erosion in grasslands, and hill-slope erosion on steep mountain hillsides that have recently been burned by wildfire. In the past, soil erosion has been quite difficult to measure; often, researchers can estimate the volume of sediment that has been removed but not pinpoint where it came from or what processes were responsible for mobilizing it.

One of the key innovations in the project was the use of three-dimensional laser-scanning technology to measure erosion at a high level of detail over a period of a few years. Using this technique at a site in the Rocky Mountains that burned in 2010 revealed that the most obvious erosion features --- steep channels that incised after the fire --- only accounted for about 1/3 of the total eroded material.

In the case of gullies, project data led to the discovery that the bulk of erosion occurs in steep steps ("headcuts") along the channel, and that these erode primarily due to collapse of soil exposed at the step faces, due to the added weight of water during summer and autumn rain storms. Based on these measurements, a computer model of gully erosion was developed. Comparison of the model with observations revealed that the erosional forms at the study site, which are ubiquitous in the western High Plains, form when grassland vegetation covers most of the channel network, but is unable to get established near and just downstream of gully headcuts. Among the various factors that influence gully erosion, vegetation cover turns out to be the most critical. The project data also provided preliminary evidence for two types of self-enhancing feedback in gully erosion. First, the steep, relatively bare slopes produced by initial gully growth may lead to more runoff generation during heavy rains, which further enhances erosion. Second, the initial loss of vegetation due to landscape disturbance or localized scour during a particularly intense storm exposes bare soil to erosion, enhancing the potential for gully growth and inhibiting plant recovery.
