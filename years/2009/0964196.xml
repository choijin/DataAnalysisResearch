<AbstractNarration>Rule systems are increasingly used in areas ranging from Program Analysis,&lt;br/&gt;Semantic Web, Security Frameworks, Sensor Networks, Cognitive Radio, and&lt;br/&gt;Disruption-tolerant Networking, each with its own demands for efficiency&lt;br/&gt;and scalability.  Advances in these areas will lead to a new generation of&lt;br/&gt;robust and secure applications that control devices on which human safety&lt;br/&gt;and even lives depend, supply with critical information, and help people&lt;br/&gt;make informed decisions by pulling together distributed Web-centric&lt;br/&gt;resources, analyzing them, and automating complex information-bound tasks.&lt;br/&gt;However, existing implementations of rule systems are not sufficiently&lt;br/&gt;scalable and have been shown to vary widely in performance.  To make the&lt;br/&gt;above vision of next generation robust applications a reality, one must&lt;br/&gt;understand the performance characteristics of rule systems and develop&lt;br/&gt;scalable optimization and analysis techniques for them.  Although advances&lt;br/&gt;have been made in improving performance of rule systems, the problem&lt;br/&gt;remained extremely challenging and poorly understood both theoretically and&lt;br/&gt;implementation-wise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a comprehensive framework for rigorous&lt;br/&gt;understanding and optimization of rule systems.  The approach is based on&lt;br/&gt;precise cost calculations and global program transformations, and it&lt;br/&gt;combines and extends techniques from database query optimization, compiler&lt;br/&gt;optimization, and recursive query processing.  It includes: (1) techniques&lt;br/&gt;for generating logically equivalent but more efficient programs; (2) cost&lt;br/&gt;models and analysis for generating parameterized cost formulas for the&lt;br/&gt;running time and space usage of rule programs; (3) techniques for&lt;br/&gt;estimating parameters of the cost formulas; (4) heuristics for searching&lt;br/&gt;the exponentially large space of logically equivalent rule programs to find&lt;br/&gt;the ones with the best predicted time, space, and tradeoffs; and (5)&lt;br/&gt;implementation of the strategy as an optimizer for the widely used,&lt;br/&gt;open-source XSB Logic Programming System.  The method and implementation&lt;br/&gt;will be evaluated using applications in Program Analysis and Semantic Web.</AbstractNarration>
