<AbstractNarration>Fish have a remarkable ability to detect the strike of a predator by sensing water flow with receptors within the skin. The major aim of this research project is to understand the mechanics of this sensory system, known as the lateral line, in zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio). This will be achieved by using a novel combination of mathematical modeling, behavioral experiments, and flow visualization techniques developed for aeronautical engineering. These approaches will consider how the shape of the body and the direction of a stimulus influence the ability of a fish to evade a predator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance understanding in two major areas. First, this work will establish the mechanics of a sensory system that is critical to the ecology of a broad diversity of aquatic animals. Second, this work will define relationships between mechanosensory inputs and behavioral outputs in a major model system for neuroscience. This will inform our understanding of how vertebrate behavior is affected by the integration of mechanosensory information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will also involve outreach and education. The investigators propose a novel K-12 educational program in collaboration with local schools and the U.C. Irvine Department of Education. The PI and his students will also participate in a number of outreach programs at U.C. Irvine that are designed to enhance involvement of minority researchers and education to underserved local schools.</AbstractNarration>

This work established that the lateral line system plays an essential role in the survival of prey fish and revealed how water flow serves as a stimulus. The research has focused on zebrafish, which has emerged as a major model system in vertebrae neuroscience. Our work offers a behavioral context for some of the major developments in understanding the neurophysiological basis of sensing and locomotion. In addition, the role of flow sensing in mediating predator-prey interactions is previously unappreciated and is now recognized as a possible mediator in the survival of a broad diversity of species.  Broader Impacts. The numerous lines of investigation included in this study developed a toolkit for the study of hydrodynamics as a sensory stimulus. This included used of robotics, flow visualization, computational fluid dynamics, morphological visualization and automated behavioral analysis. These techniques have been shared with a community of investigators. Graduate training has been integral throughout.
