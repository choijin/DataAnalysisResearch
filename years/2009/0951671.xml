<AbstractNarration>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been a long standing model system in the biological sciences for studies of photosynthesis, flagellar development and other aspects of cell biology. Recently, as a fast-growing, photosynthetic eukaryote, Chlamydomonas has attracted a great deal of interest as a source of biomass and renewable energy. University of Minnesota-Twin Cities houses the Chlamydomonas Resource Center (CRC) and its utility is enhanced by the availability of the sequence of the nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. CRC has a large collection of mutants and a complete genetic map linked to the molecular map. The PI serves as the new Director of CRC and, in its 30th year of operation, this stock collection center will continue to act as the central repository to receive, catalogue, preserve and distribute wild type and mutant cultures of C. reinhardtii. The Center will continue to maintain and distribute molecular tools for Chlamydomonas research, including genomic and cDNA clones of Chlamydomonas nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genes, and cDNA libraries. The Center will continue to distribute teaching kits, with reagents, strains and instructions for high school and beginning college biology class experiments. A web site [http://www.chlamy.org] will provide descriptions of all cultures in the collection, historical information and reference material on genetic loci and mutant alleles, genetic and molecular maps, and an extensive bibliography.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Chlamydomonas Resource Center provides strains, reagents, teaching resources and molecular clones to the Chlamydomonas community of researchers.   Chlamydomonas is a simple eukaryotic gene alga that is ideal for teaching laboratories because it grows quickly in minimal defined media.  More than 100 years of published research using this organism has led to the development of a robust set of molecular and genetic techniques that have been applied to diverse areas of research such as flagellar motility, photosynthesis, the cell cycle, cell-cell interaction and many others.  More than 500 research papers in the past five years have acknowledged the Chlamydomonas Resource Center for providing strains and/or molecular clones to facilitate individual research projects.  Chlamydomonas has also proven to be an important research organism for practical commercial applications.  Chlamydomonas produces hydrogen in anerobic conditions and produces high levels of lipids that may be convertible to biofuels.  Proteins for vaccine production have been produced cheaply in Chlamydomonas cells, and researchers are investigating the potential of this ubiquitous and harmless algae for bioremediation, and as feedstock for aquaculture.  To facilitate both applied and basic research in this model system the Chlamydomonas Resource Center maintains and distributes mutant and wild-type strains for use by students, teachers, researchers and commercial firms.  It is the only comprehensive collection of such strains in the world.  The Center also provides information, reagents for growth, and molecular clones and DNA libraries to potentiate Chlamydomonas research.   To encourage the use of Chlamydomonas in education we provide complete kits (strains, reagents, and instructions) to individual students and high school and college teaching laboratories for learning about diverse topics such as hydrogen generation, cell motility, and cell-cell interaction during mating.  By providing a central repository for mutant strains generated by researchers from around the world, the Chlamydomonas Resource Center enhances the value of genetic research in this model system, much of it funded by NSF and other government agencies.  Even after researchers close their laboratories, the valuable genetic mutants they produced during their active research careers live on, and can facilitate the research of others who work on related projects at a later time.  There are many examples of projects that were made possible by the availability of mutants generated decades before.  Perhaps the most important of these is the characterization of eukaryotic cilia, and the discovery of the previously unimagined role of these cell organelles in mammalian development.  In some cases mutants isolated in the 1970s have been critical to understanding developmental processes in the 21st century.
