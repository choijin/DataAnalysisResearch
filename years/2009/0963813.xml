<AbstractNarration>The PIs, Ralph Cohen and Dev Sinha, will be program organizers for a one-week summer school program in algebraic topology, to be hosted at the University of Oregon in the summer of 2010. This summer school will focus on the interface between algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, in particular on moduli spaces. We will bring thirty graduate students and early-career mathematicians together for an introduction to an area which is ripe for investigation, and whose techniques will inform and inspire developments throughout topology. Among other topics, students will learn about mapping class groups, stability theorems, operad actions and other loopspace machinery, cobordism spectra, singularity theory, cobordism categories, and topological  field theories. Calculations will be emphasized whenever they are relevant. This summer school will use a unique blend of pedagogical tools, combining elements which have been successful in other settings. Younger researchers will be involved with both organizing and giving talks. Attendees will be encouraged to work problems, fill in background, and do reading together in addition to attending lectures. A full effort will be made to recruit a broad and diverse group of participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The west coast topology summer school will significantly strengthen the knowledge base of topologists and others who use topology. In its role as a basic study of shape, topology has significant ramifications in other areas of mathematics, from basic counting problems (combinatorics) to solutions of equations (algebra) to applications and extensions of the calculus (analysis). More broadly, knowledge of topology is essential for example in studying the structure of the early universe, in designing a robot arm with a minimal number of controllers, and in searching large data sets for meaningful groupings as successfully done recently for study of breast cancer. The summer school will be structured to highlight ramifications in geometry and algebra, and thus strengthen the ties between basic areas of theoretical mathematics. Mathematicians from underrepresented backgrounds will be vigorously recruited. Graduate students and post-docs will gain hands-on experience with some of the most important developments of contemporary mathematics, preparing them to be future leaders of the field.  Participants will enlarge their professional networks, which is especially critical given the geographical distances faced by mathematicians in the western half of North America. Organizers and participants will also have the opportunity to reflect upon the array of pedagogical tools employed, and might employ some themselves in training graduate students and undergraduates or reaching out to fellow scientists and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Because mathematics builds upon itself in a manner unique among all disciplines, it takes years of training for graduate students to engage the research frontier.  Graduate students have an apprentice relationship with their PhD advisor, working very closely with that person.  Because of the needed focus, it can be a challenge for students to connect with other faculty and graduate students.   The West Coast Algebraic Topology Summer School provided unique training environments in which graduate students and post-docs could come to the forefront of research in an area generally outside their narrow focus while developing a vibrant learning community and network of peers.  The 2010 format emphasized engagement beyond listening to lectures.  The participants gave most of the lectures, which were outlined by the scientific organizers, a team of six leaders in the area from the United States and Europe.  The speaker-participants were thus primed to assimilate the full program, and shared their insight with other participants.     Sixty-five participants, mostly graduate students and post-docs including eight women and two participants from underrepresented groups, came from over twenty states and eight countries to the University of Oregon.  The focus topic was the study of surfaces, which are objects such as a sphere (which models the surface of the Earth) or the torus (which models the surface of a doughnut) or M\"obius strip (a band with a twist, used sometimes for conveyer belts because it ``has only one side'').  This is an area of interest to both topologists who study shape, and algebraic geometers who study solutions of equations. The area was chosen because of recent breakthroughs of wide interest.  The participants attended roughly three lectures each day, and put in many hours beyond that  each day.  A large number spent  time in the main lecture room asking questions of a few of the organizers, while there was usually another room with an organizer answering questions from a smaller group.  These questions mostly reviewed concepts from the talks, filling in details a speaker did not have time for, clarifying a difficult point, or filling in some background whicha participant lacked.  There was also some discussion of the exercises provided.  The evening sessions lasted well into the night (at least 10pm, and once until midnight), and there was always further informal discussion afterwards.  In addition to question sessions, some participants reviewed their notes of the talks, on their own or in small groups.  Others prepared themselves so that they could get the most from upcoming talks, or took the time to discuss some of their own interests in informal seminars.   In the end, the week-long program was transformative for a remarkable number of participants.  The  availability of the organizers for questions, probably the most important component of the summer school, led to a depth of discussion which for many participants was unique to their experience outside of working with their advisor.  Such deep experience outside of initial (thesis) expertise is essential for young mathematicians developing an independent research program, which is a primary outcome.

It would drastically impact the younger generations of mathematicians in a very positive way.''   A full report of the participant survey  is available athttp://noether.uoregon.edu/~dps/wcatss/survey/results.pdf    There are already at least three different collaborative  projects which have grown out of the program, which is highly unusual given thatgraduate students and post-docs predominantly work on individual projects or joint work with an advisor or mentor.
