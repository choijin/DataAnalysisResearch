<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;Exotoxins of bacteria are among the most deadly substances known. These exotoxins kill eukaryotic cells by inactivating factors and/or pathways that are universally conserved among eukaryotic organisms. When studied in the context of mammals, these toxins cause diseases ranging from cholera to diphtheria to enterohemorrhagic diarrhea. The genes encoding these toxins are usually encoded by viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages). Environmental DNA sequencing (metagenomic analyses) indicates that ~15% of all bacteriophage (both free and incorporated into bacteria) encode an exotoxin gene. With approximately 106 bacteriophages /mL of seawater and 108 bacteriophages/gram of sediment, the frequency of occurrence of the genes encoding any particular exotoxin gene in bacteriophage far exceeds the number of potential animal hosts. Moreover, these bacteriophage-encoded exotoxin genes are found at high frequency in phages isolated from environments where the corresponding human diseases are not prevalent. These observations suggest the hypothesis that humans and other susceptible mammals are neither the original nor primary targets of these toxins. Hence any anthropogenic effects on the evolution of these toxins may not be as significant as those that occurred before the dawn of man and other multicellular organisms. &lt;br/&gt;If not mammals, then "who" are the true targets of the ubiquitous exotoxins. A major source of bacterial mortality is consumption by single-celled eukaryotic predators, such as ciliates and other protozoa. Bacteria have evolved many different methods to fend off these predators, including becoming oversized and fleeing at high speeds. Coordinated release of phage-encoded exotoxins, either at the pre- or post-ingestional states via lytic induction of lysogenic bacteriophage comprises another possible antipredator defense strategy. Protozoa are phagocytotic cells and they share many features with mammalian phagocytes, especially macrophages. The phage-encoded exotoxins like the well-studied Shiga toxin (Stx), kill eukaryotic cells by attacking features and pathways that are common to all eukaryotes both, uni- and multi-cellular. Since predation by eukaryotic predators (e.g., ciliates and other protozoa), is a major source of bacterial mortality, these observations suggest that exotoxins may have arisen as part of an antipredator, (antiprotozoan) defense strategy. Thus the evolution of these toxins may have occurred before the appearance of multicellular organisms. Hence humans may be innocent bystanders in the evolutionary battle between protozoans and their bacterial prey.&lt;br/&gt;Using a naturally occurring predator-prey interaction, the studies in this project explore aspects of how bacteriophage-encoded exotoxins like Shiga toxin are used as part of the bacterial anti-predator arsenal. These studies will provide the molecular details of the bacterial response to predation by determining 1) how T. thermophila signals bacteria that are lysogenic for toxin-encoding phages to produce Shiga toxin and 2) how this exotoxin enters and causes cytotoxicity in these ciliates. Some of these mechanisms are apparently unique to the ciliates and others may be conserved in higher eukaryotes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will provide a hypothesis-driven research experience to both graduate and undergraduate students at the University at Buffalo institution and through collaborations, undergraduate students at Mercyhurst College, a small, liberal arts college located in Erie, PA. In the Koudelka lab, students have learned how to ask important biological questions and used their observations to make important contributions to scientific understanding. Dr. Koudelka has supervised &gt;22 undergraduates and high school students in the last 15 years, &gt;50% of which were members of underrepresented minority groups or women. All of the PI's trainees have gone on to successful careers in research or medicine. The results of these studies will help &lt;br/&gt;define how predation and bacterial responses to it, influence the evolution and structure of microbial communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Impact  Background:  Many of the bacteria that cause disease in humans do so by producing deadly toxins. The genes encoding these toxins are found in bacterial viruses (aka bacteriophages) that reside in the DNA of host bacteria. Interestingly, bacteriophages isolated from environments with no humans often contain these toxin genes, suggesting that these toxins did not evolve in nature to cause disease in humans.  Outcomes:  We tested the idea that the bacteriophage encoded toxins evolved to deter or kill their natural bacterial predators, e.g., single-celled protozoans. Our results showing that the phage-encoded toxins reduce bacterial predation by A.&thinsp;castellanii and Tetrahymena thermophila confirm that phage-encoded exotoxins can act as anti-predator defenses. The observation that representatives of the ciliates and amoeba, protists that are only distantly related, are targets of such anti-predator defence mechanisms suggests that this strategy evolved early in the evolutionary battle between protozoans and their bacterial prey.  We found that bacteria are able to sense specific chemical signals that alert them to the presence of these protozoan predators, and release toxin in response to them, thus suggesting that the bacterial toxin systems have been fine tuned over evolution to work against predation by microscopic protozoans. Since these molecular targets of the phage-encoded exotoxins are conserved among virtually all eukaryotes, this ever-evolving arms race between predator and prey has apparently selected for toxin molecules and toxin-delivery strategies that can affect humans. We suggest that the human suffering caused by the deployment of these anti-predator defense strategies by bacteria represents collateral damage caused by this microbiological arms race.  We showed that T. thermophila contains toxin receptors and hence can be killed by the purified toxins, apparently, Acanthamoeba castellanii, lacks receptors for exotoxins and only toxins by internalized bacteria kill Acanthamoebae. Thus, bacteria function as a "Trojan horse" to carry genes encoding exotoxin into target organisms. The "Trojan Horse" mechanism of exotoxin delivery allows intoxication of predators that lack a cell surface receptor for the toxin.  Intoxication of Acanthamoeba and Tetrahymena by internalized bacteria absolutely requires phage-mediated lysis of the Shiga toxin-encoding bacterial cell. This finding provides a rationale as to why the genes encoding these toxins are almost exclusively found on bacteriophages; phage-mediated bacterial lysis and/or other phage functions are required for toxin to be released from the bacteria prior to the digestion of the cell or it will not be able to exert its cytotoxic effect. Phage-encoded functions may also be required to mediate translocation of the toxin across the phagosome membrane into the cytoplasm.  Toxin expression by bacteria impacts bacterial survival in artificial and natural microcosms containing predators. toxin encoding E. coli persist longer in these microcosms because toxin helps them resist predation. In mixed microcosms containing tox+ and tox- bacteria, tox- bacteria susceptible to infection by phages bearing toxin genes survive predation better than do bacteria that are immune to infection by these phages. This result implies that the susceptible bacteria are used as æsurrogatesÆ to enhance toxin production and subsequent predator killing.  We discovered that toxin-producing E. coli survived longer in Lake Erie water samples than those that didnÆt produce the toxin. One strain persisted for 48 hours before declining. Our evidence suggests the dangerous strains performed better because toxin helps them fend off aquatic predators like protists &mdash; small, single-celled creatures that feed on bacteria.  Benefits:  Understanding how bacteria and their bacteriophages evolved in nature before they came into contact with humans not only helps understand certain dis...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
