<AbstractNarration>Dr. Krumholz will study of one of the most important and least understood processes in the cosmos, the formation of stars. As noted in the project summary of this proposal "stars are the engines of the Universe", the energy produced by the nuclear reactions in the interior of stars is the only significant non-gravitational source of energy in the cosmos. This energy helps govern the evolution of galaxies, the creation of the heavy elements in the universe and the formation of planets. This project will attempt to broaden our understanding of star formation by addressing the following three questions: &lt;br/&gt;-- What determines the stellar mass function, and does it vary with environment?&lt;br/&gt;-- What determines how stars cluster, and how is the efficiency of star formation effected in these environments?&lt;br/&gt;-- What sets the star formation rate, and does it vary with environment and/or over cosmic time?&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the research is a fully predictive theory of star formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of the proposal are centered on the work that the PI will perform by teaching prisoners math and science courses. The PI will offer these classes to inmates at a local detention facility. While the classes offered are not directly connected to the research in this proposal, these classes will produce a connection between the scientific community and this severely under served and mostly minority community. The inmates have the chance to earn college credit for successfully completing one of the classes.</AbstractNarration>
