<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerical  methods are  the  future of  computation in  algebraic geometry. The reason for  this is  that increases  in computing power  will  be  due  to  massive  parallelization  and  symbolic algorithms  do not  appear to  be parallelizable  while numerical algorithms are  easily parallelized. This project aims  to help build the  infrastructure for this numerical future.   It will do this through two main  research programs and through the training of students and a postdoctoral fellow.  One project is to develop and  implement a radically  new numerical  continuation algorithm that computes only  the real solutions to a  system of polynomial equations,   in   contrast   to  homotopy   continuation,   which necessarily computes  all solutions, both real  and complex.  The other  is to  use  numerical methods  to  study subtle  geometric invariants  of important  geometric problems,  namely  the Galois groups of  Schubert problems.  The first will  extend the toolbox of numerical  algebraic geometry, while the  second will showcase its potential for pure  mathematical research.  A primary goal of this project is the training of one or more students in this area and the  training and professional development  of a postdoctoral researcher.   Both   projects  are  multi-year   tasks  requiring software  development that will  involve team-based  research and collaborators at Colorado State  and Georgia Tech and will result in publications, software packages, and Ph.D. theses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry is  concerned with theoretical questions about solutions to  systems of polynomial  equations, but it  has great potential  in  applications,  in particular  through  implemented algorithmic tools.   Numerical algebraic geometry is  a new field that uses  numerical methods in  algebraic geometry and  has been driven by applications of mathematics.  This project will further its progress by developing  new numerical tools for studying real solutions,  applying it  to pure  mathematical research,  and the training of students and postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>
