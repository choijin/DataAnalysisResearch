<AbstractNarration>The project explores cloaking of sound and vibration.  A cloak surrounds an object so that it causes waves of sound or vibration to bypass the object.   Cloaking appeared on the scene in 2006 with the first demonstration of a device that can cloak electromagnetic microwaves. Acoustic cloaking is in its infancy, and it is not even clear whether cloaking of elastic waves is possible.  This project will address these questions through theory and simulation.  The first goal is a thorough understanding of acoustic cloaks, focusing on so-called pentamode metamaterials.   These are easily sheared, like rubber or water, but have the unusual property that they support a biaxial state of stress, as compared with hydrostatic.  The main objective, elastodynamic cloaking, will first consider a metamaterial layer capable of emulating the wave properties of a thicker layer of normal solid.  Mathematical relations involving coordinate and gauge transformations will be used, and more complicated cylindrical and spherical structures will be studied.  The final goal is a realistic model of Rayleigh wave cloaking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Longer term societal benefits will be enhanced technology for reducing vibration and noise, and methods to channel destructive mechanical wave energy around sensitive areas and objects, such as shielding buildings from earthquake ground motion.  The project will include a seminar for honors engineering freshmen on the subject of metamaterials, cloaking, and futuristic technology.   Undergraduates will be explicitly involved in the research, building on a current project for seniors.  A web-page explaining cloaking in layperson terms will be enhanced.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the project was to understand how "cloaking" could possibly work in solids.  The concept of cloaking is to make an object disappear as far as the incident wave is concerned so that there is no evidence of the object.  Technically this implies that the wave does not scatter from the object but passes right through.  In practice it means the wave must go around the object, which can be achieved by surrounding it by a layer of some "metamaterial" that can steer the wave, or by placing controlled "active" sources of waves.   A general method for achieving the former  approach had been known for the last decade - but could only be applied to electromagnetic or acoustic waves.   The idea is based on "transformation", illustrated in Figure 1.  The project considered the active approach for the first time.  Major findings are summarised here.    Initial results from the project concerned transformation acoustics.  In [1] we showed that  cloaking-like behavior of acoustic waves can be achieved by surrounding a cylindrical or spherical region with multiple layers of as few as three distinct acoustic fluids, arranged in a complicated layering pattern.     The first findings related to elastic transformation showed that there is a range of material properties possible for the transformed region [2].  This is quite striking and different from what happens in electromagnetics: rather than a unique material there is a broad spectrum of metamaterials that can achieve the same effect for a given transformation, as in Figure 1.  At one end of the spectrum is a class of complex materials with nonlocal constitutive behavior, anisotropic inertia, and frequency dependence. At the other end, so to speak, is the case of isotropic density, and constant elastic stiffnesses (independent of frequency). This is far more realistic, and desirable. The only drawback is that the required elastic moduli are such that  they generate a stress that is non-symmetric (the elastic moduli Cijkl satisfy the major symmetry Cijkl = Cklij but not the minor one: Cijkl = Cjikl).  Subsequently we showed [3,4] that the properties that are required for transformation elasticity, discussed above, can actually be realized by the small-on-large behavior of finite elasticity. Imagine a material subject to large (finite) strain. The theory of incremental elasticity (aka small-on-large) can predict the governing equations for small motion superimposed on this large deformation. The key is the elastic strain energy function of the material.  We showed that there is a unique type of elastic strain energy that displays this amazing property by which the finaite deformation of the solid by itself automatically redirects the elastic wave energy around the region deformed.   The concept is illustrated in Figure 2.    Further into the project we realized that "active" cloaking provides a potential solution for elastic waves.   We first showed [5] that in acoustics it is possible to get exact expressions for the amplitudes of the acoustic sources necessary to cloak a region, see Figures 3 and 4.   These results were then shown to also apply to elastic waves [6]; even though the sources generate both types of elastic waves, they can still provide cancellation over a finte region.   Regaring broader impact and outreach, of particular mention: a freshman seminar series on 'Engineering the Impossible' given in spring 2011 focused on acoustic cloaking, invisibility and related 'impossible' technologies. The students wee mainly engineering  majors, but included some humanities students. The level was 'very few equations' with emphasis on learning about technologies that had previously been thought impossible (telephony, wireless communication) and their connections with New Jersey (Bell Labs, ATT, etc.). The seminar included a class visit to the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab after we had learned about controlled nuclear fusion, another 'impossible technology', or maybe not.
