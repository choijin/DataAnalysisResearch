<AbstractNarration>This research explores challenges in developing privacy-preserving information networks and services (PPNs). Next generation healthcare information systems and applications, such as personalized and predictive medicine, need PPNs for privacy-preserving information sharing and dissemination among independent healthcare providers, enabling information access over distributed access controlled content, while safeguarding personal health information and medical privacy of individuals from unauthorized disclosures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of this research include the development of: (1)  privacy-preserving search capabilities over distributed access controlled content, a critical functionality for PPNs; (2) a suite of utility-aware data anonymization services, preserving the privacy of personal medical information against unauthorized disclosure, at the same time maximizing the data utility for medical service providers; and (3) the PPN architecture and middleware optimized for high availability, scalability and failure recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact is two-fold. First, this research will create better and broader understanding of the challenges and functional requirements for building the next generation of privacy preserving networked information systems over distributed access controlled content. A domain-specific proof-of-concept prototype on top of the PPN core will be developed for discovering and analyzing risk factors for resistant bacterial infections. These real-world studies will be conducted in collaboration with Morehouse School of Medicine and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and be use as both a driver and a testbed for this research. Second, this research will demonstrate that the PPN is an enabling infrastructure for real-time, continuous and on demand data analysis over massively-distributed and privately-shared data repositories.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
