<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to develop a Geospace Science Center which will provide control, operation, and science integration of the Millstone Hill Upper Atmosphere Facilities (UAF) program, which include the existing onsite radar as well as providing facility space for development of distributed arrays of small instruments, and small satellite missions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This center will provide a modernized control and receiver area for the Millstone UHF radar, a set of display consoles and computers suitable for the simultaneous operation of multiple instruments, a radio frequency interference (RFI) screened receiver room, an electronics laboratory, and a computing facility capable of supporting a significant grid computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upgrades to the Millstone NSF funded Upper Atmosphere Research Facility are designed to provide improved support for science observations and research, by modernizing and enhancing existing equipment and services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Millstone Observatory provides vital measurements of the Earth?s upper atmosphere, and the Geospace Center site upgrades will significantly improve onsite support equipment and data servers, as well as allow space for teaching and large workshops, which is not possible with the current accommodation. Enhancements to the Millstone teaching facilities will offer tremendous benefits for training and outreach to young scientists in the fields of Upper Atmosphere Science and Space Weather.</AbstractNarration>
