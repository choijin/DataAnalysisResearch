<AbstractNarration>The project builds on the resources and results of a prior REESE project, Strengthening Tomorrow's Education in Measurement (STEM), that has produced a fine-grained analysis of the character and limitations of the spatial measurement content (length, area, and volume) in three elementary mathematics curricula. It will expand, deepen, and report STEM results for length, area, and volume but  will also centrally address the task of putting that knowledge to work by improving educational practice. The project will complete the primary grades analysis of length, area, and volume and explore with the authors of the three elementary curricula ways to strengthen their existing materials. It will analyze the highly-regarded Singapore mathematics curriculum and compare and contrast findings with the U.S. results. It will also address issues relevant to the topic of measurement in the elementary science curriculum. It will develop and test effective ways of enriching preservice elementary teachers' knowledge of core measurement principles and work with practicing teachers to improve their measurement lessons using both innovative activities and existing curricular content. Finally, it will implement a three-year measurement mini-Center that will bring together major U.S. research and development scholars and projects for sustained interaction, innovation, and collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-year project is concerned with finding ways to strengthen instruction and learning of measurement in the elementary school mathematics curriculum. State and international assessments show U.S. children to be consistently underperforming in this content area. Difficulties are traced to significant weaknesses in conceptual and procedural understanding, including word problem solving. The project will compare the measurement approach used in the Singapore elementary curriculum with current U.S. elementary textbooks. Also, researchers and practitioners who work in the area of measurement in both science and mathematics contexts will participate in a yearly mini-Center with the goal of sharing findings and best practices relevant to the teaching and learning of measurement. Another interesting aspect of the study is the incorporation of findings in measurement courses for preservice elementary teachers, including relevant measurement experiences for practicing teachers. In the long term, the project is expected to provide a curriculum model that can potentially be replicated across the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcome Report Strengthening Measurement Curriculum, Teaching, and Research NSF-DRL-0909745 John P. Smith III, Principal Investigator Michigan State University   This project was funded for three years from August 2009 through July 2012 to analyze the treatment of spatial measurement (length, area, and volume) in current elementary mathematics curricula and to use that analysis to explore and develop ways to enhance the quality of the teaching and learning of measurement. Measurement is well-documented area of weakness for U.S. students, yet measurement is a key competence in all STEM fields and careers. Poor learning of measurement carries a substantial national cost. The project extended its work through July 2015 via no-cost extension (using unspent money from prior years).   Key results from the curriculum analysis:  &bull; Current elementary mathematics textbooks have systematic deficits in how they present and develop length, area, and volume measurement &mdash;relative to the student challenges and misconceptions that have been documented in mathematics education research.  &bull; Because textbooks are the central resource for teachersÆ lessons and because web-based materials are not generally of high-quality, it is unlikely that most elementary teachers will address these deficits in the lessons they teach to their students.  &bull;  Measurement generally, and spatial measurement particularly, involves a common process of identifying and applying units of measure appropriate to the quantity to be measured (e.g., length units to measure length).  &bull; But current curricula ignore this common process, treat the measurement of each new quantity as a new and separate topic, and fail to build on what students have learned from their prior measurement work (e.g., using knowledge of length units to develop units for area measurement).  &bull; This failure contributes to the unproductive view that mathematics is a list of unconnected facts and skills rather than a coherent body of knowledge held together by many connections. Too many U.S. teachers, as well as students, hold this view.  &bull; Curricula focus too much on how to measure and too little on why measurement procedures work.   Key results from professional development (PD) with practicing teachers:  &bull; Participating teachers recognized that they taught measurement too infrequently and often in a rote fashion.  &bull; The project focus on the conceptual principles of measurement was well-received.  &bull; As with other successful teacher professional development, our work began with teachers solving non-routine measurement tasks and understanding their work.  &bull; A key step in improving instruction was the willingness to ask studentsÆ to explain their measurement thinking, rather than simply producing answers.   Key results from Lesson Study with pre-service teachers:  &bull; With good instructional guidance, beginning teachers can develop and teach measurement lessons that are significantly more promising than standard textbook lessons. The project worked with instructors rather than provide the instruction directly.  &bull; Key elements in those lessons were clearly stated goals, open and intellectually-challenging measurement tasks, and direction for teacher observers in studying studentsÆ approaches and ideas during the lessons.  &bull; Like many practicing teachers, pre-service teachers are generally ill-prepared to recognize and address student thinking that is different from what they expected.  &bull; Learning in Lesson Study increased when pre-service teachers had the chance to revise and also reteach their lessons.   Key results from the annual research conferences:  &bull; This mode of professional interaction in support of research and development was a cost-effective to support collaboration. It was modeled on the highly successful and productive Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum, funded by NSF.  &bull; These conferences incr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
