<AbstractNarration>This Phase I SBIR project is for the development of an "atom chip" technology that advances state-of-the art miniature ultracold atom systems. Ultracold matter is an emerging arena of science and technology involving macroscopic quantum states of matter achieved using laser cooling and other purely electromagnetic cooling techniques. The proposed new technology will provide unprecedented capability for controlling and manipulating ultracold atoms that will enable development of ultracold atom applications such as navigation, frequency standards and clocks, and quantum simulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science of ultracold matter is among the most active and rapidly growing sub-disciplines of physics. Ultracold matter is recognized has considerable applications potential in sensing applications but also in applications of quantum science such as quantum simulation, computing, and communication. The proposed ultracold matter products lower the barrier to research and development and provide a pathway for non-experts to develop real world applications. This project will enable further research and development efforts within industry as well as academic and government research institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Project Outcomes Report for the General Public     Project Title: Atom Chips for Cold and Ultracold Matter Applications  Awardee: ColdQuanta, Inc.  Award Number: 0945042                 Conventional approaches to producing ultracold matter (temperatures typically less than 1 microkelvin) require considerable expertise in a variety of fields, including atomic physics, lasers, vacuum systems, and electronics.  By simplifying the production of ultracold matter, ColdQuanta hopes to lower the entry barrier to an arena that has demonstrated tremendous potential.  Some applications that stand to benefit from this technology include navigation, timekeeping, magnetometry, gravimetry, and quantum computation.              ColdQuantaÆs approach towards simplifying ultracold matter technology is based on atom chips.  These silicon substrates use current flowing through lithographically patterned conductors to trap and manipulate atoms.  An atom chip is the core element of ColdQuantaÆs RuBECi product, the worldÆs first commercial ultracold matter vacuum cell.  The primary goal of this SBIR was to investigate a new technology for fabricating atom chips.  For use with ColdQuantaÆs RuBECi cell, chips must meet three main criteria: (1) they must be compatible with ultrahigh vacuum levels; (2) for cell processing, they must be able to withstand high temperatures and (3) in order to pass electrical currents to the lithographic traces, atom chips must be fabricated with vias, or electrically conductive paths that run through the atom chip substrate into the vacuum region.  To improve chip production yield, we pursued an approach we refer to as "GlasSi" substrate technology.  GlasSi chips allow windows to be incorporated into the atom chip.  These windows can be used to image, illuminate, or optically control ultracold matter with exceptionally high resolutions (typically less than 1 micron).  Our efforts to develop and assess GlasSi technology were divided into four activities.  Each of these activities, and their results, are discussed below:     (1)  Chip Design and Fabrication:  Chip design consists of two components: a substrate design that determines the placement of window and silicon regions, and a metallization process that determines the conductor patterns.  Under this work, several GlasSi atom chips were fabricated and tested with RuBECi vacuum cells.  We have good statistics suggesting that the occurrence of vacuum leaks in GlasSi chips is exceedingly small.  By comparison, atom chips using ColdQuantaÆs previous technology had a much lower yield.  In fact, not a single atom chip fabricated under this SBIR has leaked.  (2)  Chip Current Capacity:              Due to the high current densities needed to produce and manipulate ultracold matter, damage to the atom chip from ohmic heating is a concern.  To better understand the limits of atom chip operation, finite element analysis software was used to simulate the thermal and mechanical effects of an atom chip operating under           typical conditions.  In one calculation, 3 A of current running through a 100 micron-wide trace for 60 seconds leads to a chip temperature near 100&deg;C.  This temperature is well below any damage threshold for the chip and vacuum cell.  However, if the trace is deposited onto a glass window with a 3 millimeter diameter, the poor thermal conductivity of the glass leads to temperatures very high temperatures.  These high temperatures are likely to induce thermal stresses that can crack the chip.  (3)  Current Capacity Tests:              To test the model described above, several destructive tests of atom chips were performed.  For currents below 3 A, the temperature of the chip agreed with the model to within 10%.  At higher currents, trace ablation and chip cracking were observed.  Nevertheless, results indicate that a 100 micron-wide trace can support up to 10 A of current continuously without damage.  (4)  Window Chips:              As a demonstratio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
