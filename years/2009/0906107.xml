<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom) is a high quality conference sponsored by IEEE Computer Society's Technical Committee on Computer Communications (TCCC) and Technical Committee on Distributed Computing (TCDP). Since the beginning of the conference in 2003, it has established as a premier meeting on this topic and has become extremely competitive with acceptance rate below 20%. The submission has been steadily on the rise which shows the interests and level of research activity in the community. So far PerCom was held in North America and Europe, and this is the first time it's being organized in Asia and was held in North America as well as in Europe. It is expecting about 300 will attend this year in Galveston. The corporate sponsor has also been increasing annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IEEE PerCom is a high quality conference and the premier technical forum dedicated to addressing the key challenges in pervasive computing and networking, including wireless, mobile, mesh and sensor networks, middleware, pervasive services and pervasive applications. This year the number of submissions in response to the CfP was over 240; from which about 30 papers will be accepted (60% of them long papers, 40% short papers) by the Technical Program Committee for presentation at the conference. The proceedings will be an IEEE publication. As in the past, selected (extended) papers will be invited for publication in a special issue of Elsevier?s Pervasive and Mobile Computing (PMC) journal. In addition to the main program, 10 satellite workshops are closely associated with PerCom (PerCom?s registration includes registration to all workshops so attendees can ?mix-and-match? presentations). An additional 100+ peer-reviewed, high-quality papers will be presented under the covers of these workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The travel support will enable US-based graduate students to attend and present their research results in this important IEEE conference.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
