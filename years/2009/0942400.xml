<AbstractNarration>Sketched-Truss Recognition Tutoring System&lt;br/&gt;Improved Student Learning through Active Learning and Immediate Student Feedback&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research (91) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is designed to evaluate and refine a sketch recognition tutoring system for trusses that enhances engineering learning by providing intelligent and immediate feedback.  Through a study of student learning and the revision of the software based on the study's findings, this work  provides a springboard for future development of tutoring systems for a much wider array of engineering courses including, but not limited to thermal sciences and a range of other mechanics-based classes. The software actively engages the student while providing guidance and develops a cognitive scaffold between concepts students understand to deeper levels of learning.  Most professors are aware of the importance of open-ended problems for deepening learning and enhancing innovation skills.  Intellectual Merit:  The STRAT (Sketched-Truss Recognition and Analysis Tool) facilitates the incorporation of open-ended design problems into large traditional classes.  STRAT software is designed to provide a more efficient means to teach engineers basic mechanics concepts thus allowing study time to be more productive and additional material to be added to the curriculum.  Users draw diagrams as they would naturally and thus there is no steep learning curve associated with this tool unlike tool palette or other CAD-based programs.  Furthermore, very minimal hardware is required; a standard computer and mouse is adequate.  The project has two goals.  The first goal is to measure the effects on student learning of the STRAT software through both quantitative and qualitative methods. The second goal of the project is to refine and improve the STRAT software based on experimental data, customer needs collected from students and professors, and on user feedback.  To increase external validity and utility, STRAT is being tested in a classroom setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The STRAT software has the potential to profoundly increase student learning and the efficiency of the instructional process. The STRAT tool can be used at a variety of institutions of higher learning ranging from small classrooms at teaching focused schools to public research focused universities with very large classrooms.  Visual aids are common in civil and mechanical engineering but active sketching and feedback provides additional benefits. Providing immediate feedback improves learning by eliminating the possibility of reinforcing inaccurate assumptions produced by the learner.  The sketch tool also encourages users to actively process the information instead of passively viewing visual representations. The task of free-sketching encourages and demands, that learners actively construct their knowledge leading to higher levels of comprehension and longer term learning. This approach to learning is also particularly suited for the sciences as it encourages the creation of new knowledge rather than the memorization of previously established information.  Furthermore, there are plans for the STRAT software to be freely available on a website and results broadly disseminated through conferences and journals.</AbstractNarration>
