    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to determine whether thin film materials, specifically CIGS, can accept the angle of diffracted light from holographic film, and assess the commercial viability of HPC on thin film PV modules. The project will characterize the electrical and optical properties of thin film cells, design holographic elements to work with the cells, design and produce a sample low cost module, and evaluate performance and manufacturability. Results from this project will be higher efficiencies, low-cost manufacturing and many new applications for thin film. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts/commercial potential of this project will be the merging of thin film technology with existing technology to create a groundbreaking new product. The thin film market has been growing dramatically, resulting from its low cost, low weight, and the ability to manufacture on flexible substrates and embed solar into walls, roofs and windows. When thin film is combined with inexpensive holographic film, the results should lead to even more dramatic performance efficiencies and lower costs. It has been forecasted that the thin film market will represent 20% of the PV industry by 2010, and reach $7.2 billion worldwide by 2015 (from just over $1.0 billion today).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."</AbstractNarration>
