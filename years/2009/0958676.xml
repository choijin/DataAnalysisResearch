<AbstractNarration>Using long-term experimental plots that exclude deer (native plant consumer) and garlic mustard (allelopathic forest invader), this investigator previously demonstrated that 1) over-abundant deer facilitate forest invasion by garlic mustard, 2) the presence of both garlic mustard and deer cause native perennial herb populations to decline, and 3) deer and garlic mustard negatively affect forest soil characteristics. The proposed research will extend and expand the seven-year dataset on key focal native herbaceous forest understory species to analyze the effects of deer and garlic mustard on population demography of the focal species. Integral Projection Models, a powerful new demographic method, will be employed to predict the long-term persistence or extinction of the focal species under different deer and invader scenarios generated by these experiments. This research will return novel insights into the direct, indirect and synergistic interactions of the powerfully disruptive duo, deer and garlic mustard, on the sustainability of forest native plant populations and the forest plant community as a whole.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasive species and overabundant deer threaten the functional integrity of native ecosystems and cause billions of dollars in economic losses annually. Results of this research will yield needed information on the effects of deer and garlic mustard to forest ecosystem managers by expanding our basic understanding of multi-species trophic forest interactions (deer, invader and natives). These researchers will continue outreach efforts and community engagement via public lectures, the development of a high school teacher workshop based on our findings, service on a non-profit board and community organizations, and through continued development of Virtual Trillium Trail (VTT), a computer gaming platform that provides a virtual field trip through our field site based on our field data. The effectiveness of VTT as a learning tool has been rigorously assessed with middle school students. Research training will include undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ MOTIVATION and INTELLECTUAL MERIT  Invasive plants species are increasingly dominating ecosystems worldwide.  Multiple factors have been hypothesized to drive invasive domination. These factors can be complex, subtle, and interact with each other. Importantly, their effects undoubtedly play out over long timeframes, requiring long-term experiments to accurately link hypothesized factors to predicted changes in invaded communities. We are interested in uncovering general mechanisms that can apply broadly to many noxious plant invaders and provide critical information for managers of parks and forests in the United States. We use invader, garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), as a model species to study invasion success.  Our NSF-funded research focused on the biotic resistance, enemy release and novel weapons hypotheses to help explain the rampant spread of garlic mustard in intact forest ecosystems in North America. Likewise, forests in North America currently face historically unprecedented densities of the ungulate herbivore, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus).

Further, garlic mustard produces chemicals in its tissues that defend it both from herbivores and from microbial infections in its leaves and roots. These same allelochemicals have been hypothesized to function as garlic mustardÆs novel weapon.      METHODS  To explore these invasion hypotheses, we collected size, survival, growth, flowering and deer herbivory data on six focal native plant species and garlic mustard in a forest in Pennsylvania. All focal plants that were growing inside six large, paired plots where deer either have free access or are excluded by fences, were permanently tagged and scored annually. In half of each of these plots garlic mustard is removed each spring.  At the end of the funding period, we had a decade of data from this long-term replicated experiment in a forest understory community.

This results indicates that garlic mustard is experiencing enemy release, as herbivores consume it in Europe and Asia.   Support for novel weapons: Our data on the size, growth rate, and probability of flowering for three deer palatable native species clearly show that both deer and garlic mustard are negatively affecting the native speciesÆ vital rates.  Even in the fenced plots where deer are excluded, the presence of garlic mustard significantly decreases native plants vital rates&mdash;the plants grow more slowly, flower less and are on smaller size.
