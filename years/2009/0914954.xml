<AbstractNarration>The development of numerical methods for large algebraic systems is&lt;br/&gt;central in the development of efficient codes for computational&lt;br/&gt;fluid dynamics, elasticity, and electromagnetics. &lt;br/&gt;Many other tasks in such codes parallelize relatively easily.&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic system solvers therefore remain very important now that&lt;br/&gt;an increasing number of parallel and distributed computing systems, with&lt;br/&gt;a substantial number of fast processors, each with a relatively large memory,&lt;br/&gt;are becoming widely available. A very desirable feature of domain&lt;br/&gt;decomposition algorithms is that they respect the memory hierarchy of&lt;br/&gt;modern parallel and distributed computing systems, which is essential&lt;br/&gt;for approaching peak floating point performance. This is important&lt;br/&gt;since the cost of communication often can dominate for large computer&lt;br/&gt;systems. The domain decomposition methods are also relatively easy to implement &lt;br/&gt;and they have an increasingly solid theoretical basis, which shows that the&lt;br/&gt;rates of convergence of these preconditioned Krylov space methods are &lt;br/&gt;independent of the number of subdomains and grows only very slowly with &lt;br/&gt;the dimension of the subproblems allocated to individual processors. &lt;br/&gt;In each iteration step, local problems representing the restriction of the &lt;br/&gt;original problem to a potentially large number of subregions are solved &lt;br/&gt;exactly or approximately. The subregions, which can be allocated to &lt;br/&gt;individual processors of a parallel computer, form a decomposition of the &lt;br/&gt;entire domain of the problem. In addition, the inclusion of a coarse  &lt;br/&gt;component often substantially increases the efficiency of the preconditioner&lt;br/&gt;and can dramatically reduce the CPU time. This project will combine &lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis with the design and numerical testing of algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;Each class of applications, e.g., elasticity, incompressible fluid flow,&lt;br/&gt;and electromagnetics, requires special considerations and,&lt;br/&gt;in particular, the design of an appropriate coarse solver, for the problem &lt;br/&gt;at hand,  is crucially important. Among the applications to be considered &lt;br/&gt;are incompressible Navier Stokes equations, Reissner-Mindlin plates, &lt;br/&gt;Maxwell's equations, nonlinear elastic contact problems, and those arising &lt;br/&gt;in forced vibrations and acoustics. Work will also continue on developing &lt;br/&gt;analytic tools, which also are applicable to very irregular subdomains &lt;br/&gt;such as those obtained from mesh partitioning software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this work is to provide improved computational methods&lt;br/&gt;for the engineering and scientific community. A special emphasis is on&lt;br/&gt;methods that can be used effectively on modern parallel and distributed&lt;br/&gt;computer systems; these systems have many processors and fast networks&lt;br/&gt;for the communication between the processors. In many design problems, such&lt;br/&gt;large scale computing resources are required in order to take complicated&lt;br/&gt;geometry and rapidly varying displacements or velocities into account and&lt;br/&gt;standard computing systems have often proved to be inadequate. Led by the&lt;br/&gt;US national laboratories and the computer manufacturers, large scale parallel&lt;br/&gt;computing systems are being developed rapidly and these systems are by now&lt;br/&gt;also available to practicing engineers, who, e.g., test building design&lt;br/&gt;under the impact of earthquakes, prior to certification and construction, &lt;br/&gt;or machine parts under realistic operating conditions, prior to making &lt;br/&gt;prototypes. This work requires access to software systems and ultimately &lt;br/&gt;to reliable methods to approximate complicated scientific or engineering &lt;br/&gt;models. In many applications, accurate predictions often require massive &lt;br/&gt;amounts of data to describe the geometry and material properties accurately&lt;br/&gt;enough. The design of methods to extract the solution of such problems &lt;br/&gt;requires different algorithms for different applications such as the&lt;br/&gt;design of buildings, the propagation of electromagnetic waves, or &lt;br/&gt;fluid flow in oil fields. This project is focused on mathematical analysis&lt;br/&gt;of these issues and the design of improved methods. Experience of such &lt;br/&gt;efforts in the past clearly indicates that insight gained from such work &lt;br/&gt;can greatly improve the efficiency and reliability of computational practice. &lt;br/&gt;This work is a collaborative effort with leading developers of methods &lt;br/&gt;and software systems at the SANDIA National Laboratories at Albuquerque, NM, &lt;br/&gt;and at the University of Essen, Germany. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
