<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to identify the fundamental surface properties of a micromoldable liquid metal.  The liquid metal is a low toxicity, gallium-based fluid with a low viscosity (like water) at room temperature.  It forms a thin, solid 'skin' of oxide on its surface that allows the liquid to be micromolded into desirable shapes (e.g., wires, antennas) that may be useful for flexible electronics.   The micromolded metal is stabilized mechanically by the skin, which dictates the electrical, mechanical, and chemical properties of the surface of the metal. The research will explore the fundamental properties of this surface and identify means of manipulating, modifying, and tuning it to form functional electronics with surface-dictated properties.  For this project, new surface sensitive techniques will be developed and used to thoroughly characterize the unique properties of the skin of oxide on the liquid metal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will enable the fabrication of soft, flexible, and stretchable electronic components with tunable properties.  Example applications include soft electrodes for molecular electronics, deformable antennas, and electrical components for microfluidic devices. Devices made possible by the research will offer the advantages of durability and flexibility, and will be simple to fabricate.  The research will be integrated into a new course at NC State and graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit directly from involvement in the research.  An interactive module that discusses the research within the context of popular movies will be presented annually to an established program at NC State that aims to interest 11- to 14-year-old African-American and Hispanic boys in higher education and careers in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied gallium-based liquid metals that are both metallic and fluid at room temperature.

This project explored the fundamental properties of this material and explored means of manipulating, modifying, and tuning it to form soft, functional electronics.  In addition, the project demonstrated the unique applications that arise from this understanding.  The research integrated with educational and outreach efforts that included recruitment of undergraduates and high school students into research activities and development and presentation to the public (including children) of an innovative module that discusses the properties and applications of our research.    The project led to twenty seven publications including a book chapter and two review articles.  The papers include at least ten different professors as co-authors, which is indicative of the level of collaboration initiated by the project. The project also helped support three students toward their PhD.  Key technical accomplishments include developing for the first time a way to 3D print metals at room temperature, establishing new ways to pattern liquid metals for stretchable electronics (with the best combination of conductivity and stretchability reported to date), demonstrating new ways to create microdroplets of liquid metal, showing that liquid metal particles can be utilized for medicine (as well as soft circuit boards), and creating new soft electronics including self-healing circuits and soft memory devices.  In addition, the project led to new understanding of how the metal behaves in water and also elucidated the role of electrochemistry as a way to tune the interfacial tension of the metal.  This work showed it is possible to achieve enormous changes in interfacial tension (perhaps the largest ever reported) using less than a volt, which is useful for moving and manipulating the shape of the metal for shape reconfigurable devices.   The work has been featured on the NSF website and been highlighted by Nature, NY Times, BBC, NBC, and in the Wall Street Journal (amongst many other media outlets).  Videos posted on YouTube that showcase our work have received ~2,000,000 hits cumulatively.
