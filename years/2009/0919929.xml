<AbstractNarration>Dolphins display an unusual form of sleep called unihemispheric slow wave sleep (USWS), in which brain waves typical of sleep appear in only one half of the cortex at a time. They do not exhibit rapid eye movement (REM) sleep at any time. This laboratory and their collaborators have found that when fur seals are on land they have both bilateral sleep, and REM sleep resembling the sleep seen in humans and all other land mammals.  However, when fur seals are in water, their home for 6 months of the year, they have USWS and little or no REM sleep, like dolphins. Therefore, the sleep behavior of fur seals provides a unique opportunity to determine how the brain waves of sleep are generated and why, although all other mammals have REM sleep, this state is absent or greatly reduced when USWS occurs.  To answer these questions, the project will focus on the changes going on below the cortex, determining the nature of the neurotransmitters that are released in subcortical regions during the various waking and sleep states.  It is expected that this will lead to fundamental new understandings of "why we sleep" and "why we dream," two of the most important unanswered questions in neuroscience.  Three graduate students will be trained and will complete their Ph.D.s during this project.  This project represents a model international collaboration between a Russian marine mammal facility that is currently the only place in the world with the facilities and expertise to study sleep in marine mammals and laboratories in the USA, Japan, South Africa and Switzerland. This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In all mammals so far examined (i.e. mice, rats, cats, dogs, monkeys, humans, etc.), several neurotransmitters have been shown to be maximally released in waking and minimally released in sleep. These include norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine, acetylcholine, glutamate and hypocretin. However, it is not clear whether these transmitters are released in relation to the waking state itself, as is often assumed, or in relation to specific activities occurring within the waking state, such as changes in movement, muscle tone, emotion or cardiovascular activity.   It has been known for some time that cetaceans (whales and dolphins) display sleep and waking states confined to one hemisphere at a time.  We have also shown in our prior studies that fur seals (semiaquatic mammals, Pinnipeds) can sleep both unihemispherically (as dolphins) and bihemispherically (as land mammals and humans). The major goal of this project was to investigate the nature and mechanisms of unihemispheric sleep and unihemispheric waking in the northern fur seal.  Recording electroencephalogram (EEG) from the cerebral cortex we have found that interhemispheric EEG asymmetry of slow wave activity in the fur seal is recorded across the entire dorsal cerebral cortex, including sensory, motor and associative cortical areas. Recording EEG from symmetrical subcortical brain areas we have found that unihemispheric sleep in the fur seal represents not only a cortical but a subcortical (or likely the global brain) phenomenon.   Using in vivo microdialysis techniques, we have measured the release of several neurotransmitters in the cerebral cortex and subcortical brain areas bilaterally during unihemispheric and bihemispheric waking.  Our result is surprising and clear:  acetylcholine release is massively asymmetric during unihemispheric waking, with tonic release on the waking side. In contrast, serotonin, histamine and norepinephrine release are not elevated in the waking hemisphere. Instead they are released at the same, very low, levels as during sleep, bilaterally and symmetrically during unihemispheric waking.  We find that greatly increased release of these three transmitters is linked to particular motor activities and emotional states in bihemispheric waking.  We have not found evidence that the levels of glutamate and hypocretin are lateralized as acetylcholine is.  Our findings extend our knowledge on the role different neurotransmitters in initiation of waking and sleep in the fur seal. They show that several transmitters known to be maximally released in waking, and observed to be waking-active in the current study, are not strongly linked to the asymmetric EEG seen during unihemispheric sleep and waking.   Our findings greatly advance our understanding of the neurochemistry of waking and sleep states.  They are also a major step towards developing a new understanding of the distinct functional roles of the other "waking" transmitters.
