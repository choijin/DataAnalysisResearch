<AbstractNarration>Shear in the mantle associated with the motion of Earth's tectonic plates tends to align minerals within large volumes of mantle rock.  One of the most common minerals in mantle rock is olivine, which is stiffer in some direction than in others.  The directional variation of stiffness is called anisotropy.  The partial alignment of olivine minerals in mantle rocks causes these rocks to be anisotropic.  Anisotropy expresses itself in the tendency for seismic wavespeed to vary slightly on the direction of propagation, shear-waves to acquire elliptical polarization, and for incoming seismic waves to scatter into other seismic waves. Love wave are horizontally-polarized surface waves that scatter to elliptically-polarized Rayleigh waves when they encounter regional concentrations of anisotropy.   These scattered waves, called Quasi-Love, or QL waves, are useful for detecting shear near plate boundaries, where the strong plates stretch the plastically-deformable mantle surrounding the plates as they sink at oceanic trenches, spread at rift zones, or crumple where continents collide.  QL waves can be observed on individual seismograms, and complement other types of seismic data. The investigators found QL scattering in and around the Cascadia subduction zone at the NW border in seismic data from the land-based USArray, a component of Earthscope.  At the Cascadia plate boundary the Juan de Fuca plate converges with the North American plate along the coast of the Pacific Northwest, and sinks into the mantle beneath the line of Cascade volcanoes.  Offshore anisotropy beneath the Juan de Fuca plate appears to align in agreement with coastal anisotropy estimated from other data.  This suggests that the mantle beneath the Juan de Fuca plate deforms from the lateral motion of the plate, rather than from "slab rollback," that is, a progressive retreat of the plate as it falls (of its own weight) into the plastically-deforming mantle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers are extending their analysis to the entire Cascadia subduction zone, stacking Quasi-Love scattered waves for stations along great-circle paths that track the progress of individual surface waves. The frequency dependence of the maximum scattering is sensitive to the depth range of anisotropy. QL-scattering proximal to the Cascadia subduction zone is significant, but lateral anisotropic gradients are present inland as well. The researchers are extending the stacking procedure inland from Cascadia to explore QL-crossing paths along the San Andreas system, the Basin and Range, and the Yellowstone hot spot.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For detailed interpretation of the data the researchers compute synthetic seismograms in simplified earth-model geometries as a quick-interpretation tool, and explore 3-D structure in anisotropy by adapting the SPECFEM-GLOBE seismic-wave simulator to explore the effects of hypothetical anisotropic geometries.  The researchers will produce maps of the Western US, that highlight the locations where Love-to-Rayleigh scattering is strong, what symmetry orientation (and therefore shear orientation) appears to be consistent with the scattering, and whether the anisotropic gradients are asthenospheric (i.e. dynamic), lithospheric (perhaps fossil) or represent deeper flow in the upper mantle.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Love-to-Rayleigh Conversions and Seismic Anisotropy in Cascadia  The alignment of olivine crystals in the peridotite rock of EarthÆs mantle, induced by creep along crystal dislocations during mantle deformation, causes a distortion in the relationship between stress and strain. The effect of this distortion on earthquake waves, called seismic anisotropy, offers clues to mantle dynamics. It is reasonable to suspect that tilted fast axes are induced within mantle peridotite in diverse tectonic flows, such as within subduction zones.  Lateral gradients of seismic anisotropy in Earth's upper mantle induce coupling among Earth's spheroidal and toroidal free oscillations. This coupling  converts Love to Rayleigh surface waves, also known as Quasi-Love (QL) waves, sensitive to the strike and the tilt of an anisotropic symmetry axis. We investigated evidence for QL scattering in Earthscope data, its theoretical sensitivity to the type and orientation of seismic anisotropy. We applied these findings to observations of QL waves in the US Pacific Northwest region. We constrain mantle anisotropy beneath and around the Cascadia slab, formed as the Juan de Fuca plate subducts.  Measurements of shear-wave birefringence on land above the shallow-dipping Cascadia slab show fast polarization aligned with plate motion. Assuming the standard relationship between "dry" olivine alignment and mantle shear flow, this suggests viscous coupling and slab-entrained flow. Using QL waves to discern a tilted anisotropic axis would confirm mantle entrainment aligned downward, or an alignment that betrays a counterflow in the lithosphere that occurs where slab "rollback" from the trench pushes the underlying mantle out of its way.  We developed computer codes to model QL wave scattering in the presence of 3-dimensional anisotropic structure. Scattering due to S anisotropy is stronger than that due to P anisotropy for all orientations, and so dominates in the observed scattering pattern.  Using data recorded on USArray of the Earthscope project, we observed the variation in QL wave scattering with propagation azimuth. The best-fitting model suggests coherent trench-perpendicular mantle anisotropy with an eastward dip in the subslab mantle of the Cascadian subduction zone. The resulting anisotropic model confirms the entrained subslab mantle-flow model for Cascadia and rejects the 3-D return-flow model associated with slab rollback.  Revealing the Fine Structures of the Lithosphere Asthenosphere Boundary  The transition from strong lithosphere to weak asthenosphere is caused primarily  by temperature and secondarily by water content, and was originally assumed to be gradational. However, recent seismological observations from the USArray component of Earthscope suggest a sharper and larger lithosphere-asthenosphere transition than can be attributed to the effects of temperature or water-depletion on elastic properties alone. Seismological studies have discovered an abrupt lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) in tectonically active regions of North America (e.g., the West Coast terranes and the Basin and Range province), but also a similar feature at similar depth within the thick stable lithosphere of the Eastern USA, termed the mid-lithospheric discontinuity (MLD).    We developed and tested the hypothesis that an anelastic effect, termed elastically-accommodated grain-boundary sliding (EAGBS), is the cause of both seismic features identified with the LAB and the MLD.    Recent lab experiments illustrate that mantle rocks undergo an anelastic transition when heated within a few 100&deg;C of their melting temperature. The minerals within the rock slide past each other along grain boundaries when stress is applied, but deformation is elastic within mineral grains.  Sliding within the rock weakens its stiffness, so that seismic waves travel more slowly in a rock that undergoes EAGBS.    We fit a simple grain-boundary sliding model with a range of parameters ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
