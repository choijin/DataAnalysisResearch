<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, John Bevan and Robert Lucchese of Texas A&amp;M University and their students will continue their research to develop accurate generalized models for non-covalent interactions based on a combination of experimental investigation and quantum chemical calculations.  Recent technological advances in the infrared and submillimeter/terahertz spectral regions provide unique opportunities for comprehensive experimental investigations of selected prototypical non-covalent interactions.  Investigations will focus on studies of ground state isotopic isomerization which is an anomalous deuterium isotope effect, development of an ultra-sensitive cavity-enhanced detection method for investigation of negative ion clusters using high resolution terahertz spectroscopy, and modeling of coupling of intra- and intermolecular modes through morphing approaches. The experimental studies will permit characterization of the selected systems with great precision and provide benchmark data for generating highly accurate vibrationally complete semi-empirical morphed potentials. The principle advantage of such methods is that they generate comprehensive microscopic semi-empirical models for prototypical, non-bonded interactions that can reveal fundamental new properties associated with non-covalent interactions as well as predicting properties with unprecedented accuracy. Ultimately, these approaches should lead to more generalized applications, including the prediction of the intermolecular interactions in larger clusters and model systems less amenable to detailed spectroscopic studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will provide benchmarks for understanding the structure and internal motions of larger species, including proteins and other biological molecules, as well as contributing to the solutions of problems in atmospheric chemistry, biochemistry, geochemistry, and materials engineering. Students supported in this project will receive training in both state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical techniques including opportunities for career advancement through international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Although intermolecular bonding between molecules is much weaker than bonding in normal covalent molecules, such interactions are pervasive and determine countless properties in all phases of matter. The influence of large amplitude, highly anharmonic motions complicate concerted experimental studies even in small systems. Under effectively isolated conditions, light is a powerful tool for experimental interrogation of such pairwise interactions at the molecular level.  However, except in the simplest of interactions, highly accurate predictions of intrinsic properties challenge standard theory previously used so successfully to model covalent molecules. We have introduced and developed a new approach called compound model morphing (CMM) to address this problem. In CMM, experimental measurements and molecular calculations are integrated to comprehensively characterize and above all predict many properties in prototypical intermolecular interactions with orders of magnitude better accuracy than previously possible.  We have studied how molecules interact by detailed investigation of selected pairs of neutral molecules isolated from other intermolecular interactions.  These investigations involved using narrowband light to provide detailed information about discrete energy states characteristic of the interaction (Figure 1).  Precise measurement of transitions corresponding to discrete absorptions were then used as the experimental data to be inputted into the CMM computational model for accurately predicting all properties of the intermolecular interaction.  Detailed characterization of the structure and molecular motions of interactions were generated through integration of experimental studies with computation in CMM.  Calculations were transformed to generated energy landscapes (Figure 2) that accurately reproduce a wide and varied range of high resolution experimental data.  Technological developments in the infrared and submillimeter/terahertz spectral regions have given unique opportunities for experimental investigations.  Experimental data was generated using state-of-the-art instrumentation exploiting recently developed quantum cascade lasers (Figure 3) and ultra-high resolution terahertz techniques developed in house.  The synergistic approach of combining experiment with morphing methodologies has recently been demonstrated in the ground state structure of (HI)2. This gave rise to an unexpected symmetric paired hydrogen bonded structure (Figure 4) unlike any other (HX)2 (X=F, Cl, Br) dimer as well as an anomalous structural isotope effect on mono-deuteration. Furthermore, morphing methodologies have been used to predict another anomalous deuterium isotope effect in the ground state isotopic isomerization of OC-HI.  Here, the ground state hydrogen H-bonded structure of OC-HI contrasts with the corresponding ground state halogen bonded OC-ID structure, a fundamental phenomenon not considered before in non-covalent interactions. More recently, a CMM-RS methodology has been further refined for all vibrations in OC-HF. This potential (Figure 2) was morphed using only a four parameter fit to near experimental accuracy with  primary analyzed rotational and vibrational parameters within 0.001%.  Such studies have also been generalized to halogen bonds including OC-Cl2, OC-BrCl and OC-Br2.  The investigation of OC-Cl2 permitted detailed comparison of its structure and molecular motion with OC-HCl which has equivalent binding energy. Morphing thus permits quantitative comparison of molecular motion and the greater directionality of halogen bonding in OC-Cl2 relative to the H bonding in OC-HCl.  Recently, we have been able to correlate the predictions of binding energies based on CMM approaches with blue frequency shifts of the hydrogen acceptor CO on complexation (Figure 5). For the H bonded series OC-HX (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN, CCH), it is  consistent with the original  tenets of a rule initially proposed by ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
