<AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Tobias Ritter of Harvard University.  Professor Ritter will apply the knowledge of the structure and reactivity of binuclear transition metal complexes to the development of catalytic carbon-fluorine bond formation.  First, an operationally simple synthetic methodology will be developed to effect a silver-catalyzed fluorination of arylstannanes.  Second, the silver-catalyzed fluorination reaction will be extended to complex small molecules.  Subsequently, other oxidation reactions will be investigated that benefit from the redox participation of two transition metals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Ritter's research could lead to efficient methods for the preparation of fluorine containing organic molecules.  These molecules are highly sought after in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.  In addition, they are also needed in molecular imaging via positron-emission tomography.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Ritter will also initiate educational projects that interweave research and teaching.  One project involves an outreach program targeting schools that serve predominantly underrepresented groups.  Professor Ritter will travel to different schools as part of a panel of Harvard researchers that will give a general introduction into different opportunities in Chemistry followed by specific guidelines for applying to graduate schools.  Another program will focus on establishing early contact to local high school students in the Boston area and educating them about chemistry and science in general.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The mechanism of Pd-catalyzed aromatic C&ndash;H oxidation chemistry continues to be vigorously discussed.  Historically, Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalysis cycles have been proposed.  We evaluated a detailed study of Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed aromatic C&ndash;H chlorination and proposed dinuclear Pd(III) complexes as intermediates.  We have identified a succinate-bridged dinuclear Pd(II) complex, which self-assembles during catalysis, as the catalyst resting state.  In situ monitoring of catalysis has revealed that chlorination proceeds with turnover-limiting oxidation of a dinuclear resting state, and that acetate ions, liberated during the formation of the catalyst resting state, catalyze the bimetallic oxidation.  Informed by reaction kinetics analysis, relevant dinuclear Pd(III) complexes have been prepared and observed to undergo selective C&ndash;Cl reductive elimination.  Based on the combination of kinetic data obtained during catalysis and explicit structural information of relevant intermediates, we propose a Pd(II)2/Pd(III)2 catalysis cycle for Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed aromatic C&ndash;H chlorination.  Fluorinated organic molecules are finding increasing use in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. Many substantial recent advances in fluoroorganic chemistry are due to the development of safer, less toxic, or more selective reagents.  Examples in perfluoroalkylation include the Ruppert-Prakash reagent (Me3SiCF3), the trifluoromethylator reagent ("CF3Cu"), the Langlois reagent (CF3SO2Na), the Baran reagent Zn(SO2CF3)2, the Umemoto reagent (S-(trifluoromethy)dibenzothiophenium), and the Togni reagents. Perfluoroalkyl iodides, in particular CF3I, are useful and comparatively inexpensive sources of perfluoroalkyl fragments. However, CF3I and C2F5I are gases, making accurate measurement of small quantities cumbersome.  Typical stock solutions of CF3I cannot be stored without quick attrition of the titer. We have introduce liquid-phase, halogen-bonded adducts of CF3I and C2F5I as perfluoroalkylation reagents. The reagents are room temperature-stable and can be conveniently manipulated. To the best of our knowledge, our report describes the first application of halogen bonding for organic reagent preparation, and the first X-ray crystal structure of a halogen-bonded CF3I adduct.  Using the easily-manipulated halogen-bonded adducts, we have developed a novel direct arene C&ndash;H trifluoromethylation reaction.  We also show applicability of our new reagents as drop-in replacements for gaseous CF3I and C2F5I.          Last Modified: 04/12/2016       Submitted by: Tobias Ritter]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
