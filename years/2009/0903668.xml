<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) project supports interdisciplinary training for doctoral students in anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology at Brown University to study development and inequality in the global south. Scholars and policymakers have become increasingly concerned about the causes and consequences of economic, social, and political inequality. While a large amount of research has been devoted to the topic in the United States and Europe, much less progress has been made in developing countries - where the problems are much more severe. To help deal with this issue, the IGERT project combines advanced measurement and analytical techniques with grounded understanding of local contexts in the developing world within a framework that integrates faculty, graduate students, and international collaborators. On campus, training will include interdisciplinary course requirements, participation in research community activities, and active faculty mentoring. Students will also spend two summers in a developing country, the first as apprentices in an ongoing faculty project, and the second as independent researchers collecting data for their dissertations. Broader impacts will be of several types. First, an innovative training program will be developed. Second, new data will be collected and new analytical approaches designed for understanding and mitigating inequality in the developing world; the findings will be widely disseminated both to academics and policy-makers. Third, the scholarly community will be strengthened. In the United States, underrepresented groups will be incorporated into the project; in the developing world, ties with collaborating institutions will be institutionalized and the capacity of their younger researchers will be increased. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit</span>: Inequality has become an increasingly prominent topic for social scientists and policy makers alike since the beginning of the twenty-first&nbsp;century. Most of the empirical work, however, has focused on the United States and Western Europe. Developing countries &ndash; where the problems of inequality are far worse &ndash; have not received as much attention. Partly this lacuna is due to lack of data; partly it results from the need to adjust theoretical concepts to a different context. Our IGERT project contributed to filling this gap at both levels. On the one hand, program participants collected data, both qualitative and quantitative, to analyze inequality with respect to topics as diverse as access to water in the Philippines, to bread in Egypt, to knowledge in Mexico, to gender identity in India, to democracy in Brazil, and to education in China. On the other hand, we developed new theoretical approaches by emphasizing that the drivers and effects of inequality cut across sectors and institutions and are deeply shaped by context. This approach produced innovative conceptual combinations that bridged traditional areas of research. Examples included democratic deliberation and development policy; institutional innovations and inclusion; welfare provision and &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; groups; the intersection of health, gender, and social class; race, class, and immigration; ethnic politics and social policy; the spatial impacts of urban policies; and corruption and nationalism. Together the two approaches enabled us to produce exemplary research that made significant contributions to the literature on inequality and development. These accomplishments, in turn, were made possible by our heavy emphasis on research in the field; all trainees were required to spend two summers (or the equivalent) engaging in fieldwork in one or more developing countries.
