<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to use novel carbon fiber-integrated microelectromechanical (MEMS) structures to develop an innovative high definition raster-scanned projection display system for mobile devices and other applications. Current technology relies on silicon-based MEMS structures that suffer from poor fracture toughness and fatigue behavior, and cannot provide the simultaneous large angular deflections and scanning speeds necessary for projection display. Research objectives for this project include fabricating the MEMS components, testing the prototype electronics and optics systems, packaging the optics and electronics into a portable prototype unit, and conducting preliminary investigations into screen materials. The anticipated technical results will be a functional, full-color prototype demonstrating proof of concept for a miniaturized MEMS and optics-based projection display system.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project applies to mobile device users, offering the potential of a small, affordable, projection system that could be embedded in almost any mobile device to produce a large, high resolution image onto any near-by surface.  Use of mobile devices has been rapidly expanding, however the limitations of a &lt;5" diagonal display prevent mobile devices from achieving their full potential.  The proposed technology's carbon fiber MEMS micromirrors are the only demonstrated technology capable of meeting the fast speed and large deflection requirements that enable mobile projection displays capable of providing a laptop-like user experience from a mobile device. This innovation can enhance technological and scientific understanding via an improved method for multi-media information display and access. Societal benefits include improved communication and transfer of multi-media.  Commercial impact is significant, as the technology could be integrated into most hand-held mobile devices, enabling portable video-viewing.</AbstractNarration>

Mezmeriz has answered this challenge by using novel carbon fiber-integrated microelectromechanical (MEMS) structures to develop an innovative, high-definition projection display system for mobile devices.  This embedded projector delivers a large screen experience without increasing the size of the device and facilitates the trend of mobile devices replacing cumbersome laptop computers. The end-goal was the development of a tiny, low cost, projection system embedded within mobile devices.  During this project, Mezmeriz built all the electronics systems, including the three main components: the laser driver subsystem; the image processing subsystem; and the MEMS mirror driver subsystem.  Mezmeriz successfully laid out the entire design architecture for the system, and built it to meet the key elements of the design.  The prototype version of the design was designed and built based on what components were readily available in the marketplace. The result was a lab-scale functional prototype that shows the proof of concept of key components of the entire system, including carbon fiber MEMS.
