<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is a study to expand the high speed addressing work conducted under Phase I using monochrome Plasma-spheres to color Plasma-spheres. Plasma-spheres are hollow transparent shells that encapsulate a selected pressurized gas. When a voltage is applied across the shell, the gas ionizes and glows. Plasma-spheres are applied to flexible, electrically addressable arrays to form Plasma-sphere arrays for use as large area plasma displays. Plasma-sphere arrays, like standard plasma displays require secondary electron emitting materials to increases addressing speeds. Under Phase II, the team will continue to investigate both thin film and thick film techniques for applying these materials to color Plasma-spheres. The proposed research presents a novel approach to produce video speed large area plasma displays. The Plasma-sphere array differs from other display technologies in that it allows for low-cost displays that are flexible, ultra-large, with full-color and full motion video.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a breakthrough display technology. It moves away from the traditional semiconductor fabrication processes as practiced by many display manufacturers in Asia and replaces them with low cost plastic, glass, and printing processes practiced and well understood by US based companies. The successful development of a high speed addressing will help move this product toward commercialization in the large and growing market of dynamic signage. Commercialization of this technology will lead to job creation and commercial opportunities in the United States. Furthermore, Plasma-sphere arrays are an order of magnitude lower in production cost when compared with ultra large LED displays. Lower material and manufacturing costs provide a social benefit in that fewer natural resources are required with a less taxing effect on the environment. The Plasmasphere array can be made large like an LED display, while retaining many of the exceptional features of a conventional, rigid plasma display including good viewing angle, high brightness, excellent contrast, and&lt;br/&gt;full motion video.</AbstractNarration>
