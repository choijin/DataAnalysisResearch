<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project investigates the role of strain in damage cascade formation and subsequent defect clustering in ion irradiated and annealed Si. The approach places emphasis on the growth of Si under different strain using molecular beam epitaxy. Cluster ion bombardment will be used to study amorphization mechanisms of the strained Si. In a parallel study using monomer ion irradiation, boron doped Si superlattice structures will be used to detect the flux of Si interstitials during post-irradiation thermal annealing. The measured transient interstitial supersaturation will be used as input to an inverse modeling of Ostwald ripening to obtain formation energies of defect clusters as a function of cluster size. Combining the experimental approaches with molecular dynamics simulations, the project aims for a comprehensive picture of defect development in strained silicon.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: This project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The capability to predict processing parameters in strained silicon is critical to promoting strain technology, optimizing the doping and annealing process in device fabrication, and evaluating device reliability in harsh environments involving particle irradiation. The project integrates research and education, and conducts outreach through the following activites: (1) increase minority participation in emerging materials research; (2) develop curricula; (3) create e-learning resources to integrate research, teaching and curriculum development for promoting public learning in frontiers of materials science; and (4) develop the Center of Ion &amp; Materials Research at Texas A&amp;M University and use it as a platform for interdisciplinary research and teaching.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of the project is to study defect formation and defect clustering in Si with and without strain.  The project has led to the following major findings.  1. Identify the amorphization mechanism of strained Si   Using cluster ion bombardment to obtain the radiation damage buildups as a function of cluster ion sizes, we have shown that strained Si still follows overlap model, which means that permanent damage zones forms when two partial damage zones from two neighboring damage cascade begin to overlap. This conclusion from the experimental studies is in good agreements with molecular dynamics simulations.     2. Experimentally extract the kinetics of defect clusters in strained Si  We have extracted formation energies of defect clusters as a function of cluster sizes in strained SiGe layer through (1) molecular beam epitaxial growth of Si/SiGe/Si superlattice, (2) Si self ion irradiation to create damage in buried SiGe layer, (3) measurement of Si interstitial flux emitted from the SiGe layer by using buried B diffusion markers, (4) inverse modeling of Ostwald ripening process to match the measured Si interstitial flux, (5) determination of size dependence of defect formation energies. The studies show that the defect formation energies are systematically increased in compressively strained SiGe layer. The amount of increase is most significant for small defect clusters. Such energy changes lead to accelerated Ostwald ripening of defect clustering in compressively strained Si.    3. Theoretically determine the defect formation energy in strained Si Combining molecular dynamics simulations and temperature-accelerated dynamics (TAD) simulations, we have shown that formation energies of defect clusters, up to cluster size n=5, decrease with tensile strains and increase with compressive strains. A linear formation energy dependence on strain can be established. The predicted stable defect structures, for both strained and non-strained Si, are the same up to I5. Overall findings support the experimental observations that Ostwald ripening process is accelerated under a compressive strain.  Research activities supported by this project have led to two M.S. degrees. Both students continued their graduate studies as Ph.D students. One student (Michael Martin) focused on experimental studies and the other (Di Chen) focused on theoretical studies by using molecular dynamics simulations. The project also supported several undergraduate students as summer interns. In addition, two high school teachers participated in the summer research activities.    The project shed lights into the fundamental phenomena of Ostwald ripening of defect clustering, which answers the question about abnormal boron diffusion and defect formation behaviors in strained Si after ion irradiation. Particularly, the project shows the effect of strain on the defect clustering and delivers the data on both size and strain dependence of defect kinetics. Not limited to this, the approaches used in the project, including using boron marker for detection Si interstitial flux and using flux information to model inverse Ostwald ripening process and using cluster ion bombardment to identify amorphization mechanism, are novel and can be used for other systems. The project taught a way to extract defect kinetics and provides a bridge to link atomic scale modeling to experiments. Such linkage is missing in the previous studies due to the difficulty to extract atomic scale information from experiments at very large time and spatial scales.  High performance, low power electronics are becoming ubiquitous in a vast range of everyday products, from laptops to cameras. Strained-Si surface channel and buried channel field-effect transistors have been recognized as next generation transistors by the International Roadmap for Semiconductors. Driven by the needs for various doping, ion implantation is generally used, which consequently introduces non-equilibrium defects ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
