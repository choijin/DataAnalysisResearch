<AbstractNarration>The study of gene regulation is central to modern biology. A significant portion of the nascent field of synthetic biology has revolved around building synthetic gene networks to recapitulate regulatory mechanisms found in nature or to engineer novel biological functions. However, artificial gene networks have not approached the sophistication of their natural counterparts in either design or performance. There are several technical and scientific challenges that currently limit the engineering of large-scale integrated synthetic genetic networks. This research centers on developing a framework for automating the process of gene network design by a) obtaining various working "parts" of gene regulatory mechanisms from nature and b) by applying engineering sciences to learn how to compose them reliably into novel systems which have predictable behaviors. The value of this project will be demonstrated through the development of the ?Programmable Rhizosphere?, which is a framework for engineering mutualism between model plant and soil microbe species. The Programmable Rhizosphere will allow control of interactions between disparate organisms, and represents a significant step towards our ability to manipulate complex ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This project brings together researchers from top US institutions as well as establishes a collaboration with major universities in the UK. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers associated with this project will get an opportunity to participate in a multi-institution, multidisciplinary research project. They will have the opportunity to train on a wide variety of techniques in computational and molecular biology. The results of the project will be disseminated to the broader public including middle and high school students through the development of informational materials and hands-on demonstrations designed for educating the public on the technologies and potential impact of synthetic biology.  In addition to the advances in the understanding of engineering synthetic regulatory systems, the Programmable Rhizosphere technology has broad implications for sustainability in agriculture.  In particular, these technologies could be used to engineer beneficial phenomena such as nitrogen fixation in agricultural crops, which would displace petroleum-based fertilizers currently used in agricultural production.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
