<AbstractNarration>Most offenders who are convicted of domestic violence crimes in the U.S. are mandated to attend one of the nation's 2000 batterer intervention programs (BIPs). BIPs bring groups of batterers together in treatment to hold them accountable for their crimes. Recent research raises serious questions about the effectiveness of BIPs due to high attrition rates, little evidence of attitudinal and behavioral change, and inconsistent contact with victims. A number of states are now offering other treatment approaches for domestic violence crimes; some states, including Utah, require these alternative programs to be offered after a period of BIP treatment. One alternative, Circles of Peace (CP), involves developing a social compact with the offenders and weekly conferences with voluntarily participating victims, extended family members, and trained community members to encourage behavioral change. Another alternative, Couple Conflict Group (CCG), offers a forum for multiple couples to address grievances by engaging in group discussions in which they receive and offer help to other members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study, sited in Salt Lake City, Utah, uses a randomized control design to compare the effectiveness of BIP, CP, and CCG. The study specifically tests combinations of BIP, CP, and CCG to determine which is most effective in reducing violent behavior. Part I of the study randomizes intimate partner and family violence offenders into either a BIP-only program or BIP-plus-CP program. Part II of the study randomizes only intimate partner violence cases in which the victim is willing to participate in treatment into BIP-only, BIP-plus-CP, or BIP-plus-CCG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings from this research will advance theoretical understanding of domestic violence by testing treatments that are driven by different models of violent behavior. They will also have the broader impact of informing the development of more effective programs intended to combat domestic violence.</AbstractNarration>
