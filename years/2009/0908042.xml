<AbstractNarration>Understanding earthquake physics is a critical step on the road to forecasting the short-term behavior of faults with obvious consequences for hazard mitigation. This is a project whose goal is to examine the dynamics associated with earthquake rupture. The studies to be carried out will provide much more comprehensive constraints on the way that a major fault zone behaves. Specifically, the project will combine detailed imaging of the San Jacinto Fault (SJF) in Southern California using an array to characterize the fault zone in the subsurface. It will couple this with surface outcrop and mapping of the fault zone, paleoseismic analysis, GPS analysis of crustal deformation, and theoretical work on seismic propagation to understand how factors such as fault damage, juxtaposition of different rock types, and segmentation affect the behavior of the fault zone. The Principal Investigators bring together current ideas about the rupture process and outline an approach that may be able to provide a quantitative understanding of the evolution of fault zone structures and related deformation phenomena (seismicity, strain fields) in actively deforming regions. This approach requires a framework that accounts for faults with evolving geometrical and material properties, as well as time-dependent interactions between the seismogenic zone and underlying viscoelastic substrate.</AbstractNarration>

How are  potential zones of large earthquake ruptures related to surface geodetic  deformation,spatio-temporal seismicity patterns, non-volcanic tremors,  locking depths, and fault zone properties at depth (e.g., seismic  velocity, attenuation and anisotropy)? What are the  relationships between material and geometrical properties of the fault  zone andearthquake source properties (e.g., spectral content, moments,  stress drops, radiated energy, univs. bi-lateral propagation, rupture  velocity) at different locations? What are the properties of the  crust around the San Jacinto fault zone and what is the nature of the  transitions between fault zone segments, the surrounding blocks, and  upper mantle? What is an appropriate methodology for integrating  different types of data on fault zone and crustal properties (with  different resolutions and spatial scales) in terms of a self-consistent  physical model for the evolution of earthquakes, fault structures and  related deformation fields?  We deployed 1100 Nodal seismic stations for one month in a 600  meter by 700 meter array spanning the active trace of the San Jacinto  Fault at Sage Brush Flats to understand the motions of the seismic wavefied using earthquake sources and to understand the ambient noise at higher frequenciles than ever observed before (10-200 Hz)  We created new three dimensional P and S wave velocity structure modelfor the region.   We created a high resolution catalog of 10,000+ events relocated with new three dimensional P and S wave velocity structure model  At 5 sites we used ambient noise tomography at linear arrays across the fault trace.  We observed directivity for small magnitude events down to  M &lt; 1.0 We created ground motion estimation results to be used by geotechnical engineers.
