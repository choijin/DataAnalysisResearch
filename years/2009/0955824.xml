<AbstractNarration>The Earth's bulk composition is fundamental to the understanding of the formation and evolution of not only Earth but also other planets in our own and other solar systems. However, estimates of the composition of Earth's mantle, which comprises more than three-quarters of the Earth's volume and nearly two-thirds of its mass, remain controversial and elusive.  The compositional makeup of this region is especially important for understanding chemical heterogeneity, which constrains deep structure and mixing and is crucial for inferring the thermo-chemical evolution of the Earth, from planet building and the magma ocean, to continental growth and the formation of the oceans and atmosphere.  Investigations of natural rock assemblages that have compositions that include aluminum and calcium in addition to oxygen, silicon, magnesium and iron, have suggested that the upper and lower mantle are chemically distinct and that the transition zone may not only involve a change in mineral structure but may also mark a quasi-compositional boundary.  There are several candidates for the 'natural' bulk Earth composition, and in this CAREER award she seeks to investigate the properties and signatures of these under extreme conditions.  For example, two plausible lower-mantle compositions include one derived from the building blocks of the planet and another derived from parent bodies of ocean island basalts. Investigating the behavior of these compositions at high pressures and temperatures will test hypotheses on Earth's formation, elucidate the geochemistry of the deep mantle, and determine if mantle reservoirs of varying composition are seismologically identifiable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed mineral physics research uses extreme experimental conditions designed to reproduce and 'probe' the Earth's deep interior, and the exploration of such inaccessible regions is readily disseminated to the public through multimedia and graphical approaches. In particular, the PI proposes a novel way of teaching Earth science through the use of comics, in both printed and digital form.  In doing so, the PI will be able to make topics such as Earth formation and evolution more accessible to students in the New Haven Public Schools System, as well as to the general public through online publication.  Another integral part of this proposal is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in high-pressure mineral physics research through laser-heated diamond-anvil cell experiments at national synchrotron facilities.  This training will contribute to the education of the next generation of independent researchers who will possess a thorough knowledge of high-pressure experiments that impact our understanding of the transfer of mass and energy within our planet.  The proposed research will be carried out at facilities of all scales (PI's laboratory, departmental, national and international laboratories) and results will be disseminated broadly through teaching, community outreach, seminars, conferences and peer-reviewed publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was to investigate plausible lower mantle compositions and compare their physical properties to seismological observations.  To do so, we investigated "dirty" rock assemblages&mdash;those more ?natural? in composition&mdash;that included aluminum and calcium among other elements, in addition to the usual magnesium, silicon and iron.  For example, two plausible lower-mantle compositions include one derived from the building blocks of the planet and another derived from the parent source of ocean island basalts. By investigating the behavior of these compositions at high pressures and temperatures tested hypotheses on Earth's formation, elucidated the geochemistry of the deep mantle, and determined if mantle reservoirs of varying composition are seismologically identifiable. In addition to studying different bulk compositions, we also found that varying the redox state (i.e., varying Fe3+/Fe) of the starting materials also influenced the mineralogy and subsequent densities of the assemblages formed under lower mantle conditions.  We found that samples that were otherwise identical in major elements (i.e., Mg, Si, Fe, Al and Ca) but lower in the relative amount of ferric iron to total iron, Fe3+/Fe, were denser than their more oxidized version by as much as 1-4%. Each sample was studied by in situ x-ray diffraction in order to identify high-pressure phases and their equations of state as well as by microbeam techniques for chemical analyses of major and minor elements.  With these density contrasts, we used mantle convection models to test this effect and found that the more reduced, hence denser, material would sink to the bottom of the mantle while their oxidized counterparts would tend to rise, thus affecting the overall evolution of the solid Earth through time and increasing our understanding of the Earth, its atmosphere and the solid mantle beneath our feet.     Another key outcome of this project included a novel approach to outreach in the production of two Earth science comic books geared towards middle-school aged students.  In the "Adventures of GEO!" series, George (aka as GEO, his superhero alter ego), takes the reader through adventures along the way learning about plate tectonics and the interior of the Earth (Issue 1), as well as all about the Moon (Issue 2).  The comic books were distributed to the local New Haven Public Schools and freely available online for download at www.adventuresofgeo.com.     This project supported two postdoctoral researchers, two graduate students, five undergraduate students and two lab managers, all mentored by the PI.  Of these people, six in addition to the PI are women or persons of color (or both).  Additionally, the project supported technique development and engineering that can be used across the high-pressure community.
