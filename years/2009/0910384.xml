<AbstractNarration>CareerWise-II is a continuation of CareerWise-I [supported by DRL 0634519].  This is a research project testing the efficacy of resiliency training over the Internet for the benefit of female doctoral students in engineering and the physical sciences, in order to reduce their attrition from their doctoral programs.  The central research question is whether deliberate resilience training delivered via the Internet can strengthen women students' persistence and success in STEM doctoral programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CareerWise-II identifies five research questions: &lt;br/&gt;1. What is the relationship between interpersonal communication skills and student perception of supports / barriers to degree completion / STEM careers? &lt;br/&gt;2. What is the most effective approach for delivering online instruction in interpersonal skills for STEM doctoral students?&lt;br/&gt;3.  Do instructional design principles that guide the development of non-interactive multimodal learning environments generalize to interactive, web-based environments?  &lt;br/&gt;4.  Do principles of instructional design derived from more structured domains (math, science) generalize to training soft skills (interpersonal communication)? &lt;br/&gt;5.  Does systematic resilience training over the Internet strengthen women students' persistence?&lt;br/&gt;The focus of CW-II will be on usability testing, large scale testing (including recruiting students), and improved Internet interfaces, including simulations.  The research design is comprised of three phases, each testing the effectiveness of different materials or combinations of materials.  Each phase has randomized trials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CareerWISE research program seeks to understand and reduce the attrition of committed women from doctoral programs in the physical sciences and engineering. While there are a number of related research thrusts within the interdisciplinary research group, the overarching research question pursued with this work has been whether deliberate resilience training delivered via the internet, can strengthen women students' persistence in STEM doctoral programs.     In support of this goal, by way of numerous quantitative and qualitative studies, we identified the common concerns of women in these doctoral programs and experiences that discouraged them from persisting.  The four most significant of these concerns center around managing difficulties with faculty advisors, balancing work and family commitments, navigating a male-dominated culture that can be chilly for women, and handling the delays and setbacks that are a normal part of research activity.   We also developed and formally evaluated an online psychological education program designed to increase womenÆs persistence in doctoral programs in the physical sciences and engineering.   During the grant titled "CareerWise II: Enhanced Resilience Training for STEM Women in an Interactive, Multimodal WebBased Environment," the content of the online program was expanded to include an in-depth focus on interpersonal communication. The added curriculum contains extensive written content along with detailed instruction in four critical interpersonal communication skills: planning the message, active listening, assertive self-expression, and receiving and responding to feedback. Also included are interactive simulations that provide training and practice in the corresponding interpersonal communication elements.

Following unstructured interactions with the online program, participants in the RCT were asked to respond to surveys measuring, among other things, their knowledge of and ability to apply the four key interpersonal communication skills.  The results provided evidence that both the CareerWISE interpersonal communication textual curriculum and interactive practice simulations are effective in enhancing students' knowledge and skills and also contribute to studentsÆ intentions to persist in both doctoral programs and careers in the physical sciences and engineering.  Demonstration of the siteÆs efficacy also afforded us the opportunity to use it for a number of related studies.  For example, evidence is mounting, both from our own research and from the research of others, about the importance of mentoring to womenÆs persistence in the physical sciences and engineering.  In concert, we wrote an article considering the CareerWISE online resource as a free and internationally available alternative to in-person mentoring, highlighting h...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
