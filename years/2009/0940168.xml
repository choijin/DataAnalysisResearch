<AbstractNarration>This conference support award is for the Annual International Conference on Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics "Dynamics Days" to be held in Evanston, Illinois, on January 4-7, 2010. The conference will bring together a diverse group of experts in complementary areas of nonlinear phenomena, including chaos, complex networks, granular materials, time series analysis, non-equilibrium statistical physics, pattern formation, self-organization, and fluid dynamics. The conference participants will be comprised of experts in theory and applications as well as students and postdoctoral researchers. There will be substantial emphasis on topics that cut across disciplinary boundaries, such as dynamical processes in complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics Days is an annual conference organized with the specific purpose of providing an interface for researchers from diverse scientific disciplines but with common interests in chaos and nonlinear dynamics. This meeting has become internationally known as a very effective venue for researchers to share their most recent results in understanding, modeling, and controlling nonlinear dynamical systems. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference will follow this tradition and create an interdisciplinary environment that will facilitate interactions between researchers from related but different fields. This is expected to generate new insights and lead to potentially transformative interdisciplinary research. The inclusion of students and early-career researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, is a central part of the conference. This will promote the transfer of expertise to the next generation of engineers, physicists, and mathematicians.</AbstractNarration>
