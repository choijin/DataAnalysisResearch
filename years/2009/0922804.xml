<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Cristina Suarez and colleagues Maureen Fagan, Elizabeth R. Jamieson and Kevin Shea from Smith College and Megan E. Nunez from Mt. Holyoke College will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer to support research that includes organic structure determination, organometallic structure determination, biological structure determination, DNA damage studies, dynamic NMR studies, and development of new types of NMR solvents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
