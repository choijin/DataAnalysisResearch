<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to create a new class of organic-inorganic dispersion engineered RF-optical modulators for the purpose of achieving energy efficient electrical-to-optical conversion.  The approach is based on the integration of organic materials with inorganic materials and the dispersion engineering of anisotropic periodic structures.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The research program has two major thrusts.  The first involves the engineering of electro-optical planar waveguide technology that exhibits no reactive ion etch induced surface roughness, thin film deposition through spin-coating, high index contrast, and large second order susceptibility.  These advantages are leveraged in the second thrust, which is based on the emulation of finite anisotropic periodic structures, where the internal optical field grows to the fourth power of the number of periods.  Nonlinear optical effects are tremendously intensified, thereby enhancing modulator conversion efficiency while also enabling component miniaturization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Combining the advantages of optics and RF in hybrid systems addresses concurrent demands for greater bandwidth and mobility, thereby impacting the networking, computing, and sensing industries.  The integrated educational plan responds to the challenge of preparing science and engineering students to be successful in an increasingly interdisciplinary and global environment.  The plan is to develop a global scientists-and-engineers seminar series at Ohio State University and an integrated optics curriculum that engenders integrative research thinking.  Additionally, the plan fosters the involvement of undergraduates and minority students from underrepresented groups in the research program and engages the local science museum to introduce engineering to diverse student populations.</AbstractNarration>
