<AbstractNarration>Landsliding is a complex process that influences carbon budgets in mountainscapes worldwide.  This interdisciplinary project seeks to understand the relative contribution of landsliding and deforestation to land-cover change and ultimately, their role in transferring and storing organic carbon in the Sierra de Las Minas, Guatemala.  Using a set of contrasting watersheds - dry and wet - this project will address three primary goals: 1) quantify the contribution of deforestation and landsliding to land-cover change, 2) examine the coupling between landslides and streams, and 3) estimate carbon fluxes associated with landsliding and deforestation.  Land-cover data obtained from remotely sensed images taken at many points in time, and carbon-content data obtained from field sampling of vegetation, soil, and water, will be combined in a geographic information system (GIS) to model carbon storages and fluxes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the education of a new generation of scientists in an emergent field that recognizes important links between Ecology and Earth Sciences.  This goal will be accomplished by engaging students traditionally under-represented in science across educational levels in a variety of activities, including field work, satellite image analysis and modeling, and laboratory analyses.  Students will also benefit from the cross-cultural aspects of interdisciplinary scientific research in international settings.  Results of this project will improve the knowledge base needed for carbon mitigation projects in tropical regions, and will enhance our understanding of carbon cycling and sequestration in the context of climate change, hazard assessment, and forest conservation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Landsliding continuously modifies mountains around the World.  Whether causing localized or regional impacts, landsliding is often perceived as a threat to human lives and infrastructure.  Yet landsliding may play an important role in mountain ecosystems through its influence on rocks, soils, organisms, and ecosystem processes.  Among the latter carbon cycling stands out due to its relationship with climate, ecosystem productivity, and biodiversity. Landsliding removes and transports stocks of organic carbon stored in vegetation and soil and may contribute to its long-term sequestration.  At the same time the recovery of vegetation and soil on landslide scars may contribute to the sequestration of new carbon (Photo 1).  Working in the Sierra de Las Minas of eastern Guatemala faculty and students from the University of Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras campus and Ohio State University sought to establish the contribution of landsliding to carbon cycling.  In 1998 Hurricane Mitch triggered thousands of landslides in the Sierra de Las Minas that caused extensive changes in land cover, with rippling effects throughout Central and North America.  Centering on this event, we combined high-resolution imagery, geographic information systems, field and analytical work to quantify land cover change mediated by landsliding, model interactions between landslides and streams, and estimate carbon fluxes mediated by landsliding.  The Sierra de Las Minas encompasses wide temperature (elevations range between 0-2,900 masl; Photo 2) and precipitation (the north flank - Polochic - is wet whereas the south flank - Motagua - dry to mesic) conditions. An initial focus on the southern flank of the Sierra de Las Minas showed that 1) landslide activity and the size of carbon stocks changed with elevation and 2) landsliding transferred 3% of the pre-hurricane carbon stocks.  While 30% of this carbon was delivered to hillslopes or first-order streams with a presumed high potential for long-term sequestration, the remaining 70% was delivered to higher-order streams with unknown carbon retention capabilities. Work on the southern flank also revealed complex interactions between land use change, people livelihoods, and landsliding that are critical in any discussion about sustainability in areas prone to landsliding.   Subsequent efforts in the northern flank of the Sierra de Las Minas has helped uncover important differences in landslide activity, size of carbon stocks, recovery of carbon stocks on landslides, and silicate weathering rates with potential implications for climate change studies.  Landslide activity, for example, affected a larger area and peaked at higher elevations in the Motagua than in the Polochic; likewise, soil carbon stocks in forest were greater in the Motagua than the Polochic - two results slightly counterintuitive. Landslide regeneration was on average slower in the Motagua than in the Polochic mirroring carbon density estimates for landslide soils.  Finally, increased silicate weathering was greater in streams draining the Polochic than the Motagua, and comparable to known figures from active mountains elsewhere.   The Sierra de Las Minas has provided a unique opportunity to examine complex interactions between climate variability, landslide activity, and carbon cycling and explore ways in which local communities experience and respond to natural hazards.  Undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs from UPRRP, OSU, the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, and the Universidad San Carlos de Guatemala have participated in various roles in this project, while gaining international experience.  In Guatemala, faculty and students engaged actively with children, local authorities, and park rangers through short lectures and talks (Photo 3) aimed at presenting findings of the work and explaining key ecological concepts.  Our work has been disseminated within the scientific community and broad audiences.          Last Modified: 03/11/201...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
