<AbstractNarration>Ad hoc workflows are everywhere in service industry, scientific&lt;br/&gt;research, as well as daily life, such as workflows of customer&lt;br/&gt;service, trouble shooting, information search, etc.  Optimizing ad&lt;br/&gt;hoc workflows thus has significant benefits to the society.&lt;br/&gt;Currently the execution of ad hoc workflows is based on human&lt;br/&gt;decisions, where misinterpretation, inexperience, and ineffective&lt;br/&gt;processing are not uncommon, leading to operation inefficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research project is to design and develop&lt;br/&gt;fundamental models, concepts, and algorithms to mine and optimize ad&lt;br/&gt;hoc workflows. The project includes novel research on the following&lt;br/&gt;key areas: (1) Network Modeling and Structure Mining. A network model&lt;br/&gt;is built that statistically captures the execution characteristics&lt;br/&gt;of ad hoc workflows, and is optimized to improve the execution of&lt;br/&gt;new workflows with respect to different optimization objectives.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Workflow Artifact Mining.  The network model built on workflow&lt;br/&gt;executions is then extended with workflow artifact mining to realize&lt;br/&gt;an optimization system that is able to take advantage of both&lt;br/&gt;executions and text contents. (3) Role Discovery and Relation&lt;br/&gt;Assessment. A computational framework is built to analyze the roles&lt;br/&gt;and relationships of agents involved in ad hoc workflow executions&lt;br/&gt;in order to further optimize workflows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances from this project include models to represent ad hoc&lt;br/&gt;workflows, algorithms for mining hidden collaborative models, and&lt;br/&gt;techniques that optimize ad hoc workflow processing.  The project&lt;br/&gt;bridges two emerging research areas: service science and network&lt;br/&gt;science, and enriches the principles and technologies of data mining.&lt;br/&gt;It also enhances research infrastructure through the collaboration of&lt;br/&gt;team members from different areas (data mining, database, and&lt;br/&gt;network). This research is tightly integrated with education through&lt;br/&gt;student mentoring and curriculum development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publications, software and course materials that arise&lt;br/&gt;from this project will be disseminated on the project website:&lt;br/&gt;URL: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~xyan/smartflow.htm</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Collaborative networks are composed of experts who cooperate with each other to complete specific tasks, such as resolving problems reported by customers.  A task is posted and subsequently routed in the network from an expert to another until being resolved. When an expert cannot solve a task, his routing decision (i.e., where to transfer a task) is critical since it can significantly affect the completion time of a task.  In this project, we attempted to (1) deduce the cognitive process of task routing and model the decision making of experts, (2) predict task completion time, and (3) optimize collaborations.  Our work has advanced the area of modeling and mining collaborative networks, which is critical for virtually every organization but yet severely under-investigated.  We created a new research branch in data mining, collaborative network mining and problem routing analysis.  Our models, concepts and mining algorithms for problem solving in collaborative networks were published in leading international data mining and database conferences and journals such as KDD, VLDB, WWW, and TKDE.  A tutorial, titled "Network Mining and Analysis for Social Applications," covering these research outcomes, was given in the 20th ACM International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (SIGKDD).  We built a strong collaboration with researchers at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center and successfully applied our models and mining algorithms to IBM customer service data.  Through simulation, we were able to identify the bottleneck of a customer service network and improve the identified nodes to maximize the service throughput and minimize the response time.  Our work has drawn attention from the US Army Research Laboratory and was further funded by NS-CTA (The Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance).  We have demonstrated the developed technology to IBM and ARL.  In this project, we engaged students at all levels (PhD, MS, and undergraduate students), including students from under-represented groups.  We graduated two female Ph.D. students, and mentored three MS students and one undergraduate student:  Two of them are underrepresented minorities. One joined the Computer Science Ph.D. program at the Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with full scholarship. The undergraduate student went to UC Berkeley for a graduate study.
