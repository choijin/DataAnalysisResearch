<AbstractNarration>Westdickenberg&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0955051&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator takes up problems in the areas of (i) slow&lt;br/&gt;coarsening or dynamic metastability of gradient flows, and (ii)&lt;br/&gt;logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (LSI) and the hydrodynamic&lt;br/&gt;limit.  In the first part, the investigator and collaborators&lt;br/&gt;apply the abstract sufficient condition for dynamic metastability&lt;br/&gt;developed by Felix Otto and the PI to the Cahn-Hilliard Equation&lt;br/&gt;and then develop new but related methods to tackle the more&lt;br/&gt;applied problem of coarsening rates in two-dimensional epitaxial&lt;br/&gt;growth models.  In the second part, the investigator and&lt;br/&gt;collaborators push forward their two-scale method for LSI and the&lt;br/&gt;hydrodynamic limit to prove convergence of the microscopic&lt;br/&gt;entropy to macroscopic entropy under general sufficient&lt;br/&gt;conditions.  The educational and outreach component of the&lt;br/&gt;proposal encourages and supports women in mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;disseminates knowledge on multiple levels both in coordination&lt;br/&gt;with the research plans detailed above and through four explicit&lt;br/&gt;initiatives headed by the PI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The work of this project focuses on understanding the way&lt;br/&gt;that energy (or entropy) and energy dissipation (or entropy&lt;br/&gt;dissipation) affect the nonlinear dynamics of a physical system. &lt;br/&gt;In general, science has a good understanding of global minimizers&lt;br/&gt;but a very weak understanding of local minimizers and pathways&lt;br/&gt;between them -- where many physical systems spend all of their&lt;br/&gt;time.  A broader understanding of multiscale energy landscapes is&lt;br/&gt;of both scientific and practical importance; for instance,&lt;br/&gt;epitaxial growth models have implications for nanotechnology and&lt;br/&gt;semiconductor development, technology with impact in medicine,&lt;br/&gt;communications technology, and other fields.  The education and&lt;br/&gt;outreach component of the proposal addresses a critical need to&lt;br/&gt;recruit and keep more women in mathematics, increase diversity in&lt;br/&gt;the sciences, and build international ties between the scientific&lt;br/&gt;communities.</AbstractNarration>
