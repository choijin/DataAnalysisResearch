<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to discover new fundamental principles, design methods, and technologies for realizing distributed networks of sub-cm3, ant-sized mobile micro-robots that self-organize into cooperative configurations.  The approach is intrinsically interdisciplinary and organized along four main thrusts:  (1) Algorithms for distributed coordination and control under severe power, communication, and mobility constraints.  (2) Electronics for robot control using event-based communication and computation, ultra-low-power radio, and adaptive analog-digital integrated circuits.  (3) Locomotion devices and efficient actuators using rapid-prototyping and MEMS technologies that can operate robustly under real-world conditions.  (4) Integration of the algorithms, electronics, and actuators into a fleet of ant-size micro-robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No robots at the sub-cm3 scale exist because their development faces a number of open challenges. This research will identify and determine means for solving these challenges. In addition, it will provide new solutions to outstanding questions about resource-constrained algorithms, architectures, and actuators that can be widely leveraged in other applications. The PIs will adopt a co-design philosophy that promotes cross-disciplinary research and tight collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Networks of ant-sized robots are expected to be useful in disaster relief, manufacturing, warehouse management, and ecological monitoring, as well as in new unforeseen applications. In addition, the new methods and principles proposed here can be transitioned to other highly-distributed and resource-constrained engineering problems, such as air-traffic control systems.  This research program will train Ph.D. students with unique skills in the design of hybrid distributed networks and it will involve undergraduate students, particularly underrepresented minorities and women.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The main results were reported in top journals and peer-reviewed conference papers. The following is a summary of some of the highlights of our research.     Previous small scale robots have been limited to slow, tethered treks if they were able to move at all. Many of the failures were due to lack of mechanical robustness in their environment &ndash; a failure that we have begun to address through the introduction of new, softer materials in microfabrication.

We also developed an open resource hardware and software platform (TinyTeRP), which is a resource contribution to research and education. These robots have been featured in an NSF Science Nation video and have continually attracted bright undergraduate students to research.     We have developed methods for creating chip-scale robots:  chips that can walk because they have moving legs and know how to operate them.  The combination of integrated circuits (ICs) with actuators required the development of novel hardware and microfabrication techniques.  Since the chip surface is covered with circuits for programmable walking gaits, energy-efficient actuation, and computation, we needed to use exclusively surface micromachining, and it had to be compatible with commercially-available complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.  To enable the chip-scale robot to support its own weight and to walk forward, we optimized the actuator structure. Furthermore, to provide power to these tiny chips (3 mm) we needed flexible wire connections that did not interfere with their motion.  We were pleased to see actuation in prototype devices and hope to report on the first legged chip with onboard control in the very near future.     Various micro-scale actuators were investigated, including surface micromachined dielectric elastomer actuators, thermal actuators, and nastic actuators.  The latter are hydraulic actuators within an elastomer operated by electro-osmotic pumping.  The most important improvement to the nastic technology was the discovery of a pumping fluid that does not generate gas bubbles when high voltage is applied, which will allow large forces and stable performance to be achieved.  Other technology advances include the demonstration of carbon/elastom...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
