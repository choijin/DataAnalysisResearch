<AbstractNarration>In this STEP Type 2 project, the two-phase multi-method study examines the structural and individual factors that contribute to women being less likely to complete STEM majors than men.  The study combines both a longitudinal quantitative component and a qualitative component focused on the experiences of the research subjects. The study examines structural/organizational and individual factors and the interactive effects of these factors on women's success in STEM from middle school through colleges in STEM disciplines in which women are traditionally underrepresented.  The data from the longitudinal aspect of the study will be combined with data from surveys and in-depth interviews.  The research team has unique access to existing longitudinal data sets from the University of North Carolina General Administration (UNC system's 16 campuses) and the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. The study has the support of major educational institutions in the state that have agreed to provide grades 8-16 data for students in both systems.  The qualitative aspect of the study provides a rich data source for examining in greater detail the experiences women have had as they make their way through grades 8-12 to becoming STEM majors in and graduates from post-secondary education institutions.  The research examines the relationships among gender, ethnicity/race, and socio-economic status with other individual and structural/organizational factors, such as qualification of STEM teachers, gender composition of faculty by campus and by department, and the racial composition of student body by campus and by major.  The focus on the experiences of women (completer, avoiders, and leavers) in STEM has the potential to make a major contribution in this area of research. Based on the interest of state educational institutions, the study has the potential to lead to the consideration of its findings by state-level stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF-funded study investigated the complex interplay between different stages of the educational life course and K-16 school organization characteristics and cultures in influencing gender and racial/ethnic gaps in STEM degree attainment.  The study had two major components; first, members of the research team worked with several different organizations to build a dataset of administrative records for a single cohort of North Carolina public school students.  This dataset&mdash;named the NC Roots of STEM&mdash;combined educational records from seventh grade through college graduation for members of the 2004 public high school graduating class who also attended a campus of the University of North Carolina. The dataset allowed us to follow studentsÆ progress through different levels of schooling.      The second component of the project involved interviews with senior-status students at each of the sixteen North Carolina public universities. We interviewed more than 300 students who either (1) majored in STEM fields, (2) began a STEM major and left it for a non-STEM major, or (3) excelled in high school math achievement tests or expressed an interest in majoring in STEM, yet majored in a non-STEM field.  These interviews allowed us to explore issues concerning studentsÆ aspirations, early background, and interpretations of their K-16 educational experiences.     Our study has generated important insights regarding the pathways that students take toward or away from majoring in STEM fields before and after they matriculate to UNC campuses.  Insights fall into three categories: the role of high school faculty in student persistence toward STEM degrees, high school experiences/characteristics and their effect on STEM outcomes, and issues related to underrepresented populations in STEM fields.  Below is a brief overview of these findings.  The role of high school faculty in student enrollment in STEM majors  The proportion of female math      and science teachers at a particular high school had a powerful positive effect      on female studentsÆ likelihood of declaring and graduating with a STEM      degree. Effects were largest for female students with the highest math      skills, for White female students, and for the probability of female      studentsÆ choosing majors in the STEM fields where they were most      underrepresented, including engineering and computer science. But the      proportion of female math and science teachers had no impact on male      studentsÆ STEM outcomes.  Students      frequently cited the influence of encouraging and supportive teachers as      reasons for their decisions to pursue STEM majors.  Because the enjoyment of math      and science is an important condition for Latino/a studentsÆ pursuit of      STEM majors, teachers played a very influential in the process. Latino/a      students were more likely to major in STEM during college if they were      educated in high schools where they studied with teachers who worked in      collaborative professional communities, and in schools where teachers had      a high level of satisfaction with their jobs. Latino/a students were also      more likely to mention teachers as important influences in their decisions      to attend college and to major in STEM fields.    High School Experiences/Characteristics and Their Effects on College STEM Outcomes  Taking physics and stating an      intention to major in STEM during high school was positively associated      with studentsÆ choice of STEM as a college major. Taking physics was especially      important for young womenÆs likelihood of declaring a STEM major.  Exposure      to racial segregation in high school at both the school and classroom      level affected studentsÆ college freshman grade point averages, and had an      especially negative relationship with the achievement of disadvantaged      minority students.  Segregating students in      racially isolated White high schools was related t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
