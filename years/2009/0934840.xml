<AbstractNarration>California State University, Dominguez Hills and the Urban Education Partnership are collaborating on a planning proposal to create an NSF Master Teaching Fellowship project that will develop math and science master teachers for urban schools in the Los Angeles and Lynwood Unified School Districts. Both are high-need districts that enroll primarily low-income students of color. Objectives for the planning process include: 1) establishing partnerships among CSUDH, the Partnership and school districts;  2) reaching an agreement with the school districts about possible roles for master teachers;  3) developing written criteria for participation in the project, a selection process and marketing plan; 4) developing a written model and timeline for five years of professional development for master teachers; 5) developing methods of evaluation for the project; 6) Identifying sources of nonfederal match; and 7) developing a budget that includes costs, number of fellows, and financial feasibility.  A diverse planning team of university faculty, science and math specialists, teachers, LEA representatives, and others is conducting key activities including: assessing the districts' need for master teachers and the roles they can fill; assessing the needs and interest of teachers who may participate; creating a skills profile of a master teacher and a list of appropriate sources for training by researching best practices and successful strategies in the partner organizations and others; developing connections with STEM faculty, private and public sector professionals who could provide participants with customized enrichment activities; producing a five-year training timeline for master teachers; developing  and signing MOUs that clarify the partners' and districts' roles and responsibilities; and identifying matching funds.   The team is drawing on successful strategies, research, and consultation with appropriate experts to develop guidelines for recruitment, participation, selection and evaluation of a master teacher project.</AbstractNarration>
