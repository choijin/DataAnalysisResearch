<AbstractNarration>This project will employ state-of-the-art instrumentation to investigate the photo-oxidation of biogenic alkenes and their oxidation products as part of a multi-investigator field program in the forested environment of California's Sierra Nevada, a chemical regime where organic peroxy radicals react with hydrogen peroxide under conditions with relatively low levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  This regime is currently poorly characterized; previous field observations have suggested that the mechanisms currently used in photochemical models are inconsistent with observed levels of NOX.  A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer will be coupled to a custom, selected-ion chemical ionization inlet for real-time analysis of many short-lived, reactive compounds including the organic peroxides that have, to date, been poorly quantified.  During the field campaign, a second chemical ionization mass spectrometer will be used to measure, via eddy covariance, the fluxes of hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will improve constraints on the mechanisms responsible for 1) production and loss of ozone, 2) the production and fate of organic nitrates, and 3) formation of secondary organic aerosol in Earth's atmosphere, thus providing substantially improved understanding of the nature of the organic chemistry that controls the burden of ozone and aerosol in many regions of the world.  The work will involve collaborations with a broad spectrum of scientists, including other atmospheric chemists, meteorologists, and ecologists studying the biochemistry leading to the formation and release of biogenic alkenes from trees.  These collaborations will expose graduate students and post-doctoral scholars involved in the work to the breadth of earth science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Accurate characterization of the chemistry leading to the formation and degradation of ozone and small particulate matter in EarthÆs atmosphere is essential for understanding the interactions of the biosphere and climate as well as for designing appropriate air quality improvement strategies.  Both ozone and atmospheric particles play a major role in the environment through their deleterious influence on human and animal health and through their impact on visibility in both urban and regional areas.  The chemical and physical nature of atmospheric particules also determines their interaction with sunlight that, in part, control the EarthÆs climate.  The studies supported by this grant substantially improved our understanding of the nature of the organic chemistry that controls the burden of ozone and particulate in many regions of the world.  Specifically, this award supported the deployment of two highly sensitive instruments to the 2009 BEARPEX field campaign (www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~bearpex/) as well as associated laboratory studies of the photochemistry of chemicals emitted from trees.  As part of this study, we measured the concentrations of many gases for the first time in the ambient environment and in the laboratory.   We have used these observations to investigate the interactions of pollution from the central valley of California with the biogenically-derived emissions of trees and other plants.  This chemistry is important for air quality in many regions of the United States.  These field and laboratory studies involved collaborations with a broad spectrum of scientists and engineers &ndash; from physical chemists working on fundamental questions of how molecules react to ecologists studying the biochemistry leading to the formation and release of chemicals from trees.  These collaborations exposed the graduate students and postdoctoral scientists involved in this work to the breadth of earth science.
