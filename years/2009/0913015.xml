<AbstractNarration>This proposal identifies a pathway to distributed pattern recognition through parallelization of a particular contour identification algorithm and decentralized data collection using formations of robots.  Such a system recognizes patterns in the data it collects autonomously.  Anticipated applications range from homeland security, to emergency response, scientific exploration and environmental monitoring.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional mobile sensor networks are based on an architecture in which some minimal signal processing is performed on the sensing nodes, while the bulk of information is directed to a network sink for processing and interpretation.  The hypothesis here is that the same communication infrastructure that enables motion coordination in formation of robots can be exploited for distributed processing of sensor data and autonomous pattern recognition without human intervention.  Thus, information is interpreted in a distributed fashion and without dependence on the capabilities of specialized individual nodes.  This method brings forward a robust and autonomous system which can inherently tolerate node and network failures and exhibits collective intelligence in the form of group associative memory.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical challenges to be overcome are the development of decentralized and provably convergent cooperative motion control designs which can enable targeted data collection, and the scalable implementation of a pattern recognition algorithm based on Dirichle Laplacians along with its integration with spatially distributed Hopfield neural networks.  The complete system will be demonstrated by an experimental test-bed with mobile robots capable of recognizing noisy, variable shapes on the laboratory floor.  Outreach activities will include undergraduate research and summer programs for secondary school teachers.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Potential applications of such a function can be identified in surveillance and reconnaissance, search and rescue, underwater archeology, and planetary exploration. To realize this goal, we needed to understand better how robotic sensor platform motion, information flow, data management and processing, and pattern recognition interplay with each other in a distributed actuation and computation environment.  The envisioned sensor network system consisted of a number of small sensor-bearing mobile robots that were able to exchange information with each other through local wireless network connections.

The idea was that instead of the individual sensors simply dumping their data into a central network node for off-line processing, they process information in a distributed way, based only on their own data and those of their closest network neighbors. Without any single network node having to have the whole data picture, they would collectively conclude as to whether there is a pattern in the data they have collected, even if individual sensors could not have by themselves "seen" the complete pattern, but rather bits and pieces of it. It is information exchange between them that essentially enables them all to "see" through each otherÆs "eyes." Having implemented both information collection, as well as processing, in a distributed manner promised robustness with respect to sensor noise as well as platform failures.
