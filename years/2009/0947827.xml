<AbstractNarration>The latter half of the twentieth century led to a remarkable scientific achievement:  the establishment of the so-called Standard Model of particle physics. As a theory, it incorporates all known particles and forces of nature, excluding gravity. It has been extremely successful in describing known phenomena, but we are prompted to ask whether there is physics beyond the Standard Model.  Are there new forces of nature, or new states of matter, which are important to the universe?  In this project, the PI intends to explore new theories of physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing on interesting phenomenological signals absent in most conventional models. He will study many topics including unexpected signals of the dark sector in terrestrial and cosmological experiments, models which allow wider ranges of flavor violation, connections between neutrino masses and dark matter, and models of dark matter motivated by cosmic ray signals. By exploring what connections could exist between these apparently disparate fields --- dark matter, cosmic rays, neutrino physics, and collider physics --- the PI hopes to gain insights into the possible nature of these diverse unexplored phenomena, and find ways in which terrestrial and cosmological studies can complement one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have two key broader impacts.  First, the PI will maintain a continued effort to participate in summer schools and will compile a regularly updated set of lecture notes on dark matter.  This will provide an important resource for graduate students or interested faculty in a rapidly evolving field.  Second, the PI will continue his very successful outreach effort with the Governor's School West in Salem, North Carolina. This public summer school draws students from across the state, from varied socioeconomic backgrounds, providing an opportunity to promote physics research and careers to interested and talented students, and counsel them on pursuing such a path. This program has been highly successful over the last several years, and offers year- on-year interactions with new groups of students through an established educational setup.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The standard model has been an incredibly successful theory of particle physics, describing every known laboratory phenomenon, except gravity. On the other hand, we have strong evidence that it is incomplete, in that there appears to be six times as much invisible "dark" matter as visible matter in the universe, and, as a quantum field theory, the standard model appears very artificial.  Looking for physics beyond the standard model is then essential to understand what the resolutions of these issues are. However, because dark matter is not luminous, and because high energy colliders are very complicated environments, we need strong theoretical input to have any hope of discovery.  In this project, we have pushed forward on numerous fronts. We can group these into dark matter, collider searches, and connections between the two.  Beginning with dark matter, we focused on underground searches for Dark Matter, and searches for cosmic rays produced by Dark Matter interactions. Underground searches have been very confusing, with multiple conflicting claims from different groups. With P Fox (Fermilab) and a student J Liu (NYU), we pushed a new technique to compare these experiments.

At present, no searches have yielded convincing signs of supersymmetry, or SUSY, but an important question is: should we have expected to have seen any?  In this project, we pushed forward by questioning three assumptions that go into this question: the natural energy scale where SUSY particles should have mass, the presence of dark matter as being a component of SUSY, and questioning whether dark matter, if a SUSY particle, should have features that might complicate searches.  On the mass scale, with Arkani-Hamed and collaborators, we studied scenarios where the masses of the SUSY particles were too high to be present at the LHC. We found that, while some features of these scenarios were artificial, others were quite natural, motivating the search for such particles at yet higher energies.  In questioning whether dark matter is a SUSY particle, with Ruderman and Slatyer, we studied scenarios where the signals of SUSY are smeared out, making it more complicated to find at the LHC, and pointed towards new searches that could find it.  And in the properties of dark matter, with Alves and Liu, we studied whether a simple change in the decays of SUSY particles can make them harder to find. Specifically, we considered whether new particles - "squarks" - if rather than decaying to dark matter and a quark, decayed to _two_ dark matter particles and a quark, whether this would change existing limits. We found, surprisingly, that this simple change would imply that current searches are ineffective. In essence, that new particles could be sitting...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
