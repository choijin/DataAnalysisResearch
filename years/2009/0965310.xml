<AbstractNarration>A central, yet little-researched, contributor to technology's advance and economic growth is "disruptive" technological change, which replaces older technologies and products with newer ones.  Examples include electronic calculators replacing mechanical calculators, smaller hard disk drives replacing larger drives, or new generations of photolithographic aligners for semiconductor manufacture.  Such technology disruption is considered a crucial influence on industries, has been shown to endanger businesses, and is central to the manner in which many new technologies contribute to societal welfare and economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research measures, for the first time, the frequency of disruptive technological change across a broad group of industries.  It also assesses specific processes and impacts of disruption in a sample of industries.  The research analyzes 47 narrowly defined, product-level industries, representative of various types of U.S. manufacturing, from approximately 1900 to 2010.  Jointly analyzed are related industries that fulfilled similar purposes for buyers.  Intensive data collection is necessary to develop longitudinal measures of, in part, business entry and exit, market share, and patented and non-patented technologies.  Data are being collected with the aid of two teams of summer research assistants, painstakingly assembling evidence primarily from library and archival sources.  The frequency of disruptive technological change is being assessed using alternative definitions of disruption, ranging from the replacement of incumbent producers by new entrants to the internal development of new technologies and products by leading incumbent producers.  Specific theories of disruptive technological change are simultaneously being probed in many industries, through in-depth analysis of sources including historical, technological, and trade literatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Knowing the frequency of disruptive technological change is essential to properly understand how technology is advancing the economy, and this frequency is being determined for the first time across many U.S. industries.  Fruitful policy insights may result, since the research improves fundamental understanding of entrepreneurship, corporate policy, and technological change.  Understanding the interactions of entrepreneurs, businesses entering from other industries, and incumbent producers during technological disruptions is key to understanding how policies might enhance economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project analyzed the frequency and nature of disruptive technological changes in U.S. manufacturing industries.  Disruptive technological changes occur when firms use a new technology to take over much or all of an industry's sales from established firms.  Although disruption to established businesses' sales has been a major theme in business strategy and management, preexisting measures of the frequency of disruptive technological change have not been available, and the phenomenon bears further investigation.  Data were assembled to identify the U.S. manufacturers making various products, including the dates when each firm began manufacturing and ceased manufacturing a product.  Information for each product usually begins around 1905, or for new products, from the early years of the product's commercial production.  Data continue until, in most cases, 2006.  A sample of 47 products from prior work was used as a starting point, and data on competing products were also assembled, where feasible given available information sources.  For example, in addition to electric blankets, data were collected on makers of ordinary (non-electric) blankets.  Information on firm size and market share was compiled where feasible, and the history of each firm was corrected for name changes, mergers, and acquisitions.  Information about technological change was also obtained, using a combination of patent data, descriptive information about each industry, and other sources.  Statistical analyses reveal that waves of entry yielding disruption are exceedingly rare within product industries, being more likely to occur with a new product type; a more common pattern involves certain industry incumbents, usually large established firms, taking over from other industry incumbents.  Analysis of technological change processes and impacts indicated reasons why disruptive effects on established manufacturers did not occur in some instances, and in others why disruptive effects occurred in manners that do not always fit with one common story.  Intellectual merit:  Disruptive technological change, often considered the leading issue for appropriate corporate strategy in the context of rapid global competition, has received limited empirical investigation in practice.  No prior metrics of the frequency of disruptive technological change have been available. Most case studies of disruption have received limited investigation, and comparative investigation testing alternative theories of disruption has not been carried out.  This study therefore fills a major gap in knowledge regarding the role of technological change in business competition and the economy.    Broader Impacts:  Businesses and other organizations have relied extensively on commonly-held views and sometimes fads regarding the extent to which they should take preemptive action to address or capitalize on potential disruption, and the balance of attention given to continuous gradual process improvement may have been reduced because of attention to disruptive technologies.  The antidote to possible overemphasis, or to possible misinformation or misleading fads, is solid evidence regarding the frequency and nature of disruptive technological change and other forms of technological change.  Results of the project therefore should be of use in informing appropriate organizational decision-making.  Research experience was supported for five Ph.D. students and fifty-one undergraduate students, mainly during summers and sometimes part-time during academic terms.  Training and mentoring exposed students to research skills and professional development, in addition to project skills acquired through the work.  Student participants had greater gender and racial diversity than their overall university population, aiding diversity aims.
