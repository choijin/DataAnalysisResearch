<AbstractNarration>Gravitational wave physics is on the verge of becoming an observation-driven science thanks to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and its partners.  In addition, numerical relativity has already demonstrated its great potential as a tool of discovery for the strongest sources of gravitational radiation. This award will support an integrated program of research and education built upon these two pillars: gravitational wave observations and numerical relativity.  The research will focus on (1) coupling data analysis methods to gravitational wave source models drawn from numerical relativity simulations, (2) developing the next generation of source simulations that will interpret future events.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this award include two components. (1) Graduate students will be trained to use numerical relativity as an astrophysical tool to prepare them to be leaders in the new field of gravitational wave astronomy. (2) The PI will collaborate with the LIGO Livingston Laboratory and Professor Brigg Ullmer of Louisiana State University to use video from numerical relativity simulations in an interactive kiosk designed by Dr. Ullmer.  The kiosks allow for a hands-on approach to learning about gravitational waves and are planned to be located in Louisiana and Atlanta.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On September 14, 2015 the first gravitational wave was detected by the LIGO observatories.   The gravitational wave was emitted by two black holes as they spiraled toward each other and collided, forming a single black hole.  The research of this NSF CAREER grant helped to make the interpretation of that event as a black-hole binary possible as its intellectual merit.  In addition, this grant brought the excitement of gravitational waves and black holes into the classroom and out into the public as its broader impact.     This award supported the publication of over twenty papers covering topics focused on solving the complicated set of equations known as Einstein?s equations that predict both the dynamics of the black-hole binaries and their gravitational waves.  Starting in 2010, this grant funded research and people to conduct that research focused on how the physical characteristics of black-hole binaries as they merge is  imprinted on the emitted gravitational waves and how that information may be decoded upon arrival at the LIGO detectors. The results  demonstrated how the precessional effects, basically the tilting and whirling of the binary plane and black hole spins, imprints on the waveforms in multiple harmonics.   It was demonstrated how important it will be to take these features into account to maximize the information decoded from the detected waveform about the originating binary.    The grant also supported work toward understanding the nonlinearity of gravity.  General relativity tells us that a perturbed black hole "rings down" like a bell, e.g. admits radiation that is exponentially damped.  This radiation is correlated to the physical parameters of the black hole and is a hallmark of general relativity.  A deviation from that correlation would indicate a disagreement with general relativity.  The merger perturbs the final black hole and all the harmonics that are excited because of that event contributes to the ringing down.  A further correlation between the harmonics during ringdown and the peak in the gravitational wave that occurs at merger was found and reported.    One of the most important products of this grant was the creation and release of a catalog of numerical relativity waveforms of black-hole binaries. The catalog was released to the public on a website (http://einstein.gatech.edu/catalog) and has been contributed to  LIGO Scientific Collaboration?s waveform annex or its use.  Over the lifetime of this grant, hundreds of unique waveforms that cover a wide range of physical parameters of the black hole were produced.  These waveforms are used to tune models of the merging binaries used in the detection and interpretation of gravitational wave events, in predicting key astrophysics quantities that result from such a merger like gravitational recoil, final masses and spins of the black hole, and to understand the strong-field regime of general relativity.    The work has been disseminated to the physics community through several invited talks,  including plenary talks, colloquium and seminars.   This award supported a range of activities for broader impact including an Atlanta Science Festival Event and an Atlanta Science Tavern Event on black holes and gravitational waves.  These events are for children and the general public in the greater Atlanta area. In addition, the PI has presented several public lectures and been featured in the September issue of Atlanta magazine that highlighted the work women are doing in gravitational physics.
