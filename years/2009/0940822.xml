<AbstractNarration>Since the 1970s, climate scientists have developed increasingly sophisticated models of the world climate system. These models are converging on predictions about climate changes that are likely to occur in coming decades. Such changes are certain to provoke human responses and many commentators have suggested what those responses are likely to be in particular parts of the world. Nevertheless, human populations are complex systems in which changes in one part of the system can have significant consequences for other, perhaps quite remote, parts of the system - meaning that human responses to climate change must also be studied as processes in a complex system involving, potentially at least, all human societies. To date, however, the social sciences have not produced models of large scale human population systems that integrate predictions from climate models. One reason for this neglect may be that such work requires knowledge not only of the basic principles of human behavior and the techniques for modeling it, but also of (1) current climate models; (2) geographic information systems (GIS) which provide a means for organizing geographic data worldwide, including human population data; (3) statistical techniques for analyzing the large amounts of data produced from population simulations; and (4) actual human responses to climate changes both in the recent past (e.g., Darfur) and in the more remote past (e.g., ancient Maya). Accordingly, the present project includes two political scientists with background in behavioral modeling; a climatologist who has worked extensively on climate modeling; an expert in geographic information systems; an expert in applied mathematics and statistics; and an archaeologist. Initial steps toward the behavioral model will be tested against known cases of climate change in the recent past (e.g. Darfur) and the more remote past (e.g., the Mayan collapse). To the extent predictions from the developing model do not match known human responses in such cases, its parameters will be adjusted - and, subsequently, tested against further such cases.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archaeological evidence shows that climate change has undermined many civilizations in the past but also that the climate changes per se were often less damaging than the human responses to those changes - including mass migration and armed conflict. In the interdependent modern world, human responses to climate changes have the potential to ripple well beyond an immediately affected area, and responses to such changes in different and perhaps quite remote areas might interact in negative ways. Thus, well developed models of likely human responses to expected climate changes - including abrupt changes - will allow policy makers to anticipate not only local consequences of local climate changes, but also geographically perhaps quite remote consequences. The project takes initial steps toward more fully developed models of human responses to climate change, just as early climate models can now be seen as initial steps toward the more fully developed climate models that presently exist.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists, political scientists, geographers, archeologists and statisticians. Our primary goal is to understand and model social vulnerability to future climate changes as well as humans&rsquo; responses to climate impacts in the past, present, and the future under different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs) consistent with the most recent Assessment Report #5 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The primary climate impacts that we model are extreme droughts, precipitation floods and heat stress. The primary social consequences of climate variability that we analyze include exposure, human mortality and mass migration. Empirical analysis of climate impacts is based on the 1950-2014 period while the future projections of those impacts cover the rest of the 21st century. Finally, the archaeological portion of the project uses various analytical methods and interdisciplinary datasets to understand the effects of climate change on Maya political organization and demography.</p> <p>Using a large set of contemporary climate models, we generated data describing national populations&rsquo; historical and future exposure to extreme drought, precipitation flooding, and heat stress. For some impacts such as droughts and floods, we conducted historical analysis and established a relationship between the climate variables and the number of people killed or displaced by the impact in question.</p> <p>One of our major findings, published in a peer-reviewed journal, predicts that future population exposure to extreme droughts will be primarily determined by climate change and not by population growth. The finding is important because according to the most recent IPCC report, population growth is generally expected to be the main reason behind future water scarcity.</p> <p>Another finding is our projection of a substantial increase in the number of environmental migrants in the 21st century under the high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5). We also predict a dramatic increase in what we call "failed migrants" &ndash; people who are motivated to migrate but are unable to do so because their prospective destinations are also affected by destructive climate impacts. This is a novel finding since the concept of failed migrants has not been systematically discussed in the academic literature or, as yet, in the IPCC reports.</p> <p>We also found that leaders of democratic countries are significantly less likely to lose power following major flooding events than leaders of authoritarian countries. Moreover, the role of such political structures appears greater in this respect than is the role of economic development.</p> <p>Our archeological findings demonstrate that drought had major effects on maize agriculture during historic (Mayan) times&mdash;an effect with severe consequences for population health. Although evidence for the effects of drought on agricultural production are difficult to demonstrate archaeologically, these historic data point to the complex relationships to be expected between climate, subsistence, and demographics in general.</p> <p>Our findings about adaptation to climate change have significant implications for climate change mitigation policies. For example, climate change mitigation is usually modeled as a commons game in which nations can pay a cost toward the worldwide public good of reduced carbon emissions. But nations differ substantially in their current emissions, with the contribution possible from their restraint differing accordingly, and also in the damage they may experience from ongoing such emissions. In our work, we quantify vulnerability of the world&rsquo;s separate nations to anthropogenic drought through the remainder of the 21st century. Our analysis shows that the high-emitting nations are among those least likely to be affected by such droughts through that period. We argue that this reality is better captured by the n-player dictator game in which the major emitters play the &ldquo;dictatorial&rdquo; role and the other nations play the &ldquo;dependent&rdquo; role&mdash;with the latters&rsquo; restraint making little difference to themselves or to the world.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/29/2016<br>      Modified by: Oleg&nbsp;Smirnov</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0940822/0940822_10017175_1483026871184_Figure2GlobalMigration--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0940822/0940822_10017175_1483026871184_Figure2GlobalMigration--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Global migration in response to drought"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0940822/0940822_10017175_1483026871184_Figure2GlobalMigration--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Global migration in response to drought"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In the box-and-whisker plots (panels a and c), the "hinges"?separated by the median?correspond to the first and third quartiles; the ?whiskers? extend from the hinges to the highest value that is within 1.5 times the interquartile range; cases beyond the end of the whiskers are outliers.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Oleg Smirnov</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Oleg&nbsp;Smirnov</div> <div class="imageTitle">Global migration in response to drought</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0940822/0940822_10017175_1483026362302_figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0940822/0940822_10017175_1483026362302_figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Average monthly population exposed to extreme meteorological drought under RCP 8.5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0940822/0940822_10017175_1483026362302_figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Average monthly population exposed to extreme meteorological drought under RCP 8.5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The results are based on the mean values from the ensemble of 16 CMIP5 climate models.
