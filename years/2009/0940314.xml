<AbstractNarration>Jones, DMS-0940363&lt;br/&gt;Camp, DMS-0940267&lt;br/&gt;Danforth, DMS-0940271&lt;br/&gt;Fung, DMS-0940272&lt;br/&gt;Golden, DMS-0940249&lt;br/&gt;Holland, DMS-0940241&lt;br/&gt;Kostelich, DMS-0940314&lt;br/&gt;McGehee, DMS-0940366&lt;br/&gt;Pierrehumbert, DMS-0940261&lt;br/&gt;Silber, DMS-0940262&lt;br/&gt;Tung, DMS-0940342&lt;br/&gt;Zeeman, DMS-0940243&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigators form a "Mathematics and Climate Research&lt;br/&gt;Network."  This is a framework for an intensive effort aimed at&lt;br/&gt;bringing to bear the full power of modern applied mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;statistics on the prediction and understanding of the Earth's&lt;br/&gt;climate.  The investigators focus on three key themes: (1)&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics of Climate, (2) Climate Process Modeling, and (3) Data&lt;br/&gt;Analysis and Data Assimilation.  Dynamics of Climate addresses&lt;br/&gt;critical climate processes and their interactions.  Climate&lt;br/&gt;Process Modeling undertakes the modeling of climate components&lt;br/&gt;that have been underrepresented in extant climate models, such as&lt;br/&gt;the multi-scale material structure of sea ice.  Data Analysis and&lt;br/&gt;Data Assimilation develops mathematical tools for analyzing&lt;br/&gt;climate data and assimilating them in current climate models. &lt;br/&gt;The Research Network aims to be a national resource, with&lt;br/&gt;participants at thirteen U.S. universities.  The investigators&lt;br/&gt;work together as a virtual community that holds regular weekly&lt;br/&gt;"webinars" and working meetings over the Internet.  This&lt;br/&gt;multi-year effort is expected to help in defining a research area&lt;br/&gt;of "climate mathematics" and in educating a new generation of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical researchers to meet the scientific challenges&lt;br/&gt;associated with a changing climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This project is driven by the need to better understand the&lt;br/&gt;Earth's climate system.  Climate is the result of many&lt;br/&gt;geophysical and chemical processes in the Earth's atmosphere,&lt;br/&gt;oceans and biosphere.  These processes evolve in time over many&lt;br/&gt;scales, ranging from minutes to centuries, and interact in&lt;br/&gt;multiple ways, most often nonlinearly.  Feedback mechanisms, many&lt;br/&gt;of which are poorly understood, further complicate the picture. &lt;br/&gt;Because there is only one Earth, climate cannot be studied by&lt;br/&gt;systematic experimentation; the only approach available to&lt;br/&gt;climate researchers is through computational experiments.  These&lt;br/&gt;experiments are based on mathematical models, which must be&lt;br/&gt;simple enough not to exceed the capabilities of today's advanced&lt;br/&gt;computer architectures, while still incorporating the physical&lt;br/&gt;and chemical processes that are essential for realistic climate&lt;br/&gt;outcomes.  The expertise of mathematical scientists in designing,&lt;br/&gt;assessing and interpreting these models is critical.  This&lt;br/&gt;"Mathematics and Climate Research Network" helps engage the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences community to address the mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;statistical issues of our changing climate.  The Research Network&lt;br/&gt;takes full advantage of current information technology;&lt;br/&gt;communication and collaboration among the participants takes&lt;br/&gt;place mostly remotely over the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  Data assimilation (DA) refers to a family of mathematical methods for inferring the state of a complex dynamical system from the output of an imperfect computer model and a collection of sparse, noisy measurements.  DA is an essential component of weather forecasting, because the atmosphere cannot be sampled everywhere, and uncertainties in the state of the atmosphere rapidly grow with time in a forecast model.  One of our main accomplishments has been to implement a data assimilation system using an operational model of the Earth's ionosphere, and we tested it using data from during a geomagnetic storm in September 2011.  Another family of problems that we investigated is the question of targeted observations.  Most people are familiar with "hurricane hunter" aircraft that are flown into potentially landfalling storms to acquire detailed observations to improve predictions of their path and strength.  Now imagine a more general scenario: if you could fly such an aircraft anywhere, where and when would you do so and what would you measure to improve the forecast?  The general idea is that it costs money to make additional measurements, and resources are limited.  We looked at this question from a mathematical point of view for certain idealized models and in the specific case of an operational model of the Earth's ionosphere.    Broader impacts:  Geomagnetic storms, which arise when the Earth is bombarded by particularly large bursts of charged particles from the Sun, alter the Earth's magnetic field and a layer of very thin air and free electrons, called the ionosphere, that is located approximately 80 to 800 km above the Earth's surface.  These disturbances can induce spurious electric currents in power grids, potentially causing blackouts, and ithey can interfere with the operation of satellites.  Our research is intended to improve 1-hour forecasts of the state of the ionosphere; such improvements may, for example, provide additional lead time to electric grid operators to take defensive measures during geomagnetic storms.  This project supported a postdoctoral researcher and a doctoral student in applied mathematics.  Three refereed journal articles have been published and a fourth is in preparation.                              Last Modified: 12/30/2016       Submitted by: Eric Kostelich]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
