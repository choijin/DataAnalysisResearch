<AbstractNarration>The state of Alabama enjoys the distinction of being one of the most biologically diverse regions of the country.  Documenting this often overlooked and imperiled natural heritage is the priority of the Auburn University Natural History Museum.  Although natural history collections are in decline nationwide, Auburn University has made a strong commitment to collections-based research, education and public outreach.  This award will fund improvements to the plant, invertebrate, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal collections in concert with their relocation to a new, central campus museum building. Upgraded cabinetry and shelving will allow efficient use of the new space, ensure preservation of valuable specimens and improve access to specimens by researchers, students and the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide numerous opportunities for the inclusion of undergraduate and graduate students in collections-based activities as part of their academic experience.  Several students will participate as paid support personnel and receive on the job training to become the next generation of curators and collections managers.  This award will facilitate integration of the collections into several popular and effective public education programs, including K-12 mini courses, museum tours, and workshops that heighten public interest in and emphasize the importance of Alabama's natural heritage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The state of Alabama enjoys the distinction of being one of the most biologically diverse regions of the country.  Documenting and studying this often overlooked and imperiled natural heritage and creating opportunities for the public to explore this biodiversity are the priorities of the Auburn University Natural History Museum.  In 2013, Auburn University completed construction of a new 15,000 square foot building, the Biodiversity Learning Center (BLC), that now houses the museumÆs extensive collection of plant and animal specimens under one roof for the first time.  NSF funding was used to purchase new cabinetry, shelving, specimen containers and other curation tools for the fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, mammal, plant and invertebrate collections. These will ensure long-term preservation of valuable specimens and accommodate future growth of the museum. Also by allowing much more efficient use of the new museum space, the NSF funds have significantly improved access to specimens by researchers, students and the public.       The NSF award provided numerous opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in collections-based activities as part of their academic experience.  Over the course of the project, several dozen students worked in the collections as both paid support personnel and as student researchers.  In addition to learning about the diversity they were trained in all aspects of collection management including databasing, specimen preparation and curation.  Students were offered a two-semester course in museum sciences that covered conceptual and practical aspects of biodiversity collections management.  The course included participation in the actual packing, moving, unpacking, reorganizing and curation of each of the collections.       NSF funds were also used to enhance research activities surrounding the collections including the development of a tissue library that enables researchers at other institutions to borrow cryogenically preserved material or even DNA for study. Access to specimen data resources were also improved with new database server equipment and the development of a unified specimen database system for all collections.  The award has already greatly facilitated  integration of the collections into several popular and effective public education programs, including K&ndash;12 mini courses, museum tours, open-houses and workshops that heighten public interest in and emphasize the importance of AlabamaÆs natural heritage.
