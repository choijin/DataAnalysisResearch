<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  This project upgrades the undergraduate experience in the radio astronomy laboratory through the creation of learning materials and teaching strategies and development of faculty expertise. Specifically, it introduces new digital technologies and programming techniques into the curriculum along with a visit to a working radio astronomy observatory (the Allen Telescope Array) that features many of the technologies and principles that the students study in the class. These innovations serve to give a complete  picture of the role of signal processing techniques that range from existing lab components in theory, bench experiment, and programming in general purpose computers to include the cutting edge digital technology of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Applications in radio astronomy research as well as telecommunications are emphasized through the course.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enhancements also couple with the scientific emphases of the class. The new technology supports the use of a small dish for mapping large areas of the galactic plane for study of spiral arm structure and demonstration of the existence of dark matter. New experiments include topics such as the study of hydroxyl masers and detection of pulsars.  The instructional materials are being made available to other institutions, many of which use small radio telescopes that can be coupled with the digital technology and curriculum developed in this project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improvements in the laboratory are intended to achieve the following goals: 1) modernize facilities to enable experiments that probe a wider range of astrophysics and technical issues; 2) create enthusiasm in students through use of cutting edge technology; 3) strengthen the link between teaching and research; 4) increase the engagement of women and minorities with radio astronomy; and 5) prepare students for broad range of careers. Expected outcomes for students with success of the project include: 1) a deeper understanding of the links between signal processing theory and implementation in real-world devices, including telescopes and telecommunication systems; 2) increasing the number of women taking the radio astronomy labs, leading to greater number of women finding careers in radio astronomy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The project is broadening the opportunities for undergraduate students in radio astronomy.  In addition, an important goal of the project is to increase the number of women and minorities with an engagement and education in radio astronomy. As one of the leading institutions in the field of radio astronomy, Berkeley has a unique opportunity to have a national impact through undergraduate education. The use of undergraduate TAs in the lab is an important tool for creating the next generation of teachers and scientists.</AbstractNarration>

The attached Figure shows the interferometric measurements of a 8-hour track on the Sun; it embodies much of the course academic content, including digital sampling, Fourier transforms, least-squares fitting, radio astronomical fundamentals, and data presentation.  Expected outcomes for students were: (1) develop a deeper understanding of the links between signal processing theory and implementation in real-world devices, including telescopes and telecommunication systems; (2) increase the number of women taking the Radio Astronomy and Optical/Infrared labs, leading to a greater number of women finding careers in radio astronomy and in the country's general technical workforce.  An external evaluation of the course, performed in the last year of the grant period, showed that course is very successful in providing and teaching the students technology-related skills; and that this success applies to both female and male students.
