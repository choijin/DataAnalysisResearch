    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research award to Arizona State University will undertake an experiment to evaluate active learning techniques and how such knowledge can be utilized to develop more effective classroom teaching for materials engineering and nanotechnology courses. The work is novel because the investigator will use a much more refined and precise framework for characterizing the crucial aspects of active learning. This will allow development of much more effective instructional materials. The results will also be presented at technical conferences and published in professional journals. The goal is to better prepare students for the practice of engineering through involvement in real life engineering problems. These techniques are expected to increase students' interest in engineering, and in subsequent years use of these techniques will enhance the number of students who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs.</AbstractNarration>
