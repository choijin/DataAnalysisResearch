<AbstractNarration>Skeletal variation results from both genetic and non-genetic factors. Some of the non-genetic factors that have been, and continue to be studied include mechanical loading, diet and aging. However, factors that influence early skeletal development, especially prenatally, have not received much attention. This project investigates maternal stress during pregnancy as a nongenetic factor that may affect fetal bone formation and growth, and later lead to skeletal variation observed in adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study hypothesizes that induced stress during pregnancy has a significant and negative impact on the skeletal development of offspring, even though the offspring?s environment is stress-free. For a controlled test, pregnant rats will be subjected to immobilization stress at various times during gestation. The offspring will be sacrificed at specific stages of post-natal development. Measurements of bone quality will be taken from femoral histological sections to test for differences between the offspring from stressed and un-stressed mothers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates an understudied non-genetic factor that can impact prenatal skeletal development, maternal stress. This stage in skeletal development is critical because any structural or biochemical compromise may be irreversible. The model organism, the rat, is commonly used in bone developmental research. Therefore, results from this research will be readily comparable to other studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This project will help to clarify some of the non-genetic factors that influence bone quality and microstructure. Given the potentially significant impact that prenatal stress can have on skeletal phenotypes, and that rats are an established model, implications from this research are of broad scientific and social relevance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This research is the doctoral dissertation project of an African woman from Kenya. She is the first in her family to attend college. This project will promote international science training and the education of a woman from an underrepresented group. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
