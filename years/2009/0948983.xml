<AbstractNarration>The rapid growth of urban concentrations poses major challenges to local and global ecosystems and tests the very limits of governance.  New urban growth can reduce and fragment nonhuman habitats, introduce exotic organisms, and severely modify energy flow and nutrient cycles, while urban development severely affects hydrological cycles and air quality, reducing the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance.  These challenges will require that planners, program designers, and environmental managers keep pace with the concomitant spatial, political, and economic transformations while reducing the adverse ecological impact of urban developments.  In the face of these challenges, new forms of complex social, political and economic decision making systems are evolving.  This interdisciplinary research project is designed to improve understanding of resilience in urban socioecological systems, with the over-arching question: How do human governance and biophysical systems respond interactively to both press and pulse disturbances in urban socio-ecological systems?  The investigators will focus on Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, two cities in a single metropolitan area that have developed over the last 30 years under contrasting policy regimes at the state, regional, and local levels.  The investigators will pursue three major research questions:  (1) How do differences in local and state levels of governance and policy affect the resilience of both social and ecological landscapes?  (2) How do alternative land-use planning strategies affect provision of ecosystem services in response to different disturbance factors?  (3) How effectively do the processes and outcomes of monitoring ecosystem services provide a usable feedback loop in urban socioecological systems?  Their research design will consist of four focused research projects and two project-wide unifying activities.  The first research project will examine governance effects on the spatial pattern and timing of development at the regional scale.  The second project will examine relationships among disturbances resulting from development and urban water quality.  The third project will focus on riparian vegetation changes, and the fourth project will focus on green infrastructure, with both examining the exchange and use of information and interactions among social actors at the city and neighborhood scales.  The two cross-cutting activities will complement the research projects by focusing on how urban residents perceive and manage urban ecosystem resources.  The first activity will examine civic ecology and information for decision making.  The investigators will apply a common framework to all four research projects to study how ecological information feeds back into societal decision making.  The second activity will engage secondary school teachers and their students in the Portland-Vancouver region in urban environmental restoration and research projects.  The project will create and support networks of teachers, youth, and organizations conducting ecological research and will develop and test meaningful measures of how teacher and youth involvement in ecological projects contributes to urban resilience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project includes micro-level and meso-level foci on the connections among human perceptions, citizen engagement, and ecosystem services in developing urban resilience, which should lead to insights about how human systems adapt to disturbance.  The study area, a metropolitan region containing cities with contrasting governance systems and starkly different land-use policies, is well suited for analysis and comparison of complex interactions between social and ecological systems.  Portland's "sustainability mystique" will be scrutinized and assessed both socioeconomically and ecologically.  Inclusion of external forces of population growth and climate change while simultaneously examining internal community adaptations will help identify unanticipated feedback loops or failures.  The broader impacts of this project will include creation of a network of learners in urban areas that cross jurisdictional, disciplinary, institutional, and geographic boundaries.  Research findings will be put in place experimentally and institutionally by cities and metropolitan agencies interested in building on the synergies found in integrative approaches to management.  These results should help break down past divisions between socioeconomic and ecological thinking and help improve understanding and application of factors controlling how human governance affects socioecological resilience in urban areas.  This award was funded as an Urban Long-Term Research Area Exploratory (ULTRA-Ex) award as the result of a special competition jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our Urban Long Term Research Areas &ndash; Exploratory (ULTRA-Ex) project, funded from September 2010 through February 2016, examined the role of governance for a pair of cities, Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington, which have developed over the past several decades under contrasting policy regimes at the state, regional, and local levels.  We sought to find how differences in local and state levels of governance and policy affect the resilience of both social and ecological landscapes, and how monitoring ecosystem services may provide a usable feedback loop in urban socio-ecological systems.  We investigated multiple pathways through which human actions, governance systems, and the built and social infrastructure affect ecosystem services provided by landscape vegetation pattern and regional water quality.  A key aspect of our study was a focus on social, ecological and hydrological benefits of urban flood plain restoration.  Initially a primary focus was on the comparison between Portland, OR and Vancouver, WA; in the latter phases of the project, however, we began to focus on the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area as a whole, particularly regarding aspects of climate change on flood risk management in urban streams and watersheds, and how that management might be geared toward both mitigating hydrologic impacts as well as providing ecological and social benefits.   In addition to the primary award, we received a supplemental award to examine the aspect of vulnerability of water resources to climate change, spanning both biophysical and social aspects.  We also received other associated funding from EPSRC (in the UK), as well as grants from Portland State University, Oregon State University, Pomona College, and Reed College, to conduct collaborative research on socio-ecological dynamics of urban flood risk management.   Collectively, our project generated 31 publications (with several more in preparation or review), which included 21 peer-reviewed journal articles, two peer-reviewed conference proceedings papers, seven book chapters and one book.  We formally presented our 63 times, including national and international conferences as well as local symposia and invited seminars.  During the project 13 graduate students were funded either as graduate research assistants and/or to travel to foreign countries (the U.K., China) to present work and participate in workshops.  Additionally, four undergraduate students from Reed College and Pomona College conducted research work as part of the ULTRA-Ex project.  The collaboration resulted in an international partnership with Nottingham University in the UK as well as several associated universities in a newly funded Blue-Green Cities project by the EPSRC and the University of Nottingham Ningbo China.  Regarding the intellectual merit of our outcomes, for greenspace management and floodplain restoration, the rates of riparian area losses that we observed in the 1990s due to development pressure were reversed during the early 2000s as extensive riparian restoration efforts began to outpace losses.  In our studies specific to Johnson Creek, an undammed 26 mile long stream in southeast Portland, hydrologic and sediment modelling suggests that extensive restoration efforts have succeeded in reducing flooding potential and in creating increased sediment storage capacity in the lower floodplain of Johnson Creek.  We have found that heavy metal accumulations have not reached toxic levels in bioswale soils throughout Portland.  Bioswales were also found to retain metals effectively during storms, and were shown to reduce metal loadings in outfalls to streams.  In-stream biotic, chemical and geomorphic analyses showed that the implementation of riparian setbacks have generated a passive stormwater treatment measure to reduce the level of pollutants entering Johnson Creek from the surrounding urban land use areas. Hedonic analyses show that water quality is correlated with property values in residential areas. An extensive mailed survey (n&gt;1200 returned survey forms) showed that while Portland and Vancouver residents held many common beliefs about environmental amenities, there were significant differences in perception of the value of greenspace between the two cities.  K-12 children benefited from outdoor educational experiences regardless of city location.  Our findings further suggested that while green infrastructure strategies such as bioswales provide environmental benefits, perceptions and expressions of their value by local citizens is mixed. We?ve also found that institutional stakeholders in the City of Portland face a number of both political and environmental uncertainties that may hamper their efforts to make urban streams more resilient. Additionally, our researchers are evaluating the multiple benefits created by restoration activities in Portland watersheds by developing GIS tools capable of overlaying a range of biophysical benefit layers to illustrate the benefit profile, intensity and dependency.   Overall, the broader impacts of our project demonstrated that while significant barriers yet exist in terms of institutional implementation and residential perception of value, the efforts of institutions and citizens in the Portland-Vancouver metro region over the past two decades have succeeded in creating a more resilient urban ecosystem that has reclaimed a significant amount of vital greenspace, is providing better water quality in streams, and is now less prone to flooding.
