<AbstractNarration>Recent advances in the direct computation of Lyapunov functions using convex optimization make it possible to efficiently evaluate local regions of stability for smooth nonlinear systems.   These tools can be combined with randomized motion planning algorithms to obtain new feedback motion planning algorithms which probabilistically cover a bounded reachable state-space with verified regions of stability; efficiently constructing a global feedback controller out of many locally valid controllers. If successful, the proposed work will generate a class of algorithms capable of computing covering feedback policies for nonlinear systems with dimensionality beyond that of dynamic programming.  In addition, the algorithms operate directly on the continuous state and action spaces, and thus are not subject to the pitfalls of discretization.  By considering feedback during the planning process, the resulting plans are robust to disturbances and quite suitable for implementation on real robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through both theoretical and experimental validation of these algorithms, this work aims to have broad impact on the experimental control of nonlinear and underactuated systems, including walking robots, aerial vehicles, and robots which grasp and manipulate the environment.  The algorithms and robotic experiments will be integrated in the PI's graduate robotics curriculum and outreach activities, and the algorithms will be disseminated through a software distribution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work done under this award has been the most influential work on  my career to date.  The specific algorithmic results have, in my view,  substantially increased the class of nonlinear systems for which we can  design sufficiently good nonlinear feedback controllers equipped with  robustness guarantees.    The  first outcome of the project was the "LQR-Trees" algorithm -- an  approach for combining local sums-of-squares certificates of  stability/robustness for nonlinear systems with motion planning to build  a library of formally verified controllers which could 'fill the  space'.  From this launching point, we went on to enlarge the class of  systems for which sums-of-squares could be applied, overcoming numerical  hurdles and designing algorithms for:  - autonomous hybrid systems (with discrete/continuous dynamics)  - systems w/ limit cycles, and hybrid limit cycles  - an important class of trigonemetric + polynomial systems  - rigid-body (frictional) contact  In  additional to deterministic stabilty analysis, we've investigated both  worst-cast robustness-analysis (via common Lyapunov functions) and  stochastic analysis (via super-martingales).  We've taken big strides in  addressing the dimensionality and (polynomial) degree of the system on  which these techniques can be applied, and we've demonstrated them on  serious real-world systems:  - acrobots and cart-poles  - a perching airplane  - a fixed-wing UAV flying at high speeds and darting through dense obstacles  We have even addressed algorithmic issues for planning with real-time constraints using precomputed verified 'funnels'.   Our results have won best paper awards at the top robotics and controls conferences, include ICRA and HSCC.  Finally,  we've made code containing serious implementations for nearly all of  the algoritms available as open-source at http://drake.mit.edu .
