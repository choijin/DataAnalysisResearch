<AbstractNarration>These investigators, along with graduate and undergraduate students, are installing 83 broadband seismic stations from the EarthScope Flexible Array pool to explore the deep structure of the Mid-Continent Rift System (MCRS). The MCRS is the fossil remnant of an extensive rifting event that failed to split North America during the Middle-Proterozoic era. This event left a large volume of dense basalts and associated strong geophysical anomalies. By imaging the deep structure beneath the rift, this seismic experiment investigates how such rifts form and then die, rather than developing into oceanic spreading centers. The seismic stations are located around, across, and along the failed rift, from the Minnesota-Iowa border into Canada by Lake Superior. Imaging the deep seismic structure of a central part of the MCRS will be undertaken with receiver function migration, ambient noise analysis, teleseismic surface wave dispersion analysis, regional S- and surface wave-train fitting, teleseismic arrival time tomography, re-analysis of existing seismic reflection &amp; refraction data, and SKS-splitting analysis. These analyses are combined into a multi-resolution, three-dimensional image of the isotropic and anisotropic structure of the crust and mantle beneath the MCRS and its surroundings. Results of these analyses will illuminate the role of the mantle in the rifting process and its initiation and cessation. The results will also enhance our understanding of mid-continental earthquakes. This research project employs at least three graduate students, also involves undergraduate students, and fosters collaboration between researchers from Canada and the USA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Seismic stations of the Superior Province Rifting Earthscope Experiment (SPREE) recorded seismic waves from distant earthquakes for two and a half years.  Thanks to generous landowners, holes were dug and SPREE stations were installed in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Ontario. These states meet along and around a prominent, one billion year-old structure related to the Mid-continent Rift.  The Mid-continent Rift is distinguished by voluminous one billion year-old lava flows.  Seismic wave energy from more than one hundred earthquakes was scattered by layer boundaries in the Mid-continent?s Rift?s crust in ways that were perceived and recorded by the SPREE stations. Our analysis of these scattered waves reveals that the younger sedimentary rocks that cover the old lava flows are up to 3 km thick but that the central lava flows are less deeply buried than the flows? flanks. These differences in burial depth of the dense volcanic rocks locally changes the Earth?s acceleration of gravity by minute but measurable amounts that constitute one of the most prominent "gravity anomalies" in North America. The most striking revelation of our SPREE data analysis is that deep beneath the Rift?s central lava flows there is a second, "underplated" layer of igneous (volcanic) rocks, at the bottom of the Rift?s continental crust. Along-Rift variations in the depth of this inferred underplated material and other rift structures, such as the sedimentary rocks, suggest that some central segments of the Mid-continent Rift were tectonically pushed upwards after rifting, while other segments were not.
