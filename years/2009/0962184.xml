<AbstractNarration>This project addresses important topics concerning ocean productivity in the equatorial Pacific (EP), atmospheric paleo-CO2 and the global carbon cycle over the past 26 Ma period as inferred from paleontological and geochemical analyses of sediment cores collected from the IODP PEAT expedition, leg 320. This expedition was highly successful at retrieving the first complete Cenozoic record from the equator. Although a highly productive region, the high nutrient load of the EP makes it an inefficient ecosystem, thus making it susceptible to rapid changes in cycling rates and serving an important role in ocean biogeochemical cycles. Major changes in biogenic sedimentation in the EP throughout the Cenozoic is believed to reflect past changes in this cycling and in productivity. Sedimentary diatom assemblages will be analyzed from cores of leg 320 as indicators of productivity, bio-Ba and bio-Si will be used as indicators of export production, and organic carbon and CaCO3 measurements will be made to understand the past changes in carbon cycling. This comprehensive multi-proxy approach and micropaleontological analyses will increase our understanding of paleoproductivity, carbon export and burial, and biogeochemical cycling in the equatorial regions during the middle to late Miocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Atmospheric CO2 levels are strongly regulated by ocean productivity. Understanding past changes in ocean productivity during warm earth conditions from analysis of the sedimentary record provides insights into natural variations of paleo-atmospheric CO2 levels and the biogeochemical influences of this. This study will provide fundamental information for better understanding global climate. The project provides financial assistance for undergraduate students and will support and train a graduate student. The project takes good advantage of a large investment previously made in an IODP expedition and strengthens international collaborations within the IODP community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Carbon dioxide, released via earth processes or by humans, eventually is sequestered in the oceans and changes ocean carbon chemistry. Drops in pH by added CO2 are eventually balanced by dissolution of plankton shells made of biogenic CaCO3 deposited on the sea floor.     The equatorial Pacific is a major locus of the global carbon cycle because plankton produce about 40% of global CaCO3 there and sediment it to the bottom, The region is also responsible for about 30% of ocean primary productivity, which fixes atmospheric CO2. The amount of CaCO3 buried in sediments depends upon the production of biogenic CaCO3 by plankton in response to fertilization by upwelled nutrients and CaCO3 dissolution at the sea floor to balance the carbon cycle.  The amount of change in upwelling, primary productivity, and deep-sea dissolution are poorly known over the Neogene (23-0 million years ago, Ma), but are important to understand how EarthÆs carbon cycle changes, especially under warm climate conditions.     Over the grant, we produced continuous records from 4 new sediment sections collected from the equatorial Pacific by Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 320/321. Bulk sediment chemistry was measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning at 1000-2000 year spacing and a reconnaissance study of related changes in the diatom community (plankton associated with upwelling) was undertaken at one site. These are the first high-resolution data that span from the early Miocene to the present (~20 Ma to 0 Ma).

Diatom assemblages have responses to both high production intervals and to long-term change.     The rapid onset of the intervals and their irregular spacing suggest thresholds (ætipping pointsÆ) in equatorial Pacific primary productivity associated with warm Miocene conditions. We tentatively link the productivity changes to changes in nutrient transport from the Antarctic or perhaps easier nutrient exchange between the surface and deep ocean nutrient reservoirs because of smaller density gradients. Higher winds alone could not pump sufficient nutrients into surface waters, so higher productivity must instead result from better links to nutrient rich sources.     Normally, high productivity should cause more carbon sequestration in the deep ocean and lower atmospheric CO2 (referred to as the biological carbon pump). Our data pro...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
