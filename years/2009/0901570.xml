<AbstractNarration>Berest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research lies at the intersection of several areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and mathematical physics, including geometric analysis,&lt;br/&gt;representation theory, noncommutative algebra and algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;It is motivated by old (yet unsolved) problems in the theory of partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations. One such problem (known as the problem of lacunas)&lt;br/&gt;deals with propagation of waves without diffusion, another with heat&lt;br/&gt;kernels on Riemannian manifolds with finite asymptotics. Despite being&lt;br/&gt;analytic by their nature, these problems exhibit a remarkable feature:&lt;br/&gt;they have algebraic solutions. The earlier work of the PI and his&lt;br/&gt;collaborators links these classical problems of analysis to various&lt;br/&gt;questions of algebraic geometry and noncommutative algebra, concerning&lt;br/&gt;rings of differential operators on algebraic varieties and their specific&lt;br/&gt;representations (projective D-modules). One of the primary goals of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal is to systematically study the properties of such modules, their&lt;br/&gt;endomorphism rings and moduli spaces. The results obtained so far (mostly&lt;br/&gt;in the case of curves) reveal many interesting connections with &lt;br/&gt;noncommutative geometry, representation theory, combinatorics and &lt;br/&gt;integrable systems. Another goal of the proposal is thus to investigate &lt;br/&gt;some of these connections. In a different direction, the PI intends to &lt;br/&gt;develop a new method for computing asymptotics of heat kernels based on&lt;br/&gt;ideas of homotopical algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical problems addressed in this project arise from the practical&lt;br/&gt;question: what happens when a short signal (light or sound, say) is omitted&lt;br/&gt;from a point A, travels through a medium and arrives at point B? There are&lt;br/&gt;many possibilities: there could be focusing, diffraction, persistence of faint&lt;br/&gt;echoes, or still a short `clean-cut' signal at B. This last possibility is of&lt;br/&gt;particular interest, but it may occur only under very special conditions.&lt;br/&gt;To describe these conditions in precise mathematical terms is one of the goals&lt;br/&gt;of the proposal. The results sought in this direction are fundamental for our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of wave phenomena and may have applications in related physical&lt;br/&gt;sciences, including the theory of electromagnetic and acoustic waves, space &lt;br/&gt;communication technologies, magneto-hydrodynamics, crystal optics, etc. As &lt;br/&gt;a broader impact, the PI expects that the interdisciplinary nature of this &lt;br/&gt;work will stimulate communication and collaboration between experts in the &lt;br/&gt;various areas involved.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  A surprisingly large part of the natural world, with its rich and complex structure, can be understood using fundamental physical principles governed by differential equations.  Mathematically, differential equiations are built as algebraic combinations of derivatives and elementary operations which are applied to physical quantities. Such algebraic combinations of derivatives are called differential operators; understanding the properties  of these operators is crucial to understanding the properties and the behavior of  solutions of differential equations. The present project describes new algebraic properties of differential operators related to linear differential equations.  The results obtained in this project are concerned with rings of global differential operators defined on some (possibly, singular) algebraic spaces. One of our principal results is a complete geometric classification of ideals in rings of differential operators on an arbitrary smooth algebraic curve. Another is a deeper understanding of symmetries of  differential operators (the structure of their automorphism groups) on rational singular curves. We have developed new mathematical theories and tools which have led to solution of several  mathematical problems in representation theory, mathematical physics and geometry which are inaccesible by other means.  A large part of our work can be viewed as a contribution to "noncommutative geometry" which is a fairly new area of mathematics that is crucial for  building and understanding new theoretical models in modern physics.
