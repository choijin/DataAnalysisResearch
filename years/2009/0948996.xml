<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to achieve a unified molecular-level understanding of how the energy of sunlight is captured and stored via the primary electron transfer reactions in the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center (RC). The RC from photosynthetic bacteria is a protein-pigment complex housing two separate but quasi-symmetric branches of cofactors (bacteriochlorophyll, derivatives of it, and quinones).  In principle, either branch of pigment cofactors should be able to transport electrons.  Yet in the native "wild-type" bacterial RC only the "L-branch" pigments are utilized for primary photo-induced charge separation, while the alternative, "M-branch?, cofactors are completely inactive.  During the course of the last ten years of research, electron transfer along the chain of M-branch cofactors was achieved albeit in much less than the 100% yield attained by the native L-branch. Trapping the first charge-separated state that forms on the L-branch was also achieved.  This state lives less than a trillionth of a second and has only a small transient population during the normal course of native L-branch electron transfer.  These advances have opened the door to a comprehensive molecular-level understanding of the origins of the unidirectional L-branch charge separation in the native RC and analogous understanding of electron transfer along the normally inactive M-branch of RC cofactors.  Studies that seek these twin goals are the basis of this project.  The goals will be pursued via state-of-the art time-resolved spectroscopic investigations spanning the sub-picosecond time scale (less than a trillionth of a second) to seconds. Sophisticated data analysis and computer modeling will be undertaken to compare results from various mutants with each other and the native RC.  Specific interactions between the pigments and surrounding protein residues will be targeted for investigation to determine whether and how such interactions fine-tune cofactor properties and thus may serve to "switch" between initial L-side versus M-side electron transfer.  The studies will also probe the contribution of electronic couplings between the pigments (as distinguished from issues of energetics) in controlling directionality.  The combined findings will help to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of electron transfer in the bacterial RC as a unified whole.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The studies pursued in this project are relevant to understanding electron transfer in the two photosystems of plants and charge migration in membrane-bound proteins in general.  Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms of photo-induced charge separation in the photosynthetic RC has fundamental and far-reaching direct impacts on synthetic systems for solar-energy harvesting/conversion (including avenues being explored by the Co-PIs), thereby addressing a national need for next-generation renewable energy sources.  This project will continue to have a demonstrated positive impact on the participation of undergraduates and underrepresented groups in research and science, and in the broad multidisciplinary training of students.  The integration of research ideas into teaching and educational development and dissemination to the broader community will continue to be a focus.  Such projects include the following: (1) A web-based tutorial will be further developed that can be tailored for undergraduate or high school students on the topic "Why is grass green and blood red?" (2) Two undergraduate physical-chemistry laboratory experiments will be extensively upgraded to exploit the spectroscopy of chlorophyll and related chromophores, and the energy/electron transfer processes critical to photosynthesis, to teach molecular electronic spectroscopy and kinetics from application-oriented perspectives.  In one such direct application, students will design, build, and characterize a simple solar cell. (3) A broad, science-based talk on general and fundamental aspects of photosynthesis with links to interests in gardening, global climate change, and solar energy will be developed as a program for the St. Louis Master Gardener Speaker's Bureau at the Missouri Botanical Garden.  Additionally, local and national popular print and web-based publication venues will continue to be exploited through contacts with science writers in order to disseminate the goals, relevance, and applications of photosynthesis research to a broad audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is receiving co-funding from the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With only a few exceptions, all life on earth is ultimately dependent on photosynthesis, the process by which plants, algae and certain bacteria use the energy of sunlight to live.  Light energy is converted into chemical potential energy in photosynthetic organisms in membrane-bound pigment-protein complexes called reaction centers.  This NSF-funded work has focused on reaction centers from the purple photosynthetic bacteria, primarily Rhodobacter capsulatus.  The reaction center has symmetrically arranged chains of cofactors - a monomeric bacteriochlorophyll (B), a bacteriopheophytin (H) and a quinone (Q) - emanating from the primary electron donor, a dimer of bacteriochlorophyll molecules (P).  One of the most intriguing aspects of reaction center function is that charge separation utilizes only one of these two cofactor chains.  The active branch is called the A (or L) branch and the normally inactive branch is called the B (or M) branch (see figure).   Amazingly, the trans-membrane charge separation takes place in less than a nanosecond (a billionth of a second) and occurs with a quantum yield of nearly 100%.   This project has utilized high-tech ultrafast laser spectroscopic techniques with a time resolution of less than a picosecond (a trillionth of a second).      Under NSF support, we were the first, in 1995, to achieve "wrong way" electron transfer, in a mutant reaction center, to the normally inactive M-side cofactor HM&shy;, albeit with low (~15%) yield).  We incrementally increased this yield over the next 10 years, achieving 30% in 2001 and 70% in 2006.  Additionally, we demonstrated that electron transfer via the M-side cofactors occurs to produce reduced QB.  Normally, QB receives an electron from reduced QA.  In 2009 we successfully trapped, for the first time, the elusive first intermediate of charge separation, the state denoted P+BL-.  In 2010 we engineered a reaction center mutant that is missing the BL pigment entirely, providing a new reaction center phenotype.  In 2014 we published work on a related RC mutant a single amino acid residue near P and BL can dramatically impact the directionality, rate and yield of the initial electron transfer events, an idea with roots in pioneering calculations of Parson and Warshel circa 1990.  Studies started in 1988 and culminated in a publication in 2013 involving the heterodimer mutants. In these reaction centers the electronic asymmetry of the primary electron donor is altered, and can be selectively switched in either direction, via a change of one macrocyle of P from bacteriochlorophyll to its magnesium-free analog bacteriopheophytin.  Such studies have addressed the long-standing fundamental question concerning the relative extents to which initial charge separation is governed by energetic factors or electronic factors. An additional underlying research thread spanning decades has concerned the role of the protein, static and dynamic, in modulating the properties of the cofactors and the directionality, rates and yields of electron transfer.      Overall this NSF-supported work has contributed basic knowledge of the factors that control charge separation versus charge recombination at each step along the L-side electron transport chain.  This NSF funded work has played a lead role in giving insights into the equivalent processes amongst the normally inactive M-side cofactors.  The work has demonstrated that if the charge-separated states on either the L or M sides are brought closer together in energy, the electronic mixing between them results in enhanced wasteful charge recombination.  This consistent theme has provided the basis of understanding how the native system is designed to give essentially 100% forward electron transfer and essentially completely inhibit the deleterious deactivation processes. The results directly impact the design of multi-chromophore synthetic molecular systems for achieving efficient biomimetic solar energy conversion.  In summa...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
