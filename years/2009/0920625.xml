<AbstractNarration>The central nervous system (CNS) is an elaborate network of many diverse neurons capable of relaying electrochemical signals with remarkable fidelity.  The acquisition of neuronal cell fates within the developing CNS is a highly regulated, yet evolutionarily conserved process.  Research supports the hypothesis that a distinct combination of nuclear transcription factor binding proteins activates and/or inhibits the expression of neuronal fate determination genes.  For example, a known combination of transcription factors specifies the identity of motor neurons projecting axons ventrally, while a different combination specifies the identity of motor neurons projecting axons dorsally.  Each subclass of motor neurons extends axons to innervate different muscle targets.  To decode the transcription factor networks specifying neuronal fates, the proposed research will functionally characterize a newly identified regulator of neuronal specification, the Drosophila transcription factor gene neuromancer2 (nmr2).  Thus far, expression studies between Nmr2 proteins and transcription factors known to specify motor neuron and interneuron fates reveal little co-expression between these factors.  Consequently, the first goal of this project is to employ a genetic screen to identify genes that interact with nmr2.  Identifying nmr2-interacting genes will resolve nmr2 function and determine whether nmr2 is a novel transcription factor combinatorial code member governing the specification of neurons.  The second goal is to define the downstream gene targets through which Nmr2 mediates its effects on neuronal specification.  The integration of genetics and embryological methods with genome-wide searches for Nmr2 transcription factor gene targets will elucidate how Nmr2 directs distinct sets of neurons to differentiate from each other.  Further comparative analyses will provide insight to understand the function of Tbx20, the conserved mammalian counterpart of nmr2.  In addition, this project will provide scientific training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to pursue a research thesis, to co-author manuscripts, and to present their research at scientific meetings.  This project will be conducted at the University of Mississippi.  As such the project has the potential to broaden participation of minority students in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

These cell types include photoreceptor neurons and pigment cells. Eye development is a newfound research direction resulting from the pursuit of the originally proposed studies described in the NSF-RIG proposal to understand how H15 and Mid regulate the expression of genes important for the specification of distinct neurons within the embryonic central nervous system (CNS).  We first used a classic genetic screening approach to identify new mid-interacting genes and to elucidate a Mid transcription factor regulatory "code" or network essential for specifying the fates of individual neurons. However, we streamlined the genetic screening approach to increase efficiency by using the eye instead of the CNS as an experimental model system. As a result, we quickly identified mid-interacting gene candidates involved in the regulation of eye development and over the past year, validated at least three candidates as bona fide mid-interacting genes. We are now poised to determine whether these mid-interacting genes regulate neuronal cell fate specification.  To conduct a genetic modifier screen using the eye as a model system, we obtained mutant flies with reduced levels of mid (mid-RNAi) from Dr. Bodmer (Burnham Institute, CA).

The mid-RNAi flies were mated with commercially available fly mutants with chromosomal deletions (Dros Del chromosomal deficiency lines) lacking specific subsets of genes. We then determined whether the progeny inheriting combinations of these mutations exhibited a significant modification or change of a mid mutant eye phenotype characterized by a ~50% reduction in eye bristles that typically number ~450-500 in normal fly eyes. Thus, if the mid mutant bristle phenotype is modified, for example by the loss of gene "X", and bristles are either significantly greater than or less than 50% (~250), we know that mid functions in a genetic pathway in which gene "X" controls a specific regulatory function. Using this simple experimental strategy, we identified many chromosomal deficiency lines that deleted potential mid-interacting candidate genes. The loss of some genes increased bristle numbers (&gt;250) and suppressed the mid mutant phenotype. Conversely, the loss of other genes decreased bristle numbers (&lt;250) and enhanced the mid mutant bristle phenotype. Representative mid-interacting genes are summarized below.  Mid functions within a cellular signaling pathway (known as Notch-Delta) that regulates the cell-fate specification of a wide range of diverse cell types. mid interacts with extramacrochaetae (emc), a gene that functions within the Notch-Delta signaling pathway to regulate the generation of eye bristles. mid also interacts with other genes in the Notch-Delta genetic pathway regulating bristle complex formation including pannier (pnr) and hairy. mid interacts with dFOXO, a gene that functions within pathways responsive to insulin, to regulate the generation of eye bristles and cell survival. mid interacts with Cyclin A, a gene important for the regulation of the cell cycle that controls cell division.   Remarkably, humans and fruit flies both express mid and in both organisms, this gene regulates the development of the embryonic heart. In humans, the mid gene is referred to as Tbx20. In flies and mice, complete loss of mid or Tbx20 results in death due to severe developmental defects. Mutations of these and other T-box genes rendering defective proteins result in heart, limb and bone defects. While both the Mid and Tbx20 proteins are expressed in neurons of the CNS and in developing eye tissues, examining their roles in the development of the brain, spinal cord and visual system is an understudied area of res...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
