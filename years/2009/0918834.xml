<AbstractNarration>Researchers and developers at WestEd are developing, field-testing, and evaluating ten online professional development modules anchored in research-based teaching principles and achievement-boosting mathematics materials.  The modules provide interactive learning opportunities featuring real classroom video demonstrations, simulations, and scaffolded implementation.  The professional development module development builds on the Math Pathways and Pitfalls (MPP) instructional modules for middle school students developed with NSF support. The professional development provided through the use of these modules is web-based (rather than face-to-face), is provided in chunks during the school year and immediately applied in the classroom (rather than summer professional development and school year application), and explicitly models ways to apply key teaching principles to regular mathematics lessons (rather than expecting teachers to extract and apply principles spontaneously).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project studies the impact of the modules on teaching practice with an experimental design that involves 20 treatment teachers and 20 control teachers.  Data are gathered from teacher questionnaires, classroom observations, and post-observation interviews.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Project staff developed, piloted and evaluated ten online, self-paced modules for professional learning about K-8 mathematics teaching. Module activities for teachers are anchored in research-based teaching principles and the NSF-supported Math Pathways &amp; Pitfalls (MPP) instructional materials for K&ndash;8 students.

As a result, the project added supplemental resources for teacher exploration of instructional pitfalls. In these resources, teachers examine video of problematic use of MPP principles and see video clips that allow them to "sit in on" expert teacher focus groups discussing the teaching pitfalls. Broader Impacts: The MPP online professional development modules offer districts and teachers cost-effective, just-in-time professional learning opportunities for the five pedagogical principles foundational to the MPP approach: Confronting Pitfalls, Making Sense, Building Mathematical Discussions, Capturing Key Ideas, and Visualizing &amp; Connecting. Modules can be used flexibly: as part of a face-to-face experience or individually as teachers plan both MPP and non MPP lessons. Five of the ten modules focus on K-3 classrooms, and five on grades 4-7. Key ingredients in each module are videos of mathematics teaching and learning in authentic classrooms populated by children from diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, guidance for managing classroom conversations about mathematics strategies and representations, and activities for applying the MPP principles to local curriculum. Research Activities: Research during the project included an externally conducted usability study and a project-based pilot study. The usability study by Sutton Stern &amp; Associates informed the second round of development, which included a revamping of materials due to the broad adoption of the Common Core State Standards. External evaluator Joan Heller conducted the pilot study in 13 classrooms. To gauge the impact of the online professional development experience on teachers? practice outside of Math Pathways &amp; Pitfalls lessons, six of the teachers also were observed in depth while doing "regular" math lessons. Research examined the level of implementation of the featured principle for a module along with teacher experiences of the MPP online modules.
