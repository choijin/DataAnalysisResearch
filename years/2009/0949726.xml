<AbstractNarration>Climate warming has been identified as one of the most important threats to freshwater ecosystems globally. Because temperature is the fundamental driver of nearly all biological processes, climate warming will likely have strong effects on freshwater ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide for humans. Despite recent theoretical advances that provide clear predictions about how organisms should respond to warming, our current understanding is hindered by (a) the short-term and small-scale nature of most previous studies and (b) the non-trivial practical challenges associated with experimental warming of freshwaters at the ecosystem scale. This study will take advantage of a unique geothermally-active watershed in Iceland that contains a steep gradient of stream temperatures and very little difference in solute chemistry. Using a landscape gradient study of "temperature-acclimated" streams, streamside manipulations, and an ecosystem-scale experiment, this study will quantify the effects of warming on critical ecosystem processes (ecosystem metabolism and nutrient cycling) and the flow of energy and elements through stream food webs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed multi-scale design will produce much-needed data concerning the response of stream ecosystems to changes in temperature regime, benefitting society through increased understanding of how climate warming will influence freshwater ecosystems and the critical services they provide to humanity. The project will integrate research and education through training and mentoring of undergraduates, graduate students and a post-doctoral associate. In addition to communicating results through traditional outlets (publications, national/international meetings), findings will be presented to local grade schools, high schools, and the community at large with presentations, an interactive research blog, and semi-annual meetings with Icelandic colleagues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was designed to understand how temperature influences the ecology of streams and rivers.  This is an important area of study because temperatures are rising in streams and lakes as a result of changes in global surface air temperatures.  There is still a great deal of uncertainty about what this will mean for the productivity of these systems (e.g., growth of algae, invertebrates, and fishes), as well as patterns of freshwater biological diversity.  Our research was conducted in a geothermally active landscape in Iceland that contains a series of streams that differ in temperature, but not water chemistry.  We carried out a range of studies that included (a) observations of streams at different temperatures, (b) an experimental warming of a whole stream, and (c) small-scale experiments in streamside channels. We found that temperature plays a critical role in determining species composition, as well as driving patterns of productivity.  Interestingly, we found that warm streams were dominated by a special group of microbes that can æfixÆ their own nitrogen.  This means that &ndash; as streams warm &ndash; there is more and more nitrogen available in the ecosystem to fuel productivity.  We also found that the structure of communities differs across the thermal gradient, and this has important consequences for how energy passes among species in the food web, the timing and speed of invertebrate development, and how variable these food webs are over time.  Our research has been featured in peer-reviewed publications, as well as a variety of media outlets in the USA and Iceland.  We have constructed a research blog that has attracted ~25,000 views to date.  Many of our products, including a large number of additional publications are forthcoming.  Finally, our results have been featured in many of our courses at the university level.            Last Modified: 11/10/2015       Submitted by: Wyatt F Cross]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
