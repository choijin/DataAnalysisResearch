<AbstractNarration>Expanding NSF Course, Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) Type 1 projects to Type 2 projects is sometimes difficult.  Challenges include developing faculty communities, using more robust evaluation methods, and encouraging broader adoption. This project supports a two-day workshop for computer science PIs to expand the scope of their Type 1 projects and write competitive TUES Type 2 proposals.  Twelve teams of two investigators are being recruited.  The workshop leaders and guest speakers have experience managing Type 2 projects.  It is hosted by the University of Texas at El Paso.  Materials will be made available to the computer science education community.</AbstractNarration>

The tile changed to emphasize the special interest in projects that have the potential to transform undergraduate STEM education Title changed to emphasize the special interest in projects that have the potential to transform undergraduate STEM education.    TUES sought to fund projects that created learning materials and strategies that were guided by research on teaching and learning and that could incorporate and be inspired by advances within the discipline.  In specific, the program looked for faculty that were seeking to:   Develop faculty expertise that would enable them to acquire new knowledge and skills needed to inform their curricula and teaching practice;  Implement new instructional strategies that could contribute to an understanding on how successful methodologies could be more widely adopted in diverse settings to impact student learning;  Develop and disseminate valid and reliable tests for assessing and evaluating student achievement in STEM in order to add to the knowledge base on student understanding, reasoning, practical skills, interests, attitudes or other valued outcomes; and  Conduct research on undergraduate STEM education as to how pedagogical transformation occurs and enhances learning and attitudes, and how it can be diffused through the community   There were also significant differences in the expectations between Level 1 and Level 2 projects.  The scope of Type 1 projects is generally limited to incubation of innovations through early evaluation. Projects typically involved a single institution &amp; one program component which is expected to contribute to the understanding of undergraduate STEM education with evaluation based on the project's specific expected outcomes.  Sustainability is expected through institutionalization at the participating college and/or university.   Level 2 funding seeks to mature promising curricular innovations from Level 1 into forms that can achieve substantial impact on a broader scale.  Therefore, Level 2 projects typically involve multiple institutions &amp; several program components and are based on prior work with results explicitly described.  These projects incorporate dissemination that achieves not only institutionalization, but the building of a community of action. Evaluation is targeted toward gathering evidence on the effectiveness of the intervention.   The objective of CPrep2 was to combine the learnings from the TUES Program and Synergy (DUE 0903224) to conduct a 1.5 day workshop that would educate attendees on the differences in Level 1 and Level 2 projects and how to realign attributes and findings of their Level 1 projects to enable transition to Level 2 through a discussion of common challenges that arise as projects scale-up and common strategies employed by successful efforts.    The projectÆs major activity was implementing the 1.5 day workshop in August, 2010 designed to train developers of curricular innovations related to computation. Invitations were sent to PIs of recently funded TUES Type 1 projects, and an announcement was sent to the SIGCSE list.    The primary program consisted of the following three half-day sessions:  (1)  The objectives of NSF's TUES program (led by Stephen Cooper, former NSF program director and leading researcher in computer science education.)  (2)  The characteristics of projects required to achieve scale (led by Deborah Boisvert, PI for the Synergy Project which was focused on tools and processes for effecting scale with 13 Centers in the ATE Program)  (3)  The core attributes of an effec...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
