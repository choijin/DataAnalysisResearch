<AbstractNarration>Transforming Minds in a Transitioning Community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GK-12 program at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro partners Fellows from several departmental graduate programs with teachers and students at three Guilford County Schools (one elementary, middle and high school in the same neighborhood) to form discovery teams to scientifically investigate the biological, health-related, and socioeconomic effects of changing land use patterns in the region. The research questions of the Fellows are linked to local neighborhood issues and larger historical changes in land use patterns. Although the research questions are focused on neighborhood and regional environmental issues, the scientific literacy skills acquired by program participants will enable them to critically and quantitatively address any scientific question or environmentally-related problem, ranging from local to global scales. Fellows and teachers will work in school-based teams on three primary tasks: the development and delivery of inquiry-based lesson plans, greater quality and quantity of differentiated instruction, and the creation of K-12 student teams to teach others science concepts and methods. Fellows will learn to communicate research to a wide variety of audiences, develop lesson plans, develop leadership skills, enhance their teaching capability, and engage in research activities with students. Teachers will integrate new research into their teaching and learning and take part in professional development on inquiry-based science instruction and working with diverse student groups. K-12 students will become engaged in new forms of science learning and research and will be exposed to a variety of STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Graduate STEM Fellows in K-12 Education project at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro, <em>Transforming Minds in a Transitioning Community </em>was a great success. We worked with three Title I schools, an elementary, middle and high school that were physically linked by a Greenway/Creek.&nbsp; We met all of our intended goals;.</p> <ul> <li>&nbsp;1: Improve communication skills of the GK-12 Fellows, or Resident Scientists (RSs).</li> <li>&nbsp;2: Improve team building skills </li> <li>&nbsp;3: Enhance the quality of science education in our partnering schools through opportunities for science teachers to increase their content knowledge and explore best practices.</li> <li>&nbsp;4: Foster ongoing, mutually beneficial partnerships between the university and schools to enhance science education.</li> <li>&nbsp;5: Provide training and mentoring for graduate students and teachers</li> </ul> <p>Our graduate students, learned how to effectively communicate their science to multiple audiences. The GK-12 RS experience made our graduate students better teachers and scientists. Their teaching presentations became clearer and more concise over time while still effusing their love of science. Thirty-four graduate students participated in our GK-12 program. &nbsp;These were Masters and Doctoral students in Biology, Chemistry-Biochemistry, and Geography.&nbsp;All but two students found our program to be an incredible experience. The program enhanced their communication skills (oral and written), provided opportunities to interact with diverse audiences, and explore different ways present their science. &nbsp;The relationships that our students formed with their teachers and other K-12 students enriched their graduate experiences. &nbsp;All students that graduated from UNCG are currently employed, some in Higher Education including such places as Indiana University (Bloomington), U of Nebraska, Elon University and other similar institutions. One student is currently a post-doc while another works for the CDC. Two of our RSs are now teaching in high school STEM programs and another is teaching in a Career and Technical HS. &nbsp;A few students are still working on their doctoral studies as expected due to the timing of their participation in GK-12. &nbsp;</p> <p>Our partnering teachers became involved in cutting edge science. Teachers looked forward to partnering with RSs as the RSs had the time to plan and implement effective and engaging science activities. These relationships became important to the teachers. Teachers indicate they sorely miss the program now that it has ended.</p> <p>One key outcome was the important impact on the k-12 students we served. Over 1600 students participated in classrooms that had RSs. Because we worked with three schools and grades 2-12, some students had a RS in their classroom for three years.&nbsp;All schools were Title I schools and often, due to testing constraints, teachers did not have the time to "plan" for hands-on science and labs. &nbsp;We did that, and, and we did it well. &nbsp;Students always asked teachers when the RS would be in the class. &nbsp;Our graduate students formed strong bonds with our k-12 students and students looked forward to science - particularly in the elementary and middle schools. &nbsp;We filled a gap and engaged students in inquiry based science.</p> <p>Each year of five years, GK-12 sponsored and organized Greenway Day near the Creek. &nbsp;In Year six, Greenway Day became a school-sponsored event as part of GK 12&rsquo;s sustainability. The Middle and High School science clubs took the lead on developing and implementing their activities, consequently they learned to communicate their science to their peers. Their activities were complemented by faculty activities and other hands-on science activities. &nbsp;GK-12 provides an important function of bringing together a diverse community for a common purpose: science. &nbsp;Moving the format to a school day, organized by the science clubs, means that the event will continue after the grant ends.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our evaluation results, both formative and summative, indicate that GK-12 more than met its goals and will have a lasting impact on those that were involved in the program.</p> <p>Over the years, RSs and students sampled the creek for chemical and biological data and established a data base. The analyses of these data may help the community better gauge the health of the stream and make changes accordingly. The data are available for students to analyze.</p> <p>Gk-12 also established Science Clubs in both the Middle School and the High School. These clubs will continue after the grant.</p> <p>Results of our GK-12 program were disseminated to local and national audiences through conferences, poster presentations, community events and the media.&nbsp;</p> <p>More young students are now excited about science. Due to GK 12, more students are entering STEM disciplines than the program began. Teachers are more comfortable teaching inquiry based science. The professional development implications of this program may be our lasting legacy. Over the life of the project, our partnership with Guilford County Schools has enhanced the knowledge, skills and attitudes of our graduate students, teachers, and the K-12 students engaged in the program relative to communicating science effectively to multiple audiences.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/06/2016<br>      Modified by: Stanley&nbsp;H&nbsp;Faeth</p> </div>
