<AbstractNarration>This CPATH Project extends the Small Footprint model, successfully pioneered and developed at the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, to four other institutions, Massachusetts Amherst, Harvard, Colby, and Rensselear Polytechnic. The principal investigator will work with other academic institutions to adapt the lessons learned at Olin to a broader set of schools, specifically addressing the diverse needs of different kinds of educational institutions. Among the virtues of the small footprint curriculum are: a reduced core that concentrates on the particular elements that are required in order to learn the rest of computing;  an emphasis on teaching students to learn more on their own; room for and an emphasis on active, hands-on, project-based and inquiry-driven projects, often carried out in teams; opportunities to collaborate with other disciplines and to build genuinely joint curriculum; and contextualization of the core of computing education.  A diverse initial group of pioneer collaborators have are committed to immediate curricular reform. A series of workshops and town hall meetings as well as an online consultation will be used to identify and recruit additional partner institutions and to create a national shift in understanding of what is necessary to the revitalization of computing education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Widespread change in computing curricula requires careful construction of viable models. The approaches of this project should provide opportunities for multi-disciplinary collaboration as the core computing curriculum is refactored to emphasize computing's durable bones. The PI brings a unique background including prior successes in growing curricula outwards from single institutions and extensive experience developing both a small footprint curriculum for computing and an engineering educational program. The first round partner schools have been carefully selected to provide diverse models from which to bootstrap a national conversation and community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The primary focus of this project is the content and style of teaching, training, and learning in computing. The project will engage many educators in active conversation and then transformation of undergraduate computing programs. In turn, these curricular reforms will change the educational experiences of students in traditional computing disciplines and create new opportunities for students through the development of interdisciplinary programs. Initially the project is geographically centered but over time the project will broaden its reach through workshops, town hall meetings, publications, electronic and in-person consultation by the PI, and hands-on curricular revision.  Eventually, every university in the nation should be able to look to at least one successful adaptation of the small footprint curriculum at a peer institution, so that curricular reform moves from radical innovation to the easier processes of emulation and adoption.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The primary focus of this project was the content and style of teaching, training, and learning in computing. The project engaged a large number of educators from a broadly diverse set of institutions in active conversation and then transformation of undergraduate programs, with special attention to increasing active learning methods and opportunities for inter-, multi-, and trans-disciplinary collaboration.  In turn, these curricular reforms have changed the educational experiences of students in traditional computing disciplines and created new opportunities for all students through the development of interdisciplinary programs.  Curricular change took place at multiple partner institutions, including Harvard University, Washington University at St. Louis, Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute, Lehigh University, Berea College, and the Thread-Based Computing Curriculum CPATH  consortium (Georgia Tech, CUNY Grad Center/Brooklyn College, SPSU, Armstrong, Kennesaw). Professional development workshops and ongoing consultations during the project facilitated these changes. Additional workshops were held at a range of conferences, including SIGCSE, FIE, ASEE, and some international venues.  Courses at impacted institutions became more active, more project-based, more student-centered. Curricula increased in flexibility and in support for diverse pathways, minors, interdisciplinary opportunities, etc. More students -- both inside and outside of major programs -- have been exposed to more computing ideas and computing curricula. Computing students are exposed to more contextualized education and training, developing more responsiveness to societal need. In some cases, new facilities have also been constructed or renovations influenced by these pedagogical approaches.  Related research and professional development activities probed the experiences of students in such educational environments.  Pedagogic design has a significant and lasting effect on student outcomes:  class framing impacts team role choices which in turn leads to differentiated learning outcomes; emphasis on multimodal representation leads to radically different notions of problem solving; language and framing affects studentÆs sense of inclusion and development of professional identity.  This project included both basic research and significant training for faculty members in the hands-on applications of these methods and results.  Some of the specific professional development activities held under this grant -- such as the gender and computing special session at SIGCSE -- explicitly train computing educators to support and appreciate the perspective of members of traditionally underrepresented constituencies, helping to lower barriers to entry/increase retention in STEM.  The most significant changes have been in the mindset of members of the computing community: more schools are more amenable to considering more change. At partner institutions and other institutions impacted by this work, qualitative and anecdotal evidence has begun to provide evidence for an emerging trend. Schools adopting &ndash; or adapting &ndash; the small footprint model have found ways to add project-based, inquiry- driven aspects to their courses.  The most recent computing curriculum guidelines also shows evidence of this, as the core computing curriculum is refactored to emphasize computingÆs durable bones.  The ACM/IEEE-CS Computer Science 2013 Curriculum highlights four "high-level themes" [p.13], three of which are directly responsive to the goals of this project: "The 'Big Tent' view of CS," or need for interdisciplinarity and cross-disciplinary integration; "Managing the size of the curriculum," where "the circumscription of curriculum size promotes more flexible models for curricula"; and "Institutional needs...CS2013 allows for explicit flexibility in curricular structure through a tiered set of core topics, where a small set of Core-Tier 1 topics are considered essential for all C...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
