<AbstractNarration>The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS), formed in the fall of 1982 under the aegis of Lee Stanley, has supported&lt;br/&gt;2-4 regional meetings per year of 1-2 days' duration since then.&lt;br/&gt;These meetings are held at various locations and cover a broad spectrum of mathematical logic, with particular emphasis on complexity theory, theoretical computer science, fragments of arithmetic, pure and applied model theory, proof theory, recursion theory/computability theory, set theory, subsystems of analysis in accordance with the program of H. Friedman and S. Simpson, and topos theory. NSF support is provided for some of the expenses of the speakers and attendees, in particular of the graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Via the meetings sponsored, the MAMLS grant maintains the vitality of the field of mathematical logic. Special emphasis is placed on enhancing the participation of younger researchers and members of traditionally underrepresented groups, especially women. This is done by providing an intellectual forum in which all interested persons are invited to contribute and in which there are lectures on current topics of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS) is a regional seminar in mathematical logic.  MAMLS was formed in the fall of 1982. It has been running two, three, or four meetings a year since then, first under the supervision of Lee Stanley, next under the supervision of Gregory Cherlin, and then, since December of 1995, under the supervision of the current PI, Arthur Apter. An average of two to three meetings per year is projected for the next three years.  The seminar covers a broad spectrum of mathematical logic, including (but not limited to) fragments of arithmetic, logical foundations of computer science, proof theory, pure and applied model theory, recursion theory/computability theory, set theory, subsystems of analysis in accordance with the program of H. Friedman and S. Simpson, and topos theory.  Support is provided for outside speakers.  Support is also provided for travel expenses of graduate students, postdocs, and additional regular seminar participants not receiving any stipend from other grants, and for miscellaneous expenses associated with organizing and running the seminar. These expenses include refreshments, as well as copying and long-distance telephone and fax charges.   MAMLS has been funded since 1984 by NSF.  It was funded from 1984-1985 through a supplement to Stanley's grant MCS-8301042, from 1985-1987 under grant DMS-8506058, from 1987-1989 under grant DMS-8704751, from 1989-1992 under grant DMS-8907348, from 1992-1995 under grant DMS-9121340, from 1995-1999 under grant DMS-9509993, from 1998-2002 under grant DMS-9804025, from 2002-2005 under grant DMS-0137487, from 2005-2009 under grant DMS-0456371, and from 2009-2013 under grant DMS-0902550.  MAMLS been able to get  visitors like Saharon Shelah, the leading expert in mathematical logic, as speakers on a regular basis, and we continue to rely heavily on local participants for much of the activity in the seminars.  Most of the participants are drawn from a large current e-mailing list which includes mathematical logicians and major institutions, as well as many other mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers, in the Mid-Atlantic region and beyond.  The intellectual merit of MAMLS is that it helps disseminate cutting-edge research and state-of-the-art knowledge to a wide audience of interested scholars and students. Mathematical logic is kept vital and active partially as a result of MAMLS meetings, which usually cover a comprehensive spectrum of topics. MAMLS conferences bolster the number of general interest logic meetings available.  The broader impact of MAMLS is that it helps enhance the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in mathematics, especially women. MAMLS pays particular attention to inviting women to speak and also encourages women to be active participants in all MAMLS meetings. In addition, MAMLS encourages graduate students and young postdoctoral researchers to attend its conferences. Postdocs (and occasionally graduate students) are particularly welcome speakers.
