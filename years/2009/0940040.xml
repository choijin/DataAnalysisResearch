<AbstractNarration>The grant is to support the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) 2009 on Radiation and Climate. The conference will be held at the Colby-Sawyer College, New London, NH on July 5-10, 2009. It will present cutting-edge research on the outstanding issues in global climate change with focus on the radiative forcing and sensitivity of the climate system and associated physical processes. The conference will feature a wide range of topics, including grand challenges in radiation and climate, radiative forcing, climate feedbacks, cloud processes in climate system, hydrological cycle in changing climate, absorbing aerosols and Asian monsoon, recent climate changes, and geo-engineering. The invited speakers will present the recent most important advances and future challenges in these areas. The Conference will bring together a collection of leading investigators who are at the forefront of their field, and will provide opportunities for scientists especially junior scientists and graduate students to present their work in poster format and exchange ideas with leaders in the field. This Conference with programmed discussion sessions provides an avenue for scientists from different disciplines to brainstorm and promotes cross-disciplinary collaborations in the various research areas represented. GRC participants have the opportunity to discuss unpublished work and to explore new issues and ideas in the formative stage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge transfer and networking for young scientists is an expected outcome from this grant.</AbstractNarration>
