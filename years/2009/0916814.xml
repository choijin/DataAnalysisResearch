<AbstractNarration>This workshop will discuss the linkages between science, technology and the economy. These meetings will engage physical scientists, economists, science policy experts and other interested groups on these critical issues. Some of the questions to be addressed include: What have been the distinguishing characteristics of science and technology influences on economic growth? How can these lessons be applied to current structural issues facing the U.S. economy and future economic growth? What are the key science and technology challenges that must be addressed to achieve energy and environmental sustainability? How would the policy framework maximize the effectiveness of science and technology investments in supporting sustainable economic growth? The Summit will complete its objectives with a series of events, including plenary Summit meetings in Spring 2010 and 2011 and more focused workshops in the interim.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Howard Baker Center for Public Policy, the European Commission, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars organized the EU-US Summit on Science, Technology, Innovation, and Sustainable Economic Growth.   The Summit, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and the European Commission, examined the critical impacts of investments in science, technology, and innovation on sustainable economic growth. There is increasing national emphasis on the importance of both science and sustainable economic growth, with science underpinning the creation of new industries and "green jobs." The Summit, whose activities extended over two years, explored the links between science and economic growth and included two meetings and four workshops. It is important that policymakers, scientists, and the broader public understand the implications of how research in science and technology affects both the structure and long-term growth of the economy.   The Summit has proved unique in two important respects.

Also, they have tended to focus more on narrow aspects of the growth process, such as the innovation process. In contrast, the Summit was structured to engage a diverse audience but also to produce results that are of interest to specialists in science and science policy.   Second, the Summit has taken place at a time when policy is being discussed and developed to restructure the economy in a way that will affect long-term production and employment.

The presentations made at the the final plenary meeting  will be published in a special volume of the journal Futures.
