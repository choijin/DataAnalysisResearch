    <AbstractNarration>DRL-0940773 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Brent, Linda&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) has been given to The ASTA Group, LLC to create a blueprint for an International Conference on Cyberlearning that would explore radically different approaches to both formal and informal learning at a national level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EAGER will bring together essential individuals and organizations across a range of STEM disciplines committed to advancing Cyberlearning for the improvement of STEM education and how to use technology to connect underrepresented groups with resources and tools to which they have never before been exposed. ASTA and the national defense industrial community have encountered and solved many of the same implementation issues arising now in education and have actively sought ways that technology can improve education and training effectiveness, efficiency, and accessibility. The Defense and Defense-related industries operate at the scale necessary for successful transfer of small research projects to wide-scale application. Through ASTA's extensive R&amp;D knowledge of advanced technologies, most specifically their work in multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs), modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), and game-based learning as applied in the military's education, training, and workforce development programs, they will bring the highest level of expertise to the development of a blueprint for an international conference on Cyberlearning that will forge unprecedented partnerships across government, academia, and industry. ASTA and the National Training and Simulation Association (NTSA) as Principal Investigator, will submit a proposal for an international conference in 2010 based upon the blueprint developed by the EAGER grant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that technology will be used during the EAGER phase to plan the conference, disseminate conference-related information, and serve as an interface for activities. A website and/or Internet portal will be established and will be used to facilitate on-going partnerships, monitoring, and information sharing. It may have both public and participant levels of access. Details, as well as partners for development, maintenance, and funding will be determined through the EAGER planning period.</AbstractNarration>
