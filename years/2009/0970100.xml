<AbstractNarration>The investigator and his collabortaors and students study&lt;br/&gt;  several topics in arithmetic geometry, in particular to arithmetical intersection theory&lt;br/&gt;  of cycle on Shimura varieties with connection to special values of automorphic of L-series extending his previous work on the Gross-Zagier formula and Arakelov theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project in a subfield of mathematics known as number theory. Many of these questions are motivated by the philosophy that algebraic informations can be obtained by geometric methods.  It is not too ambitious to say that the solution to the problems in this proposal will one day affect research in cryptography, theoretic physics, and quantum computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In his grant period 2010-2013, the PI and his former students Xinyi Yuan and Wei Zhang have produced three major papers in arithmetic geometry which is a subject on algebraic equations with rational coefficents. Two main tools have been used in PI's work: heights and L-functions. The heights can be constructed by arithmetic intersection theory and the L-fucntions are constructed from local solutions of equations.     Two of these three papers are on some connections between the special cycles on Shimura varieties and the special values  of L-functions. One of these two papers is a book about a complete Gross--Zagier formula on Shimura curves which has been published as a  volume in Annals Studies of Mathematics, and another is a preprint about a connection between the Gross--Schoen cycles and the  triple product L-series. The book on Gross--Zagier formula has been used in the following incoming work:  -- The congruent number problem by Ye Tian and his joint work with the PI. They have produced  some congrunet numbers with positive density by computing the parity of L-functions.  -- The Kolyvagin conjecture on the Selmer groups of elliptic curves over rationals. He has shown that every Selmer element can be constructed by CM-points.     The last of these three papers is on an arithethmetic Hodge index theorem on adelic line bundles. This theorem has been used to prove the uniqueness part  of Calabi--Yau theorem on non-archiemedean spaces, and to prove a rigidity result about the dyanamics of preperiodic points of polarized endomorphisms of algebraic varieties.     During this grant period, besides above mentioned collaborations with his students, the PI has lectured  his research in his graduate classes at Columbia and Princeton, and  in  many public lectures to non-experts, including college and high school students in US and China.
