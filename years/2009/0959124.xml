<AbstractNarration>This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), and meets the requirements established in Section 2 of the White House Memorandum entitled, Ensuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds, dated March 20, 2009. As the cognizant Program Officer, I also affirm that the proposal does not support projects described in Section 1604 of Division A of the Recovery Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 09-59124&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Apon, Amy W.; Cothren, Jackson, D.; El-Shenawee, Magda O.; Pulay, Peter; Spearot, Douglas E.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Arkansas&lt;br/&gt;Title:   MRI-R2/Acq.: Acq. of an Integrated Instrument for Computational Research and Education&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring an integrated supercomputing platform for distributed and shared memory parallel applications that are computationally, data, and storage intensive, aims to service a broad range of projects in computational science and engineering. The work potentially expands the capability to do computational research in Arkansas by an order of magnitude.&lt;br/&gt;The supercomputer requested would be used principally in the areas of computer science, computational chemistry, computational biomagnetics, mechanical engineering, geosciences, and spatial science.  It also benefits researchers in integrated nanoscience, astrophysics, bioinformatics, large scale optimization, video analysis, and network topology.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed cluster will be the primary high-end computing platform for research and educational activities for the University and for the state.  The geosciences projects have substantial commercial potential and particular significance for the economic development in Arkansas.  The proposal includes a significant outreach and an educational component targeted to undergraduate students. In addition, the project contains training activities targeted to faculty who teach undergraduate students at many institutions of the eleven four-year institutions of higher education in Arkansas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this award is to significantly expand the high performance computing infrastructure in the Arkansas High Performance Computing Center, which supports a broad range of research and education projects in science and engineering.  The acquired high performance computing instrument named "Razor" was purchased in three phases and includes 244 compute nodes (with either 12 or 16 processing cores per compute node), 74 TB of long-term storage, 27 TB of scratch storage and at least 1 TB of local storage on each node.  Six of the nodes have either 512 or 768 GB of memory to support shared-memory research applications, such as those in the fields of bioinformatics and bioelectromagnetics.  This high performance computing instrument supports research in computer science, computational chemistry, computational bioelectromagnetics, computational materials science, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, spatial science and nanoscience.  For example, researchers in the field of computational chemistry and chemical engineering use this equipment to develop electronic structure calculation methods and to perform electronic structure calculations to study the interaction between small molecules.  This understanding is critical to the biofuel and biomedical industries.  In the area of computational bioelectromagnetics, researchers use the high performance computing instrument to simulate the spatial and temporal growth of cancerous cells in the breast, providing critical information necessary to develop new and more accurate methods for breast cancer detection.  Research in the fields of mechanical engineering and nanoscience focuses on the properties of nanostructured materials.  For example, researchers in nanoscience perform atomic scale calculations to discover new materials that have applications in the microelectronics, medical and sonar fields.  In total, the high performance computing instrument supports the research and education activities of over 200 participants and has resulted in over 75 journal publications and well over 100 presentations over the three year duration of the award.  This project leverages funding from the National Science Foundation for workshops, courses, seminars, and research experiences directed towards undergraduate students that will expose them to computational research techniques, provide access to the instrument acquired via this grant and training to properly utilize the instrument.  In addition, a number of education, outreach, and training activities are targeted to faculty who teach undergraduate students at many institutions within the states of Arkansas and West Virginia.
