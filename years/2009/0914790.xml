<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Affordable Nanoengineering of Polymeric Biomedical Devices is researching low-cost, polymer-based nanotechnologies that can be used to manufacture multifunctional nanostructures and nanofluidic devices for next generation medical diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The Center?s research concentrates on the interface between polymer nanoengineering and nanofluidics, leading to two practical nanofactory assembly lines, one based on nanofluidic network and the other on electrospun nanofibers. A nanofactory assembly line links nanomaterials and nanotechnologies to allow cells, biomolecules and nanoparticles to be formed and transported along a pre-specified ?assembly line? with controlled motion and structure. It allows continuous production of multi-functional biomimetic nanostructures, non-stochastic transfection and molecular analysis of individual cells, and 3D cell-based devices. These nanofactories will greatly enhance the performance of new drugs and genes discovered through genomics and proteomics research for the treatment of cancer, infectious and parasitological disease, chronic illness, and genetic disorders. There are three major scientific challenges in Phase II: 1) nanoscale characterization and modeling of polymer properties, 2) interfacial polymer-biomolecule interactions at the nanoscale, and 3) nanoscale and multiscale fluidics and modeling These scientific studies will enable: (1) affordable and biologically benign fabrication of 3D polymer nanoconstructs, (2) guided assembly of polymer and biomolecule nanostructures, (3) active nanofluidic designs, and (4) arrays of devices for the manipulation of biomolecules, cells and nanoparticles, based on magnetic tweezers, optical tweezer wave guides, and electrochemical dip-pen nanolithography cantilever arrays. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal impacts of the proposed activities are to: (1) commercialize new nanoengineered biomedical devices through affordable manufacturing methods and novel design, (2) extend research results from medical/biology applications to functional nanocomposites, water treatment, homeland security, environmental protection, and food industry toxicology, (3) establish new products and new industries to create high-paying jobs in the U.S., and (4) train the 21st century workforce in economically important and critical high-tech fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the Center for Affordable Nanoengineering of Polymeric Biomedical Devices (CANPBD) has been to develop polymer-based low-cost nanoengineering technologies to produce biomedical diagnostic devices and multifunctional polymer-nanoparticle-biomolecule nanostructures for medical and pharmaceutical applications.  Polymeric materials offer a number of advantages for tailoring medical devices as many are biocompatible, biodegradable, easy to form, yet very low-cost. The ability to process them at the nanoscale in a way that provides industrial value has required extensive interdisciplinary collaboration.  Our research vision has focused on two highly integrated ænanofactoryÆ systems based on cleanroom and non-cleanroom, affordable, environmentally and biologically benign nanofabrication, nanomanipulation and nanofluidics technologies. The first system is referred to as the Automated Cell to Biomolecule Analysis (ACBA) and is based upon nano-devices for patient sample processing (cell sorting and characterization/analysis).  The second system is called the Multifunctional Nanoparticle Design and Synthesis (MNDS) and involves the packaging and delivery of therapies and sensors for personalized medicine.  Both have resulted in successful prototypes and patented technologies.        ACABA has three inter-connected thrusts- (1) Optical tweezers, (2) Magnetic tweezers, and (3) Nanofibers based cell sorting. All subgroups briefly described below share similar nanotechnologies and nanomaterials, while the optical tweezers and magnetic tweezers have provided complementary ACBA platforms to address a broad range of biomedical needs.        The Optical tweezers based ACBA system can sort and identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a patient blood sample, and capture and detect extracellular RNAs in exosomes secreted from cancer cells. The nanochannel electroporation (NEP) component of this system can be used for both cancer detection and cell reprogramming which is important for regenerative medicine. NEP technology has been extended from in vitro to in vivo applications in animal models.  The Magnetic tweezers based ACBA allows for analysis of cell-to-cell variations which can further the understanding of intracellular processes and the role of individual cell function within a larger cell population. A method to position and lyse individual cells on silicon nanowire and nanoribbon biological field effect transistors to release cellular components has been developed allowing for cancer cell analysis without contamination or interference from other cells. We have also integrated the magnetic trap arrays with droplet microfluidics that allows on-chip separation of magnetically labeled cells from a heterogeneous population, immediately followed by the encapsulation of these cells into droplets with the reagents. A low-cost tweezers platform has been developed by integrating the magnetic tweezers with the NEP technique for high throughput applications.  For Nanofiber-based cell sorting, we have established a comprehensive electrospun fiber process producing highly aligned nanofibers infused with chemotactic gradient capable of guiding the motion of migrating metastatic tumor cells to create "migrational chromatography," a sorting technique based purely on cellular behavior rather than a predetermined biomarker analysis. As a natural complement to this thrust, we have explored relevant fiber technologies that closely mimic those found in the human body to enhance the overall function and value of migrational chromatography.  Methods to ease the removal of cells from the array for further interrogation have optimized this sorting technique.     The synthesis and application of multifunctional nanoparticles in the MNDS system has resulted in novel nanoparticle compositions and have shown superb potential for miRNA-based therapies in liver, breast and lung cancer models.
