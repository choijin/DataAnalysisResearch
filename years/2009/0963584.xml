<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Strengthening the Professoriate at Iowa State University (SPISU) strengthens and diversifies the professoriate by creating a community of scholars who focus on integrating broader impacts efforts into their research enterprise. SPISU brings together campus programs, many NSF funded, that share the mission of broadening participation of under-represented minorities and women in STEM fields, with the goal of networking, integrating, and sustaining the efforts of individual and multiple-investigator projects. The community also includes post-doctoral scholars and advanced graduate students mentored by faculty as they develop the awareness and skills needed to develop plans for broader impacts to complement their research skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project supports these primary outcomes: (1) the creation of protocols and policies that use a faculty member's broader impact work in annual performance evaluations and the promotion and tenure process. The goal is to develop evaluation tools and protocols that will add value to ISU processes and can be implemented at other universities. (2) Through SPISU, faculty develop research based broader impact programs that are based on the scholarship of best practices. This raises the intellectual strength of broader impact plans that faculty integrate into their research programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed activity focuses on developing a new generation of faculty who integrate their broader impacts efforts with their research enterprise. The participating programs, which include ISU ADVANCE, Iowa AGEP, and other programs focused on K-grey education and diversity efforts benefit from a new group of collaborating faculty. Developing new P&amp;T protocols and procedures to include evaluation of broader impacts work also increases the level of effort that faculty put toward broader impacts. Finally, as post-doctoral scholars and advanced graduate students are included in the SPISU activities, they will be trained for faculty positions as they develop broader impact plans that are based on the scholarship of best practices. Partnering with ISU ADVANCE, Iowa AGEP, and the Math Alliance, will ensure that women and under-represented minorities are actively recruited to participate in SPISU activities.</AbstractNarration>

A research study of BI in NSF proposals identified the rhetorical conventions of BI sections and compared these conventions in funded and unfunded proposals. The results of quantitative analyses of the data provide a rich description of patterns and variation in BI discourse in general, and in the BI of funded and unfunded proposals in particular, lending themselves to practical implications for grant writing instruction and training.  Broader Impacts   SP@ISU has provided training for and fostered collaboration of faculty, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students with broader impacts partners and programs as they develop BI plans related to their research activities. The BI climate survey indicated that those who participated in SP@ISU were more than twice as likely as non-participants to partner with a program to implement BI activities. More than two-thirds of those who partnered with another program reported they had collaborated with staff at the partner program to develop their BI activity, indicating forethought to the development of the BI work. This most likely supports a more meaningful integration of BI work within their scholarship. SP@ISU?s collaboration with other institutional efforts (such as Iowa EPSCoR) and with national efforts (such as NABI) has catalyzed BI awareness and activities on the ISU campus. Significant new grants have been received by ISU teams for broadening participation in STEM fields at pre-college, undergraduate and graduate levels. The importance of BI work to faculty career satisfaction is also evident in the survey results. The transfer of resources developed by SP@ISU to the ISU Grants Hub is expected to sustain the project?s impact.  The project had four goals:  1) Build on current NSF      programs to increase efficiency and effectiveness of ISU programs to      broaden participation in STEM. 2) Create a clearinghouse of      programs, resources, and information, and a network of people to assist      and guide in the development of a broader impacts culture at ISU. 3) Facilitate and enhance the      knowledge base needed by faculty to develop well-researched broader      impacts plans as part of their research. 4) Develop protocols for      assessment and evaluation of a faculty member?s broader impacts initiatives      for inclusion in the promotion and tenure process.     In meeting these goals, SP@ISU has made meaningful contributions to both campus-wide and national efforts to support BI work.     The summative external evaluation identified significant ways that SP@ISU accomplished the goals, including:  developing and      disseminating resources to faculty about how to strengthen the broader      impacts of their research; working with other campus      stakeholders (e.g., Iowa EPSCoR and Office of Vice President for Research)      to support a campus climate that values broader impacts and sustains the      resources developed by SP@ISU; helping to broker      connections between faculty, between NSF programs on campus that engage in      broader impacts work, and between faculty and programs to support      effective collaboration; working with external      stakeholders (e.g., NABI) to support broader impacts work nationally; and establishing and      strengthening networks within ISU&mdash;and between ISU and other      institutions&mdash;to support a community of practice for those engaged in      broader impacts work.   In terms of the Transtheoretical Model of Change used in the summative evaluation, ISU faculty and administrators progressed from precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation in the early grant years to action and maintenance in the later grant years. Knowledge and products developed under the SP@ISU grant have been disseminated widely to other institutions and communities engaged in broader impacts work. SP@ISU?s dissemination has been especially impactful through the collaborations with other national BI efforts (for example NABI).  Through meaningful engagement, resource sharing, and leadership, SP@ISU has contributed to the national infrastructure to disseminate best practices developed by SP@ISU and other stakeholders.
