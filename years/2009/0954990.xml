<AbstractNarration>0954990&lt;br/&gt;Corr&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrated research and education CAREER proposal is focused to understand the role of fiber network architecture on overall tissue function, and thus establish the structure-function relationship.  In the PI's scaffold-free approach, the natural ability of cells to grow and create their own extracellular matrix is harnessed, using geometric constraint, to form functional single fibers.  This bottom-up approach will be utilized to create and tune fibers that will serve as building blocks for muscle-tendon structures, in which the architecture can be specified to fiber-level precision.  The mechanical characterization of these muscle-tendon structures, when coupled with fiber-based theoretical modeling, will provide insight required to establish the structure-function relationship.&lt;br/&gt;The key novelties to this approach are:  (1) scaffold-free engineering and mechanical evaluation of single fibers formed by directed cell growth, and (2) building functional muscle-tendon structures to precise fiber-level architecture.  This represents a fundamental shift in tissue engineering approach; one necessary to create functional muscle-tendon units in which both muscle and tendon fiber architecture dictate the physiological and biomechanical function of the structure. &lt;br/&gt;This research program will utilize a scaffold-free approach to engineer muscle and tendon fibers by directing the growth of myoblasts and fibroblasts using geometric constraints to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) develop a fundamental understanding of the influence of environmental stimuli on cellular growth and fiber formation, in both muscle and tendon. &lt;br/&gt;(2) determine set(s) of bioreactor parameters for optimal muscle and tendon fiber performance&lt;br/&gt;(3) characterize the influence of fiber and crimp geometry on crimped engineered tendon fibers viscoelastic low-load and failure properties, using theoretical modeling and experimentation. &lt;br/&gt;(4) create functional muscle-tendon structures with fiber-level architectural fidelity to achieve the desired mechanical performance, as guided by theoretical modeling simulations.&lt;br/&gt;(5) establish the structure-function relationship for engineered muscle-tendon structures; including the contributions of each tissue, and compatibility at the muscle-tendon interface.&lt;br/&gt;The research will be complemented by integrated educational projects at the graduate, undergraduate and K-12 academic levels, both within Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and as educational outreach.  The latest research findings and methods will be incorporated into 3 graduate/undergraduate hybrid courses currently taught or co-taught by the PI, and a related 5-week lab experiment will be developed for the Cell &amp; Tissue Engineering track of the Biomedical Engineering Laboratory course.  Tissue engineering knowledge gained will be integrated into the PI's ongoing undergraduate (BIR Workshop) and K-12 (Design Your Future Day) outreach seminars.  Furthermore, the PI will introduce a week-long biomaterials module into the summer American Society of Materials "Materials Day Camp", using an interactive series of hands-on experiments to establish the structure-function relationship of collagen networks present in soft tissues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 1.  The goals of this proposed work was to utilize a novel tissue engineering approach to grow individual muscle and tendon fibers, and by delivering precise electrical and mechanical stimulation to the fibers during development, gain a fundamental understanding of the influence of environmental stimuli on cellular growth and fiber formation.  To achieve this we created and established: (i) a scaffold-free approach to grow muscle and tendon fibers from cells (myoblasts and fibroblasts, respectively), and (ii) a single-fiber bioreactor able to deliver controlled and reproducible mechanical and electrical stimulation to these engineered soft tissue fibers, as they develop.  Rather than utilizing a scaffold (either natural or synthetic) to serve as a provisional tissue structure, our scaffold-free approach harnesses the cells? natural ability to grow, create their own extracellular matrix, and form functional single fibers.   Intellectual Merit: This project built and established a unique experimental platform to deliver controlled and reproducible mechanical and/or electrical stimulation to an engineered soft tissue fiber, as it develops, to gain insight into the influence of biophysical stimulation on soft tissue development and maturation.  Our scaffold-free approach to tissue engineering single fibers captures many key aspects of how tissues form and develop in the embryo, in particular the self-assembly of cells in direct cell-cell contact, without use of a provisional structure (e.g., natural or synthetic scaffold). When coupled with our single-fiber mechanical characterization, and our most recent histologic analyses, this grants unique insight into how biophysical stimuli, affect engineered fiber function and structure, respectively. Additionally, due to the highly controlled and reproducible manner in which these stimuli can be applied, this approach grants exploration of the influence of both the characteristics of the applied stimuli (e.g., amplitude, frequency, duration), and the time during development at which they are applied.  This provides truly unique insight into the role of biophysical stimulation on cellular self-assembly, fiber formation, and structural/functional maturation &ndash; items critical for a regenerative strategy to engineer tissue replacements.   This research has led to 6 journal publications and more than 25 conference presentations.  Broader Impacts: Scientifically, this project provides a unique experimental platform to gain insight into the influence of biophysical stimulation, e.g., mechanical strain and electrical stimulation, on soft tissue development.  The insight gained from such an approach can inform future tissue engineering efforts, both scaffold-free and traditional scaffold-based approaches, and thus impacts a wide variety of soft tissue engineering applications.  Educationally, this project engaged students in research at a variety of levels.  It provided opportunity to train 4 doctoral students in scaffold-free muscle and tendon tissue engineering, including the design, fabrication and calibration of an electrical and mechanical bioreactor, and functional characterization of engineered single fibers.  This project also supported 17 semester-long research opportunities to 9 different undergraduate students through RPI?s Undergraduate Research Program (URP), and 7 summer research projects to high school students, with the majority of theses being female or underrepresented minority students.  In addition, this CAREER Award supported several outreach programs, including a Biomedical Engineering module for Design Your Future Day, a K-12 education outreach program for nearly 300 11th grade girls from the Capital Region, New York state, and across New England, designed to engage students in activities, and to inform and excite them about career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines.      2.  In addition, this project has also developed a "Biomaterials" educational module, including the experiments and all necessary hardware, to be deployed at the high school level, as well as an adjusted version for outreach at the elementary school level.  This module explores the structure-function relationship of fiber-reinforced composite materials, with special focus on collagenous tissues - such as tendon, ligament, and skin - at a variety of scales through hands-on experiments.
