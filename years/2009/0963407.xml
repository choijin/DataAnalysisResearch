<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the renovation of research laboratories in a building known as the Corley Annex.  This is used by faculty in Biosystems Engineering and collaborating units. This gut renovation will upgrade the research space to contemporary levels of laboratory mechanical, electrical, and plumbing infrastructure and will result in a series of research laboratories and support spaces for the biological engineering program. The latter include laboratories for: a) Biomaterials Processing and Conversion; b) Advanced Biological Systems; c) Biosystems Automation; d) Biomaterials Characterization; e) Food Safety Engineering; f) Bioanalysis; g) Chemical Analysis; and h) Fabrication, an enhanced Instrument Support Facility, and new controlled-environment rooms.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The renovated facility will be used for research in 1) bioenergy and bioproducts engineering; 2) ecological engineering; 3) food safety engineering; and 4) biosystems automation for natural resource management.  It will enhance the existing collaboration between the Biosystems Engineering and Chemical Engineering departments.  Specific examples of planned research activities include developing new techniques for processing and pre-treating biomass for the production of liquid fuels or electrical power; finding new techniques for converting biomass to intermediate products suitable for more efficient transport and further bio-refining; determining the fate and transport of emerging contaminants in the environment; quantifying the impacts of climate variability and change on water resources; developing innovative food processing and packaging techniques to extend shelf life of food products; refining food traceability systems to insure food safety; developing sensors and controls to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides; and developing data collection systems to accurately measure biomass removals and to guide the subsequent application of nutrients to insure long-term sustainability of agricultural and forest lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will improve the Nation?s research infrastructure by adding new capability to solve problems in biological systems with emphasis on critical societal needs for producing renewable energy, maintaining supplies of clean and abundant water, and improving natural resource management.  The renovated facility will support an expansion of the existing collaboration in food engineering with Tuskegee University.  The research training capacity and capabilities of the renovated facility will support newly approved graduate degrees in Biosystems Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Addressing the needs of the 21st century requires greater reliance on engineering that embraces biological principles and use of interdisciplinary systems approaches. To help meet these needs, the objective of this project was to modernize the biological engineering research infrastructure at Auburn University by renovating the existing facility that houses research laboratories used by faculty in Biosystems Engineering and collaborating units.  These research laboratories are housed in what was formerly the Annex to the Tom Corley Building, which was constructed in 1948 and has 22,822 square foot of usable space.  Only minor renovations had occurred in the building since its 1948 construction with all mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and life-safety systems below standards necessary to support current biological engineering research efforts.  Through this ARI-R2 project, the interior portion of the entire building was demolished and new mechanical, electrical, plumbing, life safety, and data systems were replaced along with the reconfiguring and reconstruction of all spaces to allow for modern biological engineering research.  As a result of the project, the building has been renamed to "Biological Engineering Research Laboratory."  This entire facility is a shared-use building with all labs designated for use by faculty teams.  The ARI-R2 project renovated the existing building and all of the laboratory spaces therein. The following laboratories were created in the renovated facility: a) biomaterials processing and conversion; b) biomaterials characterization; c) advanced biological systems; d) biosystems automation; e) food safety engineering; f) bioanalytical systems; g) chemical analyses; and h) fabrication of research equipment.  The renovation replaced all mechanical, electrical, plumbing, life safety and data infrastructure.  New heating, cooling, and exhaust ventilation systems were installed in all spaces, including fume hoods in the traditional bench type laboratories.  Updated life safety systems and modern cyber systems were installed in the building.  New overhead cranes were installed in three high-bay spaces to allow movement of large equipment throughout these spaces.  Environmental chambers and coolers were added to provide controlled environment research and storage of food and biomaterial samples.  Additional features were incorporated allow graduate students and faculty additional opportunities to collaborate.  The building was also configured to provide modern restroom facilities and compliance with all accessibility requirements. The resulting capabilities for chemical analyses; dedicated space for advanced analytical equipment; dedicated spaces for food and biomass processing; and dedicated spaces for controlled biological systems experimentation (such as fermentation, anaerobic digestion, or soil ecosystem studies) have significantly improved the ability of the faculty and students to conduct research and research training in biological engineering.  This project has resulted in a fundamental leap in the quality and utility of the various laboratory spaces used by teams of faculty and graduate students and it compliments newly approved graduate degrees in Biosystems Engineering.

Undergraduate research programs also have grown significantly through university, NSF REU, and USDA-funded undergraduate research fellowship programs. Since the building has been completed, there have been 18 undergraduate research fellows who have utilized the space.  The newly renovated space has also encouraged collaboration with faculty members from disciplines that include chemical engineering, industrial and systems engineering, food science, pharmacy, fisheries, and forest products.
