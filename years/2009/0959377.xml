<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research and Instrumentation (MRI) program, Eric Ross and colleagues Patrick Ferro, Mara R. London, Joanne A. Smieja and Brook O. Swanson of Gonzaga University will acquire an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) This instrument will provide advanced elemental analysis capabilities at the university and expand research opportunities of faculty and undergraduate investigators in the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biology, and Civil and Mechanical Engineering.  Research projects to be undertaken include studies of molecular films, analysis of metal ion association with lipid bilayers, investigations of crustacean biomaterials, environmental studies of radioactive and heavy metals, development of water treatment methods for developing countries, and investigations of solar cells and hydrogen storage materials.  These projects will allow undergraduate students to engage in fundamental and applied research that will have local, national and international impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer is a type of mass spectrometer that uses a high-energy plasma to generate ions from a sample.  The masses of the ions produced are measured by the mass spectrometer providing an elemental analysis of the sample.  Since this highly sensitive instrument is capable of detecting ions at extremely low concentrations, it is valuable for trace analysis of environmental contaminants.  The instrumentation provided by this award will be available to Native American students and high school teachers through the Gonzaga Indian Education Outreach Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funds from this award were used to acquire an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), a state-of-the-art instrument capable of determining a wide range of elements at part-per-trillion levels.  ICP-MS is one of the most widely used atomic spectroscopy techniques throughout a variety of industries and academic research fields and thus it is a valuable element of undergraduate education and research.  Integrated into the Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry Department curriculum at Gonzaga University, the instrument provides crucial analytical training experiences for all the undergraduate majors and minors in the Department and is utilized by many students conducting research projects in chemistry, biochemistry, biology, and engineering.   The provided equipment is used broadly by Chemistry and Biology Departments to support research efforts in areas such as biochemistry, where it is used for accurate determination of metalloenzyme concentrations, and materials chemistry, where it provides quantitative analysis of doped metal oxides.   Two principle research projects were initiated in these Departments that feature the provided equipment extensively.  One involves developing an understanding of how elemental composition and variability in crustacean exoskeletons affects their material properties.  The high-performance cuticles of more than thirty different species of fiddler crab and mantis shrimp have been evaluated and the studies seeking to correlate results with other physical properties are ongoing.   This knowledge may ultimately help inform the development of future nano-composite materials.      The ICP-MS has also enabled the development of a research program centered on bioaffinity chromatography analysis.  The key scientific outcome has been the demonstration of a viable nanoscale approach to analyzing binding and partitioning events at dynamic lipid bilayers.  Previous approaches with lipid bilayer based chromatography have utilized systems requiring orders of magnitude more material which limits the membrane systems that can be practically evaluated by this method.  The exquisite sensitivity of the ICP-MS detector coupled with newly developed solid supporting materials facilitates the reduction in scale.  A chromatographic approach for investigating ion-receptor interactions at biomembranes has been demonstrated through the study of alkali metal binding to a model ion channel protein.  This data was used to garner additional NSF support that will provide research training for more than twelve undergraduates over three years as the materials and methods are further developed.
