<AbstractNarration>Enterprise network operators must frequently change the design of their networks to reflect new organizational needs (e.g., company mergers). Redesigning enterprise networks is challenging given the need to change hundreds of interdependent low-level configurations. Configuration errors can have catastrophic consequences (e.g., large-scale network outages).   The project is investigating systematic frameworks to help operators redesign their networks to meet desired high-level objectives. Optimization problems are formulated that trade-off the benefits of a redesign task with the reconfiguration costs involved. Algorithms for the redesign tasks are derived by exploring synergies with theoretical work in the operations research community. The project is devising hybrid methodologies for validating configuration changes that combine static configuration analysis with information obtained from monitoring network behavior. Novel techniques based on data-mining are being developed that can capture configuration dependencies across network devices. The techniques are being applied to important and unexplored problem domains such as migrating security policies from enterprise data centers to a cloud computing model, reorganizing routing designs on mergers, and service differentiation policies.  The research if successful will change how operators manage their networks, leading to large cost-savings for IT organizations, and the creation of more reliable and secure networks. The research will foster innovation by lowering the risks in migration to new enterprise network architectures such as cloud computing and clean-slate architectures.  The PI is creating a network configuration data repository available to academic researchers, introducing new lecture material on enterprise management in the networking curriculum, and participating in summer camps for K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The emergence of new technologies such as cloud computing and software-defined networking pose exciting opportunities for enterprise networks. However, to leverage these opportunities, enterprises must often reconfigure existing networks and applications in a judicious manner, a task that is challenging and error-prone. This project developed approaches that make networks easier to reconfigure, designed algorithms to reconfigure networks in a correct fashion, and devised techniques for configuring enterprise systems across in-house and cloud data-centers.  The project tackled challenges in migrating enterprise services into hybrid cloud-based deployments, where enterprise operations are partly hosted on-premise and partly in the cloud. Such hybrid architectures enable enterprises to benefit from cloud-based architectures, while honoring application performance requirements, and privacy restrictions on what data may be migrated to the cloud. Specifically, the project designed algorithms to decide which components must be kept local, and which components must be migrated while taking into account enterprise policies, cost savings from migration, and increased transaction delays and wide-area communication that may result from the migration.  Further, new algorithms were developed to ensure assurable reconfiguration of security policies when migrating enterprises to the cloud.  Our approach involves extracting the end-to-end policies from low-level device configurations, transforming them to handle changes to address space assignments, and placing the transformed policies in the migrated setting.  Often, multiple network designs exist to meet the same operational objectives, and some are significantly easier to manage than others for a target network. Lacking an analytical model to guide the operators, the current network design process is mostly ad hoc, and prone to creating designs that lead to configurations more complex than necessary. In this project, we have developed a new framework for quantitatively modeling the complexity associated with a network design, with a view to developing alternate network designs that are less complex but that meet the same set of operational objectives. Designs with lower complexity in turn makes it easier to make changes to network designs and configurations when required.  A typical enterprise has many users who belong to different departments (e.g., sales and engineering, or computer science and history), and play different roles (e.g., faculty, staff, administrators, and students). In response, network administrators want to enforce policies (such as access control and quality of service) that group hosts along multiple different dimensions. For instance, one policy may restrict access to a database to all employees in the sales department, while another may offer a higher bandwidth limit to senior managers across all departments.

Further, VLANs are complex to manage, and lead to inefficient routing.  The project designed an alternative approach that involves assigning IP addresses to hosts in a manner that considers all dimensions of the policy. Specifically, the project developed algorithms for an efficient address assignment, based on the policy dimensions and the attributes of individual hosts, and a compact list of switch rules that realize a specific network policy.  The research ideas developed in the project were extensively evaluated in realistic environments using configuration data from large-scale campus networks.
