<AbstractNarration>As a collaborative effort, the University of Delaware and Oregon State University propose to operate two Van Pools for the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). The East Coast Van Pool will be operated out of Delaware and the West Coast Van Pool will be operated out of the Oregon State University facilities. Both pools request funds to be utilized in support of National Science Foundation (NSF), Navy?s Office of Naval Research (ONR), United States Coast Guard (USCG) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) funded scientific research at sea. The pools will provide portable lab vans (general purpose, isotope, clean and cold) on vessels. They will charge a day rate to the institution or Agency based on the type of van requested and will be responsible for all shipping and maintenance of the vans and the storage/support facilities.</AbstractNarration>

The duties include; proposals, budgets, deployment scheduling, van repairs, van servicing, and van maintenance.    Logistics  This includes all types of transport charges from trucking, to customs. There were over the life of the grant; 42 NSF deployments for a total of 1,116 van days at sea, and 11 none NSF deployments for a total of 118 van days at sea.    Major Upgrades and Repairs Projects  Multiple vans required floor repair due to water penetration, this was completed and the vans are back in service. Also one van that was damaged during transport which was not repairable has been replaced and returned to research. Another van required a piece of equipment (Liquid Scintillation Counter) be repaired, which has been completed and is operational.  Conversion of general purpose van to wet van was needed for a NOAA cruise, and the construction of a new cold van and shop van were completed.  Due to a number of upgrades and enhancements to the multiple types of Research Vans, a company was contracted to update the drawings and designs to maintain the required documentation as needed for the construction of new portable laboratory vans.     Capital Equipment Projects   Due to increasing van cruise use requirements, a new cold van was constructed. Before the van was completed, it was scheduled for service aboard the R/V KNORR. When completed, it was delivered straight to the ship from the manufacturer and has sailed on a number of research cruises.     Additional land storage space was identified and upgraded to accommodate the new vans which were constructed, and a new fork lift was purchased to assist with relocating the vans during storage and for deployment as needed.    There have been a number of complaints regarding the ability of the cold vans to maintain a desired working climate within the workspace. The majority of these concerns occur in the warmer regions. In an effort to start examining the specification and the reality of conducting these types of science missions aboard ship, it was proposed that environmental testing be conducted. Phase 1, Examination and Testing, has been completed with several recommendations provided. Additional testing is being pursued as part of Phase 2.   Phase 1 CSC Strength testing was performed to ensure proper shipping requirements are maintained, when the Research Vans are transported by commercial carriers.     A request for a shop van was received from the R/V LANGSETH. This shop van was to be used to provide the required additional space to make repairs to the oceanographic systems aboard the R/V LANGSETH, while at sea. The van was completed as a steel option van but followed the requirements as closely as possible to that of a standard general purpose van to insure the van could be used for other purposes in the future, if required. The new shop van was completed and shipped to Hawaii for service in late 2011.          Last Modified: 10/01/2012       Submitted by: Timothy W Deering]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
