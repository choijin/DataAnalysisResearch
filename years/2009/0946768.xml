<AbstractNarration>In what has become an annual event, the French Government and The National Science Foundation jointly sponsor symposia, at the French Embassy, that bring together young investigators from both countries on a topic of current importance and that involves scientific challenges.  For 2009, the topic was digital identity management, an important subtopic under the Trustworthy Computing Program?s emphasis area on ?fundamentals?.  In bringing together these young scientists, it is anticipated that the field will be advanced by getting researchers together on problems that benefit from consideration of culture differences between the two countries (as is the case with the study of privacy issues),  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very broad view of identity management is being considered, including biometrics and other methods for authentication,  forensics to determine if after-the-fact an authentication violation took place, cryptographic and other methods to achieve anonymity, and metrics to determine the effectiveness of methods individually and in combination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI created a program that consists of invited talks, talks by young investigators, talks by Government research agencies in which important research areas for both countries are declared, and panels.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds requested would be used to reimburse the expenses of graduate and undergraduate students. The workshop is to take place on July 7-10, 2009 in Washington, DC.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our systems are experiencing an increasing number of attacks from all kinds of attackers:  underground criminals, nation states, terrorists, etc.  Knowing who is on your system is vital to discouraging attacks but also to achieve accountability in the face of an attack.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
