<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) and his colleagues will investigate the physics of proton and electron pitch-angle scattering and heating in the solar wind, using multiple spacecraft instruments and relating these observations to solar wind turbulence. Specifically, the research team will study the interaction of turbulence, proton temperature anisotropy instabilities, and solar wind heating, as well as the role of dispersive turbulence, waves, and instabilities in controlling solar wind electron thermodynamics. The overarching goal of this investigation is to understand the evolution of proton and electron thermodynamics in the solar wind and of field fluctuations in the heliosphere, over a wide range of parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team have previously demonstrated their statistical approach to studying the physics of wave-particle coupling in the interplanetary medium. This new investigation will provide a detailed picture of the connections among temperature anisotropies, small-scale instabilities, and turbulence. The PI's systematic study of different wave modes for high frequency electromagnetic fluctuations will provide fundamental constraints to temperature anisotropy studies, as well as constrain the dissipation mechanisms of solar wind turbulence and associated heating. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide for the continued professional development of a junior scientist and the training of one full time graduate student. The study of the non-equilibrium characteristics of solar wind electron distribution functions are of great importance for solving problems related to heat conduction, plasma micro-instabilities, and transport in weakly collisional plasmas, as well as for determining the origin of the solar wind. This work will have broad astrophysical applications as well, since the dissipation modes and instabilities investigated in this project occur in the solar corona, the coronas of other stars and compact astrophysical objects, and in other more exotic environments in the universe, such as astrophysical jets and supernova blast waves.</AbstractNarration>

This work led to a fruitful collaboration with theorists at the University of Iowa studying  the correlations of proton density fluctuations with the compressible component of the magnetic field. We found very convincing evidence that the solar wind density fluctuation spectrum is present as a æpassive scalarÆ to the Alfvenic cascade, and that the plasma beta dependence of this process suggests strongly that the density spectrum is that of the kinetic slow mode, coupled weakly to a critically-balanced Alfvenic spectrum. With the same collaborators, we also provided the first unambiguous identification of Kinetic Alfven Wave turbulence at scales around the ion gyro radius and smaller.  We also developed a comprehensive and sophisticated code for detailed analysis of the structure of the electron distribution functions (eVDFs) in the solar wind using data from the Wind mission, with the aim of producing large data sets of accurate and reliable electron core-halo-strahl electron parameters over the entire Wind mission.

The analysis of this dataset includes the statistical analysis of the electron core drift velocities, as well as the temperature anisotropies of core-halo-strahl electrons. Electron streaming instabilites arise from anticorrelated parallel drifts of individual components of the eVDF.  These streaming instabilities are theoretically capable of generating sunward-propagating Alfven waves, which are a possible driver of solar wind turbulence.  We demonstrate the presence of super-Alfvenic drift of the core population in the solar wind frame and study the implications for wave generation.  We show statistically that the (Maxwellian) core drifts with respect to the solar wind protons and that this drift speed is a simple function of the collision rate, as expected.  In the collisionless limit, the electron-proton drift is large (200 km/s) and may be limited by a core-proton or 'heat flux' instability and could be a source of Alfven or whistler waves.  The unprecedented quality of the electron data set that we produced from Wind is enabling new types of studies of the solar wind. The community has recognized that solar wind electron microphysics  (such as electron heating and related turbulence and instabilities among several other topics) must be a important component of the overall thermodynamics and evolution of the ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
