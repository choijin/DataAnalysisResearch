<AbstractNarration>This project represents a five-year continuation of the Cooperative Agreement between the National Science Foundation and Cornell University that supports upper atmospheric research at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory. Operated by the Geophysical Institute of Peru. Jicamarca is the equatorial anchor of the Upper Atmospheric Facilities radar chain and is the scientific community's main source of information about the equatorial ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Multiple new lines of scientific inquiry will be pursued at Cornell and Jicamarca expressly under this award. The broad goal is to quantify chemistry, transport, energetics, and dynamics in the equatorial ionosphere with radar and optical observations and compare the results with prevailing and emerging theories and models. Our investigations are organized into two priority areas -understanding the stable ionosphere and understanding the unstable ionosphere. They are driven by specific, fundamental questions pertaining to 1) topside composition and thermal structure, 2) F region photoelectrons, 3) E region thermodynamics, 4) D region physics, 5) forecasting equatorial spread F, 6) understanding anomalous plasma irregularities found in the valley region during the day and at twilight, 7) understanding the anomalous "150-km echoes", and 8) investigating meteor-related phenomena. This research will be carried out with the implementation of novel radar remote sensing modes&lt;br/&gt;and the development of enabling technologies which exploit Jicamarca's unique capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the course of this project, the main radar at Jicamarca and some of its peripheral systems are to undergo upgrades and modernization to facilitate the research outlined above. The new Integrated Plan for the NSF Upper Atmospheric Facilities identified ten experimental requirements for facilities, and our upgrade plans are organized along the lines of these requirements. Improvements to our transmitters, receivers, antennas, data acquisition system, cluster instruments, and databases will be made. Jicamarca's most important activity is providing service to the scientific community. This entails developing observing modes of general use or on demand for visiting or remote users, providing observing time and collecting and archiving the data that result, providing access to the data through an intuitive and accessible database, and allowing real-time access to the data to the greatest extent possible. Jicamarca is taking steps to improve community service with plans to 1) implement common programs for standard incoherent scatter data acquisition modes, 2) streamline the scheduling process, 3) unify the numerous databases used to distribute Jicamarca data, 4) improve and expand real-time analysis and diagnostic capabilities, and 5) improve facility visibility and transparency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader significance, the study of the Earth's ionosphere in general and the equatorial ionosphere in particular, aims to better understand the adverse effects it has on systems on which our technological society increasingly depends. The effects include the disruption of satellite-based communication and navigation systems like GPS, interference with terrestrial HF communication and over-the-horizon (OTH) radar systems, and the production of artifacts in synthetic aperture (SAR) and other kinds of radar imagery. Meteoroids of the size observed at Jicamarca could also pose a threat to space vehicles and habitats. Equatorial spread F (ESF) is nature's attempt to release free energy bound up in the ionospheric configuration near the equator, which becomes unstably stratified at twilight. The release involves plasma dynamics occurring over scale sizes ranging from centimeters to hundreds of kilometers, producing rapid flows and deep plasma depletions; these plasma irregularities function as a diffraction screen for radio signals passing through it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jicamarca's mission also complements the primary mission of Cornell University, which is education. Cornell and other undergraduate, graduate, and professional students benefit from research at the observatory through direct participation in advanced research projects as well as through additions to the engineering curriculum. Societal impact comes largely through education and career development in the strategic area of radar remote sensing and also through technological and mathematical contributions to other disciplines in aeronomy, space physics, radio science, and astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Located outside Lima, Peru, The Jicamarca Radio Observatory is the equatorial anchor of the NSF Atmospheric and Geospace (AGS) Facilities chain and is the aeronomy community's main source of information about the equatorial ionosphere and upper atmosphere. At Jicamarca, subjects ranging from basic plasma science to applied space weather forecasting are studied. mainly through the use of incoherent scatter radar techniques. Jicamarca's capabilities as an incoherent and coherent scatter radar have expanded during the previous five-year term of the award, and over 100 investigators from more than 40 institutions used these and other capabilities to conduct research leading to 105+ publications and 15 theses in areas of aeronomy, plasma physics, remote sensing, and signal processing.  Numbered among the investigators were 33 graduate students who utilized Jicamarca to advance their scientific careers, with 7 if these individuals continuing their work as postdocs.   Jicamarca's mission is to deepen our understanding of the equatorial and low-latitude atmosphere and ionosphere and the systems to which they are coupled, foster the creation of avant-garde radar and radio remote sensing techniques, train and educate new generations of space physicists and radio scientists and technicians, expand its own capabilities through upgrade and invention, and broaden its role internationally.  Below, just two of the many scientific accomlishments of the observatory achieved during the past five years are outlined. Accomplishments like these are the basis for the intellectual merit of the project.  Stratospheric Sudden Warming:  Several external sources of ionospheric forcing are well recognized, including solar wind-magnetospheric processes and lower atmospheric winds and waves. A role for lower atmospheric forcing has for many years been suggested, but clear evidence has been elusive. In the last few years, evidence emerged surrounding large meteorological events called sudden stratospheric warming (SSW). Rapid progress followed as a result of (1) extensive observing campaigns and (2) solar minimum conditions. The former were instrumental for capturing conditions before, during, and after peak SSW temperatures and wind perturbations. The latter provided conditions of reduced forcing from solar wind-magnetospheric processes. Plasma drift observations at Jicamarca were crucial for the identification of the SSW connection. Although the first clear event was identified in January, 2008, once the pattern was recognized, clear connections could be identified in archival data, SSWs are now widely recognized as being responsible for considerable ionospheric variability.  ESF forecasting  Equatorial spread  (ESF) has been a research focus at Jicamarca since nearly the beginning of its life and is a recurring theme for space weather studies sponsored by NSF, NASA, and other U.S. and international agencies. It is the component of space weather with the most frequent, direct impact on critical operational systems like satellite communications and GNSS. ESF is observed at Jicamarca using a number of low-power modes and is a source of clutter, albeit interesting clutter, in incoherent scatter measurements.  Starting in late 2012, a program was begun to ``forecast'' ESF uising numerical simulations developed at Cornell and incorporating data from quarterly campaigns. The quotation marks are used here since the forecasts are all after the fact. Drivers to the model include electric fields measured by Jicamarca and neutral winds derived from regional FPI observations. Simulation outcomes are compared with radar imagery and other telltales of ESF measured by Jicamarca. Overall, comparisons between forecasts and observations have been very favorable.  The broader impact of research at Jicamarca comes in the form of user support, training and education, the hosting of international meetings and events, and outreach, particularly in Peru.
