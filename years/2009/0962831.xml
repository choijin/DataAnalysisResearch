<AbstractNarration>Technical. An international symposium on functional pi-electron systems (F-pi-9) will be held at the Georgia Institute of Technology, May 23-28, 2010. The goal of the symposium is to provide a forum that attracts a diverse audience to learn about state-of-the-art research in the area of functional pi-electron systems. The idea is to promote discussions of broad applications of functional pi-electron systems covering fundamental aspects of chemistry, physics, and materials research, and to provide exposure to technology drivers and biologically important systems that are often neglected at more specialized conferences on displays, organic photovoltaics, and nonlinear optics. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical. An important impact of this conference will be to increase the attendance of scientists and students from underrepresented groups. Strong efforts will be made to improve the inclusion of women and minorities in fields related to chemistry, physics and materials science of electronic and photonic materials. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established among universities, research institutions, and industry. The requested NSF funds will be used to support the registration of women and under-represented minority researchers or faculty members who are professors at a minority serving institution and who will bring minority students with them to the conference. The symposium is co-supported by the MPS Divisions of Chemistry [MSN (Macromolecular/Supramolecular/Nanochemistry) Program] and Materials Research [EPM (Electronic and Photonic Materials) Program].</AbstractNarration>
