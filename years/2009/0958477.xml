<AbstractNarration>This proposal aims to establish a network forensics lab at University of Massachusetts Lowell. This proposed research and education infrastructure consists of network devices, such as network analyzers, Cisco routers, spectrum analyzer, and software for collecting and analyzing wired and wireless data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested infrastructure will support three projects focusing on network forensics: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Tracing Anonymous Criminals on the Internet &lt;br/&gt;(2) Localizing and Locking Anonymous Malicious Wireless Mobiles &lt;br/&gt;(3) Fingerprinting Wireless Mobiles for Forensics Purpose &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects will address issues that are critical to the nation?s security and will train students who will be sought out by industrial companies and research laboratories. The proposed research will also position UMass Lowell among the leaders in network forensics research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three projects in this proposal have the following broader impact: &lt;br/&gt;(i) The proposed infrastructure will enhance the research and education of network forensics, and will create an opportunity for developing new courses on network forensics and data recovery and analysis in UMass Lowell. &lt;br/&gt;(ii) The proposed infrastructure will also enhance the collaborations that already exist between UMass Lowell, regional security industry, and the other UMass campuses.</AbstractNarration>

Researchers on our campus and from other  universities have been utilizing the infrastructure for their research  and education activities. Our student Zhongli Liu (female) won a silver  medal at Student Research Competition (SRC) at ACM MobiCom 2011 with her  preliminary work on aerial localization using a mini-helicopter for  aerial surveillance and forensic localization. Please see the attached  photo of the team at MobiCom 2011, Las Vegas in September, 2011.  Equipment purchased through this grant and infrastructure established  through this grant have been catalyzing the proposed research. In 2011, 3  papers from our group were accepted by Infocom 2012 main conference  (accept ratio %16) and one accepted by the mini-conference (accept ratio  %23). Three papers were accepted by Infocom 2012 main conference and  two papers were accepted by Infocom 2013 main conference. Two papers  were accepted by Infocom 2014. Our journal papers have been published by  IEEE/ACM Transaction on Networking, and IEEE Transaction on Mobile  Computing and Computer Networks. We won the best paper award at the 8th  International Conference on Wireless Algorithms, Systems, and  Applications (WASA 2013). Our work is chosen as the spotlight paper for  the February 2014 issue of the IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing  (TMC).
