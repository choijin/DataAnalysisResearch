<AbstractNarration>This project is leading to the development of new platinum- and palladium-based alloys. Platinum and palladium alloys are important in environmental technologies (catalysts for reducing harmful gases and electrodes in fuel cells, for example) and are important economically in jewelry as well. The project combines both computer modeling and experiment, in collaboration with a group in South Africa that specializes in platinum and palladium research. The computer modeling tool and experimental expertise that is being developed will have use in other materials as well. The project is also providing advanced scientific training for U.S. students both at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The project participants include members of groups under-represented in physics (women and minorities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using first-principles calculations, alloy modeling tools (e.g., cluster expansion), and experimental techniques (mechanical deformation, heat treatment, ion bombardment), new platinum and palladium alloys are being predicted and experimentally verified. The immediate goal of the project is to refine both computational and experimental techniques for finding new alloys and improving kinetics so that thermal equilibrium is reached. A long term goal is to extend the approaches to surface problems so that catalytic materials can be developed. The technological applications, particularly environmental ones, of platinum and palladium (cathodic uses, catalytic materials, etc.) make this project a timely one. Undergraduate and graduate students and members of under-represented groups are being mentored and financially supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MWN is co-funded by DMR-CMMT, DMR-OSP, and by the OISE Africa Region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Discovering Novel Alloys by a  Combined Computational and Experimental Approach  The aim of this research was improving algorithms and software for finding new alloys. New alloys could improve jet engine components (increasing operating temperatures by 1 degree would save one billion liters of jet fuel annually), improve fuel cell components (essential for green technologies), facilitate space exploration (lightweight, high-strength alloys), improve implant technology (artificial joints), boost fuel efficiency in automobiles (lightweight frames, engines, and other components)---to name a few possible outcomes.  We focused primarily on platinum group metal alloys and developed new algorithms/software for quickly building simple models of alloys using only a small number of time-consuming, very accurate calculations which are otherwise impractical for exploring many new possible alloys.

Four important products of the research were 1) an algorithm for making very accurate alloy models which extendable to other types of research as well, 2) a large body of predictions of platinum group metal alloys, 3) a commercial software for alloy modeling, and 4) hundreds of thousands of new entries in our computational materials database, the largest of its kind (www.aflow.org).

This research grant provided training for more that a dozen undergraduate students, a masters student, and several Ph.D. students. Many are now working in industry, government-sponsored labs, and higher education.  Outcome 1: New Algorithm  The fields of signal processing, remote sensing, image processing, etc, have been revolutionized by a new technique known as compressive sensing. This approach has impacted medical imaging, data storage and compression, digital technology, applications of remote sensing for planetary exploration and global warming, and many others.  We adapted the mathematics of compressive sensing to problems in materials science. We use it to take relatively small amounts of high fidelity data and use it to build computer models that can be explored very rapidly to find materials that may have better properties than the current state-of-the-art. (See figure Compressive_Sensing_vs_Fourier.) Models built with this new mathematics are less complex and more accurate than models built with the previous, competing techniques, including those pioneered in our group. The general approach is applicable to other types of problems in physics and represents a significant conceptual advance in model building in computational physics.  Outcome 2: Large Exploration for New Platinum Group Metal Alloys  The research grant extended an effort to use large supercomputers to generate comprehensive databases of materials science results derived from computer simulation. Our effort is hosted at www.aflow.org. It is the largest database of its kind in the world.   Leveraging the workflow from this project, we generated a database of platinum group binary alloys (alloys containing two elements, at least one of which is a member of the platinum group: platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, and ruthenium). Platinum Group Metal (PGM) alloys are extremely important in chemical applications (as catalysts), automotive technology (catalytic converters), fuel cells, filtering technologies, a large jewelry market, etc.  Our PGM work was a comprehensive survey, examining many combinations. We found dozens of new compounds, predicted by our calcula...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
