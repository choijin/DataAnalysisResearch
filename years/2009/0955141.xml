<AbstractNarration>0955141&lt;br/&gt;Campbell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GHG implications of using abandoned agricultural lands to grow bioenergy crops in both the U.S. and Brazil will be studied. This will be achieved by 1) quantifying the availability of abandoned agricultural lands through geospatial analysis of existing land use data, 2) determining the potential biomass yields on these lands through spatial interpolation of field trial, crop census and remote sensing data, and 3) calculating the net GHG emissions from the life cycles of these bioenergy resources.  This research has the potential to significantly advance knowledge and understanding of the climate change benefits that would come from using abandoned rather then currently used agricultural land for bioenergy crop production.  Methodological advancements will result from coupling geospatial data collection, models and analysis with life cycle GHG assessments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Bioenergy has the unique potential to provide a dispatchable and carbon-negative component to renewable energy portfolios. However, the sustainability, spatial distribution, and capacity for bioenergy are critically dependent on highly uncertain land-use impacts of biomass agriculture.  The main objective of this NSF project was to discover the greenhouse gas and air pollution emissions impacts associated with alternative land-use approaches to biomass energy crops. The scientific approach integrated spatial modeling and life-cycle modeling tools with regional applications to the U.S. and Brazil, the two dominant bioenergy producing countries.  These results were shared through 14 peer-reviewed journal papers and numerous conference and workshop.  The following objectives were achieved:  1. Sustainable Land-Use in the U.S.:  Despite the important role that bioenergy may play in future energy systems, the economic and environmental outcomes of bioenergy remain highly uncertain.  This uncertainty is dominated by bioenergy land-use effects that may disrupt ecological systems and food economies but may also contribute to rural development and provide new options for enhancing soil quality, water resources, and biodiversity.  Field studies suggest a path to reduce negative land-use impacts through the application of abandoned agriculture lands for biomass cultivation as opposed to prime agriculture lands. However, the magnitude of the area of these lands is highly uncertain.  This NSF study responded by developing maps of abandoned agriculture lands at unprecedented spatial resolution. The high spatial resolution of these results led to the discovery of aggregation errors in previous work that relied on spatially-coarse global data sets.  A critical finding was that the U.S. abandoned agriculture area is 25-50% larger than previously thought.  Multiple follow-on studies from other research groups have gone on to validate these findings.  The potential bioenergy production from these lands was found to be substantial.  The model assessment included both the potential for liquid fuel production and electricity production.  For the case of electricity, bioenergy could supply most of the energy needed to provide seasonal backup storage for a future scenario in which the U.S. electricity system is dominated by intermittent solar and wind production.  2. U.S. Local Food Potential:  The abandoned cropland study required the development of temporally-explicit maps of U.S. croplands.  We expect that these maps could be useful for many scientific applications beyond bioenergy.  To demonstrate the broader impacts we developed a spatial model of local foodsheds that used these historical maps as input.  In particular, we assess the foodshed potential as the fraction of total dietary needs that could be met if all existing croplands were repurposed for local food consumption. This foodshed potential is a function of the spatial distribution of human populations, cropland areas, cropland productivities, and dietary requirements.  While we found that U.S. local food potential has declined over time, our results also demonstrate an unexpectedly large current potential for meeting as much as 90% of the national food demand. The decline in potential is associated with demographic and agronomic trends, resulting in extreme pressures on agroecological systems that, if left unchecked, could severely undermine recent national policies focused on food localization. Nevertheless, these results suggest a surprisingly large potential at present and provide a spatially explicit foundation for exploring the many dimensions of agroecosystem sustainability.  3. Land-Use Emissions from Brazil Sugarcane Ethanol  Sugarcane ethanol is one of the most widely-used biofuels, and Brazil is its largest producer. Using a life-cycle approach to produce spatially- and temporally-explicit estimates of air pollutant emissions over the whole life-cycle of sugarcane ethanol in Brazil we discovered that even in regions where pre-harvest field burning has been reduced, regional emissions of air pollutants continue to increase due to the expansion of sugarcane growing areas, and burning continues to be the dominant life-cycle stage for emissions. Comparison of our estimates of burning phase emissions with satellite estimates of burning in S&atilde;o Paulo state suggests that sugarcane field burning is not fully accounted for in satellite-based inventories, owing to the small spatial scale of individual cropland fires. Accounting for this effect leads to revised regional burned area estimates that are four times greater than some previous estimates. Our revised emissions maps thus suggest that biofuels may have larger impacts on regional air pollution than previously thought.  4. Education and Outreach  The primary support for two PhD students was provided by this award and summer support for undergraduate research assistants was also provided.   In addition to presenting the results at many scientific conferences, we also conducted outreach to the general public through targeted press releases, resulting in international media coverage (e.g. NPR, Fox News, Washington Post).
