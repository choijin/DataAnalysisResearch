<AbstractNarration>The PI plans to continue research in three inter-related areas. The first &lt;br/&gt;concerns geometric approximation of Kaehler metrics by Bergman metrics. &lt;br/&gt;The work of Tian, Yau and Zelditch shows that Kaehler metrics can be &lt;br/&gt;smoothly approximated by Bergman metrics, and this ``quantization process&lt;br/&gt;has found numerous striking applications to Kaehler geometry. The PI, in &lt;br/&gt;joint work with Phong, has shown that this approximation holds as well at &lt;br/&gt;the geometric level: thus, geodesic segments and geodesic rays can be &lt;br/&gt;canonically approximated by segments and rays in the space of Bergman &lt;br/&gt;metrics. The first project is aimed at deepening our understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;structure of the space of Kaehler metrics: The PI will investigate higher &lt;br/&gt;dimensional analogues of such Bergman approximations using methods of PDE &lt;br/&gt;and pluri-potential theory. The second project concerns K-stability and &lt;br/&gt;constant scalar curvature metrics. Here the motivating question is a &lt;br/&gt;conjecture of Donaldson which asserts that the non-existence of a csc &lt;br/&gt;metric should imply the existence of a geodesic ray along which the &lt;br/&gt;K-energy decreases. The PI will study this via the geodesic rays &lt;br/&gt;associated to test configurations (constructed in joint work with Phong). &lt;br/&gt;The next key step in this program is to prove C^{1,1} regularity of these &lt;br/&gt;rays using some of the recent advances in pluri-potential theory. The &lt;br/&gt;third project concerns the Kaehler-Ricci flow. The goal is to relate the &lt;br/&gt;S-condition and the B-condition (introduced in joint work with Phong, and &lt;br/&gt;studied as well in joint work with Song and Weinkove) to some of the more &lt;br/&gt;classical notions of stability in algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of this proposal concerns the Einstein equation, which &lt;br/&gt;originally arose in the theory of general relativity. The great insight &lt;br/&gt;from physics is that many of the mysteries of the universe can be &lt;br/&gt;explained if one accepts the notion that our universe is curved. This &lt;br/&gt;conceptual breakthrough may be compared to the discovery, dating back to &lt;br/&gt;the early Greek philosophers, that the surface of the earth is curved. The &lt;br/&gt;Einstein equation gives a mathematical formulation of the curvature &lt;br/&gt;properties of the universe which is precise enough to make accurate &lt;br/&gt;predictions for a vast range of large scale physical phenomena. It turns &lt;br/&gt;out, for reasons that remain quite obscure, that the same Einstein &lt;br/&gt;equations can also be used to resolve deep and longstanding problems in &lt;br/&gt;topology and geometry. The partial differential equations that arise in &lt;br/&gt;this approach are non-linear, and their study requires a broad range of &lt;br/&gt;tools from real and complex analysis, as well as algebraic and &lt;br/&gt;differential geometry. This project will investigate the interplay between &lt;br/&gt;these various branches of mathematics, with the goal of furthering the &lt;br/&gt;understanding of fundamental geometric structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Project Outcome Report:  NSF Award 0905873, "Canonical metrics in Kahler geometry"   This project concerns the study manifolds. A manifold is a curved n-dimensional space that appears to be flat if you look at it closely. For example, the surface of the earth is a two-dimensional manifold which, when viewed closely by an observer, appears to be a flat two-dimensional plane. A second example is the four-dimensional physical universe (three space dimensions and one time dimension). On a small scale Newton?s laws of mechanics, which are modeled on flat Euclidean geometry, appear to apply. But the theory of general relativity tells us that the universe is not flat and that its curvature is governed by a differential equation known as the Einstein equation.   In the project we study higher dimensional analogues of the Einstein equation known as the Kahler-Einstein equation (and the related Monge-Ampere equation). These equations, unlike the original Einstein equation, are not modeled on space-time geometry but rather on complex geometry (i.e. the geometry of "imaginary numbers"). Although this may, at first glance, appear to be rather abstract, the original motivation again comes from physics: String Theory predicts that the universe is not four-dimensional, but rather ten-dimensional. Moreover, the extra six dimensions are modeled on complex geometry and their curvature properties are governed not by the Einstein equation, but rather the Kahler- Einstein equation.   One outcome of this project concerned the certain special solutions to Monge-Ampere equation known as "geodesic rays" which are important in understanding curvature properties of manifolds. In an earlier work with D.H. Phong we showed how such rays may be constructed by taking limits of rays in finite dimensional spaces, but we did not know much about their regularity properties. We can now establish that these rays are continuous and that moreover, they are differentiable. In a later work we showed that the tools used to study regularity properties of geometric rays apply to general solutions of the Monge-Ampere equation.   The Monge-Ampere equation governs the distribution of mass on a manifold. In the extreme case where all the mass is concentrated at one point, the solution is called a "Green?s Function". We introduced a new method for constructing Green?s functions using tools from algebraic geometry. At the point of mass concentration, it is known that the solution must have a "singularity", that is it must approach infinity. Our method shows that these singularities can be very general.   Another outcome of this project concerns the Kahler-Ricci flow which is a dynamic form of the Monge-Ampere equation, that is a form which evolves over time. The simplest non-trivial solutions are called solitons. Together with D.H.
