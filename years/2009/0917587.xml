<AbstractNarration>This award is one component of a collaborative effort to fund the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) Science Education Center Partnership between Southern University in Baton Rouge (SUBR), LA, and the LIGO Livingston site in Livingston, La, through the Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF).   The managing institution for LIGO itself is California Institute of technology.   The entire partnership includes the LIGO Laboratory, SUBR's College of Education and Physics, Mathematics, and Science/Mathematics Education Departments, the Louisiana Systemic Initiatives Program (LaSIP) and Louisiana Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (LA GEAR UP), under the LA Board of Regents, and the San Francisco Exploratorium.   The LIGO Science Education Partnership is a project that combines the efforts of a cutting-edge research laboratory, a university, a State educational reform agency, and a leading museum that specializes in informal science education.   The focus of the project is the creation of an effective center for teacher training and teacher education centered on LIGO activities in Louisiana.   A previous award helped create the SEC building, with a classroom and a large exhibit hall, with exhibits developed by the Exploratorium and staffed by SUBR student docents and a (separately funded) professional staff.   This new award will extend and strengthen this success, and begin several new activities, including studies of the way children learn in both informal and formal settings supported by this award, and the effectiveness of the teacher professional development supported by this award.   These new activities will both provide scholarly work on informal and formal science education but will also provide feedback to the project which can be used to increase the effectiveness of the activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF) and the College of Education and the Departments of Physics, Mathematics, and Science/Mathematics Education Doctoral Program at Southern University and A&amp;M College joined forces with the LIGO Laboratory, the San Francisco Exploratorium and other partners in order to utilize the LIGO Science Education Center to create an exemplary statewide educational and informational resource to promote scientific learning and understanding in Louisiana.  This was accomplished through partnerships with a state agency, a world-renowned science museum (San FranciscoÆs Exploratorium), school districts and other universities.  The partnerships provided Louisiana with:  1)    Teacher Professional Development in the physical sciences.  2)    Student field trips to LIGO Livingston Observatory, a cutting-edge research facility looking for gravitational waves, with a science education center (SEC) on its campus.  3)    A unique docent program for SUBR undergraduate and graduate students.   4)    Educational research &amp; evaluation designed to improve effectiveness.     Teacher Professional Development:  Through a combination of summer institutes, year-long follow-up and short one-day teacher workshops, 858 teacher contacts experienced inquiry-based workshops in the physical sciences.  These were conducted by SUBR, LIGO SEC staff and staff from the Exploratorium.  Since each teacher affects thousands of students throughout his or her career, this is expected to have far reaching implications.     Student Field Trips:  6837 students have visited the LIGO Science Education Center under the auspices of this grant.  The field trip exposes students to a cutting edge research facility that is attempting to detect gravitational waves &ndash; or ripples in space-time predicted by Albert Einstein, but never before seen.  After talking with scientists and engineers the students partake in Science and Engineering classroom activities and experience a modern science center with over 50 interactive science exhibits.     Docent Program:  SUBR Science, Engineering, Mathematics and Education students are given the opportunity to act as docents at the LIGO SEC facility.  The students learn more science while at the same time learning how to engage visitors with authentic investigations.  During their time as docents they also act as role models to students &ndash; representing the K-12 studentsÆ next step in their desire to become scientists and engineers.  These largely under-represented-minority docents not only learn what it takes to conduct outreach, but they often develop a desire to do more outreach in their communities after leaving the program.  This in turn has a ripple effect as former docents encourage more new students to become the next generation of scientists, engineers and educators.     Educational Research &amp; Evaluation:  Researchers have found that students who go on field trips are more likely to view science and engineering as a career option, and they learn valuable science concepts in the process.  In addition the research indicates that there are optimal ways of structuring field trips to maximize their educational effect &ndash; such as conducting inquiry classroom activities prior to an experience with science exhibits.   In their final report, Inverness Research Associates says that "Evidence from five years of study of the LIGO SEC Phase II model and its impact suggests that the LIGO SEC Partnership has indeed evolved into an incipient infrastructure that supports science education improvement in the Baton Rouge area, statewide and beyond.  This outcome represents valuable return on NSFÆs investment."  (p. 3)  Inverness also states "We think the evolution and design of the LIGO SEC partnership can serve as a model for other similar Education and Outreach Centers associated with highly theoretical and remote science, technology, engineering and mathematics research facilities."
