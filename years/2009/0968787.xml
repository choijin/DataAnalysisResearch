<AbstractNarration>The goal of this Climate Process Team is to formulate and test parameterizations for internal wave mixing in the ocean interior for inclusion in state of the art coupled climate models. Mixing by internal waves is thought to be a primary mechanism governing the overall thermohaline structure of the oceans, and may have significant implications for climate variability. The project promises to reduce the uncertainty in climate prediction associated with the smallest scale physical processes that cannot be explicitly solved by climate models. The project will address three aspects of ocean mixing: near field mixing at internal wave generation sites, mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy transported in the wave field, and far field mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy away from sources. Parameterizations will be based on data-based relations for wave physics, radiation balance theory, and results from process models. In addition to be being based on sound theoretical ideas, the parameterizations will also be based on observational results from the growing data set of microstructure observations.</AbstractNarration>

Our CPT focused on the turbulent mixing associated with internal gravity wave breaking.  These waves lie on the interfaces of oceanic layers with different densities. Just as waves on the surface of the ocean break, internal waves also break. When they do, they mix colder, denser waters below with warmer, lighter waters above.

Because internal wave breaking impacts the large-scale circulation, but at the same time takes place on spatial scales that are too small to be resolved in current climate models, the breaking must be parameterized in such models. We therefore need to better understand the three-dimensional spatial geography of internal wave generation and breaking.   The oceanic internal gravity wave spectrum, which covers a wide range of frequencies, arises from interactions of waves that are forced by three mechanisms: the action of rapidly changing winds creating so-called "near-inertial" flows in the upper ocean, tidal flow over rough topographic features on the ocean bottom creating "internal tides" (internal waves of tidal frequency), and slowly varying flows of currents and turbulent eddies over rough topography creating so-called "lee waves". All three of these processes have been examined in recent field studies. Near-inertial waves and internal tides are primarily generated in the middle of the ocean, and lose some of their energy locally, but also propagate long distances before losing the remainder of their energy. This dual local/non-local nature of internal waves makes parameterizing their behavior quite challenging.
