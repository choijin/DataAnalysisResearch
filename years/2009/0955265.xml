<AbstractNarration>Objectives:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this Electric Supply Risk research is to establish scientific frameworks and to develop novel algorithms for measurement of risks in future electric energy supply and their impacts on the power system reliability. The approaches include extending the recent advances in risk analysis theory to develop efficient computational algorithms, construct output models of intermittent and variable energy resources, and apply the research outcomes to develop measures of the risks in future electric energy supply. These risk measures will be used to understand and quantify the impact of integration of large-scale uncertain generation resources on the power system reliability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in its interdisciplinary research that will advance the principles, measures, algorithms and applications for understanding and quantifying the risks in the future energy supply and their impacts on the power system reliability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project comes from the fundamental research and the technological advancement that address several key issues in defining the impact of risks from renewable energy resources. These risks directly affect the execution of the national energy policy. The broader impact is also reflected in the integrated education to address a serious nation-wide issue: severe reduction of power engineering workforce in the near future. This project will promote the participation from under-represented groups and women in power and renewable energy research. Furthermore, the proposed outreach to high school students will be helpful to increase their awareness of the benefit of renewable energy and the necessity of risk management.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[NSF Project Outcome Report   The challenges of managing the reliability of next generation electric power grid come from the increased level and variety of uncertainties in the future electric power generation portfolio. These uncertainties, including those from variable renewable energy resources, distributed energy generations, and the market activities, as well as global environmental changes did not exist previously when the theories of power system operation were developed. The underlying challenges are shaping the new normal of the power grid, with significant ramifications in the society, industries, and public policies.   The outcomes of this research project are of fundamental interest to the management of reliability and risks in the new normal of the power grid, through which various energy resources are interconnected. With all kinds of challenges in mind, solutions to a number of pressing issues are developed to address several critical challenges such as power generation modeling for grid resilience management, integration of distributed energy resources, and transmission planning with renewables, etc., arising from control room operations to the market activities.   Expanded from our previous theoretical analysis on control and operation of grid-connected wind turbines, a broad conceptual framework is constructed for modeling electricity power generation of various energy resources for reliability assessment at the system/grid level.
