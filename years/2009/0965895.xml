<AbstractNarration>S-STEM scholarships are being awarded to two consecutive annual cohorts of 12 students who are interested in biology and chemistry. Because supportive social networks are key factors in STEM retention, we are designing programs to support STEM students from diverse backgrounds guided by two themes: 1) research preparation and opportunity and 2) interdisciplinary connections. These programs build on existing programs and incorporate new initiatives including a three-week pre-college bridge program focused on data analysis; science advising clusters; a new first-year interdisciplinary course emphasizing research preparation and interdisciplinary communication; peer-led supplemental instruction and group study; a new workshop series in Research Preparation and Career Opportunities; expansion of our Summer Science Program; and attendance at professional meetings by cohort members. This project is retaining students from groups with traditionally low STEM retention rates, and thus is broadening participation in STEM fields. By opening programs to the broader STEM community, the S-STEM cohort's influence is strengthening the overall culture of the institution's STEM students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our goal was to build a stronger culture of success in the sciences at Kenyon College in order to improve recruitment and retention of students in STEM majors along the Chemistry-Biology continuum. We particularly sought to improve outcomes for students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences nationally and at Kenyon.  Two cohorts of twelve academically talented, financially needy students received scholarships.  Scholarship recipients participated in a three-week summer bridge program, advising clusters, meetings to discuss research involvement and careers, and a first-year seminar class on science communication. They also had opportunities for mentored research, professional meeting attendance, and peer tutoring through our Math and Science Skills Center.   The overall graduation rate of scholarship recipients was above 95%, better than the 86% four-year graduation rate for all Kenyon students.  Moreover, 87.5% completed a STEM major, better than the approximately 40% rate for students who start college with an interest in the sciences, both nationally and at Kenyon. Not only did a high proportion of scholarship recipients finish STEM majors, but they also moved into positions of leadership among their peers. For example, at least eleven scholarship recipients earned teaching assistantships, peer tutoring and mentoring positions, or leadership roles in student groups.   Our S-STEM program led to two major new initiatives that have been sustained beyond the grant funding period.  First, we have developed a ten day science pre-orientation program based upon the goals and activities of the three-week summer bridge program and communication seminar that were funded by the grant. The pre-orientation will be held for the fifth time in August 2016.  Second, S-STEM scholarship recipients started a peer mentoring group that remains active.  This group organizes one-on-one peer mentoring as well as professional development seminars.  A broad group of faculty and staff contributed to the programs funded by this proposal, including approximately eighteen faculty members from five departments in the Natural Sciences, as well as staff and administrators from Admissions, Academic Advising, the Career Development Office, and Student Affairs.  We assessed our program through self-studies, evaluations of specific activities, and site visits by external evaluators in the second and fifth years.  Results were disseminated at several conferences.            Last Modified: 06/22/2016       Submitted by: Christopher M Gillen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
