<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Barbasch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two major themes in this proposal, the determination of the unitary dual, and the structure of unipotent representations. Barbasch will continue and extend his previous work to find necessary and sufficient conditions for unitarity for classes of Langlands parameters such as principal series in  real and p-adic groups. The aim is to find proofs that are as uniform and conceptual as possible, and express the answers in a closed form.  Unipotent representations are (conjectured to be) the building blocks of the unitary dual. Their character theory plays an important role in the theory of automorphic forms. Barbasch will study the character theory  of unipotent representations in the real case, with an emphasis on relations to endoscopic groups, particularly twisted ones. Realizations of unipotent representations as local factors of automorphic forms, and in the context of the dual pairs correspondence are also envisioned.  This research will provide a deeper understanding of representation theory of reductive Lie groups, in particular unitary representations, which play an essential role in the applications of representation theory to automorphic forms, mathematical physics analysis and geometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will generate problems suitable for Ph.D. theses as well as combinatorial problems for undergraduate research. Together  with several faculty members at Cornell, Barbasch will run the ``Sophus Lie Days at Cornell'' an instructional conference designed to expose undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics and other sciences to the theory of Lie groups and their representations, one of the aims being to  get them interested and involved in research at an early stage. The results of this research will be disseminated through research papers, talks at seminars and conferences, and various web sites.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The general purpose of  the proposal is the study of infinite dimensional representations of real and p-adic reductive Lie groups. The field is named after the Norvegian mathematician Sophus Lie, who initiated the study of groups with a differentiable structure. Real and p-adic groups play a central role in the theory of automorphic forms, which in turn has applications to number theory. The more specific purpose of the proposal was to study the character theory of infinite dimensional representations and the unitary dual.  The intellectual merit consists of the fact that the new insights into the representation theory of  reductive Lie groups provide new information about their structure and role in other areas o  mathematics.  The broader impact  is that properties of  infinite dimensional representations such as explicit character formulas and unitarity play a role in other mathematical areas such as mathematical physics, harmonic analysis and number theory.  More specifically the proposal focused on  1) an invariant called Diac cohomology,  2) the  relation between the unitary dual of a p-adic group and the unitary dual of certain algebras called affine graded Hecke algebras.      Joint with P.Pandzic we have studied the Dirac cohomology of unipotent representations for complex groups and real classical groups such as U(p,q) and Sp(2n,R). In particular we have developed a theory of a Dirac index, which is analogous to the index of the Drac operator in differential geometry. The Dirac index gives an expression for the distribution character of a representation.      With D. Ciubotaru and P. Trapa we have developed a  theory of Dirac cohomology for the  Affine Graded Hecke algebra. Unlike for real groups,  no differential geometry is available.   Joint with D.Ciubotaru we have extended  older results (joint with A. Moy) to  blocks of representations other than those with Iwahori fixed vectors. This allows one to reduce the problem of classifying the unitary dual of a group, which is formed of infinite dimensional representations, to that of a Hecke algebra  where one deals with finite dimensional representations. In addition we have worked on devising an algorithm to compute hermitian forms of irreducible modules of Affine Graded  Hecke algebras, and therefore of representations of p-adic groups.  These results were published in peer reviewed publications, and were presented  at conferences and workshops. The most recent ones were an AMS regional conference in Greensboro NC and  Freiburg Germany.  The grant provided summer support for graduate students working towards PhD theses.  The grant supported the "Sophus Lie Days", which brought mathematicians to Cornell to give talks designed to expose undergraduate and graduate students as well as researchers to topics in the theory of Lie groups.
