<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Earth Systems Science (40)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates shallow geophysical data collection, analysis, and interpretation into the Geoenvironmental Studies curricula. The approach differs from models implemented at other institutions by focusing on undergraduate education and by incorporating geophysical technology in multiple geography and geology courses and in individual student research experiences. The project builds on past programs that developed field learning opportunities in surface watershed processes, and is integrating investigations made possible through Ground Penetrating Radar, Electrical Resistivity, and Electromagnetic Imaging in multiple courses via construction of a "curriculum bridge". The project design incorporates studies of local geology, including investigations of karst terrains (sinkhole development, losing streams, caves, springs), complex hydrogeologic settings (surface water-groundwater interaction in variable geologic materials), structural controls (faults, variations in lithology, etc.) of hydrology, and management issues (wellhead protection, site development, landfill leachate monitoring). This project provides opportunities for hundreds of students (over several years) to acquire advanced technical and quantitative skills for conceptualizing and addressing complex environmental problems, builds critical skills related to problem conceptualization, analysis, and solution, exposes students to the temporal and spatial context of field data collection, and provides opportunities to understand the theoretical basis as well as the practical capabilities and limitations of the various geophysical field methods used. The project incorporates formative and summative evaluations to measure the success of the "curriculum bridge" approach it utilizes.  Project outcomes, including curricular/instructional materials, results of student research projects, and the evaluation results are being disseminated via the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) website, a special session on geophysics in undergraduate education at a Geological Society of America (GSA) meeting, a series of regional community workshops, and by presentations and publications by undergraduates and faculty members in appropriate venues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project, Integration of Near-surface Geophysical Imaging Technology into a Geoenvironmental Science Undergraduate Curriculum, allowed the PIÆs to innovatively integrate an otherwise specialized, cutting-edge technology into an inter-disciplinary undergraduate program. We incorporated shallow geophysical imaging into the curriculum of the Geoenvironmental Studies program at Shippensburg University. Our approach was unique in that, no new geophysics courses were introduced in the curriculum. Rather, geophysical concepts and methods were worked into the existing range of relevant courses (e.g. hydrogeology, physical geology, hydrology, etc.) to expose our students to critical aspects of geophysics for environmental monitoring. We tagged this "the Curriculum Bridge" model".  This model has offered our students a unique opportunity that is rarely found in departments like ours; i.e. outside of a stand-alone physics, or geology program.  The goals of the project were to: (1) use inquiry-based instruction that targets local environmental issues, in order to attract and enhance students' interest in geoscience disciplines; (2) enhance the technical and analytical skills of our students through the collection, analyses, and interpretation of geophysical data; (3) demonstrate to majors and non-majors alike, the utility of shallow geophysical imaging in addressing a range of local, environmental questions; (4) gather and utilize hydrogeophysical datasets to enhance hands-on, inquiry-based learning in regular coursework, as well as in collaborative student-faculty research.  Formative and summative evaluation of the project measured the success of these efforts with regards to: 1) the number of students declaring majors in the department from other disciplines and majors,2) enriching student field experiences, 3) enhancing data analysis, technical, and quantitative skills, 4) understanding local resource management and planning issues, and 5) the overall success of this "Curriculum Bridge" approach to integrating what would otherwise be a specialized discipline into an interdisciplinary program.     Specific Project Outcomes:  This project acquired equipment for 3 specific shallow geophysical methods: Electrical Resistivity (ER), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), and Electromagnetic Induction (EM). From fall 2009 through spring 2014, 822 total students      (343 female, 479 male) have been exposed to geophysics instruction through      this project. Many were non-major students.  Undergraduate departmental majors are      represented in this statistic, but at least 257 (121 female, 136 male) or      just under 1/3 of the total were undeclared students at the time they took      the courses. In      Physical Geology (Gen Ed for Majors) and Introduction to Geology (Gen Ed      for Non-Majors), over 30 majors and approximately 108 non-majors are      exposed to geophysical instruction each year.  Based on our enrollment statistics, the      spring of 2014 saw the largest number of students declaring Geo/ESS majors      as new students during the rest of the project duration.  We also saw the highest numbers of      transfer student enrollments from regional junior colleges.  Through      this project, a subset of non-major students (primarily undeclared majors)      who took classes with geophysics ended up declaring Geo-Environmental      Studies as their major.  By spring      2014, at least 17 graduating seniors reported having taken the non-majors      intro course before changing their major to Geoenvironmental Studies.  Up      to 9 courses at Shippensburg now incorporate aspects of geophysical      imaging and a few others utilize products of geophysical investigations to      highlight geophysics as a tool for planning and resource management.  This      project has generated numerous individual student and student-faculty      research projects leading to over 10 conference presentations, 4 mastersÆ      theses, and three manuscr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
