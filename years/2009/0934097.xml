    <AbstractNarration>Center for the Integration of Composites into Infrastructure (CICI)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP-0934097&lt;br/&gt;West Virginia University&lt;br/&gt;GangaRao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP-0934182&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina State University (NCSU)&lt;br/&gt;Rizkalla&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP-0933996&lt;br/&gt;Rutgers University (RU)&lt;br/&gt;Balaguru&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP-0933537&lt;br/&gt;University of Miami (UM)&lt;br/&gt;Nanni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Integration of Composites into Infrastructure (CICI)" with a focus on ushering applications and cost-effective rehabilitation schemes using composites in civil and military structures. The lead institution of the proposed Center is WVU with RU, NCSU and UM as research partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new IUCRC will focus on creating new products for specific applications such as pre-cast composite bridge decks and pavement panels, and protection systems to increase the service life of infrastructure damaged by natural and man-made disasters such as earthquake and terror attack. Advances in processing of composites will lead to environmental benefits, as estimates indicate that natural fiber based composites can be manufactured at one-fourth the BTU level of comparable steel sections, and similarly self-cleaning structural composites will help oxidize car exhaust. The Center will integrate scientific endeavors complementing the strengths of all four universities to advance the composite knowledgebase and applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center activities will enhance the international competitiveness of the American industry in the area of composites including modular construction and rapid deployment techniques using natural and bio-materials; thus reducing carbon emissions into the atmosphere. The Nation as a whole would benefit as composite and hybrid material use would, in general, lead to structures of higher safety, shorter construction times and longer life spans at a reduced overall cost with the creation of new job opportunities. The Center plans to recruit graduate students from under-represented groups, including minorities and women by reaching out to the undergraduate student population at each university. In addition, Historically Black Colleges and Universities will be contacted to recruit their students for center activities. The PIs also plan to publish in various journals and conferences to promote the scientific research and knowledge dissemination, and will utilize separate funding mechanisms to educate practicing engineers and end users who are not familiar with composites.</AbstractNarration>
