<AbstractNarration>This award continues NSF support for the American Statistical Association's Federal Statistics Fellowship Program.  The Fellows Program also is supported by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The overall objective of the program is to foster collaborative and interdisciplinary research efforts that will stimulate the development and advancement of methodology and social science research relevant to issues on which Federal statistical agencies seek to provide information.  The program accomplishes this goal by bringing academic researchers into the supporting Federal statistical agencies to work with agency statisticians and social scientists on problems of mutual interest.  Specific research topics will vary but are likely to include survey methodology (including questionnaire design, data collection, estimation, and analysis), social and demographic studies (including research on the decennial Census undercount, coverage analysis of demographic surveys, and special problems of collecting data on sensitive issues), and economic measurement and analysis (including micro level studies of industry sectors, measurement of labor force characteristics, and measurement of non-wage benefits).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to basic research, the Fellows Program aims to achieve the following goals: provide academic scholars with the unique opportunity to have "hands-on" access to federal agency data; bring about an improvement of the quality of the data collected and disseminated by agencies; develop a research group of personnel for the future recruitment of statisticians and other research scientists to help fill government needs; stimulate methodological and substantive research in academia on the problems of collecting and analyzing data that provide the basic information for making decisions that can have significant effects on society; and increase the interaction and collaborative research and education among federal agencies and between federal agencies and academic institutions.  The Fellows Program directly benefits both the researchers supported by the program and the participating Federal statistical agencies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Federal Statistics Fellowship Program is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the US Census Bureau (Census) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Through this program academic researchers are supported for up to one year to work with statisticians and social scientists in the three Federal statistical agencies. Research is conducted under this program at the three agencies and takes advantage of the data available at the agencies as well as their computing facilities and considerable staff experience in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. The American Statistical Association administers the Federal Statistics Fellowship Program and the research was conducted at the Census Bureau, BEA and BLS.  The overarching outcome of this program was to foster collaborative and interdisciplinary research efforts that will stimulate the development of methodology and social science research relevant to issues on which Federal statistical agencies seek to provide information.  Specifically:  Academic scholars had the unique opportunity to have "hands on" access to Federal agency data through the research fellowships; Accomplished research scientists had increased opportunity to work on important problems in a non-academic environment, where production and research needs are often different and can conflict; Federal agency scientists were exposed to outside expertise, and hence to broaden their perspective regarding the ultimate analytic uses of the data they produce; and A cadre of researchers experienced in problems of data methodology and data uses were developed leading to the pursuit of basic and applied research based upon novel ideas and approaches.   The results of research conducted under the Federal Statistics Fellowship Program is made available to the scientific community through articles that Research Fellows submit to scientific journals; papers prepared for ASA and other professional society meetings that are published in proceedings; and papers and other publications that agencies disseminate in working papers, statistical notes, or technical report series.
