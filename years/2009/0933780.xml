<AbstractNarration>0933780&lt;br/&gt;Dudukovic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many green chemistries, with theoretically high atom and energy efficiencies, do not result in green processes due to failure in scale-up because of inadequate quantitative understanding of the interactions between fluid dynamics, transport and kinetics. Scale-up and design are often based on empiricism when attempting to accommodate new chemistries in old reactor types. This leads at best to suboptimal efficiencies and performance and at worst to failure. A systematic approach that can generate scale-up and design procedures based on science rather than empiricism is needed to reduce the risk of scale-up and enable the realization of new technologies to full potential. The development of such methodology for multiphase (gas-liquid reactors) and its application to a bioreactor and carbon dioxide expanded liquid reactor, both employed for green processes, is the subject of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rational design of multiphase reactors, which is a prerequisite for implementation of green engineering, will be enhanced as follows: 1) the state of the art of measurement techniques in multiphase reactors will be advanced to provide quantitative descriptions of the flow, mixing and phase interactions in systems that are currently difficult to quantify, and 2) these newly developed techniques will then be used to quantitatively describe the fluid dynamics in two multiphase reactors - a bioreactor and a carbon-dioxide expanded liquid (CXL) reactor, which play a role in green processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquired knowledge of the developed measurement techniques and their use in providing the foundation for scale-up of green processes will be documented and disseminated through a variety of means that integrate the proposed research with education. &lt;br/&gt;The multi-scale character of this important problem, its significance, and the systems approach needed to establish the engineering methodology for scale-up and design, provides an excellent opportunity for mentoring of a young post-doctoral researcher in developing the expertise of integrating this complex multi-scale information into modern engineering design based on science. The benefits of this project will reach far beyond the developed measurement techniques, and green-engineered multiphase reactors. The developed methodology will be applicable to many other multiphase processes and will generate new knowledge of opaque multiphase flows at elevated temperatures and pressures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in the emerging fields of energy and environmental sustainability. In addition, via the MAGEEP (McDonnell Academy for Global Energy and Environment Partnership and via I-CARES (International Center for Advanced Renewable Energy and Sustainability), (http:/mcdonnell.wustl.edu) launched recently by Washington University, there will be an international audience for dissemination of these results and for teaching a new science-based engineering scale-up methodology developed as part of this project. As part of a major initiative in "Energy and Environment", Washington University is starting to offer M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Advanced Energy Technologies. The results of this research will be integrated in the existing reaction engineering courses and the new environmental sustainability courses currently being developed. The results of this research will be widely disseminated by presentations at conferences, journal publications and through appropriate websites and networks. All attempts will be made to recruit female and/or disadvantaged minority students to the project. Also, outreach to the local high school students, especially female and/or disadvantaged minority students, will be made to bring them to campus and expose students to the lab setting and green engineering principles and practice via presentations, discussions and lab demonstrations.</AbstractNarration>
