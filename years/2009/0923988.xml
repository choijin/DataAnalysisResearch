<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize and expand the application of piezopolymer nanocomposite technology. Piezoelectric materials are an alternative energy source, which interconvert mechanical and electrical energy. Applications include transducers, actuators, sensors, energy harvesting, vibration dampening, and smart polymers. A strong market need has been for piezopolymeric materials that compete with the temperature and performance level of piezoceramics. In addition to films and fibers, this technology can form nonwoven fabrics, which are excellent geometries for smart materials and wound healing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the transformation of new energy processes that play an increasingly important role to the public in the business and social foundation of the US as costs of fossil fuels rise. Alternative energy transformations such as solar, wind, biomass, wave and fuel cells are now more actively under commercial development and will no doubt continue to demonstrate growth technically and economically. Piezoelectric energy conversions are more versatile than those mentioned above. Benefits come in forms such as transducers, actuators, sensors, energy harvesting, vibration dampening, and smart polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
