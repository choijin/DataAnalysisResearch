<AbstractNarration>In the U.S. as elsewhere, public engagement activities are increasingly common, and sometimes even mandated, for informing science and innovation policy. However, social science has not kept up with public engagement practices: There is little guidance regarding which forms, features, and contexts of public engagements are 'effective' for what purposes and why. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project advances scientific understanding of and provides guidance for the design of successful public engagements in science and innovation policy.  It accomplishes this via rigorous studies of the effects of varying public engagement features and purposes. The present research applies social-cognitive and learning theories to identify potential mechanisms and explanatory variables by which variations in public engagement activities result in different impacts. Studies are conducted in undergraduate biology courses in which students consider ethical, legal, and social issues relating to nanotechnology. In that context, this research (1) creates and tests measures of the potential explanatory variables and of outcomes relevant to varied definitions of 'effectiveness' of public engagements (e.g., for increasing the quality of input, participant knowledge gains, attitude changes); (2) experimentally investigates the impacts of varying two common dimensions of public engagement; and (3) develops a testable model of public engagement based on those results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The outcomes of this research, including the creation of a testable model of public engagement and the provision of proven tools for continued study of public engagements, are designed to help researchers to further advance the scientific study of public engagement activities. In addition, the present research is designed to provide scientific confirmation that can be used by practitioners to guide their efforts in planning public engagement activities. Finally, by involving biology majors as both research participants and as research assistants, this research benefits science undergraduates, providing them opportunities to learn first-hand about social science research and enhancing their understanding of the value and roles of citizens? contributions to science policy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:  This project took critical first steps toward the development of a theoretical model of public engagement for shaping science and innovation policy. The major barriers to the advancement of the social science of public engagement in general, and the problems that impede successful contributions to science and innovation policy in particular, include: (1) the diversity of approaches within and across engagement practices; (2) the lack of theoretical and empirical attention to the reasons why, or mechanisms by which, certain public engagement features connect to various outcomes; (3) the lack of agreement on definitions of "effective" engagement, whether the focus is on the public participant or the policymakers, or, in the case of scientists, others who might use the input; and (4) the correspondent lack of standardized, reliable measures to use to compare different forms and features of engagements.  To begin to overcome these barriers, across five studies involving more than 1200 science students, we iteratively developed and employed measures and experimental methods designed to test the effectiveness of various celebrated features of public engagement. Drawing from educational and social psychological theories, our central hypothesis was that variations in the social contexts (e.g., group vs. individual) and purposes (e.g., learning vs. critical input) of public engagements would change individual and group-level mediating processes, resulting in different impacts on individual, scientific, and policy outcomes commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of engagement efforts. To test this central hypothesis, in each of our studies we randomly assigned participants to different social and cognitive conditions for deliberating about the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) pertaining to nanotechnology, and assessed their changes in knowledge, attitudes, trust in institutions, and acceptance of policy decisions over time (usually approximately 3-4 weeks).     Intellectual Merit:  Little experimental research has investigated the various features of public engagements presumed to be most important for their success. Thus, the present experimental research takes the first step toward filling an important gap in public engagement research and provides a springboard for future iterations of model building and specification, and the formulation and investigation of specific research hypotheses. The primary intellectual merits of the project are the development and initial testing of a social-cognitive model of public engagement in science and innovation policy, and the development and testing of tools (measures, materials) for future model refinement.     Outcomes:  Our studies find that while knowledge of nanotechnology and ELSI issues associated with nanotechnology reliably increases over the course of our public engagements, attitudes change inconsistently, both with regard to their valence, and with regard to the extent to which they are influenced by factors such as ideology. Thus, our findings draw into question the generalizability of prior findings that increased information about nanotechnology will increase attitude polarization.   With regard to cognitive engagement, our research suggests that practitioners need to exercise caution when evoking deliberation. Despite the potential benefits of attempting to support and scaffold deeper levels of engagement and critical thinking, we find that overt attempts to promote and train critical thinking can backfire and create disengagement. However, prompts or "nudges" to increase deeper engagement can be effective.  Regarding social aspects of public engagement and deliberation, our results challenge the seemingly nearly ubiquitous presumption of the benefits of group discussion, and suggest that discussion may be more important for the purpose of equalizing the engagement of certain groups (e.g., enhancing women's levels of engagement to bring them up to the level...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
