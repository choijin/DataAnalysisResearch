<AbstractNarration>0923425&lt;br/&gt;Hamoush&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This major research instrumentation (MRI) proposal requests funding for a Dynamic Shear Rheometer, Bending Beam Rheometer, Direct Tension-Blister Test, Sessile drop device, and soil and asphalt test system. This instrumentation will provide important research tools for North Carolina A&amp;T State University. The instruments will be used for interdisciplinary studies of a bio-based and bio-degradable adhesive for construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this instrumentation, the investigators will study the usefulness of by-products of bio-fuel in construction adhesives. In particular, this study will investigate the replacement of petroleum-based adhesives (a non-biodegradable material) with biobased, bio-degradable adhesives from swine manure. This study will investigate the rheological characteristics of bio-based adhesives and compare them with those of petroleum-based adhesives. The requested instrumentation will lead to fundamental improvements in properties of construction adhesives and considerable reduction in the cost of their manufacture. The goals of this research are to both eliminate the need for storing swine manure and to improve the nation's sustainable infrastructural systems through appropriate usage of these by-products in construction adhesives such as asphalt binder and sealant used in highway and airport pavement. This results in major improvements in environmental and economical impacts in both the agricultural and construction sectors. Hence, this project offers a unique, simultaneous approach that addresses increasing depletion of petroleum resources and development of sustainable construction adhesives for infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As part of this grant several rheological testing equipments were acquired to study merits of application of residue from bio-fuel production as construction adhesives.  To support the implementation of the project, the Civil Engineering department at NC A&amp;T spent considerable effort to renovate and prepare the laboratory.   Using the acquired equipment, several by-products of the bio-fuel production process (bio-adhesives, bio-chars and black water; with the main focus being on bio-adhesives) were characterized.  The results of the study showed, the remaining residue from bio-fuel production can be processed to produce bio-adhesive for construction.  As part of this project we developed a vacuum distillation method that can separate bio-oilÆs light compounds while controlling the residueÆs viscosity to produce bio-adhesive for use in roofing and pavement construction.    To produce bio-oil, thermochemical conversion of swine manure followed by filtration and vacuum distillation was used.  Chemical and Rheological characterization of bio-adhesives showed bio-adhesives can be promising candidates for use as renewable resources to partially replace asphalt binder in paving and roofing applications.  The impact of the proposed research can be demonstrated through socio-economic benefits for the $11.7 billion asphalt industry and the $16 billion hog industry.  Developing bio-adhesive from swine manure creates new jobs related to production and application of bio-adhesive and new sources of revenue for hog producers.  It also reduces the negative environmental impact from swine production facilities while enhancing pavement and construction sustainability.
