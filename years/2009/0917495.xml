<AbstractNarration>WGBH is producing a PBS television series, with accompanying web and outreach activities for 9- to 12-year-olds, to inspire a generation of budding engineers.  Design Squad: Nate's Roadtrip (working title) will be a 10-part television series that is building on WGBH's prior award-winning work. The series goal is to engender enthusiasm and promote understanding of, and interest in, engineering and technology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind the fun that this lively show envisions is a serious educational purpose--to get kids to think like engineers and understand how to use science and technology to solve real-life problems. The television programs will be complemented with an extensive companion web site, as well as materials and training for engineers to mount Design Squad events in public venues and run workshops in schools, afterschool programs and libraries.  The web site will create a platform for an online community where young participants will share their own projects, see what others have made, and send in questions to the host.  Outreach activities will be supported by WGBH's ongoing relationships in the educational and engineering community, including the Girl Scouts, International Technology Education Association, NASA, and the Intel Computer Clubhouses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viridian inSight will conduct summative evaluation of the project to measure project impacts including knowledge of science and engineering concepts and the design process; attitudes towards engineering; awareness of and interest in engineering career opportunities; and the extent to which kids perceive engineering as creative, rewarding, and socially relevant.  Design Squad: Nate's Roadtrip Video Blog is slated to premiere February 2010 and the television show is slated to premiere in October 2010.</AbstractNarration>

Kass  Program Officer Email Address: vkass@nsf.gov  Program Officer Phone Number: (703)292-5095   Design Squad Nation was a 10-part series of TV shows and video blogs that built on the success of the Peabody and Emmy Award-winning PBS reality competition series Design Squad to get ætweens and teens involved in engineering. Driving the action were Judy and Adam, two twenty-something engineers working with kids across America to make their wishes come true through engineering. Whether it was a park for skaters at the White Mountain Apache Reservation in Arizona or a playground for kids in a rural village high in NicaraguaÆs northern mountains, Design Squad Nation showed that engineering is not about hiding away in some lab; it is about being active, taking risks, collaborating with interesting people, and using science, math, and technology to solve real problems. Online, the project provided children with a forum to brainstorm, submit project ideas, and respond to the ideas of others through sketches and real world prototypes. And offline, its 40 hands-on engineering activities and public events enabled children to exercise their own design skills at home, tapping into their ingenuity and teaching them how to think like engineers.  More specifically, Design Squad Nation achieved the following project goals: (1) address a critical need in engineering education and childrenÆs media, (2) provide support for the educators who work directly with them, and (3) increase studentsÆ knowledge of engineering and the design process.     (1) Address a critical need in engineering education and childrenÆs media   Our rebranded series, with its new format, was recognized with two esteemed awards the Emmy Award for New Approaches Daytime ChildrenÆs Television and the ParentsÆ Choice Gold award for Television. In addition, the project was covered in such top tier news publications as New York Daily News (circulation 512,520) and The New York Times (circulation 876,638) and national broadcast outlets such as a category on Jeopardy! (viewership 8,383,518). Even more gratifying, the winner of our Trash to Treasure contest was honored at the White House Science Fair in October. On the Web site, we created an online community for sharing user-generated content. In local communities, we staged public events that get kids and families engaged in hands-on design challenges. Through our outreach, we provided approaches for modeling the design process with kids through training opportunities; educational resources; and support for teachers, engineers, and informal educators. In collaboration with our 90 partners, since the launch of Design Squad Nation, we participated in and/or supported 26 events, reaching 33,191 kids, parents, and educators. We were also involved in 11 events targeted at educators (conferences and other professional development opportunities) and 35 trainings throughout the country, reaching 3,265 educators and engineers.      (2) Increase studentsÆ knowledge of engineering and the design process  Concord Evaluation Group conducted two summative evaluations to measure the impact of the TV show and the projectÆs educational resources (classroom materials, video assets, interactive components, and hands-on activities). The specific impacts measured included: knowledge of science and engineering concepts and the design process; attitudes towards engineering; awareness of and interest in engineering career opportunities; and the extent to which engineering was perceived as creative, rewarding, and socially relevant.   In their studies, CEG found that after using Design Squad Nation resources, middle school kids were significantly MORE likely to&hellip;    Demonstrate an under...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
