<AbstractNarration>Hardware trust has become important and has seen major growth over the last several years. There is a large and active group of academic and industry researchers working on various aspects of the hardware trust problem. However, most research in this area is currently carried out in an ad-hoc fashion and results are reported using figures of merit that prevent objective cross-field comparisons of Trojan detection schemes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few benchmark circuits infected with hardware Trojans (called trust benchmarks) are developed. The trust benchmarks pass a thorough test procedure and several detection techniques. To support further validation of the trust benchmarks, hardware platforms are developed to validate trust benchmarks and a web portal is set up to make the benchmarks and hardware platforms available to help accelerate research in hardware security and trust. Technical meetings are scheduled to collect feedbacks from experts in the community about the benchmarks and hardware platforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal include development of (i) a detailed taxonomy for Trojans, (ii) a set of static trust benchmarks, (iii) a number of hard-to-detect Trojans, (iv) hardware platforms for hardware emulation and validation of Trojan detection methods, and (v) a repository called Trust-Hub. A trust benchmark is selected for fabrication using the MOSIS program.</AbstractNarration>
