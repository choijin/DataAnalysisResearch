<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The northern Ford ranges in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica, record events and processes that transformed a voluminous succession of Lower Paleozoic turbidites intruded by calc-alkaline plutonic rocks into differentiated continental crust along the margin of Gondwana. In this study the Fosdick migmatite?granite complex will be used to investigate crustal evolution through an integrated program of fieldwork, structural geology, petrology, mineral equilibria modeling, geochronology and geochemistry. The PIs propose detailed traverses at four sites within the complex to investigate Paleozoic and Mesozoic orogenic cycles. They will use petrological associations, structural geometry, and microstructures of host gneisses and leucogranites to distinguish the migration and coalescence patterns for remnant melt flow networks, and carry out detailed sampling for geochronology, geochemistry and isotope research. Mafic plutonic phases will be sampled to acquire information about mantle contributions at the source. Mineral equilibria modeling of source rocks and granite products, combined with in situ mineral dating, will be employed to resolve the P?T?t trajectories arising from thickening/thinning of crust during orogenic cycles and to investigate melting and melt loss history. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This work involves research and educational initiatives for an early career female scientist, as well as Ph.D. and undergraduate students. Educational programs for high school audiences and undergraduate courses on interdisciplinary Antarctic science will be developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research in the Marie Byrd Land province of West Antarctica examined the process of transformation of a pile of muddy, oceanic sediments (Swanson Formation) into the stable continental crust of West Antarctica. The Swanson Formation accumulated in deep troughs in the sea, bordering the Gondwana supercontinent, early in Cambrian time.  The æmatureÆ crust of West Antarctica now is dominated by granitoid rocks, the Ford Granodiorite and Byrd Coast Granite.  This stabilized crust of West Antarctica would be emergent above sea level, were it not for the continental ice sheet that has sufficient mass to depress much of West Antarctica  below sea level.   The funded research used an exemplary site in the northern Ford Ranges, Marie Byrd Land, to study the transformation of primitive, oceanic-type sediments into mature continental crust.  The Fosdick Mountains consist of migmatite gneiss and granite rocks that contain the record of the transformation process. Migmatite is a special type of metamorphic rock subjected to extreme high-temperature conditions in the EarthÆs crust &ndash; sufficient to cause melting of portions of the rock, and a change from strong/solid rock to malleable, melt-infused material.  Our integrated research program involved remote field work, structural geology research, geographic information systems (GIS), petrology and petrological modeling, geochronology and geochemistry investigations in the laboratory. Structural geology and modeling allowed us to understand the physical-chemical processes for melt movement from deeper to higher levels in the crust. Using isotope characteristics of a refractory (non-meltable) mineral, zircon, that is a constituent of granite, we were able to identify and gauge the progress of key processes including: rock melting, melt extraction, melt migration, and coalescence into uniform granites.   Formation and removal of granitic melt from an immature source rock resulted in differentiation of the quartz + feldspar components of rock from the refractory (un-meltable; usually, iron- and magnesium- rich) minerals in the original rock.  Elsewhere, operating at subduction zones, this magmatic process is known to cause large-scale differentiation of continents. Our contribution from West Antarctica is new and informative because the region was situated on the margin of the Gondwana supercontinent, where a vast quantity of clay- and feldspar-rich sedimentary materials had accumulated. Those  sediments, we have determined, were extremely suitable for the  creation of granite and stabilization of new continental crust. Our work shows that  granite-formation and the crustal transformation occurred in two stages: one, approximately 350 million years ago, and the other, very rapid, event at ~ 100 million years ago; a finding that is beginning to be borne out in formerly-contiguous New Zealand and in Australia.               Project results were disseminated broadly to the  scientific community via more than 20 papers at annual scientific  meetings, seven or more international peer-reviewed publications, and  contributions to the online GIS database for the region being developed  jointly with the Polar Geospatial Center.  The broader impacts of this work are for education and professional development an early-career woman scientist who has now established herself as an authority in a quantitative subdiscipline of petrology research, which has discouragingly few women participants. In addition, a PhD student completed his degree and has assumed a coveted faculty position at a research university in Canada (University of Waterloo). Undergraduate students gained valuable practical experience in use of Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing, and acquainted themselves with opportunities to further their education: these students are now pursuing graduate degrees.
