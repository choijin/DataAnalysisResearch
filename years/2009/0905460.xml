<AbstractNarration>This project will develop techniques that will allow users to help each other create and maintain configurations of complex, pervasive computing and communication environments.  As personal computing environments become ever more complex, growing to include not just desktop and laptop computers, but also mobile phones, media devices, sensors, and more, configuration tasks grow in importance and difficulty. In particular, it becomes challenging for end-users to create, understand, and maintain the hardware and software configurations that allow them to carry out the activities that matter to them. Moreover, this problem will only get worse with time as computing environments grow to include the hundreds or even thousands of different devices and software services that have been forecast by computer scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach taken in this project derives from the observation that, even as each user may have specific devices, services, and preferences that make it difficult for her to find information relevant to their particular needs, there frequently exists some other user, somewhere, who has experienced and solved a similar problem. This other user's knowledge would doubtless be of great benefit to the first user, but existing tools for seeking help and modifying configurations do not make it easy for such information exchange to take place. An important goal, then, is to match each user with the knowledge she needs in order to accomplish the configuration tasks facing her, on the assumption that such knowledge resides with some other user with a similar system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address a number of challenges, including: 1) How can "configuration knowledge" be identified and made available without placing undue burden on the individuals who possess it? 2) How can help-seekers be presented with information in a way that allows them to act on it with minimal effort and likelihood of error? 3) How can the complexity of large spaces of possible configurations be reduced to only the dimensions that matter for users' decision-making? In order to address these challenges, this project will develop the Collaborative Configuration Service (CCS) - a general service that collects configuration information from various users of a particular system and matches similar users with each other for the purpose of providing help. Through an iterative study-build-evaluate process, research will construct and refine CCS by adapting it successively to three different user communities: users of an ambient information device (Chumby), users of an open source software-based home media system (MythTV), and people representing the "early majority" of home media networking users.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supporting users to gain control and receive help with the configuration and operation of open, evolving pervasive computing environments will lower the barrier to the adoption of those environments. This will lead to benefits to both the end-users themselves and to the companies for whom an open marketplace for pervasive computing services and components will present opportunities for competition and technological innovation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Through multiple studies, this project examined emerging practices around the configuration and control of complex end-user technology, and sought to develop new approaches to easing the burdens of managing such technologies. Broadly speaking, we found that configuration requires specific ways of communication solutions (and problems), capturing others' solutions is important, creating systems that automatically do this is difficult (but we found some places where it is possible), and more tools for activity capture and sharing will be important.   Studies of Emerging Practices  In our first study, we looked at the community of users for MythTV, an open source digital video recorder project. The MythTV community deals with significant configuration problems collaboratively. Based on an analysis of the community mailing list archive and wiki, and interviews with 12 active users, we found that configuration artifacts such as executable scripts, diagnostic output, and settings files were important in encapsulating and sharing configuration knowledge.  We also examined the work required to align the trajectories of evolving configurations and detailed the contextual factors required when communicating about problems and solutions. These observations provided a needs analysis for the Escalier system described below.    In our second study, we examined usersÆ interactions with both "conventional" (both manual and programmable) and "intelligent" thermostats, specifically the Nest Thermostat. The Nest was the first mass-market system to include machine learning for automating the configuration process. We found, though, that users struggled to understand how the Nest learns from their inputs, which leads to a feeling of loss of control. Many users disabled the "smart" features of the Nest in order to regain control. We also learned that after finding a stable usage pattern with the Nest, users ceased to pay attention to it. This lack of attention led to degradation in performance and unwanted behavior for the Nest. Our findings inform the design of future Smart Thermostats, as well as the difficulties people have in "smart" configurations.   Systems for using social data to help users create and maintain effective configurations  The first system we constructed is called Escalier. Escalier is a crowdsourcing system based in social navigation that examines the configuration problem by using mixed expertise in a crowd using a social navigation approach.  It does this by actively aggregating activity traces from end users and allowing the diverse expertise of a population to be leveraged to uncover more solutions. Through a simulation-based evaluation, we quantified the benefit of using a range of expertise levels.  Based on these simulations, we found that significant improvements in the discovery of viable solutions were realized even with a relatively small number of users (10,000), and that the discovery rate increased as the number of users increases. Moreover, taking advantage of differential expertise within the crowd further boosted the performance of the system. We believe Escalier is novel in its own right and may lead to a range of other crowdsourcing systems. Additionally, we explored discount expertise metrics as a way to measure community membersÆ expertise in relatively inexpensive ways.   We also built Social Overlays (SO), a system that allows a community of users to collectively improve their website. Originally developed to help improve web-based configuration interfaces, the technique generalized to any website. SO enables end&ndash;users to identify and repair common user interface problems through creating annotation "overlays" on web pages as part of their regular use, thereby improving usability while reducing t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
