<AbstractNarration>Technical: The research objective of this CAREER award is to address the fundamental materials research need for future high-efficiency solar cells. While existing studies suggest benefits of nanomaterials in enhancing solar cell efficiency, there remains a significant amount of fundamental materials research necessary for practical implementation. Examples include selection of the appropriate quantum confined materials system, study of the growth and incorporation mechanisms of epitaxial nanostructures into solar devices, and relation of the optical and electrical results to theoretical predictions. Additionally, high concentration photovoltaic systems must operate under elevated operating temperatures, thus degradation mechanisms in nanomaterials is a critical issue. The project is designed to investigate the following materials based topics: 1) vapor phase epitaxial growth and characterization of multi-layer stacks of group III-V quantum dots (QD) using a dot-barrier strain balancing technique; 2) analysis and demonstration of true wavefunction overlap and miniband formation in quantum dot solar cells using both optical and electrical characterization, and 3) study of degradation mechanisms in QD cells under variable environmental conditions. In all of the above, emphasis is placed on understanding the interplay between high quality vapor phase epitaxial growth of the quantum dot, nanostructured solar cell optical and electrical characterization, fundamental quantum mechanical predictions and subsequent carrier transport mechanisms. This project leverages existing activities in nanomaterials and solar cell development at the Rochester Institute of Technology NanoPower Research Labs and NASA Glenn Research Center.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The success of the project is expected to have impacts on the further advancement of nanostructured materials for solar energy harvesting and, in general, nanoscience and nanotechnology. The research and education activities of the project are integrated. This project trains Ph.D. and undergraduate students in the emerging fields of nanotechnology and photovoltaics. Students have the opportunity to spend the summer at NASA Glenn Research Center's Photovoltaics and Power Technologies Branch, learning valuable skills involving nano-material growth and state-of-the-art solar cell characterization techniques. The knowledge gained from the research can be directly incorporated into developing both undergraduate and graduate level courses in next generation photovoltaics, thus involving an even lager body of students in renewable energy topics. Beyond the teaching aspect, the results of this project are planned to be disseminated through both publication and collaboration with companies such as Emcore Photovoltaics and Spectrolab.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Strain Balanced Quantum Dots for High Concentration Solar Photovoltaics project provided insight into the fundamental material aspects of using nanomaterials for bandgap engineering multi-junction solar cells or for advanced concepts such as the intermediate band solar cell (IBSC). The overarching goal of this project is to addresses the need for future high-efficiency solar cells for either space photovoltaics (PV) or high concentration grid-tied solar farms. Specifically, the project has made advances in regards to strain balancing of InAs quantum dots using GaAsP, developing a fundamental theory for strain balanced QD superlattices.  This resulted in a nanoHUB application to predict strain balancing thickness and maximum number of QD layers that can be stain balanced before onset of plastic relaxation.  Improvements to understanding of QD strain balancing resulted in two record solar cell achievements:  the highest reported open circuit voltage for an InAs QD solar cell and demonstration of a record 0.5% absolute increase in conversion efficiency for QD based solar cells.  As well, in collaboration with a multi-junction solar cell manufacture, we were able to demonstrate for the first time that InAs QDs can be used for bandgap engineering of the middle GaAs cell in an upright triple junction solar cell configuration on Ge substrates.  In addition to strain balancing, this project has also enhanced our understanding of QD growth mechanisms by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy using on-axis and vicinal substrates, provided theory to explain the escape mechanisms in QD solar cell and QD interaction with device electric field, and demonstrated experimentally how delta doping can be used with QDs for IBSC application.  Specific to IBSC, we have used numerical k.p simulation map potential IBSC materials that are more suitable than standard InAs on GaAs systems.  Options identified include GaSb QDs using GaAsSb barriers and InAs QDs using AlAsSb, AlGaAs or InGaP barriers.  InAs QDs have been experimentally demonstrated on both AlGaAs and InGaP, with AlGaAs showing the most promise, best material quality and highest electron confinement.  Future work under separate funding is now concentrated on experimental demonstration of AlGaAs and GaAsSb based IBSC.  Our results have been disseminated though both conference talks and proceedings, journal publications, invited talks by the PI, book chapters, software programs developed, websites and outreach activities.  We have published 8 journal articles, 23 conference proceedings, 1 book chapter and a software product on Nanohub.  The project has supported 2 faculty members, 1 post-doctoral fellow, 2PhD, 4 MS, 6 undergraduates and 1 high school student.  One of the PhD students is now a postdoctoral fellow and 2 of the MS students have taken positions at US Government research laboratories.  Multiple outreach activities have been conducted under this project, including solar day activities though the Imagine RIT festival, public demonstrations of solar energy at the Rochester Museum and Science Center and many &frac12;-day solar cell camps and demonstrations to high school students in grades 9-12.
