    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The sixth biennial Gordon Research Conference on Biomolecular Interactions and Methods will be held at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas from January 17-22, 2010, and the first associated Gordon Research Seminar will precede the main GRC on January 16-17, 2010 at the same location. This Gordon Research Conference is a premier meeting that mixes "methods" experts with "systems" scientists working on compelling biological problems. The goal is to develop novel collaborations that enable quantitative characterization of biological samples. This conference has five distinguishing features: (1) First is the multidisciplinary, multi-scale goal of this GRC: this conference brings together biologists, biophysicists, structural biologists, practitioners of kinetics and thermodynamics, chemists and theoreticians. (2) The second defining feature is an exceptional speaker roster that includes most well-established scientists and rising young investigators. (3) This conference is unique in its format and content. Other major biophysical meetings, such as the biophysical society, are larger in scale and scope. (4) Liberal Information Communication: Having the meeting under the auspices of the GRC enables the free exchange of information beyond that achieved by presentations at more formal meetings. (5) A final defining feature of this conference is the accompanying Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), which is organized by and for students and postdoctoral scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This conference has broader impacts at many levels: (1) This conference plays a unique role in facilitating novel collaborations by bringing together "methods" practitioners together with diverse scientists investigating important biological problems. (2) This conference has a long history of training young scientists. The first ever GRS meeting for this conference, which is being organized by one student and one postdoctoral scientist, both women. will be formalized. The main GRC meeting chair is mentoring these young investigators, and they have put together a program that includes student and postdoctoral speakers and a career panel session. (3) This conference is committed to diversity: two of the four GRC chairs are women, both GRS co-chairs are women; two of nine session chairs are women; and invited speakers are from Europe, Asia and the US and from both academic and industrial organizations. The organizers have reserved a significant number of invited talks to be chosen from the abstracts to ensure additional diversity in the speaker selection.</AbstractNarration>
