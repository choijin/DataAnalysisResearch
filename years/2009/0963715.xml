<AbstractNarration>Traditional security authorization decisions are black and white: a user either satisfies a particular access policy or does not.  This rigidity is a handicap in our complex and unpredictable world.  As a result, even security-conscious organizations typically grossly overprovision principals with access rights and/or underconstrain access policies to ensure that principals can always carry out the organization's mission effectively and respond to unexpected opportunities and challenges.  This project focuses on developing dynamic and risk-aware approaches to access control that allow organizations to make security-critical decisions in the face of incomplete information and unexpected circumstances.  This is accomplished by combining proof-theoretic access controls with economic models of risk.  In the event that the expected proof of authorization for an action cannot be generated, the systems developed in this project carry out an efficient search for similar proofs of authorization that minimize the overall risk incurred by deviating from the expected.  This approach allows policies to adapt dynamically to the changing context of the systems in which they are deployed. This research will have several benefits, including increased system availability during disasters or other uncommon cases not explicitly modeled by policies; reduced instances of permission creep, as overprovisioning users is no longer required to ensure that an organization's business needs are met; a quantifiable means of assessing how policies are actually used and how they might be changed to better reflect the evolution of organizations; and the development of metrics for assessing access control risks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aims to study the tradeoffs between risks resulting from allowing access to data and the utility resulting from such accesses.  This project provides understanding of this tradeoff in several settings.   One of them is where personal information is shared, either to enable personalized services or to enable aggregated analysis.  In this setting, metric of privacy leaks is used as the measure of risk.  Two application domains have been studied, namely users' mobility information and electricity usage information (as revealed by smart meters). This project has resulted in new and better metrics for privacy risks in both the domains, using rigorous approaches based on Bayesian inference and information theory. This project has also resulted in techniques to anonymize the personal information to protect its privacy while ensuring its utility.  A second setting is access to critical data in a centralized manner. In many scenarios, the cost of anticipating information needs and specifying precise access control policies is prohibitive. For this reason, many organizations provide employees with excessive access to certain resources, such as file or source code repositories. This allows the organization to maximize the benefit employees get from access to troves of information, but exposes the organization to excessive risk. This project has developed measures of risk based on deviation from past behavior and internal relationships between accessed data objects, which we showed to be effective in identifying malicious insiders.  A third setting is access to data in a virtual organization (VO).  This project has developed market-based mechanisms for data access control that will promote productive sharing of data in VOs while prudently managing the elevated risks. Results include improved understanding of designing insurance-based and economics-based authorization for encouraging information sharing; a flexible, cash-based insurance model for encouraging appropriate information sharing in a VO; salient features of a viable marketplace for risk- and economics-based access control; and techniques for an insurance issuer to optimize a portfolio of access transactions underwritten by the insurer.
