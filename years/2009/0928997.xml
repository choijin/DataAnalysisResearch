<AbstractNarration>The "Enhancing the Quality of STEM Education and Retention @MVSU through Mentoring Strategies and Student Professional Development" project seeks to implement mentoring strategies and student professional development activities to affect the growing exodus of students from STEM majors between the freshmen and sophomore years at Mississippi Valley State University. The project seeks to assist underrepresented students who often have numerous difficulties which deter them from attending college and being totally dedicated to academics. The project will further improve the infrastructure and quality of the STEM programs by strengthening the academic skills and support structures. &lt;br/&gt;Specific components of the project are: 1) a STEM mentoring model to enhance the quality of education to affect the number of students leaving STEM majors between the freshmen and sophomore year; 2) faculty/student research teams to increase opportunities for faculty and students to engage in collaborative research; 3) a teacher education clinic to enhance the science and mathematics skills of K-12 students by strengthening the content knowledge and the pedagogical skills of middle and high school teachers; and 4)infusion of computer security concepts into the curriculum to create and build an infrastructure which supports it as a viable research option for undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;This project is important because a disproportionate number of students arrive at the University with poor preparation for the STEM disciplines. This phenomenon is partially attributable to the preparation and skill level of teachers in the K-12 school system. The geographic region targeted for this project is the Mississippi Delta where 26 percent of all African Americans in Mississippi reside.  Program activities are designed to provide improved educational experiences and opportunities for academically talented students who are pursuing STEM degrees, and to prepare them for graduate school and the workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  The Mississippi Valley State University HBCU-UP project was a five (5) year program dedicated to improving the retention and quality of STEM graduates through research and technology experiences.  The program, Enhancing the Quality of STEM Education and Retention @ Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU) Through Mentoring and Student Professional Development, encompassed four components. Program objectives, findings and outcomes that were achieved are as follows:   Mentoring Component  The objective of this component of the program was to establish a nurturing environment to affect the large attrition rate between the freshman and sophomore years of STEM education.  Program efforts resulted in the production of a mentoring model that improved the retention rate of STEM students from freshmen to sophomore year from 42% to 55%.  Moreover, the graduation rate for students between the 2010 through 2014 years increased by 33% and enrollment increased by three percent (3%).  STEM students also showed an increase in applying and receiving internships which impacted their application and acceptance into graduate programs.    TeacherÆs Clinic  The objective of the TeacherÆs Clinic was to improve secondary mathematics education by enhancing the pedagogical skills and content knowledge of teachers.  Project activities resulted in increasing the content knowledge and enhancing the pedagogical skills of more than 50 in-service STEM teachers in K-12 schools located in the Mississippi Delta. The project assisted nine (9) college students in obtaining teacher certification in secondary mathematics and/or science education. Additionally, twenty (20) pre-service teachers who participated in the Teachers' Clinic have worked in the classroom as in-service teachers.   The program also provided summer development in STEM for nearly 250 high school students. More than 80% of the 12th grade participants enrolled in college as STEM majors.   Faculty/Student Research Partnerships  The third component of the program was designed to increase the research collaborations between University students and faculty in an effort to provide an improved set of research skills to STEM majors who expressed interest in pursuing graduate education.  Over the grant cycle, a total of 19 faculty/student research partnerships were created.  A total of 41 students participated in these research partnerships.  Many of the students presented their research findings at local, state and national conferences.  Some of these conferences included the Emerging Researchers National (ERN), Association of Departments of Computer and Information Science at Minority Institutions (ADMI), Mississippi Academy of Sciences, MathFest, and the American Fisheries Society conference.  Additionally, students presented their research at the UniversityÆs annual MVSU STEM Research Day.      Computer Security Concepts  This component of the program focused on the infusion of computer security concepts into the mathematics and computer science curriculum. Program activities provided training for four program faculty members who subsequently provided training for other STEM faculty in mathematics and computer science.  Outcomes for this component of the program include the development of computer security modules for five computer science classes and one mathematics course.  The infusion of computer security knowledge into the curriculum inspired several graduates to pursue graduate school in computer security including the completing of MasterÆs degrees in computer security and the pursuit of PhDs in information assurance. The university has subsequently employed a faculty member who has earned an advanced degree in computer science with emphasis in computer security.  Summary   Project activities have aided the UniversityÆs STEM departments in improving the quality of their primarily African American graduates along a continuum from high school to graduate education and ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
