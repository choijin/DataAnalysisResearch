<AbstractNarration>0959373&lt;br/&gt;Logan&lt;br/&gt;Washington &amp; Jefferson College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a multi-disciplinary proposal to purchase a scanning probe microscopy system (SPM) capable of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) for Washington &amp; Jefferson (W&amp;J) College, a private four year undergraduate institution.  SPM represents a family of techniques that can image surfaces at the nanoscopic level and would play an integral role in both our research and our curriculum.  AFM would be used in several research projects, including 1) the controlled patterning of block copolymer nanostructures, 2) the development of synthetic cells consisting of an inorganic core, lipid membranes, and biological proteins, and 3) the measurement of nanoscale liquid droplet wetting on rough surfaces.  Understanding and controlling the patterning of nanostructures is crucial in the continued push for smaller and smaller technologies while synthetic cells would combine biological properties with the ease of handling stable inorganic molecules.  Wetting research uses the AFM in ways that are just beginning to be explored, investigating the pinning of the contact line on nanoscale defects, an important topic in all applications of spreading.  The SPM will be housed in the new $32 million John A. Swanson Science Center, scheduled to open in 2010.  Training on the instrument will be significantly enhanced by a proposed SPM virtual instrument.  AFM and STM will also be integrated into the teaching of introductory physics, upper level physics and chemistry classes, as well as general education courses for non-science majors on nanotechnology.  Local high school students will be impacted through our science education outreach programs.  The SPM would thus introduce an entirely new direction in both the research and teaching curriculum at W&amp;J by introducing concepts inherent to surface science and materials research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a multi-disciplinary proposal to purchase a scanning probe microscopy system (SPM) for Washington &amp; Jefferson (W&amp;J) College, a private four year undergraduate institution.  SPM allows us to image surfaces at the nanoscopic level and would play an integral role in both our research and our curriculum.  The SPM would be used in several research projects.  For example, polymer nanostructures could be seen through SPM, allowing us to investigate different ways of controlling the size, shape, and structure of these tiny domains.  Being able to pattern these nanostructures is crucial in the continued push for smaller and smaller technologies.  The SPM would also allow us to develop synthetic cells; these would mimic real cell surfaces but be more robust and easier to handle, providing a model for biochemical research.  Another project would use the SPM to image nano-sized liquid droplets wetting rough surfaces.  This research is important in better understanding how a liquid spreads on a surface, with industrial applications ranging from semiconductor manufacture and oil extraction to paper towels and dish soap.  The SPM will be housed in the new $32 million John A. Swanson Science Center, scheduled to open in 2010.  To train students, we intend to develop a simulated instrument, allowing them to practice on a computer before touching the actual one.  SPM will also be integrated into the teaching of introductory physics, upper level physics and chemistry classes, as well as general education courses for non-science majors on nanotechnology.  Local high school students will be impacted through our science education outreach programs.  The SPM would thus introduce an entirely new direction in both the research and teaching curriculum at W&amp;J by introducing concepts inherent to surface science and materials research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this award was to acquire a scanning probe microscope (SPM) for use in research and education at Washington &amp; Jefferson College (W&amp;J), a private four year undergraduate institution.  SPM allows us to image surfaces at the nanoscopic level.   Intellectual Merit. Part of our research examines the tiny nanostructures formed by polymers, large molecules consisting of a chain of repeated chemical units (like pearls in a necklace strung together).  Specifically, we study polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-PEO), an amphiphilic diblock copolymer that contains hydrophobic (water-fearing) and hydrophilic (water-loving) parts.  The incompatibility between these two parts is what drives the formation of the tiny domains.  To see these nanosized shapes, we use a scanning probe microscope (SPM) (funded through NSFÆs Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program).  We observed that the relative amount of PS with respect to PEO significantly impacts the type of structures formed.  A low percent of PEO results in more lasagna-like structures while a higher percent leads to spaghetti and finally dots (or gnocchi, to extend our "pasta" metaphor) (Figure 1).  Being able to control the size, shape, and structure of these tiny domains will allow us to use them as polymer templates.  So far, we have investigated the impact of such parameters as spreading solvent, spreading concentration, film transfer pressure, and temperature.   Another line of research resulting from this grant investigated the effect of nanoscale roughness on the wetting of a solid surface by a liquid droplet.   It is a fact of daily life that when the liquid advances or recedes across the surface, the edge of the liquid may become pinned until enough force is applied (Figure 2). Wetting plays a role in painting, the manufacture semiconductors, pesticide sprays, paper towels, the proper function of the lungs, and dish soap: so it is a phenomenon of great practical importance.  We investigated whether the pinning of the contact line might be due to nanoscopic defects.  While we did not observe a direct correlation between the surface roughness and the hysteresis of the contact line, we did make some advances in understanding the role of nanoscale chemical heterogeneity on the hysteresis.  Broader Impacts. The development of patterned nanostructures&mdash;controlled at the molecular level&mdash;are crucial in the continued push for smaller and smaller technologies.  The instrument itself has also impacted our students.  Since acquiring the SPM, 11 undergraduate and 2 high school students have used it for thesis and summer research (Figure 3).  Another 15 undergraduate students incorporated it into a nanoscience project in their Chemical Measurements course.  The SPM has thus resulted in an entirely new direction in both the research and teaching curriculum at W&amp;J, introducing concepts inherent to surface science and materials research.  Six students have presented their work at national conferences (Figure 4).  In addition, part of this research has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal (Langmuir, February 2012, 28, 5048-5058).
