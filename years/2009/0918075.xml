    <AbstractNarration>This RAPID proposal describes a series of field and laboratory studies to determine whether the election of Barack Obama, the first African American president, will serve as an affirmation to members of ethnic minority groups and lead to improved academic motivation and performance. Whether this particular event has significant effects on the achievement of students of varying age groups, especially in STEM subjects, constitutes an urgent and important question for rigorous scientific research. We agree with the PI that this research will advance our understanding of how major societal events, beyond the immediate classroom environment, affect students' psychology and achievement motivation. The proposed research will shed light on the social-psychological processes that play a role in the racial achievement gap in STEM-related fields, a critical educational problem. Further the results of this study will facilitate the development of pedagogical strategies, and cost-effective teaching and curriculum strategies that benefit minority achievement and participation in STEM-related fields and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
