<AbstractNarration>The proposal is to support multi-stage queries by integrating knowledge from across different queries, creating a "knowledge mosaic."   This approach, if successful could radically improve and extend web search from one of primarily fact-finding to one of fact-finding and problem solving using a set of related queries which find pieces of information which are then "stitched together" such that relationships and links between the information can be better revealed. The approach to problem-solving becomes one of using a set of related queries which find out portions of information on graph models, building the knowledge mosaic using RDF and other graph-based Semantic Web technologies and extending a proposed new query language SPARQ2L  The resultant view keeps track of what knowledge has been found, and attempts tto combine it in useful ways to provide a more complex knowledge view for the information the user seeks to discover. The research could have pronounced impact on how search and discovery is performed on the web.</AbstractNarration>

Consequently, Semantic Web data models were chosen as the context of investigating the problem of Mosaic-oriented querying paradigms. The Mosaic project explores different notions of "connecting-the-dots" across queries in a discovery task depending on whether the queries are structured or unstructured (keyword queries) on RDF data. The second major focus of the Mosaic project is to tackle the limited nature of the mainstream interrogation model (pattern matching) in knowledge discovery tasks by developing new richer query models that allow more complex questions to be posed.        The outcomes of the research revolve around three major themes:  (i) Indexing and storage for complex path queries on RDF graphs: Since path computation is a natural way of connecting the dots in graph models such as RDF, techniques for dealing with the poor I/O access patterns of graph navigation were developed based using a linear algebraic foundation for solving path problems.

One of the papers earned the best paper award for the Joint Semantic Technology conference 2012. Our work on Scalable Context Aware Search received coverage on technical news sites like Science360 (NSF news site), Engadget, Science Daily, E!Science News and several others and formed the basis for an invention disclosure which is currently undergoing review. The project provided opportunities for training seven graduate thesis students including two primary and five auxillary thesis students out of which four were female.
