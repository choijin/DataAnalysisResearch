<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project furthers the research and development of a completely new low cost high efficiency electric motor for use in HVAC compressors and transportation (electric and hybrid electric) power trains.  Parallel Magnetic Circuit (?PMC?) technology is a breakthrough magnetic force control technology that is applicable to any electromagnetic device.   Unlike alternative existing/conventional electric motors, which use series magnetic circuits limited by the flux density of the most powerful single magnet element, PMC moves flux from multiple permanent magnets and field coils into a coherent and additive geometry - dramatically increasing both efficiency and power density.  The increased power density, efficiency and operating speeds intrinsic to PMC designs are enabling performance characteristics for HVAC and transportation systems providing lower cost, smaller, lighter weight, faster and more reliable alternatives.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to improve the efficiency of over $500 billion a year in electricity usage by up to 10% or more, the potential reduction of over 20% of the world?s coal fired electricity generation and the potential elimination of up to 30% of global CO2 emissions.  Higher energy prices and usage have accelerated the growing global demand for lower cost energy efficient products.  Since over 50% of all global electricity is consumed in electric motor systems and over 26% of fossil fuels are used in transportation applications, it provides a significant opportunity to reduce energy costs, pollution and national security concerns.  PMC motors can be used to significantly increase the efficiency and lower the cost of all electric motor driven systems including electric and hybrid electric vehicles, HVAC systems, industrial, consumer, military applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the final period of the research activity we completed assembling our first prototype system and performed a head to head test against the BionX motor riding a bike over a set road course.  Based on our first results the QMP motor used significantly less energy over the course but was not able to match the course time (average speed).  Our second, refined winding prototype achieved the same average speed as the BionX however the energy savings was reduced to 8.5%.  The data did show a significantly lower temperature rise of the QMP motor, 51 oC vs. 84oC, largely due to the lower energy consumption however still indicating that the QMP motor is not completely optimized and some further benefit in terms of reduced material content is possible.  Furthermore, with redesign of the wheel hub, we can significantly increase gap flux density by incorporating a flux concentrating IPM rotor in the place of the surface PM rotor.   QM Power believes there is an opportunity to makes inroads in North America and Europe which constitute the premium e-bike market, ~10% of the global market.  The company has contemplated a licensing strategy and has engaged in preliminary discussions with an e-bike manufacturer.
