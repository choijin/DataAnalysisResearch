<AbstractNarration>The Bowling Green Community College (BGCC) of Western Kentucky University (WKU) has formed a partnership with state agencies and trade associations to address an anticipated shortage of Water &amp; Wastewater Operators/Technicians. The Water and Wastewater Technician Training Institute (WTTI) builds on existing linkages with the employment sector (water &amp; wastewater utilities statewide), state primacy agencies and technical assistance/trade associations. The project refines an industry needs-driven curriculum that utilizes on-line course delivery to provide options for both traditional and nontraditional students. The partnership revitalizes an existing Associates Degree program titled "Water Utilities Management" and integrates a 4-year pathway into WKU's Ogden College of Science and Engineering through a formal articulation agreement.</AbstractNarration>
