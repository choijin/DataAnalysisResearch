<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to test the hypothesis that machined surface and subsurface quality of dental ceramic materials can be significantly enhanced by rotary ultrasonic machining. Approaches of finite element analysis and design of experiments combined with theory of contact mechanics and fracture mechanics will be employed to carry out the following research tasks: investigate mechanisms of material removal and subsurface damages generation; solve the problem of complex surface machining; quantify machining induced damages; measure ultrasonic vibration amplitude within accuracy ±0.1 micron; and discover the relationship between ultrasonic vibration amplitude and subsurface damages. The educational objective of this CAREER proposal is to enhance the education program in manufacturing at a Historically Black College/University.  The specific approaches involve incorporating research results into existing manufacturing courses; developing a research laboratory; recruiting African American graduate students;  developing multimedia courses to improve manufacturing education;  and involving undergraduate students and K-12 teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research is expected to bring about a breakthrough innovation in dental ceramic manufacturing, which will directly benefit the nation?s medical consumers and society. An innovative and crack-free precision machining technology will be provided for the US dental industry. The research results will also benefit other medical industries where bioceramic materials are widely used such as bone and joint replacements. The proposed education activities in this CAREER plan will improve engineering education at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, contribute to increase the percentage of engineering doctorates awarded to African Americans, and broaden participation of underrepresented populations and non-traditional students in engineering research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This CAREER project has generated scientific understanding and knowledge about rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) of dental ceramics to provide an innovative and crack-free precision machining technology for the US dental industry.  At the same time, it stimulated African American studentsÆ interests in engineering research furthermore to pursue engineering doctorates.  In terms of scientific understanding and knowledge, the project outcomes include:  The material removal mechanism has been investigated. Based upon analytical results and simulation, it shows that material surface strength has been deteriorated by the ultrasonic impact before it is removed by the feeding of tool. Complex surface machining in the manufacture of dental ceramics has been solved by introducing ultra-high speed and precision milling machine. Machining induced damages and their generation mechanism are reported and published.  Ultrasonic vibration amplitude within accuracy &plusmn;0.1 &micro;m has been measured for the first time by using laser displacement sensor  Finally, it is firmly concluded that the machining induced damages are significantly affected by the ultrasonic vibration amplitude.   The project also provided opportunities for training and professional development for undergraduate and graduate students in an Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). It has helped provide research skills and experience to four PhD students in the following aspects:  The grant provides the opportunity for the four graduate students from under-represented to continue to conduct their research in the following three aspects: grinding mechanisms, finite element analysis, and molecular dynamics.  Each student has published at least 1 international journal paper and 2 international conference proceedings.  3 of them have passed their final defense and obtained their PhD degrees. One has passed his preliminary exam and expected to graduate by the end of 2016.    It also has helped provide research training to four undergraduate students in the following aspects:  The grant provides the opportunity for the four undergraduate students (3 of them are from under-represented) to work on their REU project the following three aspects: research literature review, lab development, and experiments.  One student has published 1 international journal paper and 1 international conference proceedings.            Last Modified: 06/29/2016       Submitted by: Zhichao Li]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
