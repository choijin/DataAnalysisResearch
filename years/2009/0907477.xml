<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Electronic charge transport is one of the most fundamental and central subjects in condensed matter physics.  From a technological standpoint, the electronics and optoelectronics industries depend on a detailed understanding of, and the associated ability to control, charge transport. Conventional conductivity measurements, however, are limited to relatively low frequencies and samples for which satisfactory electrical contacts can be produced.  This individual investigator award supports a project to pursue experiments that address previously intractable problems concerning charge transport and carrier dynamics in organic photoconducting materials and in nanometer-scaled materials.  Using an experimental approach based on the capabilities of lasers that are able to provide very fast pulses of light (i.e. femtosecond pulsed lasers), measurements of the high-frequency conductivity of the materials will be made, without the need for electrical contacts.  The scientific results will be of significance not only to the disciplines of condensed-matter and materials physics, but also have the potential to impact several important technologies such as organic electronic and optoelectronic devices and solar cells.  This project will support the education of a Ph.D. student. The combination of basic research involving fundamental issues in condensed matter physics with practical issues in experimental research provides an ideal training ground for career paths from academia to high technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports a project to investigate electronic charge transport and carrier dynamics in an array of novel electronic materials using the ultrafast optical method of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.  With the new capabilities to be developed, the technique will permit sensitive measurements of the complex conductivity of materials up to the mid-infrared frequencies without the need of contacts and with femtosecond time resolution. The research program will address problems in charge transport properties of organic photoconductors and carrier multiplication in semiconductor nanocrystals. This project will support the education of a Ph.D. student. The combination of basic research involving fundamental issues in condensed matter physics with practical issues in optics and lasers provides an ideal training ground for career paths from academia to industry.</AbstractNarration>
