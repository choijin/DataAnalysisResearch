<AbstractNarration>This project is providing 14-20 four-year scholarships to academically-talented, financially-needy students who enroll in the physics programs at Eastern Michigan University (EMU). The project is designed to attract high-quality students into the physics majors and to relieve them of the financial burden of tuition so that they can focus on academic success during their college career. The project includes interventions at self-identified critical points on physics degree paths: the first year at EMU, the first course in the major, and the progression to upper-level courses. The project improves and augments existing strategies in the EMU Admissions and Financial Aid Offices to recruit physics majors, including women and racial/ethnic minorities. The project also increases the educational opportunities for incoming freshmen and future physics majors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Physics Scholars Program (PSP) provided at least 7 scholarships of up to $10,000 each to academically-talented, financially-needy students who enroll in the physics majors offered at Eastern Michigan University (EMU).  These four-year scholarships were designed to attract high-quality students into the physics majors and relieve students of the burden of affording college in order to focus on academic success during their college career.  The intellectual merit of the PSP was to 1) create and disseminate a comprehensive program to recruit, support, retain, and graduate physics majors from a comprehensive public Masters institution, 2) build on existing programs in the EMU Admissions Office and the Financial Aid Office, as well as the successes of the NSF-funded Creative Scientific Inquiry Experience (CSIE) at EMU, and 3) provide quality students for the Noyce and McNair Scholarship programs at EMU.  All of these NSF-sponsored programs focus on increasing the number of STEM majors at EMU.  The impact of this program included 1) an increase in the number of students earning degrees in physics, particularly women and racial/ethnic minorities, 2) an enhancement of the research experiences of graduating physics majors, and 3) the generation and maintenance of student support systems at EMU to benefit future physics majors.  Despite only 9 students qualifying for the scholarship, the reforms initiated because of this endeavor served many students. Over the five years of this program, a total of 70 unique students participated as either scholarship recipients, or as members of the two recruitment courses.  Of these 70 students, 55 (71%) have declared majors in STEM programs.  Of these, 36 are still declared STEM majors or have graduated from a STEM program, bringing our STEM retention rate to 65%.  Of the 70 students, 40 (57%) declared majors in Physics programs and 22 of these students remain or have graduated.  Our retention rate in Physics programs is 55%.  We have maintained the curriculum changes that are intended to support physics majors in their freshman year and have enhanced our already vibrant Society of Physics Students to continue the support throughout the students? tenure in the program.   We have seen an increase in the percentage of women majors (from 19% of enrolled physics students to 23.5%) and an increase in the percentage of students of color (18%-21%) over the course of the grant.  We expect the early intervention with courses work and the increased support throughout the program will continue to increase the success of underrepresented populations.
