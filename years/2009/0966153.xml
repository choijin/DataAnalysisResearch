<AbstractNarration>The University of New Mexico S-STEM program is supporting cohorts of 27 computer science and engineering students annually.   Student recruitment, at both the high school and community college levels, is being conducted by Engineering Support Services.  Students selected to participate in the program must join at least one of four learning communities in bioengineering, green/renewable energy, high-tech materials or aerospace engineering.  As they foster student growth and interest in a student's field of study, tutoring, mentoring and professional career development are integral parts of the program.  Additional program elements include: 1) guest speakers on topics associated with the learning communities, 2) financial aid guidance, and 3) a "family focused" annual banquet.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has enabled the successful retention and graduation of tens of undergraduate students in engineering and computer science at the University of New Mexico (UNM). To enable the graduation and retention, scholarships were provided for financially-needed students who also demonstrated academic talent. In addition to the financial support, students were given career and professional development opportunities, including advising and mentoring. Students also benefited from presentations and visits by professional speakers to their cohorts. The program also included training on resume development, interviewing skills, job hunting, internship finding, how to work a career fair and how to network with company representatives, how to apply and fund graduate school, etc.     The result of this project is to contribute to Nation's need of highly-trained STEM workforce, a workforce with newly inducted members who are more holistic individuals. This has a direct impact on economic development for tens of years to come.     Examples of studentsÆ successes are:  - Several S-STEM scholars worked at nearby National Laboratories (e.g. Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories). At Sandia, for example, student scholars were engaged in cutting-edge research that affects our National security.  - Several S-STEM scholars graduated with excellent GPAs and earned paid graduate school where they have done or are doing advanced research. Some of these scholars might turn out to be the professors of tomorrow.  - Several scholars found job opportunities in industry and are currently working with companies across nation.    NSF S-STEM definitely made a great difference in the lives of our scholars. For instance, one of our NSF graduates says: "The NSF Scholarship Program allowed me to focus on my studies and provided many engineering opportunities that I wouldn't have been exposed to otherwise." While another NSF graduate adds: "Being an NSF scholar was the single most important opportunity that contributed to my success.  When I started school all I wanted was to graduate. Because of the NSF scholarship I am graduating with multiple honors and more options for my career than I could have ever hoped for."   However, it is important to emphasize that this program made a high impact not only on the scholars receiving direct financial support, but also on other undergraduate students in Science and Engineering fields who had the opportunity to join some of the seminars and workshops offered by NSF S-STEM at UNM.
