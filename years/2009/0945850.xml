<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a micro-variable circular orifice fuel injector that is intended to result in clean combustion for light duty auto diesel engines. The injector can provide flexibility for atomization in different applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be the potential for improved fuel efficiency and reduced automobile emissions.  If successful, it will help U.S. automakers to meet the challenges faced by new government regulations for emissions and fuel efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ QuantLogic Corporation  Principle Investigator: Dr. Deyang Hou  SUMMARY  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project investigated the merits and feasibility of an innovative Micro-Variable Circular Orifice (MVCO) fuel injector to overcome the limitations of conventional fixed-spray-angle mutihole injectors for advanced combustion. Innovative design, prototyping and CFD analysis was conducted to develop a unique MVCO injector to enable advanced mixed-mode combustion. State of the art laser diagnostics instruments were used to characterize spray droplet size distributions, droplet velocity and spray pattern profiles of a new prototype MVCO fuel injector. KIVA simulations were conducted to identify the merits of MVCO injector enabled mixed-mode combustion. The results have shown that: (1) MVCO fuel injector produces much more homogeneous spray distribution than conventional multihole fuel injectors; (2) MVCO fuel injector produces more uniform and finer droplet size distributions which are desirable for premixed combustion; (3) MVCO injector can enable an advanced mixed-mode combustion which has merits of significant higher thermal efficiency and lower NOx emissions comparing with diesel combustion enabled by a conventional fixed-spray-angle multihole injector; (4) MVCO injector could be potentially used for multi-fuels engines contingent on suitable injection pressures due to its flexible spray patterns.  The results have demonstrated a strong flexibility and capability of MVCO fuel injector for different injection timings and operating conditions to overcome the limitations of conventional fixed-spray-angle multihole injector for advanced combustion. This new flexibility is attributed to the variable spray patterns and homogeneous atomization of MVCO injector. The MVCO injector could be a key enabler to extend premix combustion operating maps for practical engine applications. The Phase I objectives were well met. The Phase I results provide sufficient merits to support further prototyping and engine combustion testing in phase II.  This work has broader potential benefits for auto industries, environment, energy security, and consumers. US automakers are facing significant challenges to meet government regulations for emissions and fuel efficiency while improving profit margins. The MVCO fuel injection technology will enable high efficiency in-cylinder clean combustion thus cut the cost of engine aftertreatment and fuel consumption. The results would also be valuable for high efficiency clean internal combustion engines with flexible fuels, including biodiesels and ethanol, direct injection gasoline engines, and clean engines used for hybrid applications, since the MVCO fuel injector can provide significant flexibility for atomization requirement for different fuels.
