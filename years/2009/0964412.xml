<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PI and his team will develop a new simulation framework to interactively model and visualize socio-economic and geometric characteristics of urban areas.  The framework will consist of a synergistic collaboration of three different areas: behavioral urban modeling, probabilistic graphical modeling, and visualization and computer graphics.  In machine learning and statistics, the area of probabilistic graphical modeling offers a flexible framework to build, estimate and simulate from models of substantial complexity and scale, with partially observed data.  By accounting for uncertainty and interdependencies, including aspects of dynamic equilibrium that arise in modeling the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of urban areas, the PI argues there is significant potential for breakthroughs in modeling large-scale urban systems.  Similarly, by integrating behavioral and geometrical dimensions of urban areas, he expects to exploit the power of behavioral simulations more effectively by filling in geometric details that behavioral models are not well suited to manage, and at the same time provide a powerful framework to generate 2D and 3D geometric representations of urban areas that are behaviorally and geometrically consistent.  The PI will take advantage of massive datasets available for urban areas, including parcel and building inventories, business establishment inventories, census data, household surveys, and GIS data on physical and political features, and will fuse these data into a coherent and consistent database to support his modeling objectives.  This data fusion will address imputation of missing data, accounting for complex spatial and relational connections among the data sources.  The PI will evaluate the accuracy and usability of his system through several deployments in diverse contexts.  The PI has elicited engagement from the Urban Land Institute, the European Research Council, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.  Several organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area in California and the Puget Sound region in Washington will serve as testbeds for the research. Finally, the PI will collaborate with other NSF-funded research projects, such as the Drought Research Initiative Network, in order to investigate correlations between urban development and water/drought. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The results of this multidisciplinary project will have a transformative effect on the area of urban simulation, in that they will enable non-professionals as well as the general public to better understand urban phenomena.  City planners, researchers, students, and citizens will be able to efficiently simulate urban processes not previously possible, and to visualize the effects of adopting different urban policies on urban livability and sustainability outcomes, and to address local and global concerns regarding equity, infrastructure, and economic development.  The framework will provide interactive desktop and web-based interfaces for configuring urban scenario inputs to a simulation that may reach petabytes in data size, and to visualize the simulation results using 2D aerial views, 3D city walkthroughs, and choroplethic maps and tables of indicators portraying the simulated area.  Thus, the work will also advance the fields of visualization and computer graphics, through development of new techniques for large-scale urban modeling and rendering.  The PI will develop an open-source system to make the results of this research widely available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project entitled 'Collaborative Research: Integrating Behavioral, Geometrical and Graphical Modeling to Simulate and Visualize Urban Areas' set out to combine large-scale urban simulation modeling (UrbanSim) with 3D urban visualization methods and graphical modeling to improve the robustness and usefulness of urban simulation models in both research and application to challenging urban problems.  One of the initial and most challenging issues confronted in the research was the need to rapidly analyze vast quantities of urban data with sufficient speed to make use of these queries in simulation models designed to microsimulate the location and travel choices of individual persons, households, and firms, and the investment and development choices of real estate developers.  These decisions all interact in real estate markets shaped by governmental choices on where to develop transportation and other infrastructure, and how to regulate land development through zoning and financial policies.  A key breakthrough in the research was achieved by implementing a generalized graphical network query algorithm that enabled connecting the entire metropolis, down to the level of households and firms, to the buildings and parcels they reside in, to the local street and transit network that connects them.  Using Contraction Hierarchies, we were able to achieve a general purpose accessibility calculator that can compute queries such as a generalized 'walk score' for all local street intersections within a large metropolitan area such as the San Francisco Bay Area with over 200,000 street intersections, within one or two seconds.  This breakthrough, combined with re-engineering of UrbanSim accomplished in related projects, enabled much more robust urban simulation at a level of performance that dramatically increases its practical usability for regional and local planning applications.   A second major accomplishment in the project was the development of Urban Vision, a 3D urban visualization platform that was developed in part through this project, and in part through funding from a partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), the regional transportation planning agency for the San Francisco Bay Area.    MTC provided a total of $1.2 million in additional funding for the development of Urban Vision and the application of UrbanSim to support the development of the region's first Sustainable Communities Strategies plan, an ambitious plan required by California Senate Bill 375, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 substantially by better coordinating land use and transportation investments in the region.  UrbanSim was successfully used for this planning effort, which was adopted by the regional planning agency and has subsequently withstood four separate legal challenges from different advocacy groups.  Urban Vision was used in a series of public outreach meetings during the planning process, to help convey to the public how alternative plans might shape their communities using 3D visualization of the simulated development patterns, making the results of UrbanSim scenarios much more visually intuitive than other forms of communication such as tables and maps.  At the completion of the project, the source code for Urban Vision was released under an open source BSD license.  The key participants in its development subsequently created a small startup company, Synthicity, in which they developed Urban Canvas, a completely new platform inspired by this initial prototype.  The new platform, and Synthicity, were acquired by Autodesk, Inc., in January 2015.  Urban Canvas was released as an Autodesk product in April 2015.  In summary, as a result of this project, substantial advances have been made in urban computation and visualization.  These have proven to be of considerable practical interest, and have been used to shape the first Sustainable Communities Strategy in the San Francisco Bay area, called Plan Bay Area, and...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
