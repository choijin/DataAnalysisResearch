<AbstractNarration>0952564&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Varanasi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project seeks to advance research and education programs in thermal-fluid-surface interactions involving nanoengineered surfaces with an emphasis on condensation phenomena. Using experimental and analytical approaches, the research program seeks to understand how atomistic and nanoscale properties of surfaces ultimately define macroscale heat and mass transport properties during phase change. The studies could lead to new, nanoengineered surfaces that might fundamentally alter condensation phenomena pertinent to various industries including but not limited to energy, water, agriculture and transportation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Both the wettability and morphology of a surface play dominant roles in phase change transport phenomena. This project address both issues. First, the existing theories regarding intrinsic wettability and wetting hysteresis are only useful to analyze wetting properties of a given surface. They cannot answer the question of what fundamental material properties govern the intrinsic wettability of a surface. As a result, material choice for active surfaces is typically based on a trial-and-error approach. This project will establish a fundamental understanding of the atomistic and electronic-structure properties that govern intrinsic wettability and wetting hysteresis using both quantum mechanical calculations and unique experimental techniques to enable engineers to design new classes of durable materials with desired wetting properties. Second, although wetting studies involving micro- and nanostructured surfaces have been conducted for some time, investigation of condensation on nanostructured surfaces is uncommon. Moreover, the influence of hierarchical structures and wetting heterogeneities on condensation at the nanoscale has not been explored. This project will lead to new surfaces that are designed to control nucleation, growth, and dynamic wetting phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Phase change phenomena are ubiquitous in the energy and water industries. These engineering systems have been designed using incremental approaches that are bound by the fundamental constraint of the nature of the thermal-fluid-surface interaction where the largest inefficiencies occur. This research could eliminate these age-old constraints for transformational efficiency gains in various industries. The educational and outreach activities of the program will target participants at various levels: undergraduate students, especially from underrepresented minorities and women, will be actively engaged in research. Summer training workshops for K-12 teachers and students will be provided. Graduate students will be an integral part of the program. New discoveries will be disseminated through technical publication and integrated into a new interdisciplinary course on nanoengineered surfaces. Outreach to industry and technology transfer will be conducted through shorter, fast-paced summer courses. These educational activities will be crucial in equipping the next generation of scientists and engineers with expertise in the combined areas of nanoengineering, surface science, and thermal-fluid science to address global challenges involving energy, water, and agriculture.</AbstractNarration>

The project developed theoretical and experimental framework for elucidating how nanoscale properties of surfaces define macroscale heat and mass transport properties during phase change. The intrinsic wettability and morphology of a surface, together, play an important role in phase change, ie., nucleation, growth and shedding of drops. One approach to enhance condensation is to promote drop mode of condensation. We studied the role of surface morphology, including hierarchical structures and wetting heterogeneities on wetting hysteresis and condensation performance. Droplets can reside on the surface in different states. In the Cassie state, the drop resides on top of roughness features, whereas a drop in the Wenzel state impales the roughness features. For low adhesion it is advantageous for droplets to remain in the Cassie state. In this state, the droplet assumes a nearly spherical shape and is able to easily shed from the surface. This rapid shedding leads to heat fluxes that are considerably higher than seen in conventional condensers. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanism of Cassie to Wenzel wetting transition in order to take an advantage of designing energy efficient surfaces. In our study of wetting transitions, we investigate the effect of wetting dynamics on droplet transitions on textured hydrophobic surfaces. This study reveals the importance of compressibility and liquid-hammer effects in wetting transitions. Studies using environmental scanning electron microscopy showed that drop adhesion on hierarchical surfaces is governed by a self-similar depinning mechanism in which the macroscale contact line is composed of numerous micro-contact lines sitting at the bases of the micro-capillary bridges. The micro-contact lines will themselves be further subdivided into nano-capillary bridges with their own nano-capillary contact lines. We also demonstrate direct nano-to-microscale imaging of complex fluidic interfaces using cryostabilization in combination with cryogenic Focused Ion Beam milling and SEM imaging.&nbsp; We show that application of this method yields quantitative information about the interfacial geometry of water condensate on nanostructured surfaces. This understanding has led to the design of surfaces with very low adhesion and enhancing the condensation rate by decreasing the maximum drop departure diameter significantly below the capillary length. We also studied drop coalescence during condensation. We show that isolated mobile and immobile coalescence between two drops, leads to tangential propulsion of mobile drops. These droplet-shedding modes comprise of multiple droplets merging during serial coalescence events, which culminate in formation of a drop that either departs or remains anchored to the surface. We find that favorable surface architecture consists of microscale features spaced close enough to enable transition of larger droplets into micro-Cassie state yet, at the same time, provides sufficient spacing in-between the features for occurrence of mobile coalescence.
