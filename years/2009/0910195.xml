    <AbstractNarration>Soils in the western United States are diverse, both in their properties and distribution across the landscape. Plants species show exceptional diversity as well. Many species of plants grow only in specific soil types. The wild buckwheats (Eriogonum) are a group of plants that include many of these soil specialists (edaphic endemics). This project examines these patterns using modern DNA sequencing and classic greenhouse experiments to determine if there is an evolutionary pattern relating to these soil specialists. It will also address whether these species are specifically adapted to these soils, or if they can survive on a variety of soils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project reaches across many disciplines, incorporating principles of botany, evolutionary biology, soil science, and ecology. The results of this project will add to the knowledge relating to the distribution of rare plant species, especially pertaining to soils. Unique methods incorporated in this project will be disseminated for other researchers to use and improve. A number of species in the study group are rare or endangered. Data gathered from fieldwork will be vital to various conservation agencies, for implementing sound, well-informed policies.</AbstractNarration>
