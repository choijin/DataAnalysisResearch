<AbstractNarration>All land plants grow in association with complex microbial communities both on above&lt;br/&gt;ground plant organs (called the phyllosphere) and below the ground on roots (called the&lt;br/&gt;rhizosphere). The relationships between a microbiota (the community of microbes&lt;br/&gt;intimately associated with a plant) and its host can vary from pathogenic to symbiotic.&lt;br/&gt;The microbiome (the set of genes encoded by any particular microbiota) can perform&lt;br/&gt;ecosystem services by providing the host plant with critical nutrients, protection from&lt;br/&gt;pathogens, production of functional plant hormones, and provision of tolerance to&lt;br/&gt;stressors like heat. The plant, in turn, provides the microbiome with an improved&lt;br/&gt;environment, including a complex array of energy sources released by deposition of&lt;br/&gt;plant-based sugars into the soil. Decaying plant tissue and carbon-rich root exudates&lt;br/&gt;redirect large amounts of fixed atmospheric carbon to the soil, making the rhizosphere a&lt;br/&gt;large carbon sequestration zone, important in the balance of carbon in a changing&lt;br/&gt;environment. Site specific characteristics of climate and soil that influence the yield of&lt;br/&gt;maize and other crops and the productivity of any plant community rely in part on the&lt;br/&gt;respective rhizosphere microbiome. This research will ultimately lead to agricultural&lt;br/&gt;practices designed to increase plant health and productivity, carbon sequestration, and&lt;br/&gt;disease resistance through the rational utilization of the probiotic capacity of soils and&lt;br/&gt;the local environment. The project team is a collaborative interdisciplinary group from&lt;br/&gt;UNC-Chapel Hill, Cornell and the DOE Joint Genome Institute. The experiments to be&lt;br/&gt;carried out will define the rhizosphere microbiota and associated microbiome using two&lt;br/&gt;important model plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana, the premier model for rapid&lt;br/&gt;discovery in plant biology, and Zea mays, the premier model for genetic dissection of&lt;br/&gt;complex traits in crops. Data generated by the project will be made freely available (http://www.bio.unc.edu/dangl/lab/projects/Metagenome_2-3-10.htm; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/), and will provide starting points for a variety of deeper studies into the complexities of host-microbe interactions. The project will provide training opportunities for undergraduates, doctoral students and post-doctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>
