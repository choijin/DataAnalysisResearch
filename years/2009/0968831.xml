<AbstractNarration>I propose to work on p-adic interpolation of modular eigenforms, and on statistical issues in arithmetic arising from, for example, the recent advances in the conjecture of Sato-Tate; I will continue a long-range project, joint with Karl Rubin, to study Selmer groups; recently we have been applying our work in various directions. For example, to obtain some results in mathematical logic (we show that a piece of the classical Shafarevich-Tate Conjecture implies that Hilbert's Tenth Problem phrased for any commutative ring of in&amp;#64257;nite cardinality that is &amp;#64257;nitely generated over the ring of rational integers has a negative answer) and to resolve a conjecture of Darmon regarding a re&amp;#64257;ned form of the classical ''analytic formula'' for the &amp;#64257;rst derivative at zero of a Dirichlet L-function, and to study the proportions, in a family of quadratic twists, of the elliptic curves with 2-Selmer rank equal to a given number. Our goal is to make advances in each of these directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader issues that are the focus of the aspects of my proposal described above are the classical ones: determining the structure of solutions to polynomial equations; of delineating arithmetic problems that admit of no algorithmic solution; and studying the statistical features of data important to the study of arithmetic.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals and outcomes of the project are related to number theory, both theoretical and computational, and specically to statistical issues in these subjects, with an eye toward applications in other domains, including mathematical logic. I'll begin a description of outcomes connected to mathematical logic.  Hilbert's classical Tenth Problem was posed at the very beginning of the twentieth century and framed in the vocabulary of that time, but - in effect - asks whether there exists a computer program that can tell us when we are given an equation (specically, a polynomial equation in many variables with positive or negative whole number coefficients: 0, &plusmn;1, &plusmn; 2, ...) whether it has at least one solution (again, in whole numbers).   It has long been known (thanks to Y. Matiyasevich, building on the work of many others) that there is no such computer algorithm. A natural more general setting for such a decision  problem would be to determine whether there is such an algorithm for equations in  other domains of numbers more general than  whole numbers.  One outcome of this project is a theorem (joint with Karl Rubin) that establishes - dependent on a standard conjecture in  number theory - that for a wide range of different domains of numbers the situation is the same: they also fail to have such an algorithm to determine whether equations formulated in such a domain has a solution.   To establish this theorem, one must (conditional on the conjecture mentioned above) delicately control the quantity of solutions of certain equations. Specifically, we must see that for any domain of numbers there is a polynomial f(x,y) in two variables  that have infinitely many solutions in that domain, but acquire no new solutions in a specified larger domain (this phenomenon is called "diophantine stability"). The locus of zeroes of any such polynomial f(x,y) - it turns out - necessarily includes  a piece of what is called an elliptic curve.  This focuses on the main mathematical object that the project concentrates on; namely: the arithmetic of elliptic curves.  One wants to have as tight control over the behavior of the arithmetic features of elliptic curves as possible, to get the strongest applications from the theory, as the above illustrates. This motivates the other main focus of the project: a close study of the statistical variation - when one ranges over families of elliptic curves - of the quantity of  solutions of the equations that describe those elliptic curves, where by "solutions", one means in a given field, or in a given range of fields.   An outcome of the project  is that - indeed - for certain families ('quadratic twists of a given elliptic curve')  some control over the statistics of their arithmetic has been established.
