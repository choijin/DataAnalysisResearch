    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The behavior of harmonic functions and potential functions for&lt;br/&gt;processes that have jumps will be studied. In particular, &lt;br/&gt;how does smoothness in the coefficients of the operators translate to&lt;br/&gt;the smoothness of harmonic and potential functions?&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, uniqueness for several probability models that have origins in&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics and mathematical biology will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;One model is that of stochastic partial differential equations in one &lt;br/&gt;dimension with a space-time white noise as a driving term. A second model &lt;br/&gt;is that of superprocesses with branching interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years researchers in mathematical physics, economics, and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical finance have realized that to adequately model real-world&lt;br/&gt;phenomena, the possibility of jumps must be allowed. For example, an&lt;br/&gt;unexpected discovery or unexpected regional conflict might cause a sudden jump&lt;br/&gt;up or down in stock prices. However, some of the very basic questions&lt;br/&gt;about models that incorporate jumps are as yet unanswered. One of the areas&lt;br/&gt;to be investigated is the regularity of such models. A typical question is:&lt;br/&gt;if the initial data is perturbed slightly, is it true that the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;the model at future times will also be only slightly perturbed?</AbstractNarration>
