<AbstractNarration>Photonic band-gap fibers (PBGF) are able to guide light via diffraction rather than by total internal reflection.  Such fibers allow for simultaneous high confinement of light and a gas in a hollow-core region.  As a result, PBGF's offer a unique advantage over free-space, focused geometries for interactions of light with gases due to their unmatched ratio of interaction length to cross-sectional core area. The proposed effort involving PBGF's will entail studies in two main areas: 1) ultralow power light-matter interactions with Rb atoms, and 2) the propagation of intense ultrashort laser pulses and high harmonic generation.  For the work with Rb atoms, high density vapors will be produced by the process of light-induced atomic desorption which will allow for exploration of one- and two-photon nonlinear interactions at extremely low light levels.  The effort on high-harmonic generation will explore the possibility of generating light in the deep ultraviolet using femtosecond laser pulses at modest pulse energies by confining both the fundamental and harmonic fields within the core and through use of quasiphasematching techniques. Such a system would have immediate applications in the creation of compact fiber-based ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet sources, which cannot be realized using conventional silica glass fiber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graduate students supported by this funding will develop a foundation for understanding a wide range of interactions of light with matter and will acquire the experimental skills necessary for characterizing such interactions. In addition, one or two undergraduates per year will work in the PI's laboratory on projects related to this research effort and gain their first experience of performing research in optical physics.  The PI and the PhD students will participate extensively in outreach activities at Cornell via the NSF-funded Center for Nanoscale Systems Institute for Physics Teachers (CIPT) and the Cornell Center for Materials Research.  In addition, the PI will continue to deliver optics-related seminars to high-school teachers and students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Intellectual Merit: This grant provided support for theoretical and experimental studies of the light-matter interactions with Rb atoms in special hollow fibers known as photonic band-gap fibers (PBGF).  The high confinement of the light within the fiber allows for extremely weak (i.e., a few photons) light beams to effect each another light beam.   Such a system can be used for application in quantum computing and communications.  Our accomplishments include: 1) Demonstration of that a beam with approximately 10 photons can appreciably modify the phase or the absorption of another beam.  The observed phase shift of 0.3 mrad/photon represents the largest observed value in a room-temperature system. 2) Detailed studies were made of the changes in the energy levels of the Rb atoms within the PBGF when the laser beam used to generate the atomic vapor is turned on.  In addition, it was determined that the dominant broadening mechanism of the energy levels is the short transit of the atoms across the laser beam within the fiber. 3) Demonstration of extremely efficient coupling of various types of polarized laser beams within the PBGF.  This work is important for those studies that use intense ultrashort laser pulses for light-matter interactions. Broader impact: The graduate students supported by this funding developed a foundation for understanding how light interacts with matter and acquired the experimental skills necessary for characterizing such interactions. In addition, one or two undergraduates per year worked in the PIÃ†s laboratory on projects related to this research effort and gained their first taste of performing research in optical physics.  The PI was successful in attracting students from underrepresented groups both at the undergraduate and graduate level.
