<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will investigate changes in the compositional variation of glacial tills over time across two concentric sequences of Pleistocene moraines located adjacent to the heads of East Antarctic outlet glaciers in the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM). The chronologic framework for this work will be generated from cosmogenic exposure ages of boulders on prominent morainal ridges. The PIs hypothesize that variations in till composition may indicate a change in ice flow direction or a change in the composition of the original source area, while ages of the moraines provide a long-term terrestrial perspective on ice sheet dynamics. Both results are vital for modeling experiments that aim to reconstruct the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and assess its role in the global climate system and its potential impact on global sea level rise. The variation of till compositions through time also allows for a more accurate interpretation of sediment cores from the Ross Sea and the Southern Ocean. Additionally, till exposures at the head of some East Antarctic outlet glaciers have been shown to contain subglacial material derived from East Antarctic bedrock, providing a window through the ice to view East Antarctica?s inaccessible bedrock. Till samples will be collected from two well-preserved sequences of moraine crests at Mt. Howe (head of Scott Glacier) and Mt. Achernar (between Beardmore and Nimrod Glaciers). Each size fraction in glacial till provides potentially valuable information, and the PIs will measure the petrography of the clast and sand fractions, quantitative X-ray diffraction on the crushed &lt;2mm fraction, elemental abundance of the silt/clay fraction, and U/Pb of detrital zircons in the sand fraction. Data collection will rely on established methods previously used in this region and the PIs will also explore new methods to assess their efficacy. On the same moraines crests sampled for provenance studies, the PIs will sample for cosmogenic surface exposure analyses to provide a chronologic framework at the sites for provenance changes through time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research involves graduate and undergraduate training in a diverse array of laboratory methods. Students and PIs will be make presentations to community and campus groups, as well as conduct interviews with local news outlets. The proposed work also establishes a new, potentially long-term, collaboration between scientists at IUPUI and LDEO and brings a new PI (Kaplan) into the field of Antarctic Earth Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Identifying and carefully documenting changes in the Antarctic ice sheet over time is essential to improving predictions of the ice sheetÆs likely response to future climate changes associated with current warming trends in global atmospheric and ocean temperatures.  To assess the sensitivity of AntarcticaÆs continental-scale ice sheet to such warming, we need to determine the extent to which past climate changes have affected both the coastal and interior regions of the ice sheet.  While coastal areas are generally easier to access and have provided important constraints on ice sheet history, deposits that continuously record the history in the areas distant from the coast have been difficult to find.  This study has revealed that some high-elevation deposits of glacial sediments, which occur at the base of mountains along the inland margin of the Transantarctic Mountains, can fill that void and provide a remarkable new archive of the East Antarctic ice sheet history over time.      The two areas of glacial deposits, which were the focus of this study, form a thin covering of boulders, pebbles and fine sediment on the sheet surface and extend over an area up to 15 square miles. The rock debris accumulated on the ice surface after being plucked from beneath the ice sheet upstream of the site, and transported within the ice until it was exposed by AntarcticaÆs high winds and dry air through the process of sublimation.  Such rocks provide a window to what rocks are buried under the ice sheet. We hypothesized that if the ice sheet interior maintained a similar thickness to the current level, indicating relative stability, then the composition of the rocks and sediment emerging on the ice sheet surface should remain constant over time.  In 2010-11, a field party of five spent over three weeks mapping the areas with precision GPS as well as collecting rock and sediment samples for analysis.  Upon return, the composition of the glacial debris was determined by optical identification of pebbles, geochemical analysis of fine sediment and measurement of uranium and lead isotopes within individual sand-size minerals of zircon. Each method was selected for its contributions to creating a recognizable æfingerprintÆ of the debris.  The data show that the composition of the sediment is remarkably homogenous across the glacial deposits, supporting the initial hypothesis and providing a fingerprint for otherwise inaccessible regions of East Antarctica.  The minor variations in the dataset provide a window into the erosion processes at the base of the ice sheet as well as weathering processes on the surface.  Since sediment accumulation appears to have been continuous/semi-continuous over multiple glacial cycles and generally invariant in composition, we conclude that the interior of the ice sheet has not experienced major shifts in its flow pattern or thickness over hundreds of thousands of years.  Importantly, the data do not indicate that there were major changes to the East Antarctic ice sheet interior during periods that were slightly warmer than the current climate; this contrasts with the higher sensitivity of the adjacent West Antarctic ice sheet.  Additional work would be required to determine how much other key parameters, such as the ice flow rate of East Antarctic ice, changed over this same time interval. The new data provide targets for ice sheet models that aim to accurately reproduce the observations of past ice sheet behavior to create more tightly constrained models of future ice response to a warmer world.  In addition to new sample collections, data and scientific findings, STEM students and Indiana residents have benefitted from the research efforts. Two students have been trained at the M.S. level in the Geosciences and two undergraduates have either begun conducting their own research and/or assisted graduate students with their projects.
