<AbstractNarration>The phenomenal advance in computer technology in terms of processing&lt;br/&gt;speed and capacity, closely described by Moore's law, in the last four&lt;br/&gt;decades has been outpaced by the explosive amount of data that are used&lt;br/&gt;to describe more realistic models in scientific computing. For instance,&lt;br/&gt;the number of unknowns in a linear system has grown from hundreds in &lt;br/&gt;the past to tens of millions nowadays. Fast algorithms such as the&lt;br/&gt;celebrated fast multipole method (FMM) have provided a computational&lt;br/&gt;tool for narrowing the gap. At the same time, there is a great need&lt;br/&gt;and challenge to develop better computation techniques and utilize the&lt;br/&gt;present and emerging computers, with the gain in speed up to a couple &lt;br/&gt;of orders of magnitude. The goal of the proposed research is to &lt;br/&gt;advance computational theories and techniques, in order to meet the &lt;br/&gt;demand and challenge for large scale simulations of complex &lt;br/&gt;systems in scientific, medical and engineering studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team proposed to investigate, innovate and integrate the&lt;br/&gt;key simulation steps, from analytic re-formulation of system models with&lt;br/&gt;complex geometries to combinatorial optimization in mapping numerical&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to computing architectures.  Many traditional models are&lt;br/&gt;formulated in terms of linear or nonlinear partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations (PDEs) with boundary conditions on complex geometries. By&lt;br/&gt;the work of other researchers and principal investigators,&lt;br/&gt;integral equation (IE) formulations have lead to better numerical&lt;br/&gt;algorithms in both efficiency and stability, and more importantly&lt;br/&gt;enabled certain important large-scale simulations. It is proposed first&lt;br/&gt;to study the reformulation of traditional PDE models into IE models, as&lt;br/&gt;a direct and analytical approach to innovative algorithm design. Next,&lt;br/&gt;preconditioning techniques will be studied as an indirect and&lt;br/&gt;stabilization approach. Furthermore, Graph-theoretic methods will be&lt;br/&gt;applied to optimize the FMM-based algorithms on various modern&lt;br/&gt;computer architectures, especially, parallel architectures.  These key&lt;br/&gt;components will be studied in conjunction, not in isolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the proposed work are three-fold. &lt;br/&gt;It sheds lights on (1) the model reformulation into IEs of the second &lt;br/&gt;kind as a fundamental analytic-algorithmic approach to accelerating &lt;br/&gt;and stabilizing numerical computation, (2) the connection between &lt;br/&gt;reformulation and preconditioning, and (3) on the mutual dependence &lt;br/&gt;of numerical algorithms and computer architectures. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;work will have broader impacts on various applications through&lt;br/&gt;timely dissemination with demonstration of case studies.  Three&lt;br/&gt;application areas of specific concern are electrostatics calculation &lt;br/&gt;in molecular dynamics simulations, computational fluid dynamics, and &lt;br/&gt;the study of oxygen delivery in tissues and tumors via microvascular&lt;br/&gt;networks. The proposed work involves interdisciplinary research&lt;br/&gt;collaboration and cultivation of young and new researchers with&lt;br/&gt;multi-disciplinary backgrounds.  Finally, the findings and &lt;br/&gt;algorithms will be embodied in open source high performance &lt;br/&gt;software to facilitate research computing by and large and to &lt;br/&gt;be used in classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
