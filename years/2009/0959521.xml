<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable Hampton University, under the leadership of PI Dr. Michael Kohl, to construct and implement luminosity monitors for the so-called OLYMPUS experiment.  The OLYMPUS experiment (pOsitron-proton and eLectron-proton elastic scattering to test the hYpothesis of Multi-Photon exchange Using doriS) at DESY Laboratory, Germany, will be carried out in a multi-national collaboration.  This experiment will provide definitive information about how electrons interact with protons and neutrons, thereby settling key uncertainties surrounding other electron scattering experiments.  The luminosity monitors will be built in close collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Dr. Kohl is one of the originators of OLYMPUS and is pursuing it in a lead role as co-spokesperson along with co-PIs Dr. Richard Milner and Dr. Douglas Hasell from MIT.  The luminosity monitors are considered essential in the overall OLYMPUS setup to warrant the small anticipated systematic uncertainties and are the responsibility of Dr. Kohl's group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MRI-R2 project enables new research and educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from minority populations, predominantly African-Americans. This MRI-R2 will allow construction and testing of the instrument in a new lab on the campus of Hampton University, in a newly constructed research building.  The active role of students and young researchers integrated in the OLYMPUS collaboration prepares and trains them very effectively in their future role as globally engaged scientists.  In particular, attracting undergraduate students to this program serves the underlying purpose of providing a pipeline of talented undergraduate students towards graduate education in top schools and to ultimately increase the number of underrepresented, in particular African-American, PhDs, which is at the heart of Hampton University's mission.</AbstractNarration>
