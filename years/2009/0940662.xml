    <AbstractNarration>One of the important areas in nanotechnology is nanoscale devices, manufacturing and measurement for advance of science, engineering and economy. Precision stage systems are widely used not only in semiconductor manufacturing systems and precision machine tools, but also in scanning-type measuring instruments such as coordinate measuring machines and surface measuring machines. These systems are required to have submicron to nanometer positioning resolution, but also high speed and long travel range in the presence of unavoidable uncertainties and disturbances, which is a challenge and a well-known difficulty in nanotechnology devices in broad manufacturing and instrumentation areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this research planning visit, Prof. Sheng-Guo Wang from the UNC-Charlotte, together with Japan partner Prof. Wei Gao, Director of Nano-Metrology and Control Laboratory/Research Center at Tohoku University, will investigate precision stage systems, and develop a collaborative advanced practical research project to meet this challenge in nanotechnology by sharing their complementary expertise and research resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the international cooperation; training of U.S. graduate students by providing an early career introduction to collaborative international work in advanced areas in two leading industrial countries; and promotion of a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship.</AbstractNarration>
