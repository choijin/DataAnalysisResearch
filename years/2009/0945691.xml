<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the feasibility of robust, markerless, real-time tracking of a scene on a Smartphone for use in Mixed Reality (MR) applications.  The problem to be solved is the expense and complexity of MR systems, thereby enabling the mass market adoption of MR applications.  Existing high-end MR solutions require specialized equipment and custom hardware. Such equipment is expensive and not widely available.  Existing Smartphone MR applications are inexpensive, but rely on fiduciary markers or known targets from which a Natural Feature Tracking training data set has previously been created. This imposes significant constraints on the deployment of MR applications: the location must be prepared in advance; or the consumer must change their behavior i.e. they must obtain a printed marker and bring it with them whenever they intend to use the MR application.  The proposed innovation eliminates these challenges by using commodity hardware (a Smartphone) and markerless tracking. It enables solutions that are affordable, flexible and ideal for broad market adoption.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-end MR solutions are expensive and competing Smartphone offerings rely on the use of markers or pre-trained data sets. These restrictions present a clear barrier to mass market adoption. The proposed approach eliminates these obstacles, enabling broad adoption of MR applications.  There is significant potential for commercialization of the innovation as a component of an MR application. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research was to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel tracking system for Mixed Reality that can run on a Smartphone without requiring markers or pre-trained data sets.  University researchers have shown that Mixed Reality can deliver significant and tangible benefits. Examples cited in research literature include: improved knowledge retention, shorter rehabilitation periods, greater productivity and greater user engagement. Mixed Reality has the clear potential to positively change the world we live in.  However, despite more than 10 years of research, and all of the demonstrated benefits, there have been no broadly adopted Mixed Reality applications to date.    We believe this is because existing Mixed Reality methods have significant constraints.  They are simply too expensive, too cumbersome and too restrictive for broad market adoption.  During this project, a variety of techniques were explored in detail.  The the Phase I project was completed successfully, culminating in the development of a novel markerless tracking algorithm that met the goals stated in the original grant application.  This new method enables mixed reality applications solutions that are affordable, flexible and ideal for broad market adoption, providing clear potential for societal impact by bringing the benefits of MR to the mass market.
