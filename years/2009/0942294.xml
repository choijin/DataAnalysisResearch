<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61):&lt;br/&gt;This series of animated learning modules is designed to make the processes and mechanisms of animal development transparent to undergraduate students in biology.  Module design follows pedagogical best practices by parsing the complex 3D process of development into accessible sections where text, voice, animation, and formative assessment are all combined. Assessment occurs through regular use of multiple choice questions, matching questions, data sorting and ordering questions, throughout each module. Targeted feedback is provided immediately after each assessment tool is used.  The modules require students to predict what they expect to see before viewing animation segments. Users of the modules follow a learning path in which they define expectations, observe events, assess interpretation, and make new predictions. There are many elements to the modules including contextual information, animated visualization, inquiry scripts, a formative feedback loop, written explanation, a documentation tool, and summative assessment instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in the prescriptive nature of the learning modules. They are focused around animal development, but the learning goals of each module are discipline specific. An understanding of events and mechanisms of organismal development is central to many areas within biology (introductory biology, phylogeny, evolutionary biology, developmental biology, macroevolution, molecular biology, evolutionary development, and invertebrate/vertebrate zoology), but the way in which developmental information is used varies greatly. In phylogeny, shared features indicate shared ancestry whereas in developmental biology, morphological change is correlated with gene expression. By surrounding state-of-the-art, biologically accurate animations with different sets of learning challenges, students are challenged to analyze development in different contexts, rather than to memorize morphological sequences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to have a broad impact because the learning modules are packaged for users from many different areas of study, in both upper and lower division courses, and feature a learning script for instructors. To ensure that the materials are appropriately directed, students from underrepresented STEM groups are critiquing content and design during module formulation. The module developers include students, faculty at a research university and a community college, animators, and professional evaluators of written and visual educational materials. The learning value of the modules are being assessed locally first so that improvements can be made as needed; however,web dissemination with properly selected descriptors permits easy access for students, faculty, and interested parties around the globe.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Animal development is a process that begins when an egg and sperm fuse to make the first cell of a new embryo.  This first cell divides to make multiple cells.  These cells grow, divide, and interact, eventually forming all the tissues and structures present in an animal body.  Because developing embryos are highly dynamic 3D entities where new structures appear, and spatial relationships between existing structures change over time, it is difficult to teach the process using static images and text descriptions.  Therefore, we created self-guided learning modules that include animations of developmental events and classic experiments in developmental biology.  The modules require a user to actively engage with the material and to develop hypotheses for what is observed.  The basic format of the learning script is that a user is shown a process or event and asked to make observations about it.  Embedded questions are designed to move the user along a learning path toward an understanding of the process.  New information may confirm, or conflict with, previous interpretations, but the goal is to have the user build a mechanistic understanding of many aspects of development, including cell cleavage, cell fate specification, body cavity  formation, and the function of simple genetic regulatory pathways, among others.  The modules are housed within the SoftChalk learning system where the score center keeps track of user scores on the embedded questions.  Users are identified by a log-in of their own choosing, but options to record scores for classroom users and instructors are available.  Most of the learning modules are publicly available, without cost, at http://bit.ly/DevBioPublicSite   Some recently-created materials have yet to be added to the site.  Student testers contributed to the design of the modules as they were being built, so many features meet student needs.  The modules have been used in classes at the University of California at Davis and at Sacramento City College.  Tests are preliminary, but the modules engaged beginning students and university seniors, and user success did not correlate with more traditional measures of academic success such as grade point average.  However, users seeking a passive learning experience, for example a chance to view a narrated animation explaining some aspect of development, did not enjoy working with the modules.  Although explanations of developmental mechanisms do occur within the modules, little can be learned without engagement and response to the questions.  I expect the modules to be successful learning tools in a hybrid class setting.  One unanticipated barrier to more-widespread adoption of the modules is that their structure and arrangement of topics must mesh with the rest of the curriculum that an instructor uses.  To make it easier for others to use the animations, I plan to release individual component animations to faculty in the future.  An understanding of the mechanisms of development is key for fields such as medicine or genetics, so this learning resource will provide foundational knowledge for many students.
