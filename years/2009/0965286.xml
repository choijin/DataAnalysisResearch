<AbstractNarration>Some of the key determinants of productivity, economic growth, innovation, and income inequality are the management practices of firms.  Unfortunately, in contrast to labor, capital and resource inputs, consistent and comprehensive data do not exist on management and organizational practices. This project collaborates with the Census Bureau to survey establishments about the nature and extent of these practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This is the first large-scale cross-sector panel dataset that can be matched by the US research community to numerous existing datasets on productivity, innovation, employment, technology, energy and indicators of worker well-being (such as health) within the Census Research Data Centers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the importance of the topic, the Census Bureau believes this can be added as a repeated supplement to the Annual Survey of Manufacturing (ASM) in order to construct a panel of data on about 45,000 establishments. This survey is initially targeted at manufacturing because of the availability of a range of other manufacturing data and the relative ease of measuring productivity, but the plan is to rapidly extend this to other sectors, in particular retail and health care to build on our existing firm-level management surveys in these areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses these data to address a number of important research, policy and managerial questions. For example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- What is the relationship between management, organization, productivity and growth, and what policies can promote these practices to support the growth of US firms?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- What are the extent of regional, industrial and firm-size variations in management and organizational practices; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- What are the dynamics of organizational practices over time and firms? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- What types of management practices are associated with changes in inequality over time? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: These questions are central to US policy-makers who seek to promote the success of US firms, and to make decisions based on a sound understanding of the economy. The data analysis should yield important academic and policy results.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Census Bureau recently conducted a survey of management practices in over 30,000 plants across the US, the first large-scale survey of management in America. Analyzing these data reveals several striking results. First, more structured management practices are tightly linked to higher levels of IT intensity in terms of a higher expenditure on IT and more on-line sales. Likewise, more structured management is strongly linked with superior performance: establishments adopting more structured practices for performance monitoring, target setting and incentives enjoy greater productivity and profitability, higher rates of innovation and faster employment growth. Second, there is a substantial dispersion of management practices across the establishments. We find that 18% of establishments have adopted at least 75% of these more structured management practices, while 27% of establishments adopted less than 50% of these. Third, more structured management practices are more likely to be found in establishments that export, who are larger (or are part of bigger firms), and have more educated employees. Establishments in the South and Midwest have more structured practices on average than those in the Northeast and West. Finally, we find adoption of structured management practices has increased between 2005 and 2010 for surviving establishments, particularly for those practices involving data collection and analysis.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/02/2015<br>      Modified by: Nicholas&nbsp;Bloom</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
