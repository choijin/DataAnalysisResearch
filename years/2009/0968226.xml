<AbstractNarration>This PIRE project forms an international consortium of leading superconductivity researchers from the U.S., Japan, Canada, UK, and China to investigate novel superconductors to clarify superconducting mechanisms and properties and develop novel superconducting materials. In conventional electrical systems heat is generated by friction as electrons collide with atoms and impurities in the wire, a property that is ideal for appliances such as toasters or irons but not for most other electrical applications. Superconductivity can be thought of as "frictionless" electricity whereby electrons glide unimpeded between atoms, thus vastly improving the conductor's energy efficiency. To date this has only been achieved at extremely low temperatures; the challenge is to harness this phenomenon at or near room temperature and at high electrical currents. This project will fill gaps in our current understanding of superconductivity, reconcile current theories, and advance the development of better materials for fast-performing devices and cost-saving electric motors, generators, and power transmission lines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project links leading materials experimentalists and eminent theorists in a study of FeAs, CuO, CeCoIn5, and URu2Si2 superconductors using powerful experimental probing techniques including neutron scattering, muon spin relaxation, X-ray scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy. These advanced methods allow elucidation of the phase diagrams of these important new materials of which some significant aspects are currently unknown. The PIRE team will explore the parameters affecting the highest temperature at which a certain material is superconducting and ways of increasing that temperature so that superconductivity will not require such expensive refrigeration. Some anomalies in the superfluid density and specific heat discontinuities, inconsistent with the standard theory of superconductivity, will also be investigated both experimentally and theoretically.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;International collaboration is essential for this work because it will provide U.S. scientists and students with access to critical world-class accelerator-based facilities available in the UK and Canada but not in the U.S., to high quality specimens fabricated in China and Japan, and to first-rate scientific expertise from all countries. Combining and comparing the results of multiple probes on the same high-quality specimens will significantly improve the accuracy of data. Face to face collaboration of theorists and experimentalists focused on key concepts will facilitate the translation of mathematical theory into realistic and effective models and materials. The project places great emphasis on training students and early career scientists. Students and postdoctoral researchers will undertake 3-6 month research visits to work on superconducting mechanisms at foreign sites, where they will also receive language and cultural training. The project will actively recruit minority students into the sciences via workshops for high-school students and teachers from disadvantaged schools in New York and via an outreach program on superconductivity and scanning tunneling microscopy. High school and undergraduate students will gain valuable beam-time experience through the project, and female students, who are as a group underrepresented in the physical sciences, will be provided valuable mentoring from four female leading scientists on the team. The PIRE team will also develop a contemporary, internet-based set of solid state physics lectures and a text book on introductory solid state physics that reflect current knowledge in condensed matter physics and related experimental techniques.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will strengthen and internationalize materials research programs at the U.S. institutions and engage more U.S. students in international research collaborations. It will place Columbia University and its students and faculty at the core of a research and education partnership with extensive research collaborations, teaching cooperation, and frequent reciprocal research visits for participating faculty and students. Impacts extend beyond the PI and his institution, including providing U.S. students with research opportunities at two Department of Energy U.S. National Laboratories (Oak Ridge and Los Alamos) and training of early career scientists at the UK's ISIS and Canada's TRIUMF facilities, both of which will build the core workforce for new probing facilities currently under construction in the U.S. and Japan. This PIRE project will build upon an existing Inter American materials science network (CIAM) and forge a foundation for long-term research and educational collaborations among scientists and institutions in the five participating nations, all advancing the state-of-the-art in superconductivity and its applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participating U.S. institutions include Columbia University (NY), University of Tennessee at Knoxville, and the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge (TN) and Los Alamos (NM) National Laboratories. Foreign institutions include Institute of Physics - Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Bristol (UK), the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council's ISIS facility, McMaster University (Canada), TRIUMF Canada's National Laboratory for Particle and Nuclear Physics, Tokyo University (Japan), Osaka University (Japan), Tohoku University (Japan), and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) (Japan).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>

This project involved 4 principal investigators (PI) from the US, 7 foreign PIÆs from Japan, China, Canada and UK, and about 50 member scientists.

Extensive collaboration of the Super-PIRE members resulted in 53 publications in peer-reviewed journals supported by PIRE funding, including many papers in high-impact journals: 4 in Nature Physics, 1 in Nature Materials, 6 in Nature Communications, 1 in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2 in Phys. Rev. X, 4 in Phys. Rev. Lett., and 26 in Phys. Rev. B.   In particular, neutron and STM studies of specimens generated by US and Chinese PIRE members revealed anisotropic magnetic interactions and manifestations of electronic states developing unidirectional correlations even at temperatures higher than the onset of the relevant structural phase transition.  On the border of antiferromagnetic (AF) and superconducting (SC) phases of iron-based superconductors, results from neutron, muon, Moessbauer effect, and STM revealed volume-wise destruction of AF order associated with phase separation between AF and SC phases.
