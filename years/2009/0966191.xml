<AbstractNarration>This project is increasing the number of local high school students pursuing bachelors degrees in STEM fields. Seven new students in each of the first two years of the project are receiving scholarships for four years, subject to sufficient progress towards an undergraduate STEM degree. S-STEM Scholars enroll in a special First Year Seminar. Seminar instructors utilize relevant Hope College support programs to provide academic and professional development events over the entire four year experience to inform students of opportunities that enable them to successfully prepare for and enter a STEM career. Additionally, S-STEM Scholars serve as role models for other students in the Holland area who may lack the confidence to pursue undergraduate STEM degrees.</AbstractNarration>

(https://hope.edu/academic/hhmi/students/faces/index.html)  The program recruited 18 students to participate beginning in their freshman year of college.  Of these 18, 14 have graduated from Hope College, 9 with degrees in Science, Engineering or Mathematics.  In addition, as students left the program, seven Hope students that were also from the Holland area and also met all other program requirements.  These seven students all graduated from Hope with degrees in Science, Engineering or Mathematics.  Of the 16 that graduated from Hope College with degrees in STEM fields, two are pursuing graduate degrees in STEM fields, six are pursuing careers health professions, five are employed in STEM professions and the three recently graduated and are still seeking permanent employment in STEM fields.  Many of the program participants are first generation college students.  Most found the peer mentoring program and professional development activities offered through the peer mentoring  program beneficial.
