<AbstractNarration>The Center for Science Education and the Center for Children and Technology at the Education Development Center are developing and testing a prototype electronic teacher's guide for a 12-week genetics unit in the NSF-funded curriculum titled Foundation Science: Biology (0439443) to determine how it impacts high school teachers' learning and practice. The electronic guide, which is based on an existing print guide, has a flexible design so that it anticipates and meets the curriculum planning and support needs of teachers with different knowledge/skills profiles. The electronic guide provides teachers with just-in-time, point-of-use access to resources that help teachers plan, implement, and reflect on innovative reform-oriented instructional materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Case-study research will investigate how use of the guide changes teachers' subject-matter knowledge, teachers' pedagogical content knowledge for science content and science inquiry, teachers' classroom practices, and student engagement. The results of this project will help to determine to what extent a flexible and modular electronic teacher guide can afffect teacher practice and to what extent it can enhance the ability of teachers to implement curricula effectively.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goals of the project Electronic Teacher Guide: Its Development and Use in Supporting Educative Curricula were to:  Develop an Electronic Teacher Guide (eTG) that is interactive, web-based, and provides instructional resources for planning and teaching an inquiry-based high school genetics unit. Examine the ways and extent that the features of the eTG provide flexible and dynamic curriculum planning and teaching tools, and determine the ways and extent that the eTG shows promise as a professional learning environment. Collaborate across EDC units (curriculum, technology, research) and with independent contractors and document the challenges of the collaborative process across disciplines. Build, share, and disseminate research findings concerning: (1) the challenges of redesigning a print teacher guide for the digital environment and (2) the potential of digital media to enhance the educative properties of curriculum materials, and promote instructional fidelity and coherence.   Two of the most important factors in achieving deeper science learning in the secondary classroom are the quality of the instructional materials and how a teacher uses them. High-quality instructional materials accompanied by comprehensive and accessible teacher supports can guide the way science is taught and ensure successful student learning outcomes. Over the past three decades, the National Science Foundation has supported the development of innovative, standards-based instructional materials featuring approaches to learning based in research. Support materials that accompany the instructional materials, often in the form of an extensive print teacher guide, are designed to help teachers implement the materials with fidelity to the developersÆ intentions and incorporate new instructional strategies into their practice.  Despite the best intentions of curriculum developers to provide accessible and useful teacher support materials, the use of these guides is often random and occasional because of the complex nature of the print guides. Digital affordances can overcome many of the difficulties inherent in print teacher guides by making the support materials and educative resources easier to use, readily accessible at "point of use" during planning and teaching. The Electronic Teacher Guide project undertook to reimagine and redesign the print guide for the genetics unit of Foundation Science: Biology(NSF #0439443) as an exemplar of a cybertool that could improve student learning by providing tools for planning and teaching and enhancing their own teaching practice.  The primary goals of this project have been achieved:  Goal 1 An electronic teacher guide designed to support the implementation of an innovative, research-based curriculum and enhance teaching practice was developed with six major digital features:(1) An eBook consisting of the print Teacher Guide integrated with the print Student Book; (2) An editable slide deck (My Lesson Planner function)  to support implementation; (3) Navigation tools that assist teachers in moving through and accessing the lessons and the planning, teaching, and reflecting tools.; (4) Vetted Web Resources; (5)  Essential Supports that provide multimedia resources relating to productive classroom discussions, use of formative assessment, explanation of the curriculumÆs content structure, and a guide to making mindful modifications of the instructional materials; and (6) Taking Stock, an interactive tool for teacher reflection.  Goal 2 The results of the pilot studies indicated that teachers made effective use of several features of the eTG in the planning, teaching, and reflecting modes, suggesting that the eTG shows promise as a professional learning environment that can help teachers implement the curriculum and enhance their practice over time.  Goal 3 The interpersonal skill of collaboration has become increasingly important in education and in the workplace. Developing the eTG required collaborativ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
