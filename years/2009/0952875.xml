<AbstractNarration>0952875&lt;br/&gt;Link&lt;br/&gt;The research described in this proposal promises to have far-reaching impacts in several fields including protein engineering, protein-protein interactions, and organic chemistry. It is expected that by engineering high affinity variants of the Bak peptide and testing their function in vivo (Aim 1) they will gain insights into the role of affinity in the determination of cell death. The isolation of specifically binding Bak peptides (Aim 2) is an intellectually challenging protein engineering problem and may provide insight into the differing functions of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 in vivo. Finally, the study on using click chemistry to stabilize helical peptides is an innovative cross-disciplinary exercise that brings an organic chemistry technique to bear on a problem in structural biology.  The study of apoptotic protein-protein interactions is important because of the impact of these interactions on cell death, and more broadly on the treatment of disease. The high affinity and high specificity Bak variants that will be isolated in Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal may have value as therapeutic molecules for the treatment of cancer. The educational component of this proposal promises to raise public awareness of biotechnology and bioengineering to large groups of students starting at a young age and continuing through college. In addition several innovations in undergraduate chemical engineering education to cater to and enhance student interest in biotechnology and bioengineering are proposed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The focus of this project was on Bcl-2 class proteins, a family of proteins originally identified as oncogenes, or genes associated with cancer.  Bcl-2 class proteins function as important regulators of programmed cell death, or apoptosis.  When apoptosis cannot proceed correctly, cancer can arise because cells divide in an uncontrolled fashion.  The Bcl-2 family proteins come in two flavors: those that promote apoptosis (pro-apoptotic) and those that prevent apoptosis (anti-apoptotic).  In healthy cells, there is a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins.  However, in some cancers, especially some types of leukemia, the level of anti-apoptotic proteins are increased relative to their pro-apoptotic counterparts.    Pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins bind to each other reversibly so that at any given time, some of the proteins are bound and others are free in the cell.  When the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins are higher, all of the pro-apoptotic protein is in the bound state.  This results in the cell being unable to respond to apoptosis signals, which can result in cancer.  The interaction between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins is mediated by a single alpha-helix found in the pro-apoptotic protein which binds in a cleft on the anti-apoptotic protein.  Our project focused on the development of peptides that mimic that single alpha helix.  The idea was that if we could engineer a peptide that would bind the anti-apoptotic protein tightly, then the pro-apoptotic protein would be free in the cell to commence cell death, thus preventing the cell from entering a cancerous state.      One major outcome from our project was the development of a system for engineering pro-apoptotic peptides with high affinity (tight binding) to their cognate proteins.  We used a procedure that mimics Darwinian evolution, but at the molecular level.  Millions of mutants of the gene encoding the peptide were generated using recombinant DNA methods.  These genes were introduced into the bacterium E. coli in such a way that each cell harbors a single, unique sequence.  We then used a technique called flow cytometry to sort through each of the cells and find the mutant peptides that bound most tightly to the anti-apoptotic protein.  In the best cases, we were able to improve the affinity (tightness) of the interaction by as much as 50-fold.  This work was described in several peer-reviewed publications.    Another major outcome from this work was the development of "stapled" peptides that can kill cancer cells with efficacies comparable to that of clinically used chemotherapy drugs.  We took the best peptides from the previous part of the project and chemically synthesized them in a way that allowed them be stapled with a specific chemical reaction called olefin methathesis.  The stapling reaction locks the peptide into its alpha-helical shape and also drastically improves its ability to enter into cells.

In contrast to conventional chemotherapy, the peptides are targeted, and thus may result in fewer side effects during treatment.  This shows the broader impact of the research in potentially transforming cancer treatments.  This work was disclosed in a patent application, and the patent will be issued in Fall 2016 or early 2017.    Finally, the project also resulted in important outreach and educational outcomes.  Funds from this grant directly supported our Project SEED program, which provided summer research opportunities to students enrolled at Union City High School.  All of the students who spent the summer at Princeton doing research attended college afterwards, with most continuing on in the sciences or engineering.
