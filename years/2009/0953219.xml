<AbstractNarration>Understanding and enhancing human learning are important challenges in the 21st century.  Existing human category learning models cannot quantify important capacities such as people's (in)ability to generalize from training to test, to learn from imperfect data, or to learn by actively asking questions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project studies human learning using machine learning.  It first develops machine learning theory and algorithms to quantify these human learning capacities: It establishes learning-theoretic error bounds on human generalization performance; It models human learning from an imperfect teacher with non-parametric Bayesian methods; It models human's ability to ask informative questions with active learning theory.  The project then studies computational approaches to enhance human learning: It develops "machine teaching" algorithms when the computer knows the target concept, and selects the optimal training examples to teach a human learner; It develops "human machine co-learning" algorithms when the computer does not know the target concept, but instead learns alongside the human and suggests better learning strategies to her.  Each topic is verified by human experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project advances machine learning with new learning theory and algorithms on tasks where humans excel.  It advances cognitive psychology with new models of human learning.  It has broader impacts in understanding human intelligence, and in benefiting students with new educational tools.  This research project is integrated with an educational plan that incorporates undergraduate and graduate teaching and mentoring, developing a new course and a book on machine and human learning, organizing seminars, tutorials and workshops, and sharing all results on a website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The human brain is a computational device.  A mathematical understanding of human learning not only is an important scientific question, but also opens new ways to enhance education and workforce training.  A common type of human learning is category learning, where a person learns how to categorize items from examples.  For instance, a child may want to categorize a pet in front of him into cat or dog from his previous encounters with these animals; a pilot may need to categorize a radar signal into friendly or hostile from her training.  Existing human category learning models cannot adequately quantify many important behavioral observations.  Mathematically, there is a strong parallel to classification in machine learning but this connection is under-utilized.  In this project, we built upon recent advances in machine learning to develop a range of novel mathematical models of human category learning.  Some of our outcomes are: We developed human Rademacher complexity, a mathematical index that can be measured from behavioral experiments, to quantify generalization in human category learning.  As human learners, we all have the intuition that category rules deduced from a small number of examples tend to be unreliable; when we apply such rules to future items we may be making unwarranted generalization.  Human Rademacher complexity precisely characterizes the extent to which generalizations can be trusted, thus providing a mathematical guarantee on the performance of category learning. We studied the phenomenon of human semi-supervised learning.  Most empirical work in human category learning has studied learning in either fully supervised or fully unsupervised scenarios. Most real-world learning scenarios, however, are semi-supervised: Learners receive a great deal of unlabeled information from the world (e.g. seeing many pets without hearing what kind of animal they are), coupled with occasional experiences in which items are directly labeled by a knowledgeable source (e.g. a parent pointing to an animal and saying "dog!").  A large body of work in machine learning has investigated how learning can exploit both labeled and unlabeled data provided to a learner. Using equivalences between models found in human categorization and machine learning research, we explain how these semi-supervised techniques can be adapted to model human category learning. We studied the phenomenon of human active learning.  In active learning the learners can actively query the world for label information.  For example, a child can choose among many animals one to point at and ask "what is that?"  This is contrasted with passive learning from random training examples.  We characterized human active learning performance with predictions from statistical learning theory.  Our results indicate that humans are capable of actively selecting informative queries.  We further demonstrated human machine co-learning where the computer learns alongside the human and suggests better queries to help the human learner learn better and faster. With deeper understanding of the mathematics behind human learning, we developed the "machine teaching" framework.  If machine learning is to discover knowledge, then machine teaching is to pass it on.  Machine teaching is an inverse problem to machine learning.  Given a learning algorithm and a target model, machine teaching finds an optimal training set.  In the context of human learning, machine teaching finds the optimal personalized lesson for a learner. We have validated our models by human behavioral experiments.  Experiments show that our mathematical models are better at quantitatively characterizing human category learning, and can improve human learning in carefully controlled conditions.
