<AbstractNarration>Ad hoc workflows are everywhere in service industry, scientific &lt;br/&gt;research, as well as daily life, such as workflows of customer &lt;br/&gt;service, trouble shooting, information search, etc. Optimizing ad &lt;br/&gt;hoc workflows thus has significant benefits to the society. &lt;br/&gt;Currently the execution of ad hoc workflows is based on human &lt;br/&gt;decisions, where misinterpretation, inexperience, and ineffective &lt;br/&gt;processing are not uncommon, leading to operation inefficiency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research project is to design and develop &lt;br/&gt;fundamental models, concepts, and algorithms to mine and optimize ad &lt;br/&gt;hoc workflows. The project includes novel research on the following &lt;br/&gt;key areas: (1) Network Modeling and Structure Mining. A network model &lt;br/&gt;is built that statistically captures the execution characteristics &lt;br/&gt;of ad hoc workflows, and is optimized to improve the execution of &lt;br/&gt;new workflows with respect to different optimization objectives. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Workflow Artifact Mining. The network model built on workflow &lt;br/&gt;executions is then extended with workflow artifact mining to realize &lt;br/&gt;an optimization system that is able to take advantage of both &lt;br/&gt;executions and text contents. (3) Role Discovery and Relation &lt;br/&gt;Assessment. A computational framework is built to analyze the roles &lt;br/&gt;and relationships of agents involved in ad hoc workflow executions &lt;br/&gt;in order to further optimize workflows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances from this project include models to represent ad hoc &lt;br/&gt;workflows, algorithms for mining hidden collaborative models, and &lt;br/&gt;techniques that optimize ad hoc workflow processing. The project &lt;br/&gt;bridges two emerging research areas: service science and network &lt;br/&gt;science, and enriches the principles and technologies of data mining. &lt;br/&gt;It also enhances research infrastructure through the collaboration of &lt;br/&gt;team members from different areas (data mining, database, and &lt;br/&gt;network). This research is tightly integrated with education through &lt;br/&gt;student mentoring and curriculum development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publications, software and course materials that arise &lt;br/&gt;from this project will be disseminated on the project website: &lt;br/&gt;URL: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~xyan/smartflow.htm</AbstractNarration>
