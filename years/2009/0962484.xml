<AbstractNarration>This project explores four areas of individual decision making: choices over risk, choices over time, reporting beliefs about probability distributions, and concern for one 's social-image. The four sections are tied together by constructing new ways to measure and estimate preferences. With risk, we ask subjects to construct a most preferred gamble by trading away some probability of winning for an increase in the prize. For choices over time, we vary the returns, time delays, and likelihood of getting paid and ask individuals to diversify across receiving payment "earlier" or "later." For eliciting beliefs, we employ a new scoring rule that is simple and transparent and tends to result in more updating behavior. Finally, with social image we intend to show that when a person's choices may have some moral consequences, an essential feature of the deliberations is the image created in the minds of others. All of these issues are addressed with new and simple techniques that tend to produce data that is more in line with neoclassical models of choice than many other techniques employed by economists and decision scientists in the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In summary, the projects presents a new methodology for measuring the foundations of economics analysis: preferences and beliefs. In the process we gain a deeper understanding of how the mind approaches complex individual and social decisions. This research will provide economists and decision theorists with new instruments that will improve the reliability and accuracy of their work. Policy makers will have new information to use in evaluating programs that affect time and risk. Institution and mechanism designers will have a deeper understanding of how to incorporate and use social motives to improve performance and efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Economics is good at measuring things we buy or build, but what about aspects of our choices that are not so easy to count, but our essential to understanding how policy affects our choices.   One key area is humans ability to plan for the future.  Do we consider the future enough to save for retirement, invest in education, keep our spending in line?  Answering these questions requires that we develop measures of tastes for allocating consumption across time that are statistically robust, and that have power to predict and diagnose behavior.  A large part of this grant has been devoted to this goal.   Similar questions arise with respect to risk taking.  Since the future is unknown, it is inherently risky, so our  measures of attitudes toward allocations over time must also consider attitudes toward risk.  We have developed methods for integrating both.   Another unseen demand is altruism.  When one is being generous, is there an economic "transaction" occurring?  That is, is a person "getting their money's worth" in terms of the joy of helping another when giving, and how does policy interfere with or encourage such feelings.  This research has uncovered some new ideas about philanthropic giving.  Social rewards appear to be as important as personal rewards in shaping the giving experience.  These effects are central to the giving decision.  My research has shined a light on new ways the sociality of giving it interacting with both private and governmental institutions that support giving.
