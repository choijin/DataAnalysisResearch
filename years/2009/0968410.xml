<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to explore and develop tools that will expand the use of biological analogies in engineering design. The results of this research will enable design engineers to access the wealth of elegant and ingenious approaches to problem solving that are found naturally present in biological systems. There are several challenges that prevent designers from taking full advantage of the biological knowledge domain. The first and most significant obstacle is that most engineers do not have sufficient knowledge of biology to identify an analogy from which to develop an engineered solution. To address this challenge, this research has two main thrusts. The first is the creation of a thesaurus that translates the terminology of function as used in engineering to the terminology of function as used in biology. The second is the use of novel, new computational search tools to access repositories of biological knowledge in an effort to data mine biological systems for functional analogies Thus, as engineers move a design from function to form, they can search nature for form solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this proposed research makes fundamental contributions to engineering design through creation of a biomimetic design repository and associated concept generator. Key contributions include better cross-domain search strategies on natural-language knowledge to identify novel biological analogies, and better mechanisms to enable understanding of biological phenomena so they can be more successfully applied to solve engineering problems. The biomimetic solutions will be immediately available to both academia and practicing engineering designers as the research is performed through integration in an NSF supported Engineering Virtual Organization. Curriculum development will provide a testbed for using this biomimetic repository for concept generation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The general objective of this research is to create formal methods by which design engineers can use nature as design inspiration without themselves becoming experts of biology, or any specific natural science discipline.    One principle outcome of the work is a thesaurus between engineering terms and biological taxonomies.  With the ability to map engineering functions to biological ones, a search tool was created to assist the designer in seeking inspiration from nature. Furthermore, the result is now utilized in university courses to introduce students to the biological idea as a new source of innovative design of engineering.   A second outcome of the research activity identifies the parts of a textual biological entry that can help engineers quickly access biological inspiration to create better designs.  This reduces the need for extensive post-processing of the bioinspired design method results, which improves the efficiency of the method.  The modification of the existing computational search tool to identify the primary noun within the biological search results complements the part of speech research by immediately presenting the primary noun independent of the text results.  Immediate presentation of the primary noun will help engineers achieve at-a-glance inspiration and determine if a more thorough investigation is warranted.  Contributions of this project include a part of speech search algorithm that finds primary nouns in the text related to the verb (function) of interest. This is important as a study was performed that found designers were better able to generate ideas from nouns then verbs.  Another important contribution of this work is the recognition that biological systems can be partially described using typical engineering component terms.  Additional contributions of this work include several other important discoveries such as the fact that biological systems can be modeled much like engineered systems.
