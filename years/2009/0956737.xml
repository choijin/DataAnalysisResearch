<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop, as a pilot, a highly efficient, high throughput, and compact continuous flow structured catalyst fixed-bed reactor unit for cost-effective algae biodiesel production.  Successful establishment of the technical feasibility of the integrated fixed-bed technology for algae biodiesel production will be a step forward in addressing the high capital costs, high production costs, and waste stream produced by using a traditional homogeneous alkali-catalyzed biodiesel production process.  It will further demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be economic biodiesel production using algae oil as feedstock, leading to the substitution of petroleum diesel with domestically produced alternative fuel, the reduction of diesel emissions and waste stream generation, the mitigation of global warming, creation of jobs, and the reduction of U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports.  Algae biodiesel has the potential to provide a breakthrough solution to both energy security and global warming concerns.</AbstractNarration>
