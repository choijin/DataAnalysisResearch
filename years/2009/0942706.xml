<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Mechanical (56)&lt;br/&gt;This project develops learning materials and strategies that help engineering undergraduate students learn an "expert approach" in simulation. The project formalizes an expert approach for two simulation technologies: finite-element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The expert approach will be integrated into simulation exercises in three Mechanical Engineering courses at Cornell University, using the industry-standard software packages of ANSYS for FEA and FLUENT for CFD. The simulations follow a case study approach by applying the selected software to solve canonical problems in order to make explicit connections between fundamental concepts and the hands-on visual environment in the software. This enables a modular approach where individual modules can be inserted into courses as deemed appropriate by the instructor. In addition, the project includes developing tutorials and learning modules that will be available for free on the SimCafe wiki for other instructors to use or to customize.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Physics-based computer simulations are now an integral part of engineering.  Simulations reduce the cost and time-to-market in the development of new products by reducing the need for expensive lab testing and by allowing the engineer to consider many more possible designs.  Recent technological developments have made complex simulations, previously done by specialists with Ph.D.Æs, accessible to undergraduate  students. Employers are looking for engineers who have simulation skills in their repertoire and students are eager to pick up these practical skills. However, engineering schools have found it difficult to integrate industry-standard simulations tools into core engineering curricula due to a variety of factors. First, most software training  materials involve recipes that donÆt connect with fundamentals covered in textbooks. Second, traditional textbook content may show simulation results but not how to perform the simulation and check the validity of results. Third, most faculty are not familiar with the simulation tools used in engineering practice and find it difficult to fill the gap between the simulation and textbook approaches.  This project has successfully addressed these challenges through its two major outcomes:  Development of pedagogical strategies to help students learn to approach simulations like experts  Creation of a free e-learning portal called SimCafe for teaching and learning simulations    The pedagogical challenge is to help students move beyond treating the simulation tool as a black box that they just have to get to run with blind acceptance of results.  Research on learning indicates that novices or beginners can develop an expert-like approach to problem-solving by practicing to think like experts. We have replaced  the garbage-in, garbage-out approach with a structured approach to understanding what simulations do, how to create them and how to check the validity of results. We have found that this structured approach works across multiple courses and disciplines, connecting fundamentals to practice. By training undergraduate students in this approach, we are helping them to think like expert engineers and become effective users of simulation as sought by employers.  This structured approach is implemented and supported through an e-learning portal called SimCafe that we have developed.  The SimCafe process is shown in an attached image and includes:  An essential section called Pre-Analysis, carried out before launching the simulation tool, which includes consideration of the underlying mathematical model and hand calculations of expected results/trends Several sections covering the nuts and bolts of running the simulation An essential section called Verification and Validation to systematically check the validity of results  A final section containing exercises for guided exploration of relevant principles through hands-on practice and suitable for assigning as homework in courses      The Pre-Analysis section is a direct link between each SimCafe module and traditional course content, while also forming the basis for the section on checking results. The nut-and-bolts section is what is traditionally covered in software tutorials. The Verification and Validation section builds on the Pre-Analysis section and guides students towards assessing the results critically, rather than accepting them blindly.  Through these steps, the SimCafe process helps students practice problem-solving with simulation tools following an expert-like approach.  Exercises provide further practice in this expert approach.    SimCafe learning modules have enabled Cornell University to integrate simulation tools into 10 mechanical and aerospace engineering courses, including four required courses (each with over 130 students). For example, students in two required lab courses are able to compare experimental results with simulation and also get a better intuition about the physics through visualization of simulatio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
