<AbstractNarration>0968848&lt;br/&gt;Tsapatsis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests partial travel support for participants from the USA to attend the 5th International Zeolite Membrane Meeting (IZMM 2010), held between May 23-26, 2010 in Loutraki-Greece. A part of the requested funds will allow plenary and invited speakers from the USA to attend the meeting and present recent developments in the field of molecular sieve membranes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IZMM 2010 is the continuation of a successful series including the IZMM conferences at Gifu Japan (1998), Purmerend The Netherlands (2001), Breckenridge Colorado (2004), and Zaragoza Spain (2007). In this focused meeting the scientists from both academia and industry all around the world will be given the opportunity to present, share, and discuss their recent findings and ideas about zeolite membranes, as well as to identify the future challenges of the field. Emerging applications of zeolite films as membrane, nano and micro-reactors for applications in the chemical, petrochemical and biorefinery industry and as components of fuel cells and electronic devices will be discussed. Emphasis will be placed on the technological and scientific challenges that should be overcome for further commercial development of zeolite film based products to solve important societal and technological problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IZMM conference is expected to have significant impact. It will allow to identify the future challenges for research in this rapidly evolving field, it will provide the means for young faculty and graduate students to present their work and establish themselves in the international community and it will catalyze the formation of international collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
