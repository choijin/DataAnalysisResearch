<AbstractNarration>Models that attempt to incorporate earthquake physics play an increasingly important role in seismology and are prevalent in seismic hazard assessment. &lt;br/&gt;Most often, the physical ideas that inform these models are heuristically motivated and based on expert opinion. The Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF2) employs several such models. To increase the testability of the upcoming UCERF3, we propose to investigate the characteristic earthquake hypothesis, the relation of maximum magnitude to fault length, and the Coulomb Stress hypothesis. For many faults, seismologists identified so-called characteristic earthquakes and include them as expected target earthquakes in hazard assessment. The most prominent and best studied example is the sequence of magnitude 6 events at Parkfield, CA. Studies have shown that this phenomenon possibly could be explained by low sample size from the upper magnitude ranges of the frequency-magnitude distribution. The relation of maximum magnitude to fault length plays a major role in hazard assessment as it is used to estimate the size of future large events at particular faults. This relation is based purely on a posteriori observations and has not been tested using a priori predictions. The most complicated of the selected models is the Coulomb Stress model. It shows great descriptive capabilities but is also relies on a posteriori observations through fitting of the free parameters. Its uncertainty range remains relatively unexplored. Common to all of these conceptual models is the fact that they were never rigorously tested for their predictive power, owing in some part to the difficulty in formulating them as testable hypotheses. We propose to explore the uncertainty ranges of these hypotheses and to translate them into testable hypotheses to be tested rigorously in the framework of the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability. &lt;br/&gt;This study will add more testability to the UCERF3 effort and help to understand and to quantify the impact of these models on seismic hazard assessment.</AbstractNarration>

For example, there are many steps that can be made to improve the resilience of buildings, bridges, highways, communications infrastructure, defense installations, etc. These steps generally cost money, and not all possible steps are worth the price. In addition, businesses, governments, and individuals often have choices about where to locate their facilities and homes. Earthquake probabilities comprise one factor relevant to that choice.  The assumptions that we examine are (1) that the stresses imposed on the earth?s crust by past earthquakes can increase or decrease the probability of future earthquakes in a predictable way, (2) that earthquake faults are "segmented" so that ground rupture in future earthquakes is unlikely to continue through certain known points, several tens of miles apart, and (3) that most future earthquakes in California will occur on presently known faults and their magnitudes will be limited by the length of those faults.     In principle, "Coulomb" stresses from past earthquakes, as well as those from continuing fault motion at depth, can put stresses on individual faults that either "clamp" the faults, resisting earthquakes; or add additional stresses that make earthquake slip more likely. The problem is that there are uncertainties in the locations and orientations of the past "source" and future "target" earthquakes, and in the stresses left behind before our seismic networks could record source earthquakes. Also, there are three different quantities of interest. One is the probability at a future earthquake will occur in the "red zone" where stress has been increased by past events, if it occurs at all. The second is the rate of earthquakes in the red zone after the past earthquakes have occurred.
