<AbstractNarration>In 2005, CyberWATCH was established as an ATE regional center for cybersecurity education serving the Washington, DC, metropolitan area (Award DUE-0501828).  Following four successful years of operation, the current grant renews the center for a second phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CyberWATCH consortium has grown from 10 original core institutions in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia to 26 members, including affiliates in Delaware, North Carolina, Louisiana, New York, Massachusetts, and Washington State.  CyberWATCH Phase II is expanding academic resources to meet constantly changing industry needs; strengthening the K-12 pipeline and increasing enrollments in Information Security/Information Assurance (IS/IA) programs; expanding the consortium and providing resources and support to new members; providing real-life or simulated work experiences for students; addressing public awareness of cybersecurity; promoting the IS/IA profession; and developing a revenue stream that will sustain the consortium over the long term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While continuing the successful efforts in curriculum, faculty, and student development that were launched during Phase I, CyberWATCH Phase II is adding several innovative programs.  New initiatives include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* online model A.A.S. and A.S. curricula, paired with appropriate faculty training, dissemination of materials, a curriculum maintenance and update process, and mapping updates;&lt;br/&gt;* specialized curriculum tracks in digital forensics, network security, database management security, and secure programming;&lt;br/&gt;* curricula and case studies that utilize the center's digital forensics lab;&lt;br/&gt;* faculty self-assessment instruments, which allow faculty to assess their skills in IS/IA in the context of the CyberWATCH curriculum and identify training to fill gaps;&lt;br/&gt;* a clearinghouse of guest speakers;&lt;br/&gt;* a mentoring program that pairs industry professionals with students;&lt;br/&gt;* a high school-to-college articulation program focusing on IS/IA;&lt;br/&gt;* additional curriculum modules and case studies that fill in gaps in the existing 85 modules and their alignment with CyberWATCH courses;&lt;br/&gt;* an enhanced K-12 cybersecurity education program, including summer camps for high school students, 1-2 day programs for middle school girls, after-school enrichment programs for elementary students, and a 1-2 week program for STEM teachers;&lt;br/&gt;* specialized security training for the personnel who are responsible for maintaining IT infrastructure in K-12 schools;&lt;br/&gt;* a CyberWATCH presence in Second Life, which will allow students and faculty to participate in virtual classes, workshops, conferences, and training scenarios;&lt;br/&gt;* an annual online job fair and a program to prepare students for interviews; and&lt;br/&gt;* additional activities promoting cybersecurity awareness, education, and careers to the public.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CyberWatch II: "Creating the Next Generation of Cybersecurity Professionals"  For details, visit http://cyberwatchcenter.org   CyberWatch II (CWII) (2009-2012) was an Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Regional Center, headquartered at Prince GeorgeÆs Community College, Maryland, and funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). CWII built on the foundations of the first CyberWatch grant (2005-2009); CWII has been followed by the current National CyberWatch Center, funded by NSF through 2016.  Principle collaborating institutions in CWII included:  Anne Arundel Community College Educational Technology, Policy, and Outreach (ETPRO) Community College of Baltimore County Northern Virginia Community College Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College George Washington University   The CWII mission was to increase the quantity and quality of the cybersecurity workforce. CyberWatch goals focused on cybersecurity education at all levels, but especially the community college level, and included curriculum development, faculty professional development, student development, career pathways, and public awareness. From inception as a local consortium of 10 institutions around the nationÆs capital through completion of CWII, CyberWatch achieved the following:  The Power of the Network (Chart 1). CyberWatch reached and influenced an ever-expanding number of people:   94 member institutions:   50 community colleges 44 universities In 29 states plus the District of Columbia         48       partner institutions &ndash; businesses, government agencies, state departments       of education, and professional associations   Model      Cybersecurity Curricula:   CyberWatch       developed model cybersecurity curricula, including complete courses for       Applied Associate of Science (A.A.S.) and Associate of Science (A.S.)       degrees and for two cybersecurity certificates. The       model courses were converted for delivery in an online format. The       number of CyberWatch degree and certificate programs at member       institutions more than quadrupled as a result of curriculum development,       scope expansion, and member growth. The       number of community college programs increased ten-fold (from 4 to 40). The       number of curricula mapped to external industry standards increased       twentyfold project-wide, from 3 to 61 mappings. At       the community college level, the number of Committee on National Security       Systems (CNSS)-certified curricula increased from 1 to 26. The       number of students enrolled in Information Technology (IT)/cybersecurity-related       courses at community colleges grew fifteen-fold, from 307 to       approximately 4700 (Chart 2). Almost half of the community college students       served by CyberWatch were reported to be minority students (28% African-American,       8% Hispanic, 3% Multiracial, 6% Asian).   CAE2Y (Chart 3):    CyberWatch       led the national effort to create the Centers of Academic Excellence in       Information Assurance Education for Community Colleges (CAE2Y)       designation, as part of the CAE program managed by the National Security       Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).   Faculty      Professional Development (Chart 4):   CyberWatch       trained 845 college faculty and 69 high school teachers through 85       CyberWatch professional development workshops. As a result, approximately       10,000 students were directly impacted by CyberWatch-sponsored faculty       development.
