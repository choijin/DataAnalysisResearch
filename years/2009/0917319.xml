<AbstractNarration>This project develops compile time techniques and a software tool (called the Reduction Simplification Engine, RSE) for optimization of equational programs with reductions (associative, and usually commutative, operations applied to collections of data).  By using these techniques and tools it is possible to generate programs with lower asymptotic complexity than the original specification.  Such complexity reduction is an ambitious, almost unheard of, goal in compilation: most compilers seek constant factor gains, usually a few percentage points.  The techniques developed in this project build on more than twenty years of research by the PI on a formalism called the "polyhedral model."  The main novelty of the current effort is that in addition to polyhedral techniques, algebraic properties such as idempotency and distributivity are also used to augment the analyses performed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to develop fundamental algorithms for analyzing and simplifying high level equational programs in order to reduce asymptotic complexity, and to implement the techniques in an open source tool.  The main accomplishments were:  1 We developed a simplificaiton algorithm to handle distributivity and combination of multiple reduction operators  2. We  applied the techniques with human intervention to discover a scan/prefix computation within a widey used dynamic programming kernel in HMMER, a tool used in biological sequence comparisons.  3. We developed the AlphaZ tool to automatically simplify redictions via user-gueded scripts.  We demonstrated this on the kerne used in Unafold, transofrming a degree four porgram into one that had cubic complexity  4 We developed a code generator to produce distributed memory (MPI) programs from equational specifications  5. Furthermore, in terms of the broader impact, we developed a program for international collaborations for joint supervision of doctoral dissertations between Frecnh institutions (&Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure de Lyon) and Colorado State University.  This was the fist such dissertation in the histry of CSU.   The dissertation provided a first step towardss the resolution of a twenty year problem in polyhedral compilation/analysis and transformation.  Alth0pughi ti is known for thirty years that when a tiling trnsformation is applied to polyhedralprograms, with parametric tile sizes, the resulting program does not obey the closure propertis of the polyhedral model. The Iooss dissertation showed that int he special case of a single tile size parameter, the closure properties are retaind.  6. Two additional dctoral sissertations were defended during the project and anumber of masters theses were supported.
