<AbstractNarration>0946360&lt;br/&gt;O'Connell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The VIII Conference is scheduled for October 17-21 2009, in Praia da Rocha, Portugal, with a similar format to the successful previous Conferences, but with innovative contemporary session topics. See http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~equifase/. These include: Fundamentals of Thermodynamics; Molecular Simulation; Product &amp; Process Design; New products and Materials (Properties &amp; Applications); Green Engineering &amp; Sustainability; Alternative/Sustainable Energy; Biomolecules and Biotechnology; Contemporary Educational Challenges. There are expected to be more than 150 technical participants in spite of the current economic conditions limiting international and business travel. The proceedings will be published in a special issue of the journal Fluid Phase Equilibria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present proposal requests funds for travel and per diem for up to three invited US speakers, all of whom are academics who would not be able to attend without assistance. No request is made for Meeting organization expenses or for non-US participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This Conference will gather important international researchers in the vital discipline of fluid properties and phase equilibria for product and process design to review progress and to examine the next generations of problems in chemical technology and their potential solutions. Invited US participants will share their state-of-art knowledge via lectures and discussions, and will learn of advances being made by colleagues from regions of rapidly developing technology and resource utilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Global state-of-the-art in chemical technology will be articulated, shared, and advanced by an important segment of the developing world. American participation is essential for making contributions to the general knowledge base, for building awareness of global activities, and for fostering international collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
