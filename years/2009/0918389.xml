<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;Enzymes are responsible for the many chemical reactions that allow life to occur.  To really understand how enzymes work, both their three-dimensional shapes and the molecular motions that they undergo must be studied.  New information suggests that protein structure and movements are connected in a very complex fashion, via "pathways" of amino acid residues.  This important issue will be studied in an enzyme from the bacterium P. aeruginosa.  This enzyme (called phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase or PMM/PGM) helps the bacteria produce polysaccharides and other sugar-containing products.  Because its three-dimensional structure has already been carefully studied, it is an excellent system for investigating the complicated question of how structure and movements are related.  In particular, the project involves use of biophysical techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance, to create a detailed picture of the molecular movements and fluctuations that permit the enzyme to perform its catalytic reaction.  These studies will help find the hidden pathways of amino acids involved in these processes.  Understanding these pathways may eventually help researchers design new types of proteins, such as faster and more efficient enzymes, that can be used in industry or medicine.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;These studies are at the interface of structural biology, enzymology, and computational biology.  Both undergraduate and graduate students will participate in this work and gain valuable experience in this emerging, interdisciplinary area.  Special emphasis for training opportunities will be given to women and minority students.  In addition, parts of the experimental studies will be incorporated into the graduate level curriculum in the Biochemistry department, allowing many students to gain insights into these important issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the course of this award, we performed cutting-edge, biophysical studies of an enzyme (a protein that catalyzes chemical reactions within cells), in this case for making complicated carbohydrates.  This protein, called phosphohexomutase, is part of a large family of enzymes that function in all organisms from bacteria to humans, and play key roles in cellular metabolism.  We used this phosphohexomutase as a model system, to study fundamental issues related to protein structure and enzyme function.  Key to our accomplishments was the use of multiple complementary techniques, to provide information from different experimental viewpoints.  Such detailed studies have not been conducted on many proteins, and as expected, we discovered some exciting new themes relevant to enzyme function in general. Lessons from this project are relevant and interesting for comparisons with other classes of enzymes that (i) widely regulate the basic cellular processes of life through phosphorylation, or (ii) have a complex 3D structure with multiple sections known as domains.  In the long term, a better understanding of enzymes will allow them to be engineered for novel functions, more efficient catalysis, and superior stability, thereby enabling their use in biotechnology or industry.   Among our findings was that structural flexibility (motion) of the phosphohexomutase is important to its function.  We also showed the importance of the flexibility in several related enzymes in the large superfamily, which is reflected in the evolutionary record through coevolution of amino acid sequences.  A major outcome of the award was the discovery that  enzyme flexibility is dramatically affected by forming a bond to a key but tiny chemical group called phosphate.  The effects of binding of a small sugar-phosphate molecule into the "business end" of this enzyme (where it is converted to another sugar-phosphate) was also studied.  Remarkably, both of these processes affect the enzyme all the way across its structure, and not just near the location of phosphorylation, or where the small molecule fits. The entire bulk of the enzyme, through "long-range effects", is affected by localized changes that occur on tiny atomic-scale distances within the heart of the enzyme. This is a significant conceptual advance over earlier days when scientists thought that most of the interesting behavior of proteins was focused around the immediate and tiny vicinity of the site of chemical catalysis.  In addition to the required role of phosphorylation in catalysis, phosphorylation was found stabilize the structure of phosphohexomutase, apparently through electrostatic attraction between structural sections of the enzyme called domains.  Conversely, loss of the phosphoryl group is associated with increased flexibility in certain regions of the protein, which in this enzyme appears linked to progression of the multi-step catalytic reaction.  Overall, this work has broad implications for appreciating the role of phosphorylation and other covalent modifications in proteins, and offers new perspectives on long-range electrostatic effects due to phosphorylation, which is widely important in diverse biological regulatory mechanisms.               Other activities of this award included training of students, both graduate (2 PhD students, 1 MS, and 3 others) and undergraduate (9), and including women (8) and minorities.  In addition, data from the research program was utilized to expand a graduate course with laboratory exercises to train the students in modern tools of protein structural investigation.  Also, an outreach program to a local elementary school (K-5) was initiated and Cub Scouts were acquainted with some colorful results of protein structural research. These were designed to increase interest in science and awareness of science in a diverse student population.        Last Modified: 07/30/2014       Submitted by: Lesa J Beamer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
