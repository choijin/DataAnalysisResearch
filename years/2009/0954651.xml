<AbstractNarration>Language learners must identify linguistic properties that differ across languages in the language input that surrounds them, and much recent research has explored the potential importance of distributional regularities in the language input for successful learning. However, other recent findings on child sentence understanding have shown that children's immature language comprehension system is prone to mis-parsing of the input. This raises the possibility that informative distributional information might be missed by the learner: if a child misanalyzes sentences in the input, then the true input distribution from the perspective of adults and researchers may be different from the 'intake', i.e., the effective input distribution that feeds into the language learning mechanism. This project investigates this issue through studies of incremental sentence parsing and reanalysis in question constructions in English and Japanese. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the direction of Dr. Colin Phillips and Dr. Jeffrey Lidz, Mr. Akira Omaki will conduct studies using eye-tracking, question-after-story and truth value judgment measures in English and Japanese in order to assess a) whether children, like adults, make early commitments to the interpretation of questions ('active dependency processing'), and b) whether children are able to successfully reanalyze in cases where their initial interpretation turns out to be incorrect. The experimental findings will be supplemented with a corpus analysis and a computational modeling study will be combined with the experimental findings, in order to generate an estimate of how the distribution of wh-question constructions appears from a child's perspective. A novel feature of the project is that it combines experimental and corpus-based approaches to gain an understanding of how children's language comprehension system might lead them to apprehend distributional regularities that do not correspond to what is actually present in their input. Thus, one broader impact of the project is that it could have important implications for any research that emphasizes the role of distributional regularities in the language acquisition process. A second broader impact of the project is that it will help to establish new partnerships for language acquisition research on Japanese, based on developing institutional connections with preschools, and will facilitate future international collaborations on comparative language acquisition studies.</AbstractNarration>

This project examined childrenÆs interpretation of wh-questions in English and Japanese to shed light on the nature of childrenÆs immature comprehension mechanisms, and how these mechanisms might influence language acquisition processes.  A series of story-based comprehension experiments examined preschool-aged childrenÆs interpretation of ambiguous questions such as (1), which provide an ideal testing ground for investigating online interpretation and sentence revision capacities in children.

Due to the different word orders of the two languages, this corresponds to the main clause verb ætellÆ in English (1a), and the embedded clause verb æhurtÆ in Japanese (1b). ChildrenÆs comprehension data revealed a remarkably similar bias to associate æwhereÆ to the first verb in the sentence in both English and Japanese, despite the differences in the canonical word order of the language.

From a sample of 14427 wh-questions in child-directed speech, only 86 involved wh-adjunct questions with two finite clauses, suggesting that the critical data for learning the interpretation possibilities in (1) are generally sparse. Of these 86 questions, only 20 (around 0.03%) are of the type that our experiments predict to be useful for childrenÆs learning. This is the first demonstration that the input distribution that children must learn from can be skewed based on properties of the learnerÆs comprehension mechanisms, and it highlights the importance of ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
