<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thermal Biology Institute (TBI) has been in existence for approximately ten years and focused on extremophile research primarily related to the hot spring environments of Yellowstone National Park. TBI is a multidisciplinary research center with faculty (~twenty) spread across three colleges and seven departments at MSU as such our multi-investigator research and training facility located on the 6th floor of MSU's Leon Johnson Hall is of paramount importance for facilitating and maintaining multi-investigator research projects within the center. The renovation of the main 6th floor laboratory space will include: replacement of  flooring, lighting, ductwork, cabinets, fume hoods, door frames and window sealant; refurbishment of electrical, plumbing, heating, cooling, air-handling, hood ventilation and temperature control systems; removal of asbestos; reconfiguration of lab benches &amp; spaces; installation of a fire sprinkler system and network wiring. The renovation of the cold room will include replacing this room with a pre-manufactured cold room to improve working conditions (light and space) and efficiency. A new temperature controlled computer server room will house existing computers that support the genomics and informatics activities of the institute. TBI is home to several multi-investigator NSF supported programs including an Integrated Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program in Geobiological Systems, a Research Coordination Network on Yellowstone data collection and data sharing, several past and current Microbiology Observatory project on Yellowstone microbiology. TBI researchers have a long track record in training undergraduates and have involved over seventy undergraduates in various research projects over the past five years with a number of those supported by NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. In addition, TBI has a long tradition of successful outreach and communicating science to public audiences and has made significant impacts in formal and informal education using the engaging living laboratory of Yellowstone National Park as tool to help people understand and see the value of science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Thermal Biology Institute (TBI) Research and Education Facility Renovation project served to significantly upgrade the research and research training facilities of the home of TBI, the sixth floor of Leon Johnson Hall at Montana State University.  TBI is a Montana State University System Board of Regents Center for Extremophile Research. The goal of the remodel was to provide a better configuration of laboratory space to embrace the interdisciplinarity of this center. TBIÆs focus has been on extremophile research primarily associated with the high temperature environments of Yellowstone National Park. It is a multidisciplinary research center with over twenty faculty members spread across three colleges and seven departments at Montana State University. In its fourteenth year of existence, TBI is a centerpiece for geomicrobiological research in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). TBI consists of researchers from a variety of different disciplines including microbial ecologists, physiologists, geochemists, chemists, biochemists, virologists, plant scientists, mathematicians, educators and engineers that, together, are asking fundamental questions about life in extreme environments having relevance to timely research topics such as the origin of life, sustainability and energy, environmental remediation, and global climate change. The cohesive mix of scientists having a unifying focus on GYE research provides a uniquely rich training environment for undergraduate, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers. This project has allowed TBI to continue and expand the centerÆs critical work in research, student success, education and outreach. An overview of the scope of the project includes: 1)    Reconfiguration of the 11,190sf space to utilize the space more efficiently for modern research activities 2)    Significant upgrade to basic lab research space including casework and bench tops 3)    Addition of a central core lab that couples our fieldwork staging area with organism isolation and growth facilities  4)    Addition of a phototroph dark room with pertinent equipment 5)    Significant upgrades and modernization of the electrical system supporting lab equipment, cold storage, lab bench electrical receptacles, and a central computer server  6)    Significant upgrades in lighting for safety and energy savings 7)    Additional horns and strobes to the fire alarm system 8)    Replacement of original fan coils of the floorsÆ heating and cooling system for energy conservation 9)    Replacement of fume hoods for safety and energy conservation 10)  New plumbing fixtures 11)  Relocation of autoclaves to central area, new autoclaves The renovation provided the necessary facilities to usher TBI into the next generation of research and training excellence and provides opportunity for future growth. The new TBI facility has allowed faculty, students and post-docs who are involved in multi-investigator projects to effectively work together, bolstering their success. Because of TBIÆs integration of fieldwork, microbial ecology, microbiology, molecular, and biochemical, and genomics approaches being applied to one system, the thermal environments of the GYE, having a modern, central facility with core shared laboratory space has been vital.  Investigators at all levels and disciplines within the institute can work and learn side-by-side.     Scientific impacts in the key areas of viral ecology and evolution, gene expression in thermoacidphillic algae, and hydrogenase evolution and ecology have been significant and are ongoing. TBI principle investigators have recently published several peer-reviewed papers in these areas.   &lt;!--   @font-face  {font-family:Arial;  panose-1:2 11 6 4 2 2 2 2 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:auto;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073711037 9 0 511 0;} @font-face  {font-family:"?? ??";  panose-1:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;  mso-font-charset...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
