<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on combining foundational and lightweight formal&lt;br/&gt;methods to verify the safety, security, and dependability of&lt;br/&gt;large-scale software systems.  Foundational approaches (to formal&lt;br/&gt;methods) emphasize expressiveness and generality, but they have not&lt;br/&gt;been successfully scaled to large-scale systems. Lightweight&lt;br/&gt;approaches emphasize automation and scalability, but they are less&lt;br/&gt;effective on low-level programs and on providing explicit proof&lt;br/&gt;witness. The PIs are developing new high-level and low-level&lt;br/&gt;lightweight methods and adapting them into various foundational&lt;br/&gt;verification systems. More specifically, at the high level, the PIs&lt;br/&gt;are developing lightweight dependent-type systems and&lt;br/&gt;separation-logic shape analysis, and connecting current methods such as&lt;br/&gt;conventional type systems, slicing analysis, and flow analysis; at the&lt;br/&gt;low level, the PIs are designing specialized provers and decision&lt;br/&gt;procedures to verify low-level programs and to support certified&lt;br/&gt;linking of heterogeneous components.  If successful, this research will&lt;br/&gt;dramatically improve the scalability of foundational verification&lt;br/&gt;systems and provide new powerful technologies for building trustworthy&lt;br/&gt;software systems. Combining lightweight and foundational approaches&lt;br/&gt;also provides a common thread that will pull different verification&lt;br/&gt;communities together and unify them into a single framework</AbstractNarration>
