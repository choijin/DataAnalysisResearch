<AbstractNarration>Testing a neutral model for the biotic effects of sea-level change&lt;br/&gt;Stephen Holland, University of Georgia&lt;br/&gt;EAR- 0948895&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Modern ecological studies have demonstrated how the area of suitable habitat governs the diversity of terrestrial organisms. In addition, the ability of species to disperse over broad distances affects diversity not only in local areas but also over broader regions. In the marine realm, changes in sea level can directly control the area of shallow marine continental shelf habitats and can also affect the distribution of habitat types on a shelf. As a result, sea-level change has the potential to drive changes in shallow marine biodiversity. Sea-level changes may therefore be responsible for the changes in marine biodiversity seen over geologic time scales and have the potential to affect marine biodiversity in the near future as global sea level rises.&lt;br/&gt;This research will test how the diversity of shallow-marine organisms responds to sea-level change, using a combination of computer modeling, field study of diversity changes in response to sea-level change in the distant geologic past, and database analysis of the marine fossil record. Field work will be conducted in Late Ordovician (~450 Ma) rocks of the eastern United States, building on data acquired in previous NSF-funded studies. This research will apply Hubbell?s (2001) model, which makes quantitative predictions about the relationship of diversity to habitat area and dispersal potential. The combination of modeling, field, and database approaches will bridge current research in ecology and paleontology, two fields that have historically had little interaction despite substantial overlap in their focus. Funds from this research will support the training of undergraduate research and a graduate student. Statistical methods developed in this research will also be distributed as freeware for use by scientists and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research examined the relationships between the biodiversity of shallow marine seas, the area of these seas, and the rise and fall of sea level. Although it was previously thought that shallow-marine seas expanded when sea level rose and contracted when it fell, we have shown that the relationship is far more complex, depending not only on the magnitude and direction of sea-level change, but also the starting position of sea level, and the basin and habitat. This complexity explains not only why previous researchers failed to find a consistent simple relationship. Using a relatively new development in ecology called neutral theory, we were able to show from our field studies of Ordovician (450 m.y.) marine communities that the diversity and evenness in abundance among species in shallow-marine seas both increase as the area of those seas increases. We have also found that changes in sea level can cause abrupt and repeated changes in the area of shallow-marine seas, and that these explain the long-standing observations that shallow-marine species tend to be more abundant, widespread, and environmentally tolerant than deeper-marine species, and that new forms of marine organisms tend to evolve in shallow-water habitats. &nbsp;Finally, our research has shown that over geological time, the abundance of marine life, driven by changes in the productivity of the oceans, is the primary cause of changes in the biodiversity of the oceans over the past 500 million years.&nbsp;<br />Our work has implications for how biodiversity of the oceans may change with projected sea-level rise, although our results may be overwhelmed by other changes such as pollution, habitat destruction, and ocean acidification.
