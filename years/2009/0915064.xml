<AbstractNarration>The object of this proposal is the analysis of existing methods, and  the development of new ones, for the task of multi-manifold learning,  where the data is assumed to be comprised of low-dimensional  structures.  The main focus will be in studying the potential of  spectral methods for clustering and modeling of low-dimensional  surfaces embedded in high dimensions; in designing new spectral-based  approached to the task of detection of low-dimensional objects in  point clouds; and the analysis of popular manifold learning  algorithms, especially in terms of robustness to outliers.  A number  of applications will be specifically addressed, for example, motion  segmentation, structure from motion, classification of face images,  segmentation of diffusion tensor images and the characterization of  cosmological models in astrophysics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern high-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional  structures. Such situations arise in image processing; e.g., in  target tracking, where a typical trajectory defines a curve through  successive frames; and also in medical imaging, e.g., in the  examination of vascular networks. The study of the galaxy  distribution, which contains filamentary and sheet-like structures,  is another example.  Traditional methods are known to be ineffective  in this context and the last decade has seen a massive amount of  research aiming at improving on these classical tools.  A number of  approaches for multi-manifold modeling have been suggested, mostly by  computer scientists and engineers.  Applied mathematicians and  statisticians have different perspectives to &lt;br/&gt;offer and their contribution is needed, not only in designing new  algorithms but also (and perhaps especially) in providing theoretical  foundations, which researchers in the field have been asking for. The  research in this proposal will address both issues, developing  rigorous mathematical theory combined with carefully designed  numerical strategies addressing specific applications, such as motion  segmentation, structure from motion, classification of face images,  medical imaging and the characterization of cosmological models in  astrophysics.  The PIs will share their findings through publications  and software, all available online to the scientific and engineering  communities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

It is often observed that many common high-dimensional data sets are actually intrinsically low-dimensional. The main focus of the work supported by this award was on quantitative geometric data modeling, and in particular,  modeling data by mixtures of manifolds or merely subspaces. Such modeling shows up in extremely important practical data sets, for example, in motion segmentation of videos and cold dark matter structure-formation. It often provides a more accurate framework than the common single subspace modeling.  The increase in modeling accuracy engenders an increase in theoretical and computational complexity because there are many more quantifications, such as the number of subspaces or manifolds, angles of intersections, the smoothness of the manifolds, etc. The computational strategies for these recent models and their mathematical analysis are thus typically challenging.  A major achievement of the work supported by this award was the theoretical and numerical study of modeling data by multiple manifolds. The PI and his collaborators developed practical algorithms for this purpose and theoretically justified them (that is, they showed that the algorithms could correctly recover the underlying manifolds). The theory guided the development of the algorithms and indicated limitations of other proposals. It has implications to the analysis of the well known algorithm of spectral clustering for the case where the underlying clusters lie on low-dimensional manifolds. In particular, the theory indicated  how to utilize local low-dimensional structure to improve the accuracy of the common spectral clustering in this case.
