<AbstractNarration>Professor Greenberg intends to study a diverse set of problems related to&lt;br/&gt;Selmer groups, elliptic curves,  and Iwasawa theory. Selmer groups have &lt;br/&gt;traditionally been an important tool for studying the Mordell-Weil group of &lt;br/&gt;an elliptic curve over a number field.  They have also played an important &lt;br/&gt;role in proving special cases of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture &lt;br/&gt;which provides a relationship between arithmetic properties of an elliptic &lt;br/&gt;curve E and the behavior of the Hasse-Weil L-function for E.  In recent years, &lt;br/&gt;it has become clear that certain natural generalizations of the Selmer group &lt;br/&gt;should provide similar conjectural relationships to the behavior of much more &lt;br/&gt;general kinds of L-functions. Iwasawa theory provides a framework for studying &lt;br/&gt;these conjectures. In its essence, the idea is to study Selmer groups associated &lt;br/&gt;to a family of representations of the absolute Galois group of a number field. &lt;br/&gt;The formulation of these conjectures in a general setting leads to some &lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems. One problem is to find a simple way to measure how &lt;br/&gt;large the Selmer groups are.  Their size should be measured by an element in &lt;br/&gt;a certain ring. But it is difficult to find a way to define that element. One of the &lt;br/&gt;objectives of this project is to tackle that question in two contrasting settings. &lt;br/&gt;In one setting,  the ring is rather easy to describe, but is non-commutative. In &lt;br/&gt;the other setting,  the ring is commutative, but we know very little about its &lt;br/&gt;actually structure.  Another objective of this project is to better understand the &lt;br/&gt;behavior of certain quantities which indirectly reflect the structure of Selmer &lt;br/&gt;groups, especially in the non-commutative setting. These quantities are certain &lt;br/&gt;``multiplicities.''  There are typically an infinite number of these quantities. &lt;br/&gt;Professor Greenberg  hopes to show how to determine all of these quantities &lt;br/&gt;from just a finite number of them.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the fundamental questions in the theory of numbers is the study&lt;br/&gt;of solutions of an algebraic equation. The difficulty of this question&lt;br/&gt;depends on the degree of the equation and the number of variables. It&lt;br/&gt;has been understood since antiquity how to study this question when the&lt;br/&gt;degree is one or two and the number of variables is also one or two.&lt;br/&gt;However, the question becomes much more subtle when one considers&lt;br/&gt;equations of degree three, even if the number of variables is just two.&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental conjecture concerning this question was formulated in the&lt;br/&gt;1960s by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. Although considerable progress has&lt;br/&gt;been made since then, the conjecture remains unresolved. Such equations&lt;br/&gt;define a class of curves known as "elliptic curves." The study of their&lt;br/&gt;properties has proved to be of importance in cryptography - designing codes&lt;br/&gt;for the secure transmission of information. Professor Greenberg intends to&lt;br/&gt;continue his study of "Selmer groups" which have been a traditional tool in&lt;br/&gt;understanding the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves and in studying&lt;br/&gt;the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. The ultimate goal is to&lt;br/&gt;achieve a deeper understanding of the solutions to the algebraic equations&lt;br/&gt;that define an elliptic curve, and to develop a more general point of view&lt;br/&gt;concerning conjectures analogous to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
