<AbstractNarration>Bio-Link is the national ATE Center for Biotechnology.  Bio-Link's mission has been to (1) increase the number and diversity of well-educated technicians in the workforce; (2) meet the growing needs of industry for appropriately trained technicians; and (3) institutionalize community college educational practices that make high-quality education and training in the concepts, tools, skills, processes, regulatory structure, and ethics of biotechnology available to all students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although based in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Center's activities embrace biotechnology education nationwide. The Next Generation National ATE Center for Biotechnology and Life Sciences is designed to meet the rapidly changing needs of the biotechnology and related life science industries and prospective technical workforce.  Bio-Link is providing the much wider range of services and products now necessitated by the swiftly changing biotech industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bio-Link's mission remains the same. With the current support Bio-Link is expanding the activities to fulfill this mission in today's new biotechnology environment. The goals of the new National Center of Excellence are to: (1) strengthen and expand biotechnology education programs across the nation; (2) enable biotechnology faculty, students, and technicians to work more efficiently; and (3) support a smoother transition of students to the technical workforce in the biosciences and related industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve its goals, the new Center is emphasizing three categories of activities and products: direct services to faculty, teachers, counselors, students, biotechnology programs, and educational institutions (includes consulting services, professional development for educators, maintenance and replication of an Equipment Depot, maintenance and expansion of the Clearinghouse of Instructional Materials for Biotechnology Technician Education, the development of "courses in a box," creating a one-stop shop for online courses, and establishing a faculty internship program); information sharing and collaboration among students, faculty, industry and educational institutions (includes networking, developing a Web-based interactive community, creating an online Technician's Association, documenting and disseminating science education pipeline models, and documenting and disseminating models and resources for community college-industry engagement); and greatly expanded and improved information for students and for life-sciences and related companies (includes continuing to offer Website information services, a national biotechnology program survey, developing a matrix of jobs/careers/skills/programs, and producing video career scenarios for recruitment). Key partners include Austin Community College, the Bay Area Biotechnology Education Consortium, the BayBio Institute, Digital World Biology, Internet Scout at UW-Madison, Madison Area Technical College, SRI International, and more than 19 other partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in its focus on biotechnology, an increasingly interdisciplinary industry that warrants significant attention in today's climate, one in which threats against homeland security and health loom large and in which medicine evolves with great speed. Moreover, the industry provides technicians with opportunities to advance rapidly into high-wage positions. Through its 10 years of experience as an ATE Center and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, Bio-Link possesses the critical expertise and capacity to continue and expand its work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impacts, Bio-Link has influenced science education in general through materials and techniques developed within its network. With its partners, it has piqued industry's interest in hiring community college graduates, and has opened doors for underrepresented populations. Bio-Link is continuing and expanding its broad dissemination of cutting-edge resources to improve teaching practice, educational access, and career opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Bio-Link Next Generation National Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Center for Biotechnology and Life Sciences has a primary mission of working with community and technical colleges that are preparing technicians to work in biotechnology companies and related areas. This National Center ATE Award has allowed the convergence of biotechnology programs at community and technical colleges across the United States and has promoted local industry support.  Bio-Link has developed a powerful network of community and technical college biotechnology programs that provide the education necessary for employment in the biotechnology and related life science industries.  Bio-Link's mission is to 1) expand biotechnology education programs across the nation; 2) enable biotechnology faculty, students, and technicians to work more efficiently; and 3) support a smoother transition of students into the technical workforce in the biosciences and related industries.  In order to achieve its goals, Bio-Link emphasizes three categories of activities and products:  Category I. Providing direct services to faculty, teachers, counselors, students, biotechnology programs, and educational institutions.  Category II. Stimulating information sharing and collaboration among students, faculty, industry and educational institutions.  Category III. Supplying greatly expanded and improved information to students and to life-sciences and related companies.  Bio-Link's key activities:  Bio-Link provides numerous resources at www.bio-link.org and www.biotech-careers.org.  Bio-Link shares materials through its online Curriculum and Instructional Materials Clearinghouse and Courses-in-a-Box.  Bio-Link organizes an annual Summer Fellows Forum, leads Communities of Practice such as the Bridge to Biotech, and coordinates the Bio-Link Equipment Depot.  The Bio-Link National ATE Center is based at City College of San Francisco but has distributed leadership.  The network of community and technical colleges reaches across 37 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.  This robust network has grown from 44 programs in 2011 to 105 programs in 2016.   One of the most important resources that Bio-Link provides is a Curriculum and Instructional Materials Clearinghouse that can be accessed through www.bio-link.org.  The goal of the clearinghouse is to improve the quality of instruction in biotechnology programs across the country so that students complete certificates, earn degrees, and either enter employment or continue their education.  Talented instructors from diverse backgrounds, many with industry experience, have contributed materials, insights and ideas.  Such engagement continues to enrich the Bio-Link community.  A contributing factor to the success of the communication and availability of information and opportunities for sharing is due to the management of the website at www.bio-link.org.  There are sections for students, instructors, and industry.  A map provides the ability to click on a state and find the Bio-Link programs and the companies that have hired graduates.  Metrics about the use of the website provides data for making decisions about what to minimize or enhance.  Professional development for community and technical college instructors and high school teachers has been a major focus for the Bio-Link ATE Center.  The major professional development activity is the annual Bio-Link Summer Fellows Forum.  In the most recent Forum, 94% of those responding to a follow-up survey indicated that the contacts they made have enhanced and supported their work.  Bio-Link has impacted the development of new biotechnology programs, the continued improvement of existing programs, and the creation of contract service organizations.  Forty-three Bio-Link programs have received additional funding with 34 of those receiving NSF-ATE awards.  This provides a broader impact than what is supported by the National Center Award alone.  The grant-writing and mentoring component of Bio-Link has provided huge dividends and great enthusiasm for continued partnerships.  In addition to the Bio-Link Summer Fellows Forum, Bio-Link sponsors a number of other professional development activities including the HI-TEC Conference.  The impact from this professional development over the life of the Bio-Link awards has been the teaching of over 70,000 students.  In support of the education of biotechnology students, our industry partners have encouraged and supported the distribution of industry donated supplies and equipment.  Bio-Link has set up the Bio-Link Depot to address this.  The Depot was started at City College of San Francisco and is now being replicated and adapted at other colleges.  Educators receive equipment and supplies that enhance their ability to teach laboratory skills to students.  The most recent San Francisco annual report shows a total of $987,735 supplies acquired and this number is only increasing.  The potential for distribution of donated supplies and equipment to educators is staggering.    Finally, Bio-Link has broadened it's impact by working with other disciplines and even internationally.  Bio-Link has co-presented workshops with Nano-Link as an example.  Bio-Link colleges have worked as sub-recipients to the c3bc TAACCCT award to Forsyth Technical College from the U.S. Department of Labor.  In addition, a team from the biotechnology community was invited to present at the 103rd Indian Science Congress.  The biotechnology community has grown and been invigorated as a result of the work of the Bio-Link ATE National Center.
