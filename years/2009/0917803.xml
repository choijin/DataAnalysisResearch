    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the 2009 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Conference on Mechanisms of Eukaryotic Transcription to be held Aug 25-29, 2009. The regulation of gene transcription is a prominent mechanism for the control of cellular processes and development. This has led a large but diverse group of scientists towards the study of transcription in numerous systems. The aim of the conference on Mechanisms of Eukaryotic Transcription is to provide a forum to bring together the diverse group of scientists working in different areas of this field. This meeting allows each of them to hear, discuss, and critically evaluate the latest results from different experimental systems and to form a global picture of mechanisms of gene regulation. The conference will be an open international meeting devoted to the most recent advances in the rapidly evolving field of eukaryotic transcription. Oral presentations will consist of a combination of invited presentations and selected presentations from submitted abstracts. The oral presentations will be complemented by poster presentations in three poster sessions, also selected from submitted abstracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The meeting format is designed to attract participation by a combination of junior and senior leaders in the field, including minority, graduate student, and international participants. The meeting will provide an outstanding venue for these scientists to share recent developments and emerging ideas in this exciting field of molecular biology.</AbstractNarration>
