<AbstractNarration>The chemical synthesis of polymer building blocks that have varied molecular architectures and/or are rationally designed to self-assemble into higher-order structures is critical to the design of multifaceted macromolecular materials.   Along these lines, this project involves the synthesis, characterization, and self-organization of calixarene- and resorcinarene-core polylactide/polyethylene glycol star block copolymers.  Methods will be developed for synthesizing the star polymers.  Studies will then be carried out to examine the capability of the macrocyclic-core star block copolymers to form multimeric micelles or unimolecular micelles in aqueous solution.  The ability of the putative micelles to entrap and, subsequently, release model hydrophobic guests will also be evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Perry Corbin of the Department of Chemistry at Ashland University.  Professor Corbin's research efforts focus on the synthesis and study of calixarene- and resorcinarene-core star block copolymers.  Because of the structural diversity of calixarenes and resorcinarenes and their potential to be readily functionalized, these macrocycles are ideal platforms for preparing versatile star block copolymer amphiphiles.  As such, the polymers and aggregates to be prepared have the potential for use in varied materials applications, including their use as nanoscale, targeted drug-delivery vehicles.  The studies to be carried out will, in turn, provide undergraduate students with important, broad-based research experiences that will focus on molecular synthesis and characterization, the self-organization of polymers in solution, and an investigation of the properties of polymeric materials.</AbstractNarration>
