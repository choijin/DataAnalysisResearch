<AbstractNarration>Abstract for Proposal number 0948057 "Effective Negotiation Skills":&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this workshop on Effective Negotiation Skills is to begin the development of a community within the American Society of Mechanical Engineers that supports and mentors researchers from underrepresented groups. The workshop is designed to provide faculty members and graduate students with professional development activities and to give them the opportunity to make connections with an international network of supportive researchers in their field. This workshop will be the inaugural event of the committee on the Broadening Participation committee of the ASME. The goal of the Broadening Participation committee is to develop, implement and oversee new and existing activities aimed at broadening the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in the activities of Design Engineering Division of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  Participants will spend ½ of the workshop focused on developing negotiation skills led by Academic Professionals who are offering this negotiation skills workshop to groups across the country. They are well known for their long term involvement with the COACh workshops for women faculty sponsored by the AIChE and supported by NSF and NIH. The other ½ of the workshop will be led by the organizing committee with a focus on networking activities intended to foster a variety of long-term relationships including: 1) research collaborations, 2) mentoring, and 3) an affinity group built around common interests/concerns associated with the challenges for underrepresented groups in the ASME DED community. This is a very good proposal for the underrepresented groups in the engineering community. They will develop crucial skills and will become better connected within the engineering design community earlier in their career. The amount of support for this proposal is a reduced amount of $ 29,049.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omnia El-Hakim, Ph.D.-Program Director &lt;br/&gt;For Diversity and Outreach&lt;br/&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;br/&gt;Directorate for Engineering&lt;br/&gt;4201 Wilson Blvd., Suite 505N&lt;br/&gt;Arlington, VA 22230&lt;br/&gt; Tel: (703) 292- 2149&lt;br/&gt;Fax: (703) 292- 9013&lt;br/&gt;E-Mail: oelhakim@nsf.gov</AbstractNarration>
