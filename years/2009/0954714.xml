<AbstractNarration>One of the fundamental challenges in molecular simulation is the fact that chemical detail is often necessary for answering questions of interest, yet it is this very detail which greatly limits what is feasible to study. Multi-scale simulation methods give the hope to solve this problem, by combining results from multiple scales, using detail only where it is needed most. Several key issues remain, such as how can one know which details are the most relevant? How can one efficiently, systematically, and rigorously combine results from multiple scales? Here, the PI presents a framework for a novel and highly flexible multi-scale approach, which uses Markov State Models (MSMs) as a framework for multi-scale simulation. Such multi-scale MSMs (or MSMSMs) can combine results from different simulation methodologies, with the expectation of getting the "best of both worlds", i.e. the accuracy of more detailed models and the computational tractability of simpler models. Moreover, MSMSMs present a natural, statistical framework for bringing together multiple simulation methodologies, predicting long timescale behavior from many shorter simulations, and describing and elucidating complex, heterogeneous dynamics. To test these methods, the PI will apply this model to the study of protein folding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several broader impacts of this work. First, if successful, The PI's methods could have very broad impact in molecular simulation in fields very far from just protein folding, since the issues of understanding which details are relevant and the use of simple vs complex models are present in essentially all fields of molecular simulation. Second, as the PI uses the Folding@home distributed computing platform for this project, there is a significant education and outreach component; the PI has pioneered several outreach aspects, including the use of YouTube videos, PlayStation 3, and large-scale distributed computing as outreach, and he proposes to continue that work with this project. This work has had the impact in making many people in the general public familiar with biology and chemistry at a sophisticated level, as many individuals participating in Folding@home wish to understand the simulations they are running. Moreover, the PI plans to expand these areas to incorporate means to engage underrepresented groups by direct interaction with teachers from local schools, building curricula and web pages to be put on our Folding@home web site. This project is jointly supported by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Chemistry Division.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Simulations have the hope to shed light on many areas in chemical physics. For example, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide high-resolution physics-based models of emergent biological phenomena.  While promising, there are three central challenges limit the application of MD for studying questions in biophysics. In particular, there is a huge (1000-fold) gap in timescales between what can be easily simulated (microseconds) and experimentally relevant timescales for many systems (milliseconds).  Moreover, a second challenge lies in the analysis of MD simulation, since the result can contain millions of data points in tens of thousands of dimensions.    Our approach to these two challenges has to build kinetic models of the process, called Markov State Models (MSMs).  This solves the long timescale challenge by statistically "stitching together" relatively short (on the order of microseconds) trajectories to give information for much longer timescales (milliseconds).  Moreover, our approach also yields novel ways to understand the wealth of data, as it naturally decomposes complex systems into simple kinetic models.  This approach was not without its limitations, but from the work supported from this grant, we have been able to make several fundamental technical advances in MSM methods.  Specifically, we have worked to make our methods much more systematic and methodical, with advancements in kinetic clustering methods, statistical approaches to avoid overfitting, and better schemes to test new models.  Indeed, the combination of these improvements in simulation and analysis has allowed for simulations of phenomena on the hundreds of microsecond to millisecond timescale: as a high end GPU can today simulate over 100ns/day for a 30,000 atom system, a cluster of 100 GPUs can simulate an aggregate of 10&micro;s/day, yielding a millisecond of aggregate simulation in three months.  While this cluster cannot simulate one long millisecond trajectory in three months, having 100 10-&micro;s trajectories is very powerful when the MSM approach is applied, allowing one to simulate phenomenon on the millisecond timescale.  Looking to the next 10 years, we expect that these approaches will become more automated, with statistical methods replacing empirical tests of model quality and adaptive sampling approaches maturing to the point where they can automatically tackle a wide range of sampling challenges.  Moreover, in 10 years, GPUs (which double in speed every year) will likely be 1000 times more powerful.  The combination of these technologies suggests that MSM simulations on the millisecond timescale will become routine and require only a day on a modest 10-GPU cluster, and simulations on the seconds timescale will become within reach.  At that point, the field of bimolecular simulation will likely be in a golden period, where sampling is no longer the principle challenge for many biological questions of interest.
