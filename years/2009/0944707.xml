    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for faster, lighter, more powerful electronic devices with increased capability. The manufacture of advanced printed circuit boards, a key component of electronic devices, utilizing high density interconnect technology are generally limited by the electroplating process in printed circuit board shops. Specifically, the design and manufacture of printed circuit boards with finer pitch transmission lines, smaller diameter through holes and vias, and thicker boards with higher layer counts to provide increased circuit densities. The objective of the Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a patented ElectroCell that addresses current and future manufacturing limitations associated with sophisticated high aspect ratio printed circuit board features. The proposed innovation will enable the uniform metallization of high aspect ratio z-interconnects, resulting in improved throwing power, high levels of uniformity and improved mechanical properties as compared to currently available plating cell geometries. Furthermore, the proposed technology will enable the continuing miniaturization and sophistication of electronic circuitry. The Phase I project will include plating of test vehicles from a commercial partner using standard and novel flow schemes, analysis and comparison with state-of-the-art technologies, and modeling of the system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is important to consumers and the U.S. Government due to the vast number of end-products and services that rely on electronic devices. The proposed advanced manufacturing process is anticipated to have a significant impact on performance and reliability of such devices. The enhanced technical understanding and breakthrough that could be achieved by this project could help to revitalize the domestic printed circuit board industry. The public consumer markets for electronic devices enabled by this innovation include thousands of consumer products, such as handheld devices, computer products, global positioning systems, automotive electronics/engine controls, cameras, and next-generation automotive, aerospace and medical applications. The market for electronic devices is currently estimated to be $1.3 trillion dollars.</AbstractNarration>
