<AbstractNarration>Power consumption, which has increased dramatically with IC technology advancement and system complexity, has become a critical issue in design of more complicated, versatile, and reliable systems. The International Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) report estimates that a 20-times dynamic power consumption gap and as much as 800-times standby power consumption gap for portable devices need to be closed by the year 2016. Left unchecked, power consumption will curtail the feasibility of future advanced real-time embedded systems. This NSF CAREER research project is leveraging current operating system functionality to support real-time and power-aware computation that can meet the increasingly stringent timing and power/energy constraints for advanced real-time and embedded applications.  In particular, this research is developing innovative scheduling techniques and decision functions that can exploit hardware capabilities and make proper tradeoffs.  These techniques are based on knowledge of hardware infrastructure features and the intentions of applications, as communicated through the operating system layer. The expected impact of this research lies in its promise to alleviate the inadequacy and inefficiency of power and energy conservation in todays real-time embedded applications.  Such applications are of great economic importance.  They already prevalent and are becoming increasingly pervasive. Through experimental, application-based research, this project seeks to validate and provide sound studies of its theoretical system-level power reduction techniques under practical scenarios such as automotive electronics. Integration of research and education is carried out under this CAREER project via the course development, graduate/undergraduate student mentoring, out-reach, and dissemination of results. The project offers hands-on learning opportunities for pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

The principle of the approach is simple: while many advanced computer systems can deliver high peak performance, practical applications rarely need computer systems to run at their peak performance all the time.  The challenge, however, is how to dynamically modulate the computer system performance accordingly without violating the constraints such as timing, power, temperature, etc.  Some key results and findings from our research are summarized as follows:  While many scheduling techniques focus solely on reducing the processor energy consumption, other components in the systems such as display and storage may also consume extensive power/energy consumption. We developed new scheduling algorithms to reduce the system-wide energy consumption for real-time applications with different QoS guarantee requirements. As the power consumption continues to increase, the leakage/temperature relationship plays an increasingly important role in power/energy aware computing. We studied different models to account for the leakage/temperature dependency and identified an appropriate linear model. By incorporating this linear leakage/temperature model into system level analysis, we developed a number of feasibility checking algorithms, which form the foundation for thermal aware real-time system analysis. Since leakage power depends on temperature and temperature also depends on overall power consumption, the calculation of energy consumption becomes a challenging problem. We developed an analytical method to calculate the energy consumption for a given schedule.  This method is both fast and accurate.

If such a constant speed is not available, then a two-speed schedule using the two closest neighboring speeds can lead to the lowest peak temperature among the two speed schedules. We developed many power/thermal aware scheduling algorithms to minimize the overall system energy consumption under a peak temperature constraint, to reduce the peak temperature, and to maximize the throughput of a computer system under a peak temperature constraint.
