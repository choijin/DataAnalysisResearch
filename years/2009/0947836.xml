<AbstractNarration>Water and Energy Systems: The Key to the Future of Arid and Semi-Arid Regions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kimberly Ogden, Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson AZ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arid and semi-arid regions in the southwest US are experiencing rapid population growth raising concerns regarding sustainable management of land, water and energy resources. The goal of this proposal is to bring innovative research in water and energy resources to the classroom. This will be achieved by developing and delivering a high school level course built around instructional modules in water and energy engineering as well as junior high level modules for integrated science courses. Each module represents an application of ongoing research at The University of Arizona (UA). The research modules will be drawn from the energy and water research centers including: AzRISE, Arid Lands Institute for Bioenergy, EFRI: Infrastructure Development, NSF/SRC/Semetech ERC for Environmentally Benign Semiconductor Manufacturing, and the IUCRC NSF Water Quality Center. These research units have significant involvement with industry, utilities, and government agencies, and these partners will be an integral part of this GK-12. The graduate fellows will come from a variety of engineering disciplines and participate in a teaching methods/communication course prior to working with the schools. The teachers will be instructed on the basic concepts and implementation of engineering modules and will gain content knowledge in engineering principles. The teachers will be drawn from regional junior high and high schools, many of which have large minority (Hispanic) populations and low income families. Together teachers and graduate students will participate in a summer program that will have a variety of pedagogical workshops that are designed to promote information transfer and learning between the two groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Arizona Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering completed a five-year National Science Foundation GK-12 Project. Engineering GK-12 awarded 40 graduate student and 28 K-12 teachers to teach in 19 school in southern Arizona. All who participated greatly benefitted from the GK-12 program, and each year the program goals and objectives were met. The focus of the grant was "Water and Energy Systems" and the relationship to the future of our desert natural resources.  Intellectual Merit: The expertise of the engineering fellow enhanced teaching Engineering 102 and aided in incorporating engineering aspects in a variety of subjects including basic science, chemistry, math, and physics.  Many of our teachers wrote about the loss of the program, and how their students will miss the opportunity to work with graduate students. The fellows gained communication and teaching skills not taught in typical STEM fields; skills that enhance teamwork, collaboration, confidence, and the ability to translate high-level research into laymanÆs terms for all to understand.  Broader Impact: The teachers and their representative schools connected with the U of A via resources, field trip experiences, use of equipment, and lab experiences for interested students. Teachers maintain activities, labs, and lessons created by all the fellows stored on a flash drive for continued use throughout years to come. Further, some teachers gained new content knowledge as taught by their fellow, or they learned ways to incorporate engineering into all aspects of their curriculum. Finally, K-12 students benefitted by seeing young, college role models encouraging them to pursue STEM careers and to excel in math and science during their secondary school years. Fellows made learning fun and tangible for students by creating lessons that engaged the student or applied knowledge to a real-world problem. Additionally, students participating in Engineering 102 were eligible for college credit if desired at the outset of the course. These linkages continue past the life of the grant as a sustainable effect of the partnerships. Many of the high school students who proceed on to post-secondary education will major in engineering, while other students impacted by the program may pursue other STEM related majors.  The past five and a half years have documneted benefits for fellows, teachers and K-12 students.  Fellows from all six cohorts (40) made statistically significant improvements in their teaching ability, use of inquiry methods, and interactions with students. Both fellows and teachers rated fellow teaching skills as above average. Repeat use of teachers allowed for stronger co-teaching partnerships and excellent instructional modeling. Because of the partnership teachers rated themselves higher for continued use of STEM and problem-based lessons. Fellows presence in the (20) Engineering 102 classrooms provided an "expert" support to students and teachers in the area of coursework content and applications. Fellows and teachers agreed that fellows contributed towards students' learning.   The long-term outcomes and effects from this grant may never be fully understood, but the satisfaction of providing opportunities and introducing students to the world of engineering is well documented in the last five years of reports.
