<AbstractNarration>This project covers the concept and technical details of maintaining and operating (M&amp;O) the IceCube Neutrino Observatory upon the completion of construction and deployment of the 86-string array under the MREFFC project. The University of Wisconsin (UW) offers their proven approach to providing M&amp;O for IceCube based on their experience from both constructing the detector and starting its partial operation. Learned lessons that shaped this project include the need for: (1) resources for both distributed and centrally managed activities, and (2) additional accountability mechanisms for "in-kind" and institutional contributions; both are necessary to ensure that the detector maintains its capability to produce quality scientific data at the level required to achieve the detector's scientific discovery objectives. The project exploits a balance between the Core M&amp;O tasks that are centrally funded through UW-Madison, and the "in-kind" tasks that are supported through the IceCube Collaborating Institutions. The success of the IceCube research will enhance scientific and technological understanding on many levels through broad dissemination of data and discoveries. The proposed distributed model of the IceCube M&amp;O and scientific data analyses results in educational opportunities and mentoring at all levels, from undergraduates to postdoctoral researchers, and in a broad set of disciplines including operations, management, engineering, computing, and scientific research. IceCube is a unique detector that inspires innovative capacities of a new generation of scientists and engineers to solve the most vexing scientific problems by applying new knowledge about the Universe.</AbstractNarration>

The experiences of the team members at the South Pole are shared with audiences worldwide through real-time webcasts with the South Pole station, held several times per year and reaching hundreds of people in the US and around the world.   High school internship programs provide firsthand experiences for students by connecting them with researchers and technical personnel. Over 400 high school students have participated in the IceCube Masterclass program for one-day research experiences since launching in 2014. K-12 teachers are essential partners in efforts to excite and engage the next generation of STEM professionals. Since the 2009-10 season, four teachers have deployed to the South Pole to work at the IceCube observatory in conjunction with the NSF PolarTREC program.  The majority of IceCube Collaboration institutions have undergraduate students assisting with research and/or technical tasks. Additional National Science Foundation support provides opportunities for two-year college students to participate in IceCube research in the US and in Europe.  The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is run by an international collaboration of over 300 scientists in 12 countries. The University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison is the lead institution and through the Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center, WIPAC, ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
