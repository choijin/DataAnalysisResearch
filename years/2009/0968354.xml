<AbstractNarration>This PIRE project brings together an international team of U.S., Bangladeshi, Indian, German, and Italian scientists to further our understanding of the dynamics of the world's largest delta, the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta (GBMD). This delta, named for the three large rivers that flow into it from the Himalayan and Burmese Ranges, encompasses most of Bangladesh. In addition to its size, this delta is notable because it is at the active juncture of three tectonic plates and receives over one gigaton of sediment annually from the three large rivers. Only about one-third of this sediment remains in the delta because the delta is sinking so rapidly. This combination preserves a tremendous stratigraphic archive of erosional processes in the Himalaya, the river-based processes that are building the GBMD, the tectonics of the active plate boundaries it overlies, and the interactions among these processes. This record is largely unexplored and little is known about the fundamental interactions between sedimentation and tectonics at this scale. This PIRE team will use a broad suite of disciplines and techniques to collectively study the sedimentary and hydrological processes, tectonics, structural geology, and seismology essential to unravelling GBMD dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIRE team will first create a record of the stratigraphic architecture of the delta using a mixture of advanced technical and local manual methods. Core areas of the project include: 1) defining the tectonic plate boundaries that are buried by sedimentation; 2) identifying potential sources of future earthquakes; 3) investigating the relative causes of subsidence rates due to longer term effects (e.g., sediment loading, tectonics, and compaction) vs. shorter term effects  (e.g., earthquakes and human interventions); 4) investigating rapid channel switches of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers; and 5) assembling a comprehensive, integrated record of delta dynamics by coupling tectonics and hydrological processes, and by linking long-term steady processes with abrupt, short-term events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bangladesh is a developing country that is the size of Iowa, but with a 50-fold greater population of almost 160 million people. This impoverished nation is extremely vulnerable to natural hazards related to the dynamism of the delta system. Such hazards include widespread seasonal flooding, river erosion and channel redirections, permanent land loss from sea level rise, naturally-occurring arsenic in groundwater, recurrent cyclones and monsoons, landslides, and huge earthquakes. Because such infrequent geologic events are poorly understood, there is little long-term planning to address the timescales at which the dynamic GBMD landscape is changing, leaving a growing population at risk. Reliable knowledge of geologic processes is therefore a prerequisite for effective infrastructure design, risk-reduction and resource optimization in Bangladesh. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIRE project provides a compelling international education opportunity for all participants by collaboratively engaging them in research on an important fundamental problem, the results of which could reduce the impact of future delta-related hazards. It will train the next generation of U.S. earth and environmental scientists to work globally via international fieldwork, laboratory experiments and analysis, and modelling. Graduate students and undergraduates from PIRE institutions will be able to conduct research in Bangladesh and enroll in interdisciplinary field courses there; additional research trips and field schools will be open to students from institutions not directly involved in the PIRE research efforts. The project will also broaden participation across PIRE institutions and strengthen the geosciences dimensions of an interdisciplinary course on water issues in Bangladesh taught at the University of Minnesota. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIRE project will allow the U.S. institutions to build their capacity for international engagement. It will strengthen and link longstanding ongoing research involvement in Bangladesh on several campuses. It will couple the U.S. institutions in an international network of delta experts in Europe and South Asia. Members of the project will also take advantage of the unique "Experimental Earthscape" and computational facilities at the National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics (NCED), an NSF-funded Science and Technology Center at the University of Minnesota. Linkage to NCED, which supports many researchers studying the Mississippi River delta, means this PIRE has the potential to have a large national impact by providing fundamental new insights into the behavior of delta systems. This award will also help build Bangladeshi research capacity and infrastructure via the collaboration with the Delta Study Centre (DSC) and Dhaka University Earth Obseratory (DUEO) at Dhaka University (DU). The project should help position DSC and DUEO as centers of excellence on deltaic sedimentary and tectonic processes and establish them as a focal points for GMBD research with strong faculty, archived sedimentary data, and oversight of critical seismic and GPS networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaborating institutions in the U.S. are Columbia University (NY), Vanderbilt University (TN), the University of Minnesota, and City University of New York, Queens College. Collaborating foreign institutions are the University of Dhaka (Bangladesh), Bremen University (Germany), Physical Research Laboratory (India), the Bengal Engineering and Science University (India), and Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (Italy). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is cofunded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Earth Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The collision of India and Eurasia created the Himalaya Mountains and Tibetan Plateau. On the eastern side of India, the two continents both slide past each other and converge, creating the IndoBurman subduction zone where India dives beneath Eurasia. This is the continuation of the Andaman-Sumatra subduction zone that gave rise to the 2004 magnitude 9.3 earthquake and tsunami. Simultaneously, erosion of the Himalaya Mountains supplies copious sediments to the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers, which has built the world's largest delta in Bangladesh. This delta is colliding with the IndoBurman subduction zone, an extreme case of subduction of thick sediments. Our project studied the delta, the subduction zone, and their interaction.</p> <p>To study the delta's sediment layers, we drilled over 400 wells using a local hand-drilling method, and collected seismic images along the rivers.&nbsp; We mapped deep valleys cut by the rivers during the last ice age when sea level was 120 meters lower.&nbsp; We also found 5 switches in the path of the Brahmaputra River over the last 10,000 years as sea level rose to present levels.&nbsp; As rivers build up sediment layers, rivers switch course to deposit sediments in low-lying areas. The last switch occurred about 200 years ago when the Brahmaputra River shifted up to 100 km westward. These river course switches are influenced by delta subsidence (sinking), which we mapped as increasing seaward to about 4.5 mm/year (greater than current rate of sea level rise), and by tectonics in eastern Bangladesh. The delta?s future depends on the balance among sea level rise, land subsidence, and river sediments that fill the space to compensate.&nbsp; Currently, the river mouth is gaining new land, while the west coast is losing land.&nbsp;</p> <p>In eastern Bangladesh, the delta is being pushed under the subduction zone.&nbsp; Because delta sediments are so thick (we estimated 16-20 km using our seismometer array), they are folded up in an unusually broad belt of folds and faults. The area being folded is over 200 km wide, about 10 times the typical&nbsp;width of subduction zones. We mapped these folds and faults in Bangladesh and India and found the underlying fault, the megathrust, is only 3-4 km deep. This is unusually shallow, probably due to changes in the rocks underneath. Using our GPS array, we determined the subduction rate as 13-17 mm/year over an area large enough to generate a magnitude 8.2-9.0 earthquake on the megathrust in this densely populated region. This constitutes a previously unappreciated hazard to the 140 million people living nearby. Improved building codes and enforcement have the potential to make the country and its capital, Dhaka, more resilient over the long term, because we do not know how far into the future the earthquake will strike.</p> <p>We also discovered 5-10 million years old rocks from a paleo-Brahmaputra River and delta over 250 km east of the present river. North of Bangladesh and south of the Himalayas, the Shillong Plateau was uplifted, forcing the ancient river westward around the 2000-meter high and 300-km wide Plateau.&nbsp; We suggest this Plateau marks the beginning of a new southward shift of the Himalayas.&nbsp; Our GPS shows that about 1/4 of the motion between India and Eurasia has shifted to this new area, because it is easier for the&nbsp; Plateau to thrust over thick delta sediments than for the Himalayas to thrust over thick Indian crust.</p> <p>Overall, our findings reveal new details about dynamics of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta and its subduction beneath the IndoBurman subduction zone.&nbsp; As this represents an extreme case,, it informs understanding of subduction of extremely thick sediments.&nbsp; It also reveals the dynamics of how rivers build deltas and the forces influencing river switches. The detailed geological template we obtained is the one upon which most local hazards occur, including flooding patterns, saltwater intrusion, coastal land loss, arsenic contamination, and earthquakes. Our results provide a long-lasting and accessible foundation for geological research in Bangladesh.</p> <p>Over 30 undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral scientists actively participated in the research, with most traveling to Bangladesh. We taught four undergraduate courses with 49 students visiting Bangladesh (or in one case the Mississippi Delta) over Spring Break. We taught a 2-week Field School in Bangladesh for 17 U.S. and 14 Bangladeshi students. We also taught two short courses at Dhaka University on paleoseismology, and on seismic data processing and analysis, with about 20 students each. With USAID PEER support, we developed and outfitted a seismology and geodesy laboratory and a sample repository at Dhaka University. This center is archiving well samples in a permanent repository and data center with analysis equipment. We have started working with international and local groups on the earthquake hazard. Videos about the project are available at YouTube and the American Museum of Natural History, and a 1-hour PBS documentary was shown in April, 2018.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/06/2018<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;S&nbsp;Steckler</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0968354/0968354_10029855_1543200263209_basemaptectonicsHingeShelf--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0968354/0968354_10029855_1543200263209_basemaptectonicsHingeShelf--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tectonics of Bangladesh region"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0968354/0968354_10029855_1543200263209_basemaptectonicsHingeShelf--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tectonics of Bangladesh region"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Topographic map with the outline of Bangladesh marked in red.

Improved building codes and enforcement have the potential to make the country and its capital, Dhaka, more resilient over the long term, because we do not know how far into the future the earthquake will strike.  We also discovered 5-10 million years old rocks from a paleo-Brahmaputra River and delta over 250 km east of the present river. North of Bangladesh and south of the Himalayas, the Shillong Plateau was uplifted, forcing the ancient river westward around the 2000-meter high and 300-km wide Plateau.  We suggest this Plateau marks the beginning of a new southward shift of the Himalayas.  Our GPS shows that about 1/4 of the motion between India and Eurasia has shifted to this new area, because it is easier for the  Plateau to thrust over thick delta sediments than for the Himalayas to thrust over thick Indian crust.  Overall, our findings reveal new details about dynamics of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta and its subduction beneath the IndoBurman subduction zone.  As this represents an extreme case,, it informs understanding of subduction of extremely thick sediments.  It also reveals the dynamics of how rivers build deltas and the forces influencing river switches. The detailed geological template we obtained is the one upon which most local hazards occur, including flooding patterns, saltwater intrusion, coastal land loss, arsenic contamination, and earthquakes. Our results provide a long-lasting and accessible foundation for geological research in Bangladesh.  Over 30 undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral scientists actively participated in the research, with most traveling to Bangladesh. We taught four undergraduate courses with 49 students visiting Bangladesh (or in one case the Mississippi Delta) over Spring Break. We taught a 2-week Field School in Bangladesh for 17 U.S. and 14 Bangladeshi students. We also taught two short courses at Dhaka University on paleoseismology, and on seismic data processing and analysis, with about 20 students each. With USAID PEER support, we developed and outfitted a seismology and geodesy laboratory and a sample repository at Dhaka University. This center is archiving well samples in a permanent repository and data center with analysis equipment. We have started working with international and local groups on the earthquake hazard. Videos about the project are available at YouTube and the American Museum of Natural History, and a 1-hour PBS documentary was shown in April, 2018.
