<AbstractNarration>The ORBIT open access testbed for next-generation wireless networking at Rutgers was developed to address the challenge of supporting realistic and reproducible wireless networking experiments at scale.  The 400-node ORBIT radio grid was released as a community resource in 2005, and can be accessed by researchers via an Internet portal (www.orbit-lab.org) which provides a variety of services to assist users with experiment setup, control and measurement.   This project is aimed at a major hardware upgrade of the computing equipment and measurement instruments which make up the ORBIT testbed.  Specific equipment items being upgraded are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- All 400 ORBIT radio nodes which serve as the primary computing platform for experimenters.&lt;br/&gt;- Computing/storage servers and switching equipment in the ORBIT backend cluster.&lt;br/&gt;- RF measurement instruments for spectrum monitoring on the radio grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also includes resources for ongoing maintenance and software support necessary for continued 24/7 operation of the ORBIT facility as a community resource.  The proposed equipment upgrade will prepare ORBIT for anticipated higher performance experiments on emerging wireless technologies and network architectures.  Specific areas of experimental research that will be enabled by the upgraded ORBIT testbed include dynamic spectrum access, cognitive networking, wireless security, delay-tolerant routing protocols and network virtualization.  As an open community facility, ORBIT helps lower the barrier for experimentation on wireless networks, thus improving teaching and research productivity in the field.  The testbed currently serves as an important platform for wireless aspects of future Internet architecture research in the NSF computer science and engineering communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This CRI (Computing Research Infrastructure) grant represents the third phase of the ORBIT project, first funded in 2003 under the Network Research Testbeds (NRT) program (CNS-0335244) and subsequently under a follow-on grant CNS-0725053. A notable result of the earlier projects has been the successful construction and community release of the 400-node ORBIT radio grid facility that enables remote users to conduct reproducible networking experiments with large numbers of programmable wireless nodes.  The ORBIT radio grid was first made available to research users in Oct 2005, and since then has become a widely used community resource for experimental evaluation of emerging wireless network architectures and protocols.

Experiments being conducted on the enhanced ORBIT radio grid are community-driven and span a wide range of current and future wireless networking research topics.  Examples of specific experiments being supported include multi-radio spectrum coordination, cognitive radio networks, ad hoc network routing, storage-aware routing, delay tolerant networks, mobile content caching, location-aware protocols, and inter-layer wireless security.   Also, ORBIT was selected as the platform for DARPAÆs 2013-14 "Spectrum Challenge" in which academic and industrial teams competed on the design of software defined radios robust to various forms of interference.  The focus of this CRI project was on a set of equipment upgrades necessary to evolve the testbed capabilities to keep up with "MooreÆs Law" advances in computing platforms and radio technology.  In particular, one of the main results of the project was the replacement of the computing nodes (originally installed in ~2005) in the ORBIT radio grid with up-to-date platforms incorporating faster processors as needed to support emerging categories of experiments.   A high-performance ORBIT node platform (based on the Intel Core 2 Duo processor) was designed, manufactured, and a total of 200 new nodes were installed into both the testbed with the funding provided by this project.  In addition, the radio technologies available to experimenters were upgraded to include a total of ~50 software-defined radios (USRP, USRP2 and USRP X310 units) which can be programmed to support a variety of wireless technologies including WiFi, LTE and new experimental radios.   Servers and network switches in the ORBIT backend racks have also been completely upgraded with new quad-Pentium processors and OpenFlow switches respectively, and high-speed layer-2 connectivity to the GENI/NLR backbone has been established. Open LTE base station platforms for eventual replacement of current WiMax capability in ORBIT have been developed, and initial validations of three alternative platforms (hardware, Amarisoft commercial SDR and Open source SDR) have been carried out; Finally, continuing improvements have been made to the ORBIT user portal and related ORBIT management framework (OMF) software in order to meet evolving user needs.     Overall, this CRI grant enabled us to evolve the capabilities of the ORBIT testbed to keep abreast of the latest computing and radio technologies.  The equipment upgrades carried out in the project are expected to extend the life of the testbed from the initial lifetime of 7-10 years to 12-15 years.  The ORBIT testbed continues to serve a significant number of researchers across the country working on future wireless systems, and has the beneficial effect of lowering the barrier of entry for students and faculty who would normally not have access to advanced radio and networking equipment, thus helping to speed up the innovation cycle time (research-to-development-to-product) in the wireless field.
