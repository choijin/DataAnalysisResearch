<AbstractNarration>Understanding the structure and dynamics of Internet topology, routing, workload, performance, and vulnerabilities remains  disturbingly elusive, in part for lack of large-scale distributed network measurement infrastructure available to scientific researchers. This project upgrades and extends -- in geographic scope as well as function -- an active measurement instrumentation (Ark), creating an unprecedented laboratory in which to easily design, implement, and coordinate execution of Internet measurement experiments across a widely distributed set of dedicated monitors.  In 2007 Ark launched a new global Internet topology measurement and mapping expedition, and now gathers the largest set of IP topology data available to academic researchers. We use the best available techniques for IP topology mapping, share raw and processed data sets, and support software for analysis, annotation, topology generation, and interactive visualization of resulting graphs.  The effort has three tasks: (1) adding new monitors in geographic and topological areas lacking coverage; (2) improving tools for processing topology data; (3) enhancing and developing software modules to support new experiments and validation. Workshops will also be conducted to collect, synthesize, and integrate feedback on Ark operations.  It is expected that a broad set of research communities will continue make use of this measurement infrastructure. By lowering the cost to implement scientific Internet measurement experiments, Ark will allow researchers to test and evaluate more ambitious, sophisticated and risky ideas. The resulting data will enable a wide range of network modeling, simulation, analysis, and theoretical research activities, including historical Internet studies and evaluation of proposed future Internet architectures.</AbstractNarration>

Improved understanding of the structure and dynamics of Internet topology, routing, workload, performance, and vulnerabilities requires concerted efforts aimed at collecting the best possible data and making them available for scientific study and analysis.  Yet measurement of operational Internet infrastructure involves navigating more complex and interconnected dimensions than measurement in most scientific disciplines: logistical, financial, methodological, technical, legal, and ethical. CAIDA has been navigating these challenges with modest success for fifteen years, collecting, coordinating, curating, and sharing data sets for the Internet research and operational community in support of Internet science.  The main outcome of this project is the creation and maintenance of a secure platform capable of performing various types of Internet measurements and assessments -- the Archipelago (Ark) measurement infrastructure. Three major data products of Ark are: (1) a comprehensive longitudinal dataset of macroscopic IPv4 and IPv6 topology data, with tools and curated routing data sets to help interpret and process the raw data; (2) rich DNS data associated with each observed IP address; and (3) heavily curated strategic data kits convertng the raw data to router and AS-level granularities.  First, the Ark infrastructure continues to collect our most comprehensive and scientifically generative active data set - the IPv4 Routed /24 Topology Dataset - by systematically sending special probe packets and observing IP-level paths to a dynamically generated list of IP addresses covering all /24 prefixes in routed IPv4 address space. This unprecedented longitudinal measurement experiment started in September 2007 with a handful of monitors, and now runs on 80 monitors distributed worldwide (shown in the attached Figure).  We parallelize measurements across three teams of monitors, obtaining a traceroute measurement to each routed /24 (i.e., the full routed address space subdivided into (16.7M) /24 prefixes) in about two days.  Second, we perform DNS lookups of all IP addresses observed in our IPv4 and IPv6 topology probing. We use a customized bulk DNS lookup service capable of millions of DNS lookups per day.

The mappings facilitate annotation of IP topology data with information commonly encoded in router names, such as geographic location, link capacity, router type (access vs. backbone), and network name. The raw traffic data supports study of characteristics of DNS name servers, such as the penetration of DNSSEC and IPv6.

(Alias resolution is the process of identifying which interface IP addresses belong to the same routers, which is required to convert IP-level topology data discovered by traceroute into a router-level topology.)  Additionally, we make several processed data sets available as "soft infrastructure" to researchers: traceroute-derived AS Links (IPv4 and IPv6), and BGP-derived data to support richer annotation and topology inferences.  Our main outreach activity was organizing and hosting four annual workshops and publishing the reports in ACM SIGCOMM CCR.  The intellectual merit of this project is in the demonstrated ability of the Ark measurement platform and resulting data to serve other researchers undertaking macroscopic studies of the Internet, providing an unprecedented laboratory i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
