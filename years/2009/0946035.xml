    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to determine the commercial viability of a sensory substitution device that enables blind users to "see with sound" by transforming images from a wearable camera into sounds. One aspect to be investigated is whether or not the proposed device is useful and effective in the daily life of blind users. Another aspect is to determine the ease with which blind users can learn to interpret the sounds. Related to both, another goal is to develop a training curriculum that makes learning to interpret the sounds and use the device in daily life as easy as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research is the rehabilitation of the blind, enabling them to interact with their environment in ways that are otherwise impossible - recognizing and localizing objects at a distance, and being able to navigate in an environment without touching or bumping in to things. It is anticipated that the device can enhance the personal freedom and independence of the blind, enabling them to engage in a larger spectrum of activities, and empowering their integration and interaction with the rest of society.</AbstractNarration>
