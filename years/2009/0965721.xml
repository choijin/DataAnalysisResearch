<AbstractNarration>Tropical cyclone formation is still a largely unsolved scientific problem.  Numerical modeling studies have recently examined how a weak incipient mid-tropospheric cyclonic vortex (MCV) transforms into a tropical cyclone.  These studies show tropical cyclone development along distinctly different pathways.  Consequently, two competing theories have emerged: respectively referred to as processes of "bottom-up," during which an MCV is developed following an initial spinning up of surface winds; and "top-down," during which surface winds are strengthened after a formation of a strong MCV.  In this project we will investigate whether these apparently conflicting simulation results are due to the model initial condition is near a bifurcation point.  If this is the case, then relatively small changes to the initial conditions, or model physics, could alter the pathway for tropical cyclogenesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simulations will be conducted with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF; developed at National Center for Atmospheric Research) and Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS; developed at Colorado State University) to examine which pathway is taken for a wide variety of environmental conditions.  In particular, the hypothesis will be explored that the cause of the apparent bifurcation is related to the quantity of ice produced in deep convective towers.  The role of sea surface temperature in cloud ice production and the pathway taken to cyclogenesis will be investigated.  The sensitivity to microphysics, radiation, and vertical wind shear will also be analyzed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit.   This research will explore the possibility that there exist bifurcating pathways to tropical cyclogenesis, as suggested by recent numerical modeling studies.  It will evaluate the physical causes for the existence of a bifurcation point and examine the sensitivity of the pathways to environmental conditions.  A unique aspect of this study will be a comparison between two different modeling systems (WRF and RAMS) that will allow a better assessment of the veracity of the results and the possible existence of a bifurcation point.  If the results of this study provide evidence for the existence of bifurcating pathways, it will provide a new perspective of tropical cyclogenesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts.   Knowledge of the existence of a bifurcating pathway to tropical cyclogenesis would be beneficial to weather forecasting.  One of the pathways appears to often form very small, rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones, which are currently particularly difficult for tropical forecasters to predict.  This study would elucidate the environmental conditions favoring tropical cyclone development and also provide details of their morphology and observable features that would be useful for predicting their development.  This study would also be of interest to researchers who study the effect of changing climatic conditions, such as sea surface temperature and vertical wind shear, on tropical cyclone activity.  The sensitivity tests to the microphysical and radiation schemes could help lead to improved numerical prediction of tropical cyclones.  The use of a double-moment microphysical scheme may provide improved capability for remote sensing comparisons, such as multiparameter radar.  Additionally, the identification of a bifurcation point would be of interest to researchers in other fields who study bifurcating systems.  The results of this work will be actively disseminated through participation at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.  Furthermore, the project will directly contribute towards the education of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This study focused on the early stage of hurricane formation, examining how a tropical disturbance strengthens to become a tropical depression, a process known as tropical cyclogenesis. It made use of complex atmospheric models designed primarily to investigate clouds and their role in weather systems. Tropical disturbances occur over the warm tropical oceans and are characterized by a cluster of numerous rain showers and thunderstorms. Observational studies have found that tropical disturbances that undergo tropical cyclogenesis often have a broad circulation of winds, known as a vortex, a few kilometers above the surface. Prior to this study atmospheric models had shown that there might be two distinct ways that a tropical depression could form when there is a vortex aloft. One pathway involves deep upward motion in rain showers and thunderstorms, which draws low-level air into the system. As a result the circulation at the surface spins up cyclonically because of the Coriolis force. Eventually surface winds simply strengthen enough that the system becomes a tropical depression. There does not appear to be a significant role of the vortex aloft for evolution along this pathway. The second pathway is quite different since the large vortex aloft strengthens considerably, which is then followed by the sudden formation of a tiny surface vortex in the center of the tropical disturbance. Subsequently this small vortex becomes the focus of a strengthening circulation that grows in size often developing rapidly into a small tropical cyclone.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two fundamental questions that need to be to be answered to understand why the second pathway exists: First, why does the pre-existing broad vortex aloft strengthen, and second, why does the very small surface vortex suddenly form? This investigation has provided an explanation for the first question and a partial answer to the second. Model experiments reveal that the reason for the development of a strong vortex aloft in the case of the second pathway is due to the production of copious quantities of ice in deep convective towers. The outflow of ice crystals in the anvils of numerous convective towers forms a large-scale upper level ice canopy. As the crystals fall they undergo a process known as sublimation at the canopy base, where they convert directly to the vapor phase. This, results in cooling, which causes the air to become negatively buoyant and sink, subsequently driving a mid-level inflow. The Coriolis force acting on this mid-level inflow then causes the mid-level cyclonic circulation to strengthen.
