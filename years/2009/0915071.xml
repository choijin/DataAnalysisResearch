<AbstractNarration>This project is developing automated methods of artificial intelligence (AI) for creating generalized plans that include loops and branches, can handle unknown quantities of objects, and work for large classes of problem instances. One of the key challenges is to reason about plans with loops and to do so without using automated theorem proving, which tends to be intractable. In particular, research is accomplishing the following goals: (1) develop new theoretical foundations for generalized planning; (2) develop effective abstraction mechanisms and new plan representations to support these new capabilities; (3) develop effective algorithms for plan synthesis as well as generalization of sample plans; (4) develop analysis tools to reason about the applicability, correctness and efficiency of generalized plans; (5) extend the framework to include sensing actions, conditional plans, and domain-specific knowledge in the form of partially specified plans; (6) create a new set of challenging benchmark problems and perform a rigorous evaluation of the approach; and (7) increase the interaction between the AI community and other communities, particularly model checking, that study the abstraction mechanisms and theoretical foundations necessary for generalized planning. This new framework may significantly improve the scope and applicability of automated planning systems.</AbstractNarration>
