    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to increase the number of students with learning disabilities who pursue and graduate from technological education programs and either continue their academic pursuit of four-year technological degrees, or gain employment as successful technology workforce employees. Landmark College, a two-year college for students with learning disabilities and attention disorders, will conduct a series of needs assessments of three community college technology programs and regional technology employers to develop a hybrid (in-person and online) professional development program, based on best practices. The professional development materials will cover a number of areas of struggle for students in technology-related courses, including mathematics and science instruction, mastering complex vocabulary, study skills, and metacognitive strategies to help students assess their own understanding. Program effectiveness will be assessed through the implementation of a one-group pretest-posttest pilot study conducted at the three community college partner sites (Community College of Allegheny County, Lone Star College, and Western Nevada College), using a grounded theory analysis approach to review formative program results and summative student and faculty outcomes. An independent external evaluator will assess the project's effectiveness in meeting its goals.</AbstractNarration>
