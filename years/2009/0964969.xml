<AbstractNarration>This project is to develop a global scale IPv6 monitoring system that will track IPv6 address allocations, IPv6 routing announcements, the topological connectivity of IPv6-capable networks, and IPv6 reachability in the data plane, all at the global scale. Each of these metrics is useful in tracking IPv6 deployment, but the right combination of control plane metrics and data plane metrics has the potential to provide a comprehensive overview of IPv6 deployment successes and obstacles. Lessons learned in monitoring IPv4 infrastructure will be applied, but monitoring IPv6 deployment poses a number of unique challenges and unknowns. At this early stage of IPv6 deployment, it is particularly important to provide data plane information that can complement the control plane information. This project will develop an innovative technique that measures IPv6 coverage and reachability by using active probes to DNS servers. This approach leverages our existing DNS  monitoring infrastructure and will allow us to test reachablity in both IPv6-IPv6 and IPv6-IPv4 scenarios. If successful, the results will provide detailed information for researchers and operators faced with specific measurement questions and also provide a global perspective that is meaningful to those searching for IPv6 deployment challenges. The results will not only provide the latest snapshot of IPv6 rollout but will also help identify open issues and potential obstacles to facilitate IPv6 deployment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[IRNC:SP: 6Watch: RouteViews Infrastructure for Monitoring, Tracking and Diagnosing IPv6 Deployment IPv6 usage has grown significantly over the past 5 years.  The percentage of users making Internet connections over IPv6 has increased from less than 1% to over 7%.  The number of entries in the IPv6 global routing table has increased from 2,200 to 23,000.  IPv6 has become an integral component of the Internet.  The 6watch grant has helped monitor the growth of IPv6 by supporting the RouteViews and Cyclops6 projects. RouteViews RouteViews is a network research project hosted by the University of Oregon. The RouteViews project has been collecting IPv4 routing data since late 1997, and IPv6 routing data since May 2003.  RouteViews operates route collectors, which are colocated at network exchange points around the world.  These collectors gather routing data from network service providers, which is then used to analyze the state of the Internet.   The 6watch grant enabled the RouteViews project to continue to grow--adding new collectors at critical locations, and improving the scope and the quality of the data. RouteViews currently has IPv6 routing relationships with 114 different organizations, and a total of 163 peering sessions with those organizations. Routing data is useful in a number of ways.  The data is analyzed over time to determine the rate of growth of the Internet.  Researchers use the archived data to study significant changes in the topology of the Internet.  Regional network operators query the route collectors in order to verify reachability to their own networks.  The data is also used in anomaly detection systems, which monitor events such as bogus routes, route hijacks, and other forms of abuse. Cyclops6 Cyclops is an Internet route monitoring system hosted at UCLA.  Utilizing resources from the 6watch grant, the Cyclops system was modified to include support for the IPv6 protocol.  This produced the Cyclops6 system. Cyclops6 allows any organization to monitor the network paths they use to reach the Internet.  By monitoring network paths, as well as network addresses, Cyclops6 is able to detect when there are significant changes in reachability to any network.  The Cyclops system is an innovative network monitoring system.  The Cyclops system categorizes the links between organizations in the Internet.  By assigning weights to the links, and observing the changes in the weights over specified time intervals, Cyclops is able to detect major changes in routing in the Internet.  Cyclops also continually monitors basic routing attributes.  For example, the address space used by an organization is monitored.  When there are changes to these attributes, alerts can be generated.  RouteViews is a primary data source for Cyclops. Impacts The 6watch grant has produced routing data that has been useful in many areas of research.  A number of organizations use the data to generate statistics about the growth of the Internet.  For example, the "CIDR Report" and "BGP Report" are preeminent sources for network routing statistics. These reports show increases in the size and scope of IPv6 networking.  The "BGP Routing Leak Detection System" is another research project that has been built upon the use of openly available routing data.  The Routing Leak system provides researchers with a reference grade methodology for investigating route leaks and hijacks.  Similar research has been performed by CERT at Carnegie Mellon University.  The CMU research examines the correlation between routing anomalies and the propagation of SPAM and malware. These examples and numerous others are products of the 6watch grant.  Network operators use the RouteViews route collectors to monitor their networks on a daily basis.  And RouteViews continues to be one of the few quality sources for routing data for research.  The 6watch project has been successful in supporting the collection of IPv6 routing data, the distribution of that data, and the deve...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
