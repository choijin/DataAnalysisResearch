<AbstractNarration>The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) propose to broaden participation in computing by leveraging the Broadening Engagement program of the SC ("Supercomputing") conferences for 2010-2012. For more than 20 years, the SC conference series has been the "goto" venue for technical development, community building, and interdisciplinary activity in high performance computing, networking, and storage. SC brings together computer scientists, applications scientists, government, industry, and education and can play a major role in facilitating the diversification of the computing community and workforce. The SC conference has continued to reach out to underrepresented groups to stimulate their successful engagement with HPC. The current proposal leverages SC Broadening Engagement programs for SC2010-SC2012 and extends community support and development and builds on existing networks and alliances in the BPC community to visibly increase the level of participation of underrepresented groups in high performance computing and computing disciplines. The project will foster lasting, collaborative relationships between faculty, IT professionals, students, and computer and research scientists who attend the conference. The project will be co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and ACM and with NSF support will provide participation grants, networking, mentoring and research opportunities during and beyond the SC10-SC12 conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Beyond Broader Engagement: Project Outcomes for the NSF&shy;sponsored BeBE project   The primary objective of the Beyond Broader Engagement (BeBE&shy;SC) at the Supercomputing Conference (SC) is to leverage the success of the SC Broader Engagement (BE) program by drawing more underrepresented professionals into high performance computing, and through BeBE, to foster BE members? success in leadership roles within the HPC community.   The specific goals of the BeBE&shy;SC program were three fold:   Increase the number of individual BeBE participants at SC conferences Increase the professional networks of BeBE participants via BPC Alliances and mentoring. Develop nascent researchers and leaders from underrepresented groups in the leadership of SC, HPC communities.        In November of 2010 (New Orleans, LA), 2011 (Seattle, WA) and 2012 (Salt Lake City, UT) the Broader Engagement program brought BeBE&shy;SC financially supported students, professionals, and faculty members to SC from a pool of 280 accepted applicants. For each conference year, the BeBE program organizers developed BeBE specific and SC&shy;wide programming around the conference, kicking off with an orientation program, BeBE programming that were open to all registrants, a mentorship program, a job fair, and related activities.       Developing Networking and Mentoring   BeBE fosters leadership explicitly by using a collaborative mentoring model. By its very design this model serves to usher students, early career professionals and junior faculty into the HPC technical venue. The BeBE participants described how BeBE&shy;SC involvement led to sustained or deepened involvement in SC and HPC. They note this sustained involvement has been beneficial for their developing careers. Participants also stated that the most valuable aspects of their BE experience were: networking, access to high quality technical content, and the opportunity to engage in rich content through discussion, presentation, and debate.   We know from research and our own evaluations that attending conferences, participating in research, and creating professional networks are key to individuals (particularly those from underrepresented groups) becoming and feeling part of the professional, research society.   Beyond BE participants noted how they appreciated access to leaders in the high performance computing community through specialized BE programming and sessions.   Creating a network of support for leadership and growth   A desired outcome of the BeBE program was to develop leaders in SC and throughout the HPC research community. When asked, students and professionals indicated the following BeBE content helped to develop their leadership abilities: conference participation, a           structured support networking, content knowledge development, personal and professional goal setting and achievement.   Beyond the SC   Alumni of the SC BE programs have created leadership positions by organizing programs and activities within and beyond SC. These include the Broadening Participation in Data Mining and the Broader Engagement program of SIAM led by Sustainable Horizons Institute.
