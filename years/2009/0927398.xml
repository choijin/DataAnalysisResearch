<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a preliminary design and work-breakdown-structure for a large-scale subsurface experimental facility to investigate coupled thermal-hydrological-mechanical-chemical-biological processes in fractured rock at depth. The experiment will be part of the proposed Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) in the Homestake Mine, South Dakota. Many natural and engineered earth systems involve coupling of multiple processes in rocks that vary across a wide range of scales. The most pervasive process in the Earth?s crust that gives rise to strongly coupled phenomena is the flow of fluids (water, CO2, hydrocarbons, magmas) through fractured heated rock under stress. Understanding changes in the reactivity, deformability, life-supporting and transport properties of rocks that fluids infiltrate is important in a broad range of geological engineering and geological science endeavors. Despite this fundamental importance, the interactions remain poorly understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will: (1) Determine properties of Homestake rocks: geological, geochemical, mechanical, thermal, isotopic, and reactivity. (2) Upscale these data to elucidate transport mechanisms (conductive versus convective), natural reaction rates in fractures, and microbial community evolution. (3) Evaluate monitoring strategies, in-situ probes and sampling methods, and necessary measurements. (4) Select a candidate site for the evaluating coupled processes. (5) Develop a work-breakdown-structure. (6) Develop a coupled numerical model to evaluate potential effects on the rock mass and optimal heater configuration, power, and monitoring borehole orientations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The models and insight from these experiments will have broad applicability to engineered systems, e.g., enhanced geothermal systems, CO2 sequestration and subsurface contaminant transport. Educational outreach will involve facility tours and a traveling benchscale ?mock-up? demonstration experiment. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The interactions between the fluids and rocks in the EarthÃ†s crust result in systems we rely on directly for energy (geothermal) or industrial materials (economic ore deposits). These interactions are commonly studied from the historical perspective, as it is difficult to observe them in real-time.  Most natural and engineered fluid-rock processes are characterized by strong coupling of hydrological, thermal, mechanical, chemical, and sometimes biological processes. In order to quantitatively understand these processes we conducted an initial study for the design and are planning stages of a proposed experimental facility to investigate coupled Thermal-Hydrological-Mechanical-Chemical-Biological (THMCB) processes at a range of scales (grain/pore-scale to decimeter-scale) in real time. The experiment is being planned as part of the proposed Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) at the Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota.  We characterized the geochemical variations in waters within the DUSEL site, from surface water to groundwater that was present up to 4850 feet below the surface. We analyzed this data using a range of approaches to understand the geochemical reactions that were occurring as a function of space and time.  Based on the measured compositions, waters can be grouped into three types: dilute, shallow Ca-HCO3 waters; intermediate-depth Mg-SO4 waters from sumps and stopes; and concentrated, deep Na-HCO3 waters. From these three end-members we infer that fluids evolve along two separate paths: one path in which interaction with the mine infrastructure results in oxidation of the sulfides to yield more SO42- relative to carbonate species, and a second path in which increased depth and interaction with rock results in more Na+ relative to Ca2+ and Mg2+. All waters were beneath regulatory limits for the elements considered.  We also analyzed the isotopic composition (&delta;D, &delta;18O, &delta;13C, 87Sr/86Sr, (234U/238U)) of the waters to evaluate the key hydrologic and geochemical processes that control the movement of water and solute through the rock surrounding the mine.  We further developed a numerical reactive-transport model for U and Srto evaluate the importance of subsurface fractures in controlling the transport of solutes. The model indicates that the isotopic composition of the water is sensitive to both fracture aperture and rock U-Sr compositions. These methods may be applied to measuring effective fracture apertures at other study sites, provided that the U and Sr concentrations and isotopic compositions of fluids and rocks at the site can be characterized. The simple methods we develop may be applied to measuring effective fracture apertures at other study sites and in other systems, such as geothermal systems, fracture-dominated groundwater systems proposed for nuclear waste storage, fluid flow in fault damage zones and finally fluid flow and reaction in highly heterogeneous but structured environments associated with groundwater contamination. Our results may therefore have implications for the use of tracers in hydrology, diagenesis and geothermal processes.  The geochemical data we collected for the Homestake DUSEL project is the first comprehensive dataset collected for this facility. As such, the data will provide an important baseline for future studies at the site, including hydrology, biology and engineering experiments. It will also provide useful information for site management as the geochemical signatures can be used to fingerprint the history of the water.
