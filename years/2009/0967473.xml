<AbstractNarration>0967473&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klausner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the onset of boiling involving surfaces that are extremely smooth, with geometrical features on the order of nanometers. Experimental observation has shown that the onset of boiling using such surfaces occurs at superheats much lower than expected and on the same order as for rough surfaces.  This observation of somewhat anomalous behavior calls the traditional view of heterogeneous nucleation as emanating from trapped vapor in small surface crevices and cavities, into question. The proposed research seeks to explain, from a fundamental basis, this apparent anomaly. A combined experimental and analytical approach is taken. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: It is hypothesized that the high surface energy associated with free electron flow at metallic surfaces contributes to the work of formation of a critical nucleus, thus reducing the thermal energy required to initiate vapor bubble incipience.  Density functional theory will be used to develop a mathematical framework to compute the incipient superheat while an experimental facility will be employed to measure incipience phenomena for a variety of atomically smooth surface/fluid combinations. The experimental investigation will be extended to measure the incipient superheat for the same surfaces fabricated with nano-sized features embedded within micron sized cavities.  The degree to which these features promote or inhibit incipience will be determined. Once the heterogeneous incipient mechanism for nano-smooth surfaces is well understood, the production and suppression of nucleation sites at low to moderate superheats will be investigated.  Finally, a computational platform will be developed to simulate and predict the detailed transient thermal field within the solid heating surface, and the local temperature field will be used in conjunction with the incipience criteria to determine whether nucleation sites are produced or suppressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Boiling is a basic heat transfer process that is ubiquitous across an extremely wide spectrum of manufacturing, energy generation and water production processes. &lt;br/&gt;University of Florida electronic education delivery platforms will be used to broadly disseminate new knowledge that evolves from the research via distance learning. Short courses for industry will be offered and the research results will be incorporated into these courses.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project entitled, <em>Heterogeneous Nucleation in Boiling Systems</em>, has resulted in significant advancements in understanding how the inception of vapor bubbles in boiling energy transport systems enhances the transport of thermal energy. In this work it has been demonstrated that wicking phenomena on structured surfaces draws liquid into the microstructure resulting in a substantially increased upper limit on the energy transfer rate. A large data set comprising different surface/fluid combinations has been collected, and the measured limiting energy transfer rate has been compared with a theoretical model that has been developed as part of this work. The theoretical model is very useful to engineering practitioners that design boiling energy transport systems and has a variety of applications such as thermoelectric power conversion, nuclear reactor cooling, air conditioning, refrigeration, chemical processing, synthetic fuel synthesis, and desalination. In addition, a large data set has been compiled for the energy transport rate for boiling phenomena on micro-smooth surfaces, and it has been demonstrated that the atomic lattice structure of the heating surface has a strong influence on the formation of vapor bubbles. The bubble formation enhances the energy transport in two ways. The first mechanism involves the evaporation of liquid to vapor for growing the vapor bubble, and the second involves the disturbance of a flowing liquid around a bubble attached to the heating surface.
