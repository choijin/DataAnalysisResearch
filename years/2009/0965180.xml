<AbstractNarration>The project enables low-income students, who meet established academic criteria, to obtain Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degrees in the biological sciences, physical sciences, mathematical sciences, computer and information sciences, geosciences, engineering, and technology areas associated with the preceding science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. These students will then transfer to an upper-division school or enter the workforce directly in their chosen field. For each term, a minimum of 27 academically promising students are provided with scholarships and a wide range of specially-designed enrichment activities to ensure their success.</AbstractNarration>
