<AbstractNarration>This EAGER award is for an exploratory, high-risk, high-payoff effort to develop a novel instrument for dark matter detection. Observations indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary Dark Matter particles that do not emit or absorb light. The leading hypothesis for the nature of dark matter is that it consists of new elementary particles produced moments after the Big Bang, generally referred to as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. One way to detect them in an Earth-bound experiment is to measure the low energy nuclear recoils they produce in rare interactions with normal matter. This group will develop small NaI and liquid xenon detectors that can be installed in the Solar Neutrino Borexino detector, at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory, Italy, for a dark matter search. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detector would be inserted through existing plumbing tubes into the center of the Borexino liquid scintillator. When positioned in the Borexino scintillator, the background in the small detector due to external sources of gamma rays and neutrons will be negligible. The Borexino scintillator also serves as a very efficient anti-coincidence detector to veto internal gamma and neutron backgrounds that originate and scatter within the small detector and in the Borexino scintillator. A 10-kg detector with the combination of low backgrounds from external and internal sources should have sufficient sensitivity to test the validity of the reported DAMA/LIBRA dark matter signal.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, this proposal addresses one of the major scientific questions of our time, the nature of dark matter in the universe. As a cross-disciplinary topic it also has an impact on advanced detector technology.  The PI has a commitment to involving undergraduates in his research projects.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The EAGER Award supported the early research and development of low background sodium iodide scintillation detectors that could test the DAMA/LIBRA (D-L) claim of WIMP dark matter detection.  The D-L evidence for dark is based on the observation of an annual modulation in the rate of single-crystal interactions in an array of NaI(Tl) scintillating crystals. The modulation has a phase consistent with dark matter, has been observed for more than ten years, and has no known explanation due to spurious normal matter effects.   However, the observed amplitude of the D-L modulation appears to be inconsistent with the results of other direct detection dark matter experiments that use detectors based on  xenon (LUX) and germanium (CDMS).  Since the signal can depend on the target a new experiment with sodium iodide detectors is needed to confirm or refute the D-L evidence for dark matter detection.     The EAGER grant supported the development of new NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors that would be more sensitive to dark matter events than D-L.   The goal of the new experiment is a detector with lower background in the energy region of interest (2-6 keV) and lower threshold energy than 2 keV, achieved by D-L.  To achieve these goals the new experiment features a liquid scintillator veto detector that surrounds the NaI(Tl) crystal modules to provides additional background suppression of radiation from crystal radioactivity, external gamma rays, and cosmic rays.  The lower crystal background and threshold energy, in combination with the active liquid scintillator shield, are designed to enhance a true dark matter signal above background, thereby providing better separation of a true signal from background and other spurious effects.     The progress on radio-pure NaI(Tl) crystals involved collaboration with commercial partners to reduce radioactive impurities in the crystal, the main source of background. The improvements addressed the production of higher quality sodium iodide powder,  crystal growth methods that eliminated contaminations from environmental sources of natural radioactivity, and the improvement in sensitive mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) that could make sufficiently sensitive measurements of the troublesome naturally occurring radioactive impurities, K, Rb, U, and Th.  The research on powder production was carried out with SAFC HiTech (now Sigma Aldrich), and Seastar Chemicals. Both collaborations resulted in the production of sodium iodide powder with much lower levels of radioactivity than normal commercial sodium iodide.  Development of high purity crystal growing with special crucibles and procedures was carried out with Radiation Monitoring Devices  The ICP-MS measurements developed by Seastar Chemicals and PNNL were successful in improving the sensitivity to potassium and other elements.   Their sensitivity to potassium now approaches 1 ppb, a significant improvement over gamma ray counting that reached 35 ppb sensitivity after several months of gamma ray counting with 5-kg samples.     The enhanced sensitivity of mass spectroscopy enabled rapid testing and improvement in methods to achieve crystals with low radioactivity.     The main outcome of the EAGER research was the eventual production of a 2-kg NaI(Tl) crystal with a potassium impurity of 9 ppb. This is the lowest potassium impurity so far achieved in NaI(Tl) crystals,  and lower than the 13 ppb potassium in the DAMA/LIBRA.   The low level of potassium in combination with additional background reduction with the liquid scintillator veto will result in an overall background reduction of  a factor of ten compared to the D-L background.  Addition improvements are expected to reduce the potasium and other impurities, based on studies of sources of contamination and tests of chemical purification of the sodium iodide powder.  A potassium level as low as 1 ppb in the final crystals may be possible.     The reduction of potassium summarized above are based on mass spec...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
