<AbstractNarration>The proposer plans to study solar wind turbulence by applying statistical analysis techniques to ACE, Wind, and Helios 2 spacecraft data. Specifically, she will analyze magnetic field probability distribution functions (PDFs) in order to seek the causes of intermittency and the departures of solar wind plasma structures from Gaussian profiles. She expects to determine whether phase correlation or spectral variability is the main cause of observed non-Gaussian PDFs of magnetic field variations. In this investigation, she will extend her prior calculations and modeling of non-Gaussian PDFs to a broader range of solar wind parameters, testing both random-phase and phase-correlated models. The proposer will thereby produce theoretical predictions of these PDFs, from the largest to the smallest separation scales, and provide definitive tests of the relative impacts of variability and phase correlations on the non-Gaussian nature of such probability distribution functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposer explains that her new model of intermittent turbulence will be valuable for estimating the scattering of solar wind energetic particles and for quantifying the dispersal of solar wind magnetic field lines.  She notes that such information is crucial to accurate space weather predictions of solar energetic particle intensities at the Earth. As a female scientist, the proposer is a member of an underrepresented group in solar physics. Therefore, funding this research will contribute to broadening diversity in the field.</AbstractNarration>

Phase correlation is often believed to be the cause of the non-Gaussian PDFs, and of the coherent structures (e.g., vortices) associated with them. The concept of spectral variability, however, is also naturally associated with intermittency.

We clearly demonstrate that in the SW, time variability of the power level of turbulence is the cause of the non-Gaussian PDFs, not the phase correlations.     Through modeling along a SW flow line of the self-similar field variations, in a simple ``constant-at-all-scales'' Fourier spectrum of magnetic turbulence, and convolution of these field variations with the measured distributions Q of the time-varying Fourier power levels, we obtain accurate fits of the measured non-Gaussian PDFs of magnetic field variations over a very broad range of inertial scales in the SW (shown in Figure 1 for scales of 1e9, 1e10 and 1e11cm).

We also find that inertial-range intermittency is much stronger in SW turbulence than it is in terrestrial fluid turbulence. We suspect that mechanisms of significantly different nature are at work in both types of turbulence and suggest explanations for the strong SW intermittency that are very much specific to the SW.
