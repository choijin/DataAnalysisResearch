<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent years have seen a significant revision of our understanding of the nitrogen cycle. The discovery of new biological processes such as anaerobic ammonia oxidation, and the recognition that key metabolic processes like ammonia oxidation are more broadly distributed among extant organisms and across broader habitat ranges have forced us to reevaluate nearly a century of data collection and biogeochemical modeling. Furthermore, genomic analyses between organisms mediating key processes in the nitrogen cycle also oblige us to revisit our assumptions of how these metabolic pathways first developed. The recent discovery of a thermophilic nitrifying archaeon has expanded our view of the organisms and habitats capable of supporting ammonia oxidation based metabolism. With the discovery of other thermophilic microorganism capable of transforming nitrogen compounds, these results suggest the existence of a complex, possibly ancient nitrogen cycle in high temperature environments. Understanding the organisms and metabolic processes that contribute this high temperature nitrogen cycle may inform how these nutrient cycles first evolved. The principal objective of this project is a detailed investigation of the physiology and biochemistry of the pathway for ammonia oxidation in the thermophilic ammonia oxidizing archaeon Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii. Researchers at San Francisco State University will use a combination of physiological, biochemical, molecular and genomic approaches to better understand the biology of N. yellowstonii and the evolution of ammonia-oxidation based metabolism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of these studies are expected to significantly advance our understanding of the evolution of ammonia-oxidation based metabolism and of the microbiology of nitrogen cycling in high temperature environments. However, an important aspect of this project is the training and promotion of young scientists from groups traditionally underrepresented in Science. This project will be conducted at San Francisco State University, a large, comprehensive, public university with a large pool of underrepresented minority (URM) students. The project will train one URM postdoctoral fellow, two graduate students and 1-3 undergraduates through mentoring by the PI (a URM himself) and senior laboratory personnel. The PI will incorporate these studies into his undergraduate and graduate teaching to stimulate student interest in microbial ecology, evolution, and genomics.</AbstractNarration>

This project funded basic research into the physiology, ecology and evolution of a group of microorganisms, known as ammonia-oxidizing archaea (or AOA), driving key chemical transformations of nitrogen compounds in high-temperature environments. AOA derive energy by oxidizing ammonia to nitrite. However, owing to their recent discovery, little is known about their biology and their interaction with other organisms and their environment. With this award, we explored the biology of a thermophilic representative of the AOA, <em>Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii</em>, cultivated from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park. <em>N. yellowstonii</em> grows at the highest temperature ever recorded for any AOA, up to 74?C. With this award, we were able to show that <em>N. yellowstonii</em> is able to use a variety of alternative energy sources in addition to ammonia, including urea, biuret and amino acids. We found that <em>N. yellowstonii</em> can grow under a wide variety of nutrient concentrations, but it appears to prefer extremely low concentrations of ammonia, dividing fastest at concentrations below 250 nanomolar. Likewise, although oxygen is required for growth, we found that <em>N. yellowstonii</em> tolerates a wide range of concentrations. These traits suggest that <em>N. yellowstonii</em> is adapted to growth in nutrient poor environments. As part of our study, we also sequenced and analyzed the genome of <em>N. yellowstonii</em>. We found that many of the genes we had previously predicted might be important for energy production in AOA (based on our earlier studies of marine AOA) were absent from the genome of <em>N. yellowstonii</em>. Our findings have made us reevaluate our theories about the physiology of these environmentally important microorganisms and have led to important insights into their role in shaping the composition and metabolic interactions of microbial communities. For instance, we demonstrated that the presence of AOA in hot springs limits the amount of nitrogen available to other microorganisms in those microbial communities. To overcome this limitation, some organisms must use substantial amounts of energy to convert nitrogen gas to biologically usable forms, a process known as nitrogen fixation. Inhibiting AOA metabolism decreased the need for nitrogen fixation and substantially increased the growth rates of the rest of the community. Overall, the scientific findings of this award have increased our understanding of these microorganisms and have raised numerous new questions we hope to continue addressing in future NSF-funded projects.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to these scientific results, a central goal of this project was to train and promote young scientists from groups traditionally underrepresented in Science.
