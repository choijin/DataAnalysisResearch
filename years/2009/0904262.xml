<AbstractNarration>The proposed research is on Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) in dimensions two and three.  TQFTs    produce   topological invariants of geometric objects such as knots and 3-dimensional manifolds. We shall study applications of TQFTs to classical topological problems  such as finding whether  a given Serre fibration over a surface (or more,  generally, over a 2-dimensional orbifold) has a section. This will require a careful study of  Homotopy QFTs introduced by the author in 1999. In another direction, we will give a   general algebraic framework for 3-dimensional state-sum TQFTs and connect the latter  to 3-dimensional surgery TQFTs as follows: the state sum TQFT derived from a finite semisimple monoidal category C is isomorphic to the surgery TQFT derived from the Drinfeld  double of C. The proof will use the   technique of bottom tangles due to Bruguieres-Virelizier-Habiro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum physics has invariably served as a source of new mathematical insights and techniques. One   such  insight introduced about 20 years ago by the Fields medalists E. Witten and M. Atiyah is called Topological Quantum Field Theory. It allows us to approach real-world geometric objects such as surfaces of solid bodies or  knotted circles in the space from a new, physical perspective. We will use this viewpoint to address  certain geometric problems concerning the surfaces. In particular, we will answer  several classical questions raised well before the introduction of   Quantum Field Theory.  We will also study a connection between  mathematical techniques  arising from Quantum Field Theory and from  Quantum Gravity. This study will involve deep algebraic techniques introduced by another Fields medalist V. Drinfeld. This  project will exhibit new facets of the fundamental connection between   physics, geometry, and algebra.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Topological Quantum Field Theory, also called quantum topology,  is a  branch of modern geometry studying soft  (topological) properties of  geometric shapes through an application of methods coming from  theoretical physics. Quantum topology has been very successful in  associating algebraic objects (invariants) with various 3-dimensional  shapes and  with  knotted circles in 3-dimensional shapes. One  fundamental finding of the project is a new connection between two  different techniques used in quantum topology: the technique based on  ideas of statistical mechanics and the technique based on 3-dimensional  surgery    which cuts out pieces of geometric shapes and  glues them back following specific instructions. It is established in  the project that the second technique is more general than the first:   an invariant obtained using a statistical model  can be also obtained  via surgery. The precise computation uses a rather delicate algebraic  instrument  called the Drinfeld center and allowing to manipulate the algebraic data  in the models. The statistical models  being simpler and more direct  than surgery often allow more geometric insight. The surgery method is  often more suitable for computations. The connection between the two  approaches leads to more efficient computations and better geometric   understanding. A  fundamental finding of the project is a new, more general model for  so-called modified quantum invariants. These invariants are introduced  when the  more standard statistical models fail to produce anything  non-trivial. Our  model for such invariants generalizes previously known  models and specifically the Kashaev knot invariant appearing in his  volume conjecture. This generalization elucidates the appropriate framework for the modified quantum invariants and  provides  more examples for further analysis. Another important outcome of the project is the possibility to apply the   methods of quantum topology not only to 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional shapes but also to  additional structures on such shapes. This very interesting direction  involves  new difficult and deep algebra and also raises  a number of  questions, to be studied in the future.  The key new question is the possibility to extend the above mentioned connection between two techniques to the setting of additional structures on 3-dimensional shapes.
