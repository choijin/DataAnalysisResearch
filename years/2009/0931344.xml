<AbstractNarration>0931344&lt;br/&gt;Samuelson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this research is to evolve an economically viable coal and biomass fed energy plant concept that integrates advanced subsystem technologies which are under development in a synergistic manner to generate electricity while capturing a significant portion of the CO2 and coproducing H2 for future fuel cell hybrid vehicle applications.  For the design element of the research, a typical plant sire will be conceptualized by taking into account access to coal and biomass feedstock resources, proximity to CO2 sequestration sites and transportation of the coproduct H2.  For the purposes of the design study, major subsystems in the context of 2020 deployment will be selected, with development of models for predicting performance.  A variety of concepts will be evaluated utilizing system simulation models, and by developing exergy analysis and rough order of magnitude economic analysis leading to a final system design selection.  Through a broad array of outreach activities hosted by the principal investigator, including an international colloquium, annual short course events, and industry member meetings, results of the research will be widely disseminated.  Additionally, an outreach program will involve local elementary and high school teachers.</AbstractNarration>
