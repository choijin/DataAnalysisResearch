    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop a new generation of anode materials for lithium-ion batteries having the advantages of low cost, high Li+ ion storage capacity, high rate, and long cycling life. These anode materials are innovative nanocomposite structures made up of Si nano particles, carbon, and nano graphene platelets (NGPs). NGPs were recently shown to exhibit the highest intrinsic strength among existing materials. This reasearch aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility of this electrode technology by carrying out the following tasks: (1) preparation and characterization of the nanocomposite particles based on theoretical guidelines, and (2) cycling performance evaluation of laboratory-scale cells. The goal is the development of an anode material with a capacity over 700 mAh/g. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project is that the availability of a high-capacity and high-rate anode material will overcome one of the barriers that have prevented the more widespread implementation of Li-ion batteries in electric vehicle applications. If successful, the new anode technology is expected to speed the development and deployment of advanced lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. The batteries that use this anode material will have enhanced the charge/discharge rates and enable electric vehicles with higher mileage range. The technology is expected to have positive impact in several of the nation's energy-related initiatives: reduction of greenhouse gas and other emissions, and decrease in dependence on imported fossil fuel. Moreover, the successful commercialization of this technology is expected to provide a differentiating capability that can strengthen Li-ion battery development and manufacturing within the US.</AbstractNarration>
