<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this collaborative research between University of Connecticut and Texas A&amp;M University is to develop a new probabilistic framework of dynamic analysis for handling large-scale structures under uncertainties.  In particular, the research team aims at tackling a number of research challenges such as high computational cost and difficulty in characterizing model uncertainties, often encountered in this type of analysis.  The approach in this research is built upon a hybrid modeling and analysis strategy, using both the computations and measurements of structural modal responses.  It features the combination of structural dynamic model order-reduction, Bayesian response prediction (based on a set of viable candidate models), and recursive model updating and verification at multiple stages.  To enable the probabilistic analysis of high dimensional systems, a highly efficient adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo solution procedure will be developed and embedded into the analysis framework.  This framework allows us to evaluate simultaneously the structural uncertainties and their impact to vibration responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the outcome of this research will lead to the concurrent advancements in both probabilistic structural analysis and Monte Carlo-based solution techniques.  The information of structural uncertainties and their impact to vibration responses can be used to guide the robust design of structural products, and also be used to develop thresholds for vibration response-based online structural monitoring.  The collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of the research will provide unique learning opportunities for students involved at all levels.  The plan for dissemination will make results widely available, contributing to training analysts and engineers by presenting at professional conferences, publishing in refereed journals, and teaching at university-level courses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Probabilistic analysis of large-scale dynamic systems, even assuming linear responses, is very challenging, because of its high computational demands.  The technical objective of this NSF-funded research is to develop a set of new methods and tools for handling such probabilistic analysis that are useful for a broad array of engineering systems.  This is a multi-university research project, led by Dr. Jiong Tang at the University of Connecticut, collaborating with Drs. Yu Ding and Faming Liang at Texas A&amp;M University.  The research team pursued three major schools of thought to address the aforementioned technical challenge:  (a) A divide-and-conquer strategy that reduces a large system into smaller subsystems of manageable sizes. Understandably, a small subsystem can go through the same probabilistic analysis much faster than the original system.  (b) Make use of the concept of multi-fidelity analysis, and then devise multi-fidelity predictive models for dynamics analysis.  High-fidelity models are accurate but run slowly, while low-fidelity models are biased but can run fast.  An intelligent combination of the multi-fidelity models strikes a sensible balance between model quality and computation complexity, allowing the otherwise computationally expensive probabilistic analysis to be carried out with a realistic timeframe.  (c) Use adaptive methodologies to speed up statistical computations.  One of the reasons slowing down a probabilistic analysis is because such analysis inevitably uses random samples to empirically evaluate probability. Drawing random samples are tedious and time consuming.  Injecting adpativity is to make the random sample drawing process to be aware of its history, and consequently, later sample drawings can done in a smart way because of the knowledge of what has been drawn previously.  Doing so improves the efficiency of statistical computations.  The research team developed specific technical methods to materialize the aforementioned ideas.  The resulting methodologies are in Bayesian frameworks, where uncertainties are naturally characterized through the sampling of its posterior distribution.  All the above-mentioned ideas are proven to make substantial impact on the originally posted problem and advance the knowledge frontier in the area of probabilistic analysis of dynamic systems.  The methodology developments and findings of this project are at different stages of dissemination:  some were published, some accepted for publication but will appear later; and others are in the peer-review process and subject to revisions before publication.  Students who worked on the project received training in the areas of dynamic systems, optimization techniques, statistical modeling and computation.  These areas cover three disciplines:  mechanical engineering, industrial and systems engineering, and statistics.  These areas belong to two different colleges.  Without this project opportunity, students usually do not have much chance to be cross-trained with such inter-disciplinary knowledge and skills.  The technical outcomes are embedded into several graduate course lecturing at the partner universities.  The research team presented their methods and ideas to not only their own professional affiliation but also to groups across disciplinary boundaries and to industrial practitioners.
