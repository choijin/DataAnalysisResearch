<AbstractNarration>The Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences is the home for the long-standing Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton (CCMP). CCMP is the largest US collection of marine phytoplankton. The domestic user base is wide-ranging and includes academe, industry, government labs and education. Because the collection is extensive and well-known, CCMP serves a large international user base as well. Bigelow Laboratory and the (CCMP) have demonstrated that they can operate a large and highly used marine algal culture collection. This laboratory is an excellent site for these collections because of its many scientists who are dedicated to marine research on microscopic organisms. The facility is situated on the Gulf of Maine, and it has many years of experience successfully operating the CCMP. This grant provides five years of maintenance support for CCMP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cultures of marine archaea, bacteria, and viruses are made available to a diversity of researchers saving them time and expense of collecting the organisms from the oceans of the world. The Bigelow Laboratory also offers courses, workshops, and internships for high school and college students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report: NSF grant ref. # 0951733 The Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton (CCMP)     Microbial life in the oceans sustains essential ecological processes and has major influence on energy flows, weather patterns, global climate, and habitability of the planet for human life.  Vast numbers of single-cell plants, called phytoplankton, form the base of the food chain in the oceans, generate half the oxygen we breathe, influence cloud formation and climate and play a crucial role in the oceanÆs ability to remove atmospheric carbon dioxide generate by humans.  These phytoplankton range in size from large enough to see with the unaided eye to less than 1/100th the thickness of the average human hair.  Equally so, these phytoplankton  possess an amazing level of genetic diversity that allows them to live in any ocean environment that has sufficient sunlight to support their growth.     The Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton (now called the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota, NCMA) continues to serve as the central repository to receive, curate, maintain and distribute living cultures of marine phytoplankton.  With nearly 2700 strains it is the worldÆs largest living library of marine phytoplankton.  The core activity of the NCMA is supplying nearly 3000 cultures each year to scientists, educators, biomedical researchers and businesses doing work in the algal sector worldwide.  In addition, to cultures we provide advice to all partners looking to propagate these organisms once they purchase them from the NCMA.  This information is aggregated as the meta-information on our web site (http://ncma.bigelow.org) under FAQÆs, as well as an online query form for additional questions that our curators can answer directly.  In addition to this online forum, we conduct an annual Algal Culture Techniques training course geared to graduate students and other professionals in the algal industry.  We cover all the basics from making media to single cell picking and starting new algal strains to mass culturing for biotechnology applications.  This course is international in scope often with 3-4 students of the 12 we bring in each year coming from countries outside the U.S.     With a focus to becoming more self-sustainable, the NCMAÆs began executing a long term strategy during this grant period that includes expanding our æsupport servicesÆ for algal culturing, and new services such as provision of harvested algal biomass and extracted and purified nucleic acids for subsequent analyses by our partners.  In addition, the NCMA has expanded its capabilities to grow true mass cultures of algae in support of both academic research and algal business sector activity, in particular understanding the environmental controls on production of high value natural products (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids).  Facilitating this expansion in the services we can provide was the move to a new state-of-the-art facility in the Bigelow Center for Blue Biotechnology housed at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences.  In this new facility the NCMA continues to proactively manage our phytoplankton plankton collection such that we can continue to provide the most geographically and taxonomically diverse marine phytoplankton collection in the world.
