<AbstractNarration>Axons are long cellular cables that conduct information through the nervous system. Despite a century of investigation, how axons elongate is poorly understood. This question is important because axonal elongation wires the brain during development and is ultimately responsible for how individuals think and perceive the world. The PI's approach to studying this problem is to monitor the process of axonal elongation in vivo using advanced microscopy in living intact Drosophila (fruitfly) embryos, and in vitro on individual neurons grown on glass coverslips. These classic cell biological approaches will be combined with biophysical analysis and powerful genetic tools developed in Drosophila to answer the following questions: 1) What are the cellular mechanics of elongation in vitro and in vivo? (2) How do forces control axonal assembly? (3) How do guidance cues cause axons to turn? Answering these questions will illuminate the understanding of the genetic and cellular mechanisms of axonal elongation. This project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, and has an outreach component that exposes K-12 students, undergraduates, graduate students, and secondary physical science teachers to cell biology, genetics, microscopy, and contemporary questions in neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two major questions in neurobiology are, "How is the brain wired during development?" and "How can neuronal regeneration be improved following injury or disease?" Answering both requires an understanding of the fundamental process by which axons, the long cables that transmit information in the nervous system, lengthen. The focus of our work in this proposal was determining if axons are ædynamic solidsÆ that lengthen as the result of the addition of new material at the tip or are æactive fluidsÆ that lengthen because forces generated in neurons cause them to stretch like piece of æsilly puttyÆ. At deeper level, our question was whether the development of the brain is primarily explained in terms of polymer chemistry whereby the assembly of proteins into filaments underlies the formation of the axon or in terms of physics whereby forces drive the forward flow of material.     Intellectual merit: To investigate, we developed novel approaches for directly visualizing the transport and addition of material in axons inside of living embryos from the fruit fly (i.e. Drosophila Melanogaster). To illustrate, we included a picture of growing neurons as they are making their way from the central nervous system out to the muscles. We found the axons lengthened through the bulk forward flow of material. To determine the relevance of these results to vertebrates, we then compared the outgrowth of Drosophila neurons, with the neurons of higher vertebrates grown on glass coverslips (i.e. in vitro).
