<AbstractNarration>0933414&lt;br/&gt;Gonzalez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this research is to identify asymmetric warming-cooling trends in coastal areas and the associated impacts on energy demands.  Recent results of observational studies have suggested an asymmetric warming in coastal California not captured by global scale climate models or analyses.  As a consequence, for this research it has been hypothesized that climate change impacts at inland sites in California have increased summer daytime horizontal temperature gradients, which have increased the strength and frequency of cool summer marine sea-breeze flows into heavily populated and highly polluted California coastal plains, which in turn decrease the demand for electrical energy for cooling.  To test this hypothesis, the unique thermal surface gradient will be studied in detail along California coastlines and the specific implications for changes in average and peak electricity demands will be investigated.  The approach will be to investigate the changes in both climatological degree days (for both heating and cooling) and in heat waves (in terms of frequency and severity), and to correlate these changes with topography, sea breeze patterns, urban centers, and distance from the coast.  The climatological analysis will be correlated with existing energy demand information from electric and gas utilities in the state to determine spatial and temporal trends.  The climatological analyses will be projected into the future (50+ years) with a mesoscale atmospheric model, which will be driven by downscaled information from Global Circulation Models based on IPCC scenarios.  The modeling will address the relative effects of global warming (different scenarios) and land use changes, as reflected in changes of energy variables (degree days, peak electricity and gas demands).  The project is a joint collaboration of two minority serving universities (CCNY and San Jose State University) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This NSF project enabled the following significant outcomes;  Scientific Outcomes:  The reverse reaction to global warming hypothesis for coastal regions was tested and validated via climate record observations and use of high resolution regional climate modeling.  This hypothesis states that in sea-breeze dominated climates greenhouse gases (GHG) induced warming may increase inland land surface temperatures at faster rates than sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in coastal regions, inducing increasing sea-breeze flows and subsequent coastal cooling.  The hypothesis was partially validated with long-term observations of maximum temperatures in two coastal air basins in California (Los Angeles and San Francisco, Fig 1), and fully validated with a regional climate modeling using an ensemble of past (1970s)-present (2000Æs) simulations for Los Angeles air basin (Fig. 2).  The results of the simulations clearly demonstrate increased sea-breeze as function of global arming induced large scale atmospheric and ocean changes overshadowing locally induced warming signals (i.e. urbanization).  Coastal cooling reverse reaction has been recently reported in other locations around the world.   It was found that annual-extreme temperature trends, however, generally showed cooling at sites below 600 m and warming at higher elevations.  Spatial distributions of hot-day frequencies showed expected maxima at inland low-elevation sites, but low-elevation areas again showed reverse-reaction decreases (Fig. 3).   The coastal cooling process for all coastal California areas was quantified, and it was determined that coastal cooling is present as far as 60 km from the coast and below 500 m of elevation (Fig. 4).  Two new coastal-cooling air basins were detected:  San Luis Obispo Air Basin and San Diego Air Basin (not shown).   It was found in the all-California analysis that coastal cooling may be modulated by decadal large scale signals, particularly the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (Fig. 5).   Energy demands in California were found to be correlated with the reported summer temperature trends, with coastal biases for mean and summer electricity peak in total and per capita demand, consistent with decreasing extreme heat events.  Winter energy demand for natural gas was found to have a symmetric decreasing trend, consistent with warming minimum temperature patterns (Fig. 6).     Human Resources Outcomes:  The project enabled the training of three Ph.D. students, 1-master student, 1-post-doctoral fellow, and two undergraduate students.  All these students were members of under-represented minorities.  Students received interdisciplinary training in the following areas; atmospheric sciences, climate sciences, energy analysis, GIS, and remote sensing.  All doctoral students and post-doctoral fellow were trained in high resolution atmospheric modeling.  The project contributed to the retention and graduation of these students, all completing their respective degrees, or close to completion.  The demand for the students who completed their degrees demonstrate the need for their skills and knowledge from industry and government agencies.  This direct impact in human resource development is exceptional considering the funding level of the project.        Broader Impacts Outcomes:  The research opened the discussion about the possible coastal cooling effects in other regions of the planet including California coast.  Recent reports in South America pacific coastal areas of Peru and Chile have confirmed the extension of this discussion.  The project also allowed the researchers to present the connection energy-climate from a holistic approach, quantifying the historical past and expected future trends and changes between surface temperatures and energy demands for the case of California.
