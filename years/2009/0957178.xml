<AbstractNarration>Understanding written sentences in a language learned at a later age is different from processing sentences in one's native language. This project aims to clarify what underlies this difference by testing to what extent a language learner's problems with sentence processing are related to 1) the lack of detailed word knowledge and rapid access word-level information, and 2) the reader's ability to suppress irrelevant information in general. Native speakers and second-language learners will be closely compared. The proposed project is a collaboration between the University of Florida (USA), the University of Utrecht (The Netherlands), and the Universidad De La Laguna (Spain), and will test native speakers of English, native speakers of Spanish, Dutch learners of English, and English learners of Spanish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project may lead to a better understanding of how second-language learners comprehend written language and why certain individuals experience more problems than others when learning a second language. Outcomes of this project may inform research on language education and intervention techniques. This will ultimately benefit minority populations learning English as a second language, as well as populations with language impairments. Finally, the project will be integrated into the linguistics curriculum at University of Florida and will create international research opportunities for students to gain hands-on experience with psycholinguistic and electrophysiological research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is co-funded by SBE/BCS and the Office of International Science and Engineering</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merits  One controversy in current research on second-language processing is to what extent late learners of a foreign language can become like native speakers. According to some views, late learners can never attain the detailed grammatical knowledge that native speakers have, and can never use this information as quickly as native speakers do during reading and listening.  The present study contributed to this discussion by showing that late language learners can perform like native speakers, at least, under some circumstances. These findings are supportive of the idea that learners can attain the same level of knowledge as native speakers, but may sometimes experience difficulty processing this information, especially when the task gets harder.     Broader Impacts  The fact that language learners can be indistinguishable from native speakers in many respects supports the view that a high level of attainment is possible, even if one does not learn a second language in early childhood. Results from the present and related research may therefore eventually inform language education policy. In addition, insight in the way advanced non-native speakers process language may help improve language rehabilitation and intervention therapies for patients whose native language is not English. An increasing number of people in the US do not speak English as a native language.  This means that as the population gets older, the number of non-native English speaking patients with language disorders as a result of e.g., a stroke, will increase as well. Knowledge of non-native language processing is crucial to customize language rehabilitation therapies to non-native speakers of English.  Another broader impact of the current project is that it provided ample opportunity to undergraduate and graduate students (most of them women and/or from a minority background) to participate in research and gain hands-on experience in the field of language processing research. Finally, the project involved an international collaboration between the University of Florida and Utrecht University (The Netherlands), which paved the way for more research collaborations, and for student and faculty exchanges between these institutions.
