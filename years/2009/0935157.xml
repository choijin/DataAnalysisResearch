<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research award to Purdue University will study the progression of students through their choice of engineering major.  In particular the study will address why students choose to enroll in one engineering discipline rather that another and what factors influence their decision to stay in that discipline, move to another or to leave engineering. The results will offer constructive information on the complex issue of recruitment to and retention in engineering. The study will take place at Purdue University, Department of Engineering Education using the existing MIDFIELD data base of student records from ten universities.  This will be augmented with in depth surveys of Purdue students. The research team is well positioned to address the multidisciplinary nature of the research, comprised of experts in both engineering education and psychology. The findings of the study will be significant in terms of understanding the decision-making processes of all engineering students and in particular of women and minority students. The goal is to better prepare students for the practice of engineering through more effective development of their careers.  The results will improve efforts to recruit students to engineering, and will enhance the number of students who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
