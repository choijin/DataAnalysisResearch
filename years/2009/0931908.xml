<AbstractNarration>The Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics (ICERM) is a new Institute. Its mission is to support&lt;br/&gt;and encourage research in the mathematical sciences with a&lt;br/&gt;thematic focus on the fruitful interplay between mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;computers, explored and developed through computation and&lt;br/&gt;experimentation.  ICERM will accomplish these goals through a&lt;br/&gt;variety of programs and activities. The Institute will run one&lt;br/&gt;large research program per semester, with each program focusing&lt;br/&gt;on a particular subtopic that aligns with the general&lt;br/&gt;theme. Program participants will range from graduate students to&lt;br/&gt;senior researchers. During the summers, the Institute will host&lt;br/&gt;additional programs for postdoctoral scholars and early career&lt;br/&gt;researchers, as well as for undergraduates selected from a&lt;br/&gt;national pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICERM will be a novel institute in an area of growing&lt;br/&gt;importance. An Institute in computational and experimental&lt;br/&gt;mathematics has the potential to cut across disciplines within&lt;br/&gt;and beyond mathematics and statistics. The Institute programs&lt;br/&gt;will strongly emphasize training and retaining graduate students&lt;br/&gt;and postdoctoral scholars in the mathematical sciences community.&lt;br/&gt;ICERM's leadership has substantial experience in supporting and&lt;br/&gt;working with underrepresented groups in the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;sciences, and Institute programming will provide new&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for underrepresented students and scholars.  ICERM&lt;br/&gt;has already initiated partnerships with leading research intense&lt;br/&gt;companies and national research laboratories, and effective plans&lt;br/&gt;to nurture these partnerships will help to sustain a rich and&lt;br/&gt;deep interaction with the broader research community.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) was founded in 2010 by Brown University faculty Jill Pipher (lead PI and founding director), Jeffrey Brock, Jan Hesthaven, Jeffrey Hoffstein and Bjorn Sandstede. It was supported by this award to Brown University. Its mission is to support and broaden the relationship between mathematics and computation: specifically, to expand the use of computational and experimental methods in mathematics, to support theoretical advances related to computation, and address problems posed by the existence and use of the computer through mathematical tools, research and innovation.&nbsp;</p> <p>ICERM achieves these goals by hosting collaborative research programs, ranging from weeklong workshops through semester programs. These are chosen through a competitive proposal process, overseen by a Scientific Advisory Board of leading mathematical scientists from across the country. Program organizers are specified in the proposal, speakers and lead participants are nominated by these organizers, and all programs accept applications from the community. Graduate students and postdocs are encouraged to participate.</p> <p>Outcomes of successful research programs include the discovery of new mathematics, particularly through computational work; the development of new algorithms or computer experiments that deepen the understanding of the mathematics; the creation of synergies between mathematicians with computational expertise and those without; the enhancement of employment options for early career researchers both in and out of academia; and new collaborations resulting in publications and grant proposals.</p> <p>An important goal of ICERM is promoting the career development of students and postdocs. Each summer, it hosts Summer@ICERM, an eight-week mentored research program for undergraduates. Discussions with postdocs and comments on exit surveys made clear that young researchers need help to make connections with the senior researchers in residence. As a result, ICERM workshops now feature a mid-week poster session, and the semester program opening events involve introductory talks from the students and postdocs. It also hosts round-table professional development seminars; the supporting materials are a national model for research ethics training in the mathematical sciences.&nbsp;</p> <p>ICERM's focus on the interplay of algorithms, computational experiment, and mathematical discovery results in programs covering a broad spectrum of the mathematical sciences. Some are at the heart of pure mathematics, like arithmetic dynamics, Dirichlet series, and the Langlands program. Others emphasize applications of mathematical tools to problems in the sciences, e.g., computational techniques in probability to uncertainty quantification and Monte Carlo methods. ICERM has hosted weeklong workshops in diverse topics ranging from polymer chemistry to cybersecurity, and cardiovascular mathematics to aerospace applications.&nbsp;</p> <p>ICERM&rsquo;s research impact is magnified through its international partnerships, supported through the Virtual Institute of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences (VI-MSS) supplement. This has supported collaborative research with partners in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, and South Africa.&nbsp;</p> <p>ICERM is committed to the inclusion of under-represented groups among its funded participants, organizing committees, and board members. Program and workshop organizers receive a statement about ICERM&rsquo;s diversity commitment and are encouraged to recruit speakers and long-term participants from a wide range of institutions and backgrounds. ICERM is proud to host events like `40 Years and Counting: the Association for Women in Mathematics Celebration of Women in Mathematics' and the 2015 `Conference for African American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences'.</p> <p>To raise awareness of the impact of mathematical discovery on society and culture, ICERM hosts regular public lectures. The Simons Foundation Mathematics of Planet Earth 2013 Public Lecture attracted over 500 people, from high school students to presidents of major mathematical societies and regional universities. Other topics have included animation, bird colors, crime, lotteries, and origami.</p> <p>The impact of ICERM can be understood in numerical terms: It has hosted over 50 workshops during this award. Each year, about 1000 individuals participate in its research programs and many more attend public&nbsp;lectures and events. Participants have come from 32 countries and 46 US states and&nbsp;territories. Surveys of programs through fall 2014 show 466 publications attributable to ICERM semester programs; 122 proposals for funding and 77 awards grew out of these programs. 80% of survey respondents said that they continued the connections made while attending an ICERM semester program.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/27/2017<br>      Modified by: Brendan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Hassett</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0931908/0931908_10019708_1509071313419_pappus.Fall.13.LowDimTop--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0931908/0931908_10019708_1509071313419_pappus.Fall.13.LowDimTop--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pappus's Theorem and Dynamics"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0931908/0931908_10019708_1509071313419_pappus.Fall.13.LowDimTop--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pappus's Theorem and Dynamics"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The signature image of the Fall 2013 program `Low-dimensional topology, geometry, and dynamics'</div> <div class="imageCredit">Richard Schwartz</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brendan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Hassett</div> <div class="imageTitle">Pappus's Theorem and Dynamics</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0931908/0931908_10019708_1509071772110_HotNet_subnetworks.Spring14.NGA--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0931908/0931908_10019708_1509071772110_HotNet_subnetworks.Spring14.NGA--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hotnet subnetworks"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0931908/0931908_10019708_1509071772110_HotNet_subnetworks.Spring14.NGA--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hotnet subnetworks"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Signature image for the spring 2014 program `Network science and graph algorithms'</div> <div class="imageCredit">Eli Upfal</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brendan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Hassett</div> <div class="imageTitle">Hotnet subnetworks</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0931908/0931908_10019708_1509070663291_PAdic.Julia_set.Fall.11.CAD--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0931908/0931908_10019708_1509070663291_PAdic.Julia_set.Fall.11.CAD--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Julia Set"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0931908/0931908_10019708_1509070663291_PAdic.Julia_set.Fall.11.CAD--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Julia Set"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image represents the Julia set for a complex quadratic polynomial.
