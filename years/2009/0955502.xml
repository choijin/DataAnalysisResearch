<AbstractNarration>Baron Peters of the University of California, Santa Barbara is supported by a CAREER award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Chemistry Division to develop molecular simulation strategies for understanding molecular level properties of critical nuclei for nucleation  from solution. Nucleation is the process by which the first microscopic embryo of a new phase is formed to initiate a phase transition. Understanding the factors that influence nucleation rates and the features of a nucleus that determine whether it is stable or unstable is a major challenge for experiments and for simulations. The PI uses path sampling, atomistic simulations, lattice models and coarse grained dynamics to understand various aspects of the critical nucleus structure and interfacial energy contributions at the nanoscale. This work extends simulations of nucleation beyond spherical particles and implicit solvents. These efforts combine state-of-the-art methods for rare events with rigorous methods to control the chemical potential (supersaturation) in the condensed phase.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Familiar examples of nucleation are the formation of carbon dioxide bubbles in an opened soda or ice crystals in a bottle of water placed in the freezer.    Actually these visible droplets, bubbles, or crystals of the new phase are actually later stages in the phase transformation. Microscopic nuclei with just a few molecules may form and re-dissolve many times before finally giving birth to a stable nucleus that can eventually grow to a visible size. In some cases, like the example of bottled water in the freezer, hours or weeks may pass before the first stable nucleus forms.  New simulation methods designed specifically for nucleation from solution provide mechanistic insights to guide the crystallization and synthesis of materials with controlled crystal structures, shapes, and properties. The insights gained from this work facilitate the preparation of pharmaceuticals, the synthesis of electronic and catalytic materials, and purification by crystallization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Nucleation is the process which initiates a phase  transition, e.g. in the freezing of water to make ice, in the formation  of dew from cool moist air, or in the solidification of metals during  casting.  Nucleation is an activated processes with a well-defined rate,  much like a chemical reaction, but the factors that influence  nucleation rates are not as well understood.  In particular, we have  very little understanding of the factors that control solute precipitate  nucleation rates, e.g. in the crystallization of active pharmaceutical  ingredients.   Our NSF CAREER project focused on the relatively  uncharted territory of solute precipitate nucleation.  We developed the  first theories to predict (1) how additives influence solute precipitate  nucleation kinetics, (2) how solute diffusivity influences the  nculeation mechanism, and (3) how boundary layers that form during  solute freeze concentration can lead to a googol-fold acceleration of  nucleation rates. We developed (4) new methods to extract nucleation  from metastable zone width data, (5) results that fundamentally altered  our understanding of laser induced nucleation phenomena.   We also  developed several new simulation techniques, including (1) the seeding  method for computing nucleation rates from atomistic simulations, (2) a  systematic framework for optimizing measures of nucleus size, (3) the  first atomistic simulation method to predict the Tolman length (a  correction for nanoscale curvature in interfacial energies), (4)  numerous simulation methods for efficiently sampling rare barrier  crossing trajectories, and (5) methods for quantitatively testing  mechanistic hypotheses.  These simulation methods are now widely used in  the fields of nucleation, enzyme dynamics, solvated reaction dynamics,  and interfacial phenomena.    The project supported the education  of three PhD students, one post-doctoral fellow, and several  undergraduate research experiences.  With their efforts and the NSF  support, we met and far exceeded the original goals of the solute  precipitate nucleation project.
