<AbstractNarration>In this CAREER award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Boehme of the University of Utah will systematically explore the theoretical and experimental foundations of pulsed electrically detected magnetic resonance (pEDMR) spectroscopy. PEDMR is many orders of magnitude more sensitive than traditional magnetic resonance spectroscopy and is thus well suited for the investigation of the role of spin in microscopic electronic processes in very small and low dimensional semiconductor samples and devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has profoundly impacted physics, chemistry and materials research, as well as medical diagnostics during the past decades. Nevertheless, the traditional detection of magnetic resonance through induction is insensitive when compared to other (e.g. optical) spectroscopies ? a limitation that has impeded applications to electronically improved semiconductor materials. This limitation will be overcome using a direct electrical detection scheme via electric current. The aim of this project is to allow the observation of microscopic processes which are responsible for efficiency limitations in devices like solar cells, light emitting diodes or processes that could be utilized for alternative information processing technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Boehme will integrate the development of student recruitment tools with his research through high school student internships and undergraduate research projects, with the goal of increasing minority participation in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual merit of NSF CAREER Project 0953225  In the course of this project, a variety of new pEDMR related spectroscopic methods, theoretical methods, as well as spectroscopic facilities have been developed and implemented. Most significantly, during the five years of repeated design and redesign of resonators for oscillating magnetic fields, the band width of pEDMR spectroscopy which had been confined to a very limited set of distinct excitation frequencies, has been expanded to more than four orders of magnitude, ranging now from below 10MHz to above 300GHz. This is an unprecedented frequency range not just for pEDMR but for any magnetic resonance spectroscopy technique. An example for a low-frequency pEDMR probehead (&lt;100MHz) is displayed in Fig. 1.  Beyond the development of spectroscopic facilities, this project has also succeeded in the development of new numerical simulation tools which allow for the fast and reliable theoretical prediction of pEDMR spectroscopy data and thus, for efficient ways to comparatively study theoretical predictions and experimental results as well as the demonstration of a variety of new pulse sequences that were developed for the application to pEDMR.  In particular, this project has led to the first successful demonstration of pulsed electrically detected electron nuclear double resonance experiments, the first demonstration of electrically detected nuclear spin echoes, and the first demonstration that electrically detected charge carrier spin-beating can be utilized for the assignment of paramagnetic charge carrier states to specific charge carrier recombination processes in semiconductor materials.  The educational and outreach activities of this project period were focused on the development and implementation of an undergraduate recruitment effort that was specifically targeted to reach high school and middle school students from underrepresented groups. Several activities were pursued in the course of this project, including visits by students of high school and middle school MESA clubs at the University of UtahÆs Department of Physics and Astronomy (see Fig. 2). A significant enhancement of underrepresented groups within the student population of the Department of Physics and Astronomy has been observed during the project duration.  While correlation does not prove causality, this observation nevertheless supports the conclusion that the educational activities of this project have been successful.     Broad impacts of NSF CAREER Project 0953225  Broad impact of this project has been made and will continue to be made in various ways: First, through the successful establishment of a solid scientific foundation for a new spectroscopy method which has led to breakthroughs in materials spin spectroscopy, a prerequisite for the continued development of innovative nanoelectronic, spintronic and quantum devices;  secondly, through the training of highly qualified scientists and engineers who have become scientists at universities, research laboratories, and in industry and who themselves have become driving forces behind innovation and, therefore, economic progress in our society.
