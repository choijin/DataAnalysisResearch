<AbstractNarration>General Relativity has very important long term goals among which&lt;br/&gt;the weak and strong cosmic censorship, final state and stability of Kerr&lt;br/&gt;conjectures are the most outstanding. To complete such goals one&lt;br/&gt;needs to solve many fundamental difficulties among which the PI proposes&lt;br/&gt;to concentrate on the problems of uniqueness and stability of the Kerr&lt;br/&gt;family as well as the bounded curvature conjecture. The PI intends to&lt;br/&gt;continue his work with A. Ionescu, and more recently S. Alexakis, to&lt;br/&gt;remove the restrictive real analyticity assumptions of the well known&lt;br/&gt;results of S. Hawking and Carter-Robinson. The PI also plans to continue&lt;br/&gt;to work with I. Rodnianski and J. Szeftel and settle the important&lt;br/&gt;bounded curvature conjecture. Together with I. Rodnianski they plan&lt;br/&gt;to adapt the recent work of Christodoulou, based on what he calls&lt;br/&gt;the short pulse method, with which he was able to derive the first&lt;br/&gt;result on the formation of trapped surfaces for solutions of the Einstein&lt;br/&gt;vacuum equations. The PI and his collaborator believe that the new method can be signifficantly improved and applied to various situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the proposal will give a better understanding of some&lt;br/&gt;of the main theoretical open problems of General Relativity. The long&lt;br/&gt;term hope is that some of the insight gained in the process will &lt;br/&gt;influence related areas such Theoretical Physics and Numerical Relativity.&lt;br/&gt;Of paramount interest to the gravitational wave experiments is to de-&lt;br/&gt;sign numerical algorithms which can simulate, realistically, black hole&lt;br/&gt;interactions. The PI also hopes that the interplay between geometric and an-&lt;br/&gt;alytic methods, which are being developed, will influence other areas of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear PDE, Differential Geometry and Analysis. The PI plans to attract&lt;br/&gt;and train a larger number of PhD students and postdocs, than he has&lt;br/&gt;done so far, in General Relativity. The PI believes that the subject is going&lt;br/&gt;now through an exciting period when important problems are solved and many new avenues of research are being open.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The    main research theme    pursued by the PI  can be   summarized   as an  attempt   to show using mathematical  tools that   ``black  holes are real''.  Indeed  the  reality of these physical object  which,  by  definition, are  beyond   direct observation can be  naturally tied  to    the following questions:    1.)   Are  black holes     necessarily     Kerr  solutions,   that  is    the special    class of   stationary solutions of the Einstein field  equations  characterized   by mass and angular momentum ?     2.)   Are   these  special solutions stable under small   perturbations ?    A  negative answer to this        fundamental  question will imply     that   the Kerr black holes    have  no    physical  reality, i.e.  they  are simply mathematical   artifacts  3.)   Can these  black     holes form   dynamically through a  collapse mechanism?     Can  collapse   happen    due to pure radiation ?  What is the mechanism of collapse?     The PI has        given preliminary, positive results  (i.e. attesting  to the physical  reality  of black holes) for all these questions.    For example   in collaboration with S. Alexakis and A. Ionescu   the PI has shown that   any stationary black hole  which is sufficiently cloe to  a  Kerr solution must itself be a Kerr solution. This solves  1.)  in   the particular case of interst to the fundamental question of stability  described  in 2.).            A particularly remarkable result  of  the  the PI,  in collaboration  with   J. Luk and I. Rodnianski, is  the discovery        that black holes  can form  through a fully  un-isotropic         mechanism.  More precisely  they have shown   that black           holes can form from strong,  regular, initial conditions  which  are fully concentrated in one direction.    This    fully           non-intuitive  result,  proved by rigorous  mathematical  tools  is  now  subject to  numerical  experiments.
