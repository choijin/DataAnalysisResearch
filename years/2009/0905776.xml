<AbstractNarration>The PI's  research  is in the two closely related areas of  asymptotic geometric analysis and  convex geometry, and their applications.&lt;br/&gt;Classical convexity studies the geometry of convex bodies in Euclidean space of a fixed dimension. Asymptotic geometric analysis deals with geometric properties of finite dimensional convex bodies as the dimension grows to infinity. In her research the PI uses methods from both areas, as well as probabilistic tools and concentration  phenomena, to get a better understanding of the structure of convex sets. The  PI was able to prove a variety of results where such structural aspects of convex sets play a role: in approximation of convex bodies by polytopes; to establish a link between the so called order statistics (which are fundamental objects in statistics)  and Orlicz norms; to determine the ``sizes" of certain (convex) sets that appear naturally in quantum information theory.&lt;br/&gt;A further focus  of the PI's research is the development of affine invariants.  &lt;br/&gt;The PI and her collaborators started the  systematic study of (affine invariant) functionals associated with convex bodies and their corresponding inequalities. Among the most important such functionals are  affine surface area and p-affine surface area . The affine isoperimetric inequalities related to them are more powerful than their Euclidean relatives and related to  other important inequalities, e.g. &lt;br/&gt;the  Santalo- and Inverse Santalo- inequalities. The latter is related to Mahler's conjecture which is still open in dimension 3 and higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mathematical description of a scientific or engineering question often requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a geometric space of high dimension.  For example, if you want to specify the location of one gas molecule in a room then you need to report the front/back, side-to-side, and up/down locations of the molecule, using three numbers. The direction and speed of the molecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe enough of the molecule's current state to allow us to predict its future motion from position and velocity we would need six separate numbers in all.  If you want to track 100 distinct molecules of the air in the room then you will need 600 independent numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant measurements.  As these dimensions increase then the difficulty of sampling and computation go up rapidly, a phenomenon scientists and mathematicians sometimes call "the curse of dimensionality."  However, there are also patterns that emerge as dimension increases which are not visible in low dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;We can  exploit those patters, thus taking advantage of the "curse of dimensionality" to make it the  "blessing of dimensionality". &lt;br/&gt;It is one purpose of this grant to study such high dimensional phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECTS OUTCOME REPORT   Dr. Elisabeth Werner  During  the funding period of this proposal,  Dr. Werner has  worked on  problems raised in the proposal  and has either solved them or, at least, made significant progress in all of them. More than thirteen  papers were published or have been accepted for publication as the outcome of the research undertaken.   Research  Activities: an overview.  The PI's research is in high dimensional convex geometry.  We want to mention just  a few typical issues arising in convex geometry  and point out their relevance for other areas.   A  classical problem in convexity is  to reconstruct a convex shape from its sections. Research carried out there finds applications in medicine and biology where convex shapes occur naturally (e.g., organs). The understanding of surface structure of convex bodies  finds applications in chemistry as this is relevant for arrangements of, e.g.,  molecules and crystals. Methods from convexity theory are essential in some areas of computer science, for instance in the  development of geometric algorithms   and in quantum computing (see more below). The study of convex shapes was one of the  goals of  this grant.  High dimensional  geometry  deals with geometric properties of finite dimensional spaces as the dimension or other relevant free parameters  increase to infinity. This is important as a mathematical description of a scientific or engineering question often requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a geometric space of high dimension.  For example, if you want to specify the location of one gas molecule in a room, then you need to report the front/back, side-to-side, and up/down locations of the molecule, using three numbers. The direction and speed of the molecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe enough of the molecule's current state to allow us to predict its future motion from position and velocity we would need six separate numbers in all.  If you want to track 100 distinct molecules of the air in the room then you will need 600 independent numerical coordinates.  As these dimensions increase, the difficulty  computation go up rapidly, a phenomenon scientists and mathematicians  call "the curse of dimensionality."  However, there are also patterns that emerge as dimension increases, not visible in low dimensions.  We can  exploit those patters, thus taking advantage of  the "curse of dimensionality" to make it the  "blessing of dimensionality". This was another purpose of the grant.  Research  Activities:  details.  During the proposal period, the PI and her collaborators and students carried out a systematic study of some of the most important affine invariant functionals on convex bodies, the ``p-affine surface areas".  Understanding those, helps to get a better understanding of the boundary structure of a convex body which in  turn is relevant for the above mentioned applications. In particular, the PI, together with her PhD students, established  ``affine isoperimetric inequalities"which serve as detectors for extremal situations. Very recent developments open totally new directions. For one, the PI  found new affine invariants and proved that those and the above mentioned p-affine surface areas are certain entropies from information  theory. In a related direction, the PI, Artstein, Klartag and Schuett showed that some of the above affine isoperimetric inequalities establish further  links between information theory and high dimensional convex geometry and  tie in with the PI's research on quantum information theory and convex geometry. To date, the PI's research in that area culminated in Aubrun's, Szarek's  and her analysis of the "Additivity conjecture for quantum channels" via methods from high dimensional  geometric analysis.      Outreach  and Education Activities  Dr. Werner lectured on topics related to the project at conferences, seminars and colloquia, both in the United States and abroad (Canada, China...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
