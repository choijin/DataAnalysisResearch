<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long term goal of this project is to gain new understanding into mechanisms of transcriptional control in eukaryotes.  Regulation of gene transcription is central to growth, development, and response to environment in all cells; thus, understanding transcriptional control is a central goal in genetics. The specific goals of this project are to gain new insight into chromatin remodeling during gene activation, and into the role of the Mediator complex in gene regulation. DNA in higher organisms, including humans, is packaged into nucleosomes by wrapping around an octamer of histone proteins.  This creates a potential impediment to protein-DNA interactions needed for transcription of DNA into RNA, and so at many genes these nucleosomes must be remodeled to allow transcription to occur.  This project will focus on chromatin remodeling at the CHA1 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Genetic and biochemical approaches will be used to examine the mechanism by which remodeling leads to histone eviction at CHA1 and at additional inducible promoters. Studies will also be conducted to investigate the role of the Mediator complex in transcriptional regulation in yeast.  Mediator is a large, multi-subunit complex, comprising tail, middle, and head modules that bridges activators, whose binding is the initial step in gene activation, and the general transcription machinery.  Mediator is highly conserved across the eukaryotic kingdom, and serves as a conduit for many regulatory signals, but the mechanism by which it controls gene expression is not well understood.  Research will be carried out to determine whether one specific part of the Mediator complex, called the tail module, has specific functions aside from its requirement for recruitment of the middle and head modules, and to determine the role of the tail module of Mediator in CHA1 activation, in genome-wide recruitment of Mediator, and in transcriptional repression.  Overall, this project will provide new information on fundamental aspects of transcriptional activation which at present is poorly understood.  Transcriptional mechanisms are well conserved across eukaryotes. Hence, the information gained from this work will be broadly applicable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will include training of a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow.  In addition, undergraduates will be recruited to participate in this project as summer interns, to be funded by REU supplements. The project will also result in generation of large data sets from microarray studies, and these will be made publicly available, both by providing raw data files to a public repository (GEO), and by making more user-friendly, processed data files available for download from the principal investigator's web site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit              The focus of this project was a large assembly of proteins called the Mediator complex.  Mediator consists of over twenty proteins in a single complex, and is found in all eukaryotic cells (cells having nuclei, as opposed to bacteria, which lack nuclei).  Mediator is critical to gene transcription, in which RNA Polymerase II copies DNA into messenger RNA, which codes for the proteins that perform most of the structural and functional tasks needed for cellular life.    The project had two main objectives.  The first was to determine the role of one part of the Mediator complex, called the tail module, in turning genes on, in directing Mediator to the genes at which it functions, and in turning genes off.  Using the model organism bakerÆs yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which greatly resembles higher organisms including ourselves at the molecular level but is experimentally much simpler to work with, we discovered that individual proteins in the tail module of Mediator sometimes function redundantly&mdash;meaning that either one of two individual subunits is dispensable for specific functions, but if both are impaired, function is lost.  We determined the effect of loss of tail module function on genome-wide transcription, and found that certain classes of genes are more reliant on the tail module for transcription than others.  Whether this is true for mammalian cells is not yet known.  The same genes that showed loss of transcription upon loss of tail module subunits also no longer were associated with Mediator or RNA Polymerase II, showing that the tail module was critical for Mediator association with such genes; other genes that were not affected must therefore associate with Mediator by other means.  We showed that in some cases this association depended in part on interactions with others proteins involved in gene transcription, such as RNA Polymerase II and TATA-binding protein.  We also found that Mediator was associated with certain categories of repressed genes; how much it contributes to gene repression at these targets, and the mechanism by which it does so, remain unknown.  Our second major objective was to determine the mechanism by which histone eviction occurs at active gene promoters.  Histones are proteins that associate with eukaryotic DNA in structures called nucleosomes; the association can block access to DNA by other proteins that is required for transcription to occur, hence must be overcome during transcriptional activation.  Thus, activation of gene promoters is often accompanied by eviction of the associated histones, and active promoters tended to be depleted of nucleosomes.  We found evidence that histone eviction from promoters occurs by a two step mechanism, with the second step requiring assistance from the binding of transcription-associated proteins to stably remove the histones.  Because histone loss is also seen at active promoters in mammalian cells, these findings provide new insight into how genes are turned on in these cells as well.     Broader impact              The results from this work were disseminated via four research papers and two review articles that were published in refereed scientific journals, and presentations at several scientific conferences.  Some of the experiments provided large data sets that were deposited in public archives where they are freely accessible by scientists and the public.  The project also contributed to the training of three graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow, all female; and also eight undergraduate students including five female students and one minority student, and one female high school student.
