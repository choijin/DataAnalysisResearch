<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to improve our understanding of the processes that modulate precipitation intensity, distribution, and type in mountainous regions in order to better distinguish between natural and climate change related variations. The research focuses on developing a 10-year climatology of moderate and heavy precipitation based on high-quality radar measurements within the European Alps. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the use of four-dimensional radar observations in conjunction with operational sounding analysis, Global Positioning System (GPS) derived water vapor fields, water vapor satellite images, and European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) reanalysis maps, the project will i) analyze the characteristics and four-dimensional structure of precipitation as well as determine time-space variations of precipitation within five regions with highly differentiated climate conditions, ii) determine the role of synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation and upstream conditions on the precipitation characteristics, and iii) determine seasonal and annual variability of precipitation characteristics, atmospheric circulation, and upstream conditions. Furthermore, the 10-yr precipitation climatology will be compared to rain-gauge and satellite observations, and regional climate model results for the Swiss Alps and other mountain areas around the World. The research will advance the knowledge about precipitation variations related to weather and climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project includes (i) the understanding of potential changes in precipitation intensity, frequency, and snow-rain distribution by monitoring precipitation and estimating changes in precipitation characteristics as being an important tool for policy makers and climate researchers to assess various future climate scenarios, (ii) the training of a graduate student, and (iii) wide dissemination of results and findings in conferences and refereed literature. The principal investigator will include the results into the university teaching curriculum and will give talks to non-research community as part of outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>
