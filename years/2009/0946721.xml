<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Timothy M. Swager and Dr. Peter M. Mueller from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) redox transformations in a number of metal-containing systems (Jonas Peters); 2) study of molecular photocatalysis sytems (Daniel Nocera); 3) characterization of metal-containing systems with multiply-bonded ligands (Christopher Cummins); 4) the development of new catalysis systems for olefin metathesis and dinitrogen reduction (Richard Schrock).  The instrument will also feature in the educational outreach activities of Dr. Mueller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry, catalysis and solar energy research.  Students using the apparatus will receive valuable training with cutting-edge instrumentation. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposal for funding to purchase a new single-crystal x-ray diffractometer had the following three goals: (1) Increasing the capacity of the X-Ray Diffraction Facility (XRDF) of MIT's Chemistry Department to keep up with growing demand, (2) modernizing the instrumentation and enhancing the capabilities of the XRDF to allow for new research and (3) improving teaching and outreach to the greater community.  All three goals of the original proposal are met.  The capacity of our Diffraction Facility has approximately doubled, the newly gained capabilities allow determination of previously unobtainable crystal structures and the amount of teaching and outreach related to the funded instrument has increased significantly.  Thanks to the funded instrument, the capacity of the XRDF is currently at ca. 800 datasets per year which will satisfy the needs of MIT's Department of Chemistry for the years ahead.   The funded instrument is a dual-wavelength diffractometer, which allows deciding on the optimal wavelength after a crystal has been mounted.  Many samples submitted to the XRDF require the one or the other wavelength, but it is not always clear beforehand, which.  Therefore, a dual-wavelength setup maximizes the new instrument?s flexibility and consequently enhances the XRDF?s capabilities.   The funded instrument is equipped with the new I&mu;S micro-source technology in order to analyze much smaller and more weakly diffracting crystals than accessible with our old equipment  Approximately one third of the data sets obtained thus far on the funded instrument could not have been obtained with our old equipment, because the crystals were either too small for conventional X-ray sources or diffracted too weakly.  In addition, we were able to collect several protein data sets, which would have been impossible with standard sealed-tube technology  Since routine operation of the funded instrument begun in mid-August of 2010, the funded diffractometer collected a total of 435 (counted to the End of 2012) data sets for nearly 40 research groups and was used for teaching and outreach on numerous occasions.  Almost all datasets gave rise to publishable crystal structures that directly further the research of the researchers who submitted the crystals.  This high level of use and the large number of structures determined, as well as the large number of papers demonstrate the very high impact of the funded instrument for research but also for teaching and outreach.  Contributions to various disciplines are made through those crystal structures as well as the mentioned teaching and outreach.  Research involving this instrument belongs to the disciplines of chemistry, crystallography, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, material sciences, computer sciences, biology, pharmacology and education.    The funded diffractometer is part of MIT's Department of Chemistry X-Ray Diffraction Facility (XRDF) and its main use is the determination of crystal structures as part of scientific research.  On the other hand, the XRDF is also a teaching facility and a second important aspect of the funded instrument is in education and outreach and the funded instrument is fully integrated into all teaching activity as well as the local outreach.  Every year approximately one dozen Ph.D. students are trained through both coursework and hands-on access, enabling them to use the facility to advance their thesis work.  Because so many of the Ph.D. students at MIT choose academic career paths, MIT continues to help nucleate the use of crystallographic methods in many research departments around the world.  This further demonstrates the importance of the funded instrument for science education and outreach.    The educational efforts of MIT?s XRDF also reach underprivileged demographic groups and the funded instrument is an important tool in early science education.  As mentioned above, the XRDF?s outreach initiatives involve numerous students from Bunker Hill Community College (BHCC) and Phillips Academy (PA) in Andover.   BHCC is a highly diverse and cosmopolitan college (40% Caucasian, 26% African American, 16% Hispanic, 14% Asian/Pacific Islander) with ca. 60% female enrollment.  Through BHCC we can reach a section of the population that would not typically come to MIT campus, and access to the funded instrument affords the BHCC students the opportunity to do research on a much higher level than they otherwise could.     As one of the country's foremost boarding schools, PA in Andover is not usually considered a gathering place of underprivileged students, but a closer look at PA's demographics can convince otherwise.  Focusing exclusively on excellence, the admissions process of PA is completely needs blind.  Diversity is a time honored tradition in Andover and PA students come from 34 countries, 37% of the students are of color, and 42% receive financial aid.  Therefore, through Phillips Academy we can reach gifted high school students from all social and ethnic backgrounds, who, by means of the admissions process, have been pre-identified as highly intelligent and deserving, which makes this contact a particularly effective way of broadening access to a diverse group of students.
