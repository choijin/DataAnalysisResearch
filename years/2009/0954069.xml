<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the sustainability and resiliency of interconnected networks of distributed resources.  The particular focus is on electric power networks and communication networks and their interdependencies.  The project seeks to develop a scheme for the deployment of distributed resources on a first-come, first-served basis.  Such a scheme requires efficient optimization algorithms that select which distributed resource is feasible given economic, technological, and interoperability constraints.  The scheme considers resource conflicts and congestion on the interconnection network.  Efforts include developing models and metrics for networks of distributed resources, developing a computational platform for evaluation, and visualizing performance and interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, the project develops a synergy between research on electric power networks and the resiliency of communication networks.  The project examines optimization methods and connection schemes for interconnected distributed networks and their associated resiliency and sustainability.  The research approach relies on finding general principles and methods for interconnected networks of distributed resources.  Data from prior disaster situations is used to evaluate the proposed approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impacts, the project has the potential to improve the sustainability and resiliency of two important types of critical infrastructures, electric power networks and communication networks.  Graduate students involved in the project receive the cross-disciplinary education necessary for this research.  The project facilitates cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional research collaboration between two faculty members.</AbstractNarration>
