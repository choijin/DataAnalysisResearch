<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the development of an interdisciplinary graduate training program centered on the design and study of novel materials with structure-derived functionalities. The program is a collaborative effort between Purdue University, Cornell University and Norfolk State University (NSU). Its goal is to train students to conduct research that will lead to faster, smaller and more efficient devices and technologies with numerous applications, including information storage, signal detection, and biomedical possibilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical and professional training opportunities include annual laboratory training at Cornell and NSU, ongoing video-conferencing of modular courses, regular consideration of the ethical and social aspects of magnetic and nanostructured materials, and student-driven research initiatives. Trainees will also explore engineering education research in order to learn about the challenges of translating new knowledge into educational resources for schools and the general public. Students will benefit from structured mentoring and training for individual career development--education elements that have been identified as essential for the retention and success of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. This partnership, of two research universities and a Historically Black University, will bring greater understanding of how the integration of complementary capabilities and opportunities can better prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

The collaboration between Norfolk State University (NSU) as a Masters&rsquo;-L University (as defined by the Carnegie classification system) and Purdue University and Cornell University as RU-VH (Research Universities, Very High research activity) combined the various research capabilities at the different types of universities. In addition to learning and working with the differences in institutional capabilities, the diversity of universities exposed students and faculty alike to the variety of institutional cultures. By integrating the project researchers&rsquo; expertise and interests, IGERT-MNM faculty and students have made broad scientific contributions in the area of magnetic and nanostructured materials, publishing 73 peer-reviewed articles and making 58&nbsp;technical presentations.</p> <p>The goals of the IGERT-MNM collaboration were successfully achieved through the following:</p> <p>1. Students were trained to conduct interdisciplinary research, preparing them to be independent researchers that harness the technical capabilities of the three affiliated universities. They were trained in interdisciplinary research related to novel materials, integrating chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering.</p> <p>2. IGERT Trainees were introduced to pedagogical principles through Purdue&rsquo;s engineering education research emphasis, which guided the program annual evaluation and redesign. All Trainees prepared educational products in their areas of research, and several participated in engineering education research and publication.</p> <p>3. IGERT Trainees developed the ability to communicate their science effectively through proposals and other forms of technical writing, and</p> <p>4. Students were trained in issues related to ethics, responsible conduct of research, and intellectual property in order to handle professional ethical situations related to research of novel technologies.</p> <p>IGERT-MNM succeeded in creating and sustaining a highly diverse Trainee cohort: 27 Ph.D. and M.S. students at Norfolk State University, eight Ph.D. students at Cornell and three M.S. and Ph.D. students at Purdue. The students&rsquo; backgrounds and research areas include chemistry, engineering (optical, mechanical, electronic, education), materials science, and physics. The IGERT-MNM Trainees/Associates profile includes 45% female and 41% ethnic/racial STEM under-represented minorities, with 25% of international participants as Associate Trainees. Trainees regularly worked in multi-campus teams to support and develop the IGERT-MNM project, learning about different cultures in an interdisciplinary, inter-gender, inter-racial, multiethnic and international environment.</p> <p>The project goals were achieved by the implementation of the <strong>IGERT-MNM Model</strong> as envisioned in the proposal, through the <strong>intimate integration of multi-dimensional assessment, constant redesign, student leadership and effective communication/collaboration. </strong>As an expression of the project&rsquo;s intentional and ongoing self-evaluation, Trainees applied a longitudinal mixed methods approach to follow three IGERT-MNM student teams as they proposed and conducted interdisciplinary materials science research.&nbsp; Results indicate that high-performing teams have shared perceptions of the importance of components involved with collaborative research, and have strong agreement between personal and group competencies.
