<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract:  The Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of Professor Li Jia of the University of Akron for the investigation of the cobalt-catalyzed, carbonylative polymerization of heterocycles (e.g., aziridines) and heteroalkenes (C=O and C=N bonds).  The research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of these processes and developing efficient synthetic methods for preparing both commodity and functional polymers.  The process, which could lead to new classes of aliphatic polyesters, remains unexplored.  The key to realizing the polymerization appears to be the activation of the acyl-cobalt bond.  Nucleophilic and bifunctional organic co-catalysts with nucleophilicity and latent Lewis acidity will be used to accomplish the metal-carbon bond activation.  The polymerization reactions developed in this project are powerful tools for the synthesis of tailor-made polymers for biomedical materials and environmentally friendly plastics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract:  The Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of Professor Li Jia of the University of Akron for the investigation of novel, catalytic copolymerizations of aldehydes and carbon monoxide (i.e, the carbonylative polymerization of aldehydes).  The research focuses on the rational design of catalytic cycles that utilize inexpensive starting materials derived from non-petroleum sources.  This high risk research effort may result in the high reward, commercial development of degradable polymers.  The products of the reaction, aliphatic polyesters, have a wide range of applications as specialty and commodity plastics.  The research activity trains students and postdoctoral associates at the interface of organic, inorganic and polymer chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
