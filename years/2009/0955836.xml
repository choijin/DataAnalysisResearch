<AbstractNarration>The funding of this proposal, titled "CAREER: Steps Toward a Physical Understanding of the Star Formation Law", will allow Dr. Bolato to study the relation between star formation and gas over a range of galactic environments with the ultimate goal of determining the physical mechanisms that drive star formation. The combination of new facilities like Spitzer, EVLA, ALMA, and JWST and the recent advances in modeling techniques make it possible for the first time to make detailed comparisons between observations and model predictions. From low-mass galaxies and the outer disks of spirals to the environs of starburst galaxies, this proposal will study the atomic and molecular gas involved with the process of star formation in a wide range of environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposal range from the mentoring of undergrad students to the creation of a public lecture series in Spanish for the U. Maryland observatory program. One graduate will be supported for the duration of the grant. Dr. Bolato will give a series of public lectures in both English and Spanish as part of the University of Maryland observatory program. In addition to the education related broader impacts the PI will also develop an "Astronomy Workshop Toolbox" in English and Spanish for use in high-school astronomy classes.</AbstractNarration>
