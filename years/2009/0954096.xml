<AbstractNarration>This project aims to create a systematic framework with novel approaches and techniques to defend against current and next generation botnets. A botnet is a network of compromised computers (bots) that are under the control of an attacker (botmaster) through some command &amp; control (C&amp;C) channel. In recent years, botnets have distinguished themselves from previous generation malware as the primary platform and root-cause for most Internet attacks and illegal activities. With the magnitude and the potency of attacks afforded by their combined bandwidth and processing power, botnets are now considered as the greatest single threat to Internet security. As botnets involve both host-level and network-level activities, a systematic defensive framework should consider both host- and network-level information. We can achieve better defense by utilizing host-network coordination, community-based intelligence, and a cross-layer view, instead of relying on a single (or a set of separate) host- or network-level information source(s). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes a host-network coordination- and correlation-based framework for systematic botnet defense in depth. It addresses three major questions covering detection, prevention, and attribution of botnets: How to detect the existence of botnets in an efficient, accurate, robust, fast, and automatic way? How to prevent botnets from penetrating into a protected network? Where does the command and control (C&amp;C) actually originate from? The methodology and techniques proposed in the project can have a profound impact on future malware defense in terms of improving its effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the project period, we have the following outcomes:     1. A set of new botnet/malware prevention, detection and defense systems:  We design a new solution to boost the scalability of existing botnet detection systems for high-speed networks.  We design a new semantic-relationship-correlation-based two-factor CAPTCHA system for web bot prevention.   We develop EFFORT, a new host-network cooperated bot malware detection system.   We design PeerPress, a new active scheme for fast and reliable P2P malware detection.  We design AutoVac, a new system to automatically extract system resource constraints from malware code and generate vaccines based on the system resource conditions.   We develop a new system, GoldenEye, for automated targeted malware analysis, more specifically, to efficiently and effectively identify the targeted victim?s environment given an unknown malware sample.      2. New botnet/malware infrastructure detection systems:   Malware server infrastructure is of extreme importance for modern malware operation, thus it is more fundamental and meaningful for defenders to detect these infrastructure than infected hosts.  We design PoisonAmplifier to identify compromised websites (which can be used as malware servers) through tracking down search poisoning attacks. We design two novel proactive techniques/systems, CyberProbe and AutoProbe, for active, robust, fast and scalable malware server infrastructure detection at the Internet scale.   We design SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), a new system to utilize an unsupervised framework to infer malware campaigns by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions. We design VisHunter, a new system to identify malicious redirections from visible servers to invisible servers at the entryway of malicious web infrastructures.      3. New malware analysis and defense systems for the emerging smartphone platform:  We design a new Android malware detection system called DroidMiner, which can automatically learn/mine malicious patterns in terms of their malicious program logic and abstract them into threat modalities. We design VetDroid,  a dynamic analysis platform for reconstructing sensitive behaviors in Android apps from a novel permission use perspective.  We design a new analysis framework called AppIntent  to analyze sensitive data transmission in Android for privacy leakage detection. We design UIPicker, an adaptable framework for automatic identification of sensitive user inputs in Android systems. We study the market-level and network-level behaviors of the Android malware ecosystem to identify patterns/characters that can be used to detect malware authors in the market.      4. New security solutions for next generation networks:   For proactive defense, it is very important to look forward to the security issues in the next generation networking technology, which is widely believed to be Software-De?ned Networking (SDN).  We design FortNox, the first security-enhanced kernel for SDN controllers. We develop FRESCO, the first SDN security application development framework designed to facilitate the rapid design, and modular composition of SDN-enabled detection and mitigation modules. We design AvantGuard, the first SDN data-plane extension to defeat data-to-control-plane saturation attacks. We design FloodGuard, a new lightweight and protocol-independent DoS defense framework for SDN networks.         Last Modified: 03/28/2017       Submitted by: Guofei Gu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
