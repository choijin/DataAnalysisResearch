<AbstractNarration>Discovery and inventory of Papua New Guinea?s megadiverse flora&lt;br/&gt;Papua New Guinea (PNG), while considered botanically one of the world?s most species-rich areas, remains poorly-collected. The size of the vascular flora is largely unknown, with estimates ranging from 11,000 to 25,000 species. Bishop Museum, with collaborators from more than 20 PNG, U.S., and international institutions, will undertake botanical surveys in nine under-collected regions of PNG over three years. The project will lead to the discovery of at least 100 new vascular plant taxa, the documentation of species range extensions, and a significant improvement in the understanding of PNG?s floral species richness and endemism as it relates to faunal diversity and geology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in the curation and digitization of botanical collections from PNG, the development of a comprehensive checklist of the vascular flora, the collection of material for future molecular studies, and support the training of two graduate and three undergraduate students and in-country personnel in systematic botany, GIS, and herbarium curation. Results will be used to assess the impacts of human activities, such as forestry and climate change, on the botanical diversity of PNG for conservation priority setting. Information will be made available to scientists and the public through electronic media, scholarly publications, and museum displays.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
