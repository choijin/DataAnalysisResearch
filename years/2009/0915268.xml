<AbstractNarration>Succeeding in mainstream universities (at all levels) involves extra challenges for deaf and hard of hearing students.  Skilled sign language interpreters and captioners with advanced domain knowledge are often difficult to find, multiple visual channels of information in the classroom can be hard to juggle, and collaboration both inside and outside the classroom is often strained due to language barriers.  Furthermore, translation of advanced STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) topics into American Sign Language (ASL) is far from standardized, and often requires discussion between students and interpreters to devise consistent signs.  Better access to classroom activities and a consistent, conceptually clear signing system for STEM topics are both vitally needed in order for deaf and hard of hearing students to advance in the sciences.  Thus, in this project the PI will design, implement, and evaluate two distinct yet interconnected technologies.  The first of these is ClassInFocus, a classroom platform to help students access remote interpreters and captioners, avoid visual dispersion, and facilitate interaction in the classroom.  ClassInFocus will utilize the existing high bandwidth internet connections at multiple universities to create more opportunity for finding the best qualified interpreter or captioner for specific STEM topics.  Designing, implementing, and evaluating technological solutions that best meet the educational needs of deaf and hard of hearing students is a challenging research problem; this immersive technology that brings many different technical and human resources into the classroom in an accessible and unobtrusive way is new to the field.  ASL-STEM Forum, the second thrust of this work, will be an on-line video forum to facilitate discussion about signing for STEM topics.   Visual collaboration between members of the community, in this case the Deaf Community, is important to ensure natural, conceptually correct, and community approved language progression.  Designing, implementing, and evaluating a cyberinfrastructure solution to facilitate discussion about ASL vocabulary and grammar for STEM content, that will eventually serve as a resource for students, teachers, and interpreters involved in ASL for STEM fields, is another challenging research problem.  Using social networking techniques to engage the deaf and hard of hearing community in discussions about ASL topics and vocabulary in STEM fields is entirely new to the field.  This research will involve collaboration with the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at Rochester Institute of Technology, Gallaudet University, and the Shodor Education Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The new technologies to be developed as outcomes of this research will enable deaf and hard of hearing students to better access the STEM fields by improving the learning environment and the linguistic access to STEM content.  Not only does this increase the likelihood that deaf people will attain college and graduate degrees, it will increase the participation of deaf and hard of hearing people in the development and research of new technology.  Other students may also benefit from this technology, as digital notes and captions provide alternative access for students with learning disabilities and create opportunities for searchable archives of class content.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the project are to design, implement, and evaluate computer based tools and systems to help deaf and hard of hearing students achieve their educational goals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.  Three specific projects contributed to these goals.  1. ASL-STEM Forum, a web-based resource where people can upload definitions for scientific terms and signs for them. The purpose is the help American Sign Language (ASL) to grow in scientific fields. The Forum has been up and running since 2009 with several studies concerning its efficacy. To date the ASL-STEM Forum has about 1537 users, 8,600 terms, 3,250 signs, and more than 410,000 views of signs.   2. ClassInFocus, a multimedia conferencing system that allows for the inclusion remote sign language interpreters and captionists. Each participant can have his or her own view of the conference (teacher, presentation, chat, interpreter, captionist). Several studies have been done both in the lab and in actual classrooms to evaluate the efficacy of the system.     3. ASL2English, a web-based dictionary for novice ASL students to help them find the meaning of signs that they see.  The dictionary uses the classic attributes of signs including hand shape, location, orientation, movement, and relative position of the hand for search.   The search is robust with respect to variations in signs and observation errors using latent semantic analysis techniques.  A study was done using data from ASL-Flash, a sign language flash card study aid that asks users to enter attributes of signs they observe in sign language videos in exchange for the English meaning of what they observed.    The study indicated that attribute-based search can be effective in finding observed signs.    The development and studies were done in conjunction with researchers at Gallaudet University, the world leader in liberal education and career development for deaf and hard of hearing students, and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID), a college of Rochester Institute of Technology.  NTID provides deaf and hard-of-hearing students with outstanding state-of-the-art technical and professional education programs, complemented by a strong arts and sciences curriculum.   A complementary goal of the project was to involve faculty and students with disabilities in the research in order to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in scientific research.   Of the four faculty members on the project, two are deaf.  Two of the five graduate students on the project have a disability.  Fifteen of the seventeen undergraduates on the project are deaf or hard of hearing.  These projects will benefit society by improving access to scientific education for students who are deaf or hard of hearing.  In addition, they support the acquisition of American Sign Language for all students regardless of hearing status.
