<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports a research project that aims to deepen our understanding of carbon networks, a class of emerging materials with potential to create revolutionary multifunctional electronics.  Carbon networks, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, are predicted to have fascinating electronic, optical and magnetic properties, where small changes in atomic arrangements can dramatically alter their behavior. As progress in this field moves forward, researchers need increasingly creative tools to study the electronic properties of carbon nanomaterials.  This work leverages methods pioneered by the PI to use magnetism as a non-invasive probe of electronic properties.  As an example, disorder in planar networks of carbon is currently of great interest because such regions appear to couple to light and may also be useful in 'steering' electrons around in carbon devices.  Dramatic changes in magnetic properties induced by disorder (caused by oxygen bonding to the network) have already been observed and provide an incisive tool for relating disorder to changes in the electronic landscape of these materials. This research will involve graduate students in collaborative work that will help them chart successful interdisciplinary careers.  Support for this project will enable an expansion of outreach activities at an NSF funded Shared Equipment Facility (SEF), providing additional remote experiments and recruitment of new users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator project will study fundamental optical and magnetic properties of materials derived from hexagonal networks of carbon, including graphene, graphene oxide, and carbon nanotubes.  Much of this research exploits important connections between orbital diamagnetism and local optical and transport properties.  Specifically, the former provides a complementary probe of single-particle electronics that can often clarify the latter.  In graphene oxide, changes in orbital diamagnetism will quantify aromatic network disruption that may hold a key to bandgap engineering and optical emission in that material. In the case of carbon nanotubes, a battery of highly purified samples will be used to understand how diamagnetism in carbon nanotubes depends on symmetry and atomic structure.  For graphene, the possibility of magnetic anomalies that arise from quantum criticality at the Dirac point will be investigated.  In addition, a unique collection of purified carbon nanotube samples will be used to provide a definitive map of carbon nanotube dark exciton energies as a function of atomic structure. This research will involve graduate students in collaborative work that will help them chart successful careers.  Support for this project will enable an expansion of outreach activities at an NSF funded Shared Equipment Facility (SEF), providing additional remote experiments and recruitment of new users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied optical properties of an emerging class of materials based on networks of carbon atoms.  Specifically, much of our work studied large tubular molecules known as carbon nanotubes, as well as flat sheets known as chemically modified graphene (graphene oxide).   Carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide both offer promising opportunities for creating the next generation of nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.  In our work, we explored the fundamental nature of these materials, with a goal toward understanding the manner in which the atomic orbits of carbon atoms are re-organized into a new electronic landscape within the materials.   Optical transitions such as the emission of light help to probe and interpret this landscape.  We developed methods to use optical transitions to identify nominally hidden electronic complexes in carbon nanotubes.   This work identified the energetic location of  "dark excitons" within this family of macromolecules, which give a key measurement of multi-particle interactions in these materials.   Those interactions ultimately affect the manner in which nanotubes harvest and emit light.  We also worked with another group to identify molecules that would assemble cages around carbon nanotubes, breaking the nanotubes apart from each other and suspending them in water.   This work provided a new algorithm to design such molecules as well as a first demonstration of its success.  We also performed experiments to help identify the origin of light emission from graphene oxide, a phenomenon our group helped to discover.  By studying the emission of light on time scales less than 1 trillionth of a second, we were able to offer an explanation for why some samples emit blue light and others emit red light based on differences in the flow of energy throughout this material.  Ultimately, the scientific community must understand if the light emission involves electrons confined to a plane or additional electronic orbitals associated with chemical modification.   Our work advances this debate by showing the emission involves a wide range of energetic states characteristic of strong disorder.   We have also studied how electronic delocalization affects a wide range of properties in a highly correlated manner in disordered carbon networks, bringing together a range of properties that had been studied separately for decades.  Finally, as a stepping stone to our current award, we reported calculations of ring-like electrical currents in carbon nanotubes that appear in response to a magnetic field.   Such currents are the type that can cause magnetic levitation, however in this case our interest is more fundamental, using these currents to probe the landscape of electronic states in these materials.     The broader impacts of our work include the training of graduate students in a wide range of experimental methods, as well as training and outreach activities associated with running a property measurement shared equipment facility.
