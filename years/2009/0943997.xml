    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this EAGER award is to develop a synthetic DNA based, cellular and self-organizing framework for conceptualizing and designing adaptive systems. This represents a new design methodology for adaptive systems development. Such systems are needed in space exploration, performing tasks in hazardous situations, and for extending utility and lifetime of engineered systems. Following nature's biological synthesis approach to the formation of biological systems, this research will develop a DNA based product representation that maps biological concepts and processes into mechanical products and processes. It will also investigate DNA based cellular system configuration design and self-organizing based construction mechanisms. Computer simulation based case studies will be carried out to verify and demonstrate the effectiveness of the new methodology. The research will result in insights and a research program for a transformative approach to designing complex and adaptive engineered systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide insights and initial design methods for applying a biology inspired system design and construction process to adaptive systems development. The research has the potential of opening a new field of design research that takes advantage of the knowledge of biology, complexity and complex systems. The adaptive systems developed using the resulting methodology of this research will significantly enhance human being's exploration capability to reach deeper spaces and oceans by eliminating the needs for having human beings involved in unreachable and dangerous situations. The knowledge gained from this research will be incorporated in workshops and design curricula. Graduate students from underrepresented groups will be involved. A research open house will be held for K-12 students to participate. The results, methods, and tools developed through this research will be available to the research community for future explorations.</AbstractNarration>
