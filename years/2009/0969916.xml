<AbstractNarration>A set of experiments will be performed that use atomic interference for precision measurements.  In atom interferometry, the quantum mechanical wave that describes an atom is split into two components that are separated in space.  When the two components are later recombined, the result encodes information about the atom's environment.  The project will investigate using interference to improve measurements of acceleration, rotation, and gravity, with the goal of improving sensor technology for inertial navigation and underground detection.   The project will also explore the use of interferometry to detect and count single photons, which could be useful for implementing or attacking various types of quantum communication schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will have broad impact in a variety of areas.  Two graduate students will be supported and the experiments performed will likely form the basis of their PhD dissertations.  These students will receive training in advanced scientific techniques and will be well-prepared for a productive career in research.  The project could also have significant technological and social relevance due to the  growing importance of inertial sensing and quantum communication in commercial and national security applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The goal of this project was to develop and implement applications for condensate interferometry. A condensate is a collection of atoms at nearly absolute zero temperature, with the special property that most of the atoms share an identical quantum state. This property causes the atoms to behave less like individual particles and more like a collective æatom wave.Æ An interferometer is any device that splits a wave into two parts and later recombines them to exhibit interference. This allows a measurement of any relative shift between the crest and trough of the two waves.     An interferometer based on atoms can be a very sensitive measurement tool for a wide variety of phenomena, because atom waves are very sensitive to their surrounding environment. Using atoms in a condensate offers potential further advantages, because all the atoms interfere in the same way. We are working to develop the advantages and apply them.     One major outcome of the work was an improved understanding of the details of how a condensate interferometer performs, and what its limitations are. For instance, if you confine the condensate using a magnetic field, that can cause distortions in the waves that ruin the interference effect. It is also important to make sure the condensate atoms start out collectively at rest, which can be a challenge when we are also varying the magnetic field to control distortions.
