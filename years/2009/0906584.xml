<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will focus on the fundamental thermal properties and oxidation response of boride ceramics such as zirconium diboride (ZrB2).  Boride ceramics are capable of withstanding extreme thermal, mechanical, and chemical environments such as those associated with hypersonic flight, advanced ceramic-based cutting tools, buffer layers for microelectronic circuits, and inert matrix fuel forms for nuclear reactors.  A deeper understanding of the thermal properties and oxidation response is needed to enable designers of future systems to fully utilize the unique combination of properties offered by refractory diborides and other ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTC).  The ability to use these materials in commercial products would allow systems to operate more reliably and at higher temperatures, which will increase efficiency and decrease energy consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:  &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed effort is to understand the elevated temperature thermal properties and environmental response of refractory diboride ceramics.  Zirconium diboride will serve as a representative system, but the research will also encompass other diborides.  The research is motivated by contradictory and unexplained thermal property and oxidation results, which may be due to variations in the amounts and compositions of impurities introduced during synthesis and processing.  A combination of experimental studies, physics-based modeling, and analytical characterization will be used to investigate the roles of trace impurities, intentional solid solution additions, and the isotopes of the constituent elements on thermal properties and oxidation behavior.  The research has the potential to transform the understanding of boride ceramics, which could enable their utilization in future generations of hypersonic aircraft, cutting tools, electronic devices, or nuclear reactors.  The project will train two graduate students and at least one undergraduate per year in specialized techniques required for processing, testing, and characterizing materials for extreme environments.  The project team will also promote potential careers in science and engineering to K-12 students, primarily through a statewide math and science competition for high school students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project supported the research of two graduate students and three undergraduates in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Missouri S&amp;T One journal paper was published and one was accepted for publication Two invited presentations and five contributed presentations resulted from the research The students participated in outreach activities that brought over 450 high school students into our laboratories for demonstrations or hands-on experiments Reactive hot pressing was used to produce polycrystalline zirconium diboride ceramics with a room temperature thermal conductivity over 135 W/m&bull;K, the highest reported value for this material. A comprehensive study of the effect of change the ratio of 10B to 11B in zirconium diboride was conducted.  The results showed that zirconium diboride produced using the lighter isotope had a higher thermal conductivity.  Mixed isotopes had a lower thermal conductivity than zirconium diboride formulated with either pure isotope.  This research has provided new insight into the effect of atomic mass on thermal transport in ceramics. An ultra high temperature electrical property testing cell was designed and built.  The cell will enable measurement of electrical conductivity and other properties at temperature up to 2000&deg;C.  The cell will enable, for the first time, direct measurement of electrical properties at ultra-high temperatures, which will provide insight into the contributions of phonon and electron transport to total thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of zirconium diboride-hafnium diboride solid solutions was studied.  Hafnium is a common impurity in zirconium-containing materials and this study is necessary to understand seemingly contradictory property values (thermal and electrical conductivities, heat capacity, etc.) reported by different groups for "pure" zirconium diboride.
