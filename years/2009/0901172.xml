<AbstractNarration>This photonics project is the start of a three-phase initiative to develop a new photonics program that a) responds to regional employment shortages in this emerging field by training much-needed technicians, and b) produces graduates who choose to go on to receive more advanced degrees.  Phase one adds a photonics option to the college's existing manufacturing offerings by instituting a Photonics Technician Certificate, creating a new optics laboratory, and exploring the local need for an Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree in Photonics.  Future phases will implement the AAS degree, extend the student recruitment effort, and pursue articulation agreements with four-year institutions. The project team applies lessons learned from an NSF S-STEM grant for student recruitment, and collaborates with the National Center for Optics and Photonics Education (OP-TEC) and the ATE program at Indian Hills Community College. This project: Develops new courses by adapting and field testing photonics curricula in collaboration with OP-TEC and local industry; Trains faculty in both content and teaching methods; Adapts existing strategies used by other ATE grantees, including those designed to equip all students with the mathematical ability to succeed; Collaborates with local manufacturers on an Industrial Advisory Board; Develops a local pipeline from high school to AAS degree to 4-year degree; Provides a replicable model of how to implement a new technical program in an emerging technology field in a systematic manner, including local partners.</AbstractNarration>
