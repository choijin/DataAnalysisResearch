<AbstractNarration>A workshop, ?US-Japan Future Network Research Collaboration Workshop?, will be held Dec 4-6 in Honolulu, Hawaii to assemble leading network researchers from the U.S. and Japan. This workshop is a sequel to an NSF-supported workshop with the Japanese held October 31 and November 1, 2008 in Palo Alto California. Both countries, through CISE/NSF and Japananese research funding agencies, have major research efforts in networking research and in infrastructure development to support research activities. For NSF the major efforts are NeTSE/NeTS/FIND, and GENI and other infrastructure development awards. For Japan the initiatives include AKARI, the Japan Gigabit Network (JGN2). Increasingly, our Nation depends on high speed networks for national defense, commerce, and for interactions among out citizens. Research is continually needed to lead to new technology to improve the bandwidth, efficiency, security, and reliability of the networks we do so much rely on. Cooperation with Japan will accelerate the development of advanced networking technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The US-Japan Future Network Research Collaboration Workshop brought together leading US and Japanese networking researchers to discuss specifics of potential collaborative projects to conduction research on networks of the future.  The workshop was held in December 2009 in Honolulu, Hawaii.  Nineteen leading researchers from the US participated in the workshop (by invitation only) along with four NSF participants. From Japan, twenty-eight researchers, along with four advisors, participated in the meeting.  A major outcome of this workshop was to identify the areas for collaboration and a potential list of collaborators. More importantly, the breakout sessions of this workshop served as a platform to pair up researchers from both countries who might be interested in collaborative projects, should funding opportunities arise.  This effort led to submission and funding of seven joint US-Japan research projects on future networks, where US researchers were funded by NSF and their counterparts funded by NICT of Japan. The outcomes of these seven projects (which are ongoing) are expected to be on new methodologies and architectures for future networks, and effective network research infrastructure activities in both countries.  The broader impact of the workshop was that it served to be an important venue for peer collaboration and communication between researchers in networking research and infrastructure from both countries.
