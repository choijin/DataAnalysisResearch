<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this CAREER award, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry and the Biomaterials programs of the Division of Materials Research, Professor Nathaniel Rosi proposes to develop a new synthetic strategy for simultaneously controlling both the synthesis and the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles.  Nanoparticle properties depend intrinsically on their size, shape, and composition and also their local arrangement within an assembled nanoparticle superstructure.  However, precisely controlling the structure of nanoparticle superstructures and precisely controlling the placement and registry of nanoparticles within these superstructures is a significant challenge. Synthetic methods capable of addressing this challenge would enable the design of nanoparticle superstructures with arbitrary structural complexity and highly specific and tunable physical properties. The proposed work focuses on the development of a new class of peptide conjugate molecules designed to simultaneously direct the nucleation, growth, and assembly of inorganic nanoparticle superstructures.  The peptide conjugates will be programmed to control both the composition of the nanoparticles and the ultimate topology of the nanoparticle superstructure.  This methodology will be optimized in order to allow for control over nanoparticle size, composition, and interparticle spacing.  These factors will be systematically tuned to prepare nanoparticle superstructure-based substrates for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.  The successful execution of the proposed work will lead to new methodology for precisely controlling the synthesis, assembly, and physical properties of nanoparticle superstructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoparticles are envisioned to be the structural and functional building blocks for next-generation materials and devices.  The physical properties of nanoparticles depend largely on how they are arranged into a material or device.  Therefore, in order to control the properties of these next-generation materials, it is important to be able to precisely control the arrangement and assembly of their constituent nanoparticles.  The proposed work aims to address fundamental challenges associated with nanoparticle assembly, and it will lead to the development of new methodology for controlling the synthesis, assembly, and properties of nanoparticle superstructures.  These basic research efforts will be coupled with outreach efforts aimed at attracting high-school students, especially minorities, to participate in university-based chemistry research.  Undergraduate and graduate students will develop important mentoring skills while training high-school collaborators in a cutting-edge and highly interdisciplinary laboratory environment.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Since 2010, we have used this funding 1) to demonstrate that this methodology can be used to prepare a variety of nanoparticle superstructures with different morphologies (e.g. nanoparticle double helices, linear nanoparticle chains, and hollow spherical nanoparticle assemblies); 2) to show how the methodology allows one to control the metrics of a nanoparticle superstructure (e.g. particle size, interparticle distances, etc.); 3) to illustrate that the methodology can be used to target and prepare nanoparticle superstructures of different composition (e.g. gold, cobalt-platinum, silver, etc.); and 4) to develop strategies for not only assembling nanoparticles into nanoparticle superstructures but also for assembling these superstructures into larger scale entities.  This year, we have used this funding to explore how altering the valency of the peptide conjugate molecule (the active molecular construct that controls the nanoparticle synthesis and assembly process) can affect 1) the assembly of nanoparticles, 2) the morphology of the nanoparticle assembly, and 3) the structural parameters of the resultant nanoparticle assembly.  We also examined how small chemical alterations to the peptide backbone can affect peptide assembly and nanoparticle assembly, in general.  This final year of funding, on a no-cost extension, resulted in 2 new research publication (Langmuir 2015, 31, 9492-9501 and RSC Advances 2015, 5, 76291-76295), 6 invited research seminars, and multiple student presentatoins.  Since Spring 2012, three graduate students (Ms. Leekyoung Hwang, Mr. Chengyi Song, and Mr. Chen Zhang) who were primarily funded by this award have received their Ph.D. degrees, and in Fall 2016, Mr. Andrea Merg, will defend his dissertation.  Early in the funding period (2010), we examined synthetic methods for controlling the structural parameters of helical gold nanoparticle superstructures prepared using our peptide-based methods. Later, in 2013, we demonstrated how these structural parameters affect the chirooptical properties of these helices.  One parameter that we did not explore in these earlier studies was the pitch length of the helical nanoparticle superstructures.  We postulated that we could design peptide conjugate molecules that would assemble into helical structures and that we could control the pitch of these structures by adjusting the structures of the individual peptide conjugate molecules.  Our peptide conjugates consist of a hydrophilic peptide head group and a hydrophobic aliphatic tail. We reasoned that increasing the size of the hydrophilic head group could significantly affect the pitch of a helical assembly.  To do this, we designed a family of peptide conjugate molecules with differernt aliphatic tail lengths (C12-C18) and different numbers of peptide head groups (1, 2, or 3; monovalent divalent or trivalent). We systematically studied the assembly of these conjugates and how they are able to direct the assembly of nanoparticle superstructures. We found that increasing the valency decreases the pitch of the peptide assembly and the resultant double-helical nanoparticle assembly.  We were able to systematically adjust the pitch using this family of conjugates.  This is important, because the pitch length directly correlates to the strength of the resulting chirooptical signal for the nanoparticle superstructures: smaller pitch leads to stronger signals.  This work was published in Langmuir.  These systematic studies lead to the discover of a new single-helical nanoparticle assembly that results when the thiol-ether portion of the methionine residue of the peptide is oxidized to the sulfoxide.  This leads to the formation of a peptide helical coil that directs the assembly of gold nanoparticle single helices.  A manuscript detailing thi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
