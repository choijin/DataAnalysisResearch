<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The recognition that Pliocene and Miocene age glacier ice lies buried beneath sublimation tills in the coldest parts of the Dry Valleys, and likely elsewhere in the Transantarctic Mountains, opens up the possibility of establishing multi-million year records of climate and atmospheric evolution. The PI proposes a quantitative analysis of the Mullins Glacier, the oldest debris-covered alpine glacier. Preliminary work suggests that ancient atmosphere is trapped within Mullins Glacier, however, geomorphic processes, have modified the glacier in unforeseen ways. In prior work, the PI developed qualitative models defining these processes, and in this proposal he seeks to quantify and test these models through quantitative modeling and higher-level data acquisition. Questions to be addressed include: What aspects of vapor diffusion, atmosphere-surface interactions, and till characteristics encourage long-term preservation of buried ice? How might sublimation tills and sublimation polygons at the ice surface influence subsurface ice loss and the composition of trapped gases in glacier ice? Do morphometric parameters of sublimation polygons shed light on the depth and purity of subsurface ice? If so, can these morphometric parameters be used to map undetected buried-ice deposits elsewhere on Earth and Mars? What can variations in the concentration/ style englacial debris in Mullins Glacier tell us about local environmental change over multi-million year old time scales? To answer these questions, the PI proposes numerous experiments for Mullins Glacier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This work will quantify surface processes that modify what may be the longest record of atmospheric evolution and climate change. This research has relevance for understanding buried ice on Mars. The research will support a graduate student and undergraduates. The PI will continue his successful outreach activities with the Los Angeles Valley Community College system and in further developing his digital image analyses lab at Boston University, which showcases his Antarctic and planetary work in 3D to visiting students, faculty, parents, and those interested in Antarctica in the wider community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Buried glaciers in the Transantarctic Mountains represent an untapped archive of ancient atmosphere and climate change. Unlike todayÃ†s relatively fast-flowing ice sheets, stagnant and/or slow moving buried glaciers may contain ice several million years in age. Until recently, there has been little quantification of the processes that both preserve and modify buried glaciers in Antarctica. Unknown are important details of ice burial, ice loss, and the evolution of overlying deposits that play critical roles in maintaining and/or modifying buried glacier ice. Furthermore, the degree to which buried glaciers may serve as robust climate proxies - on both Earth and Mars -  has been debated.     In this research, we examined two of the oldest buried glaciers on the planet, the Mullins Glacier and the Friedman Glacier.  Using ground penetrating radar, we found that both glaciers are relatively clean except for repetitive, inclined layers of rocks.  The pattern of these inclined layers is nearly identical across both glaciers, suggesting a regional forcing mechanism and one most probably related to climate change.  To test this hypothesis we modelled the thermal regime, flow characteristics, and isotopic signature of both glaciers, and found that the internal layers could only be produced by changes in the rate of ice accumulation and rock fall, both of which are well-known proxies for climate change.      We found that the spacing of the internal layers, along with measurements for modern and ancient ice-flow velocities, suggest that repetitive changes in climate occurred on the order of every 30 to 40 thousand years. If correct, the evidence for climate change over the last several hundred thousand years in this unique buried-ice system is registered as subtle changes in ice accumulation and rock fall, rather than large-scale changes in ice advance and retreat.  Future work is aimed at determining a precise chronology for the inclined debris layers, thereby generating a robust record of regional climate change.
