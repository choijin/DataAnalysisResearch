<AbstractNarration>0934364 University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC); Milton Halem &lt;br/&gt;0934114 Georgia Tech; David Bader &lt;br/&gt;0934422 University of California, San Diego; Sheldon Brown &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research (CHMPR)" with a focus on hybrid multicore computing and research on parallel processing algorithms as well as technology-driven research questions. The lead of the proposed Center is UMBC with site locations at Georgia Tech (GT) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center plans to develop, test, and optimize prototypes of computationally intensive applications. A key contribution of the Center will be the implementation of prototype applications on new architectures and comparative performance analysis. This Center is needed to advance knowledge both in high-performance computing as well as computer architecture communities. The PIs are well qualified and the access to resources is excellent. The combined computing facilities at UMBC and GT, respectively, are the largest most advanced Cell Broadband Engine based multicore university systems available today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will address the future needs of the computer industry as this new hybrid multicore processor technology evolves. The proposed Center will provide faculty and students the unique opportunity to gain hands-on expertise to address a wide variety of practical, hybrid multicore applications in areas of climate prediction, defense, biomedical informatics, 3-D graphic environments, finance and social computing. The Center has described efforts to increase participation of underrepresented groups, and there are plans to publish the results of research and education projects within an online Hybrid Multicore Knowledge Repository.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The NSF Center for Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research (CHMPR) and its affiliated industry and government partners aim to be the preeminent cooperative research consortium for addressing the productivity, performance and scalability issues in meeting the insatiable computational demands of its sponsors' applications through the continuous evolution of multicore architectures and open source tools.  The CHMPR research programs have drawn on the diverse computational science expertise at the partnering universities and industry members to make strides in several areas. New approaches for Physics simulation pipelines have been developed that allow real-time simulation environments to handle tens of thousands more objects than currently available Physics solutions when the activity levels are low.  We have developed software tools to identify memory mismanagement on the Heap that is often overlooked and in C++ software.  Utilizing this tool we identified and fixed memory bugs in GoogleÆs Chrome Browser and other open source projects, reducing their respective memory usage.  Utilizing large hybrid multicore systems, our real-time virtual environment ran disaster simulations of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 and the Fukushima Daiichi disaster of 2011.   Based on expertise gained in virtual world development, we have assisted in the development of a virtual world e-learning platform utilized by over 700 students at the University of California at Irvine. Preliminary results show modestly improved performance in learning objectives compared to other online platforms.  The platform has also been used by MBA students from around the world to enhance their leadership and teamwork skills while running a virtual business.   Our virtual world and cinema work has been exhibited across the globe from the US and Brazil to Belgium and Switzerland. The center has trained and supported 11 students that have moved on to successful jobs in industry or are advancing their academic careers.
