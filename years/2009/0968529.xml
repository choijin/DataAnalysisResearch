<AbstractNarration>With the advent of powerful wireless devices over the last several years, the delineation between activities typically reserved for the home computer and the mobile device has blurred considerably. The new opportunities for "always on" access have significant sociological impacts with respect to communication between individuals and the communities that they form. The new network access inspires a set of related fascinating research questions. What effect does pervasive, wireless network access have on the social interactions of young adults, in particular college-aged students? Conversely, what impact would a better understanding of these social interactions have on the underlying wireless and wired networks?  What is the relationship between the two systems, i.e., does the wireless network truly drive social interactions &lt;br/&gt;or do social interactions drive demand on the wireless network?     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal will be to gather high quality, long-term social network and behavioral data and then to analyze the data from sociological and technical perspectives.  The work will provide two hundred and fifty smart phones to a diverse cohort of first-year University of Notre Dame undergraduate students.  The infrastructure will build on lessons from previous efforts at MIT to create a second-generation system for the purpose of tracking the social ties, communication patterns, and behaviors of the cohort over two years.  The broader impact of the work will include inter-disciplinary contributions for both computer science and sociology.  The work will make available a tremendous body of anonymized data to improve both social and network performance research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How does always-on access to the Internet impact how young adults make and keep friends?  That is the central question posed by this grant effort, namely are smartphones impeding or diluting our social structure and similarly, what can we learn about emerging young adult social structures through modern smartphones.     The NetSense study deployed two hundred Android smartphones to the Fall 2011 freshmen class at Notre Dame and monitored those students through graduation. Data was gathered with full consent on communications (texting, email, phone calls, Facebook), interactions (proximity to one another), environment (location), and device usage (apps used, frequency of phone usage, data consumed).  The intellectual merit included:  Students      rarely text individuals that are nearby but students will text other      students despite their peers being nearby.       The notion that students would sit next to each other and text      rather than speak largely appears to be an anecdotal myth.  Within      fifteen weeks of being on campus, most students have reached their steady      state for the number of friends over the next few years (though the particular      friends in that network may change).       The number of friends that a student has varies a great deal      between students but is fairly stable over time for an individual student.   The      size of a personÆs network is predicted by their personality, especially      extroversion.   Women      have slightly larger networks initially, but the gender gap closes within the      first year.  There      is significant clustering based on demographic traits such as gender,      race/ethnicity and religious orientation.   Women      are more likely to have female friends, men male friends, but this is in      large part because college students in this study are more likely to have      within residence hall ties, and residence halls are sex segregated.   Ethnoracial      minorities (African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Latinos) have both larger      networks and display stronger tendencies towards assortative mixing      (having friends within the same ethnoracial group) than Whites do.       Their larger networks are the result of them having ties to persons      within their ethnoracial group and to Whites. Ties      within ethnoracial groups last longer than ties between persons in      different ethnoracial groups.   However, between ethnoracial      group ties vary in their survivability.  Ties between Whites and      either African-American or Latinos do not last as long as ties between      Whites and Asians or ties between African-Americans and Latinos.  The      latter two types of ties last just as long as within group ties,      indicating some affinities between Whites and Asians on the one hand and      African-Americans and Latinos on the other. The      major reason that some cross-ethnoracial group ties do not last that long      is that they are not embedded in a network of other social ties.       Ties that are embedded (i.e. the two connected persons have one or      more friends in common) are more likely to survive, irrespective of      whether the tie is a cross-ethnoracial tie.  There      is also clustering (assortativity) based on religious affiliation.       All three groups - Catholics, religious non-Catholics, and Nones      (atheists, agnostics, and those who express no religious affiliation) are      more likely to have friends who are like them in terms of religious      orientation.  Controlling for this tendency,  Nones are also      less likely to have ties to either Catholics or religious non-Catholics. There      is also significant clustering based on behaviors and attitudes.       Students who drink alcohol more tend to have friends who also drink      more.  Students who are more politically active tend to have friends      who are also more politically active. WiFi      offloading may be problematic and is highly dependent on th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
