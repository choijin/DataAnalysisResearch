<AbstractNarration>With the support from the Chemical Synthesis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Xumu Zhang and coworkers at Rutgers University New Brunswick conduct research to develop highly reactive, regioselective, and enantioselective asymmetric hydroformylation reactions.  Chiral ligands for use in Rh-catalyzed asymmetric hydroformylation reactions will be designed and synthesized.  Factors that control the selectivities of the reactions will be investigated.  The synthetic utility of the chiral ligands synthesized and the asymmetric reactions developed will be demonstrated in a few challenging asymmetric syntheses of chiral pharmaceutical and fine chemical products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydroformylation reaction is an important fundamental process in chemical industry.  The development of efficient asymmetric hydroformylation reactions would have an important impact on the industrial production of fine chemicals.  Furthermore, the use of these reactions to improve efficiencies of asymmetric syntheses of chiral bioactive compounds and the research training of students in catalysis and synthetic organic chemistry would benefit the pharmaceutical industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the life of the award, the following outcomes have been achieved in PI's lab:  1). Development of Truly Practical Synthesis of Chiral Ligands for Asymmetric Hydroformylation Reaction  Development of a highly efficient and practical chiral ligand synthesis for asymmetric hydroformylation is the key for the further exploration. Although we have prepared chiral ligand YanPhos from a chiral building block called NOBIN, the synthesis of NOBIN is difficult by itself.  Direct synthesis for YanPhos from a chiral binol is highly desirable. We synthesized chiral aminophosphine intermediate from a derivative of binol and conversion of the aminophosphine  to Bz-YanPhos can be achieved easily in the last step. The key synthetic steps are the reaction of chiral OTf intermediate with a benzyl azide. With this efficient synthesis, YanPhos could be scaled up and used for making chiral aldehydes widely. Since we have discovered YanPhos is one of the most efficient ligands for asymmetric hydroformylation and can compete well with Binaphos, a ligand has dominated over 10 years in the field of asymmetric hydroformylation.    2). Development of Bis-diazaphospholate Ligands for Asymmetric Hydroformylation Reaction  Recently, we have reported the tunable synthesis of a series of electronically and sterically bis-diazaphospholate ligands. Systematic screening the library of ligands on AHF of different type of olefins showed that an introduction of an appropriate electro-withdrawn group to the ortho postion of phenyl moieties in the ligand is essential to achieve the high regio- and enantioselectivities. With a low catalyst loading (S/C = 1000:1 -3000:1), a wide range of terminal and internal olefins undergo the hydrofomylation reaction to give the synthetically useful chiral aldehydes with good conversions, good to excellent regio- and enantioselectivities. We believe the findings reported should assist in further research on the systematic approach of asymmetric hydroformylation catalysts.    3). Development of Revolutionary Chiral Bisphosphorus Ligands for Asymmetric Hydroformylation Reaction  In the cyclic phosphine, introducing heteroatom such as an O and N atom will make the phosphine ligand more electron-deficient and the ring structure makes ligands rigid. Therefore, this type of ligands is highly desirable for asymmetric hydroformylation.  We have worked with a process group in Boehinger-Ingelheim Inc. in using their BIBOP ligands (a TangPhos derivative) for asymmetric hydroformylation study.  This type of ligands is much easy to be modified with different substituted groups.  Although we have invented YanPhos, TangPhos, DuanPhos, Binapine and modified diazaphospholanes, BIBOP ligands have never been employed for asymmetric hydroformylation of alkenes yet. To our surprised, with substrate/catalyst = 500, the classic alkene substrates, such as styrene and vinyl acetate have been hydroformylated in high conversion (&gt;99%) and up to 91% ee catalyzed by Rh-MeO-BIBOP.Our goal is to a true breakthrough and a revolutionary catalyst with simple synthetic steps but highly efficient catalysis ability. Giving our success employing BIBOP ligands for asymmetric hydroformylation reaction, we will continue to explore challenging substrates with different functional groups on BIBOP ligands and develop new efficient ligands with simple synthetic steps for asymmetric hydroformylation.  So far only few chiral phosphine ligands (Binaphos, diazaphospholane, Ph-BPE, TangPhos, DuanPhos, Binapine, YanPhos ) give promising results in terms of high activities and/or enantioselectivities (&gt;90%ee) at 40-80 oC.  Among these ligands, several chiral ligands such as TangPhos, DuanPhos, Binapine, YanPhos  have been developed in the PIÆs lab.  Furthermore, training in synthetic organic chemistry provides chemists (postdoctoral fellow, Ph.D. graduate, M. S. graduate, B.S. undergraduate students) who are needed in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical companies.  The...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
