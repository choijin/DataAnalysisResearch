<AbstractNarration>In June 2009 Oregon's governor signed into law a bill to create Citizens' Initiative Review (CIR) panels for the 2010 statewide general election. Two-to-three times in the summer of 2010, a stratified random sample of 18-24 Oregon citizens will deliberate on an initiative for 5 days, then prepare a one-page statement that goes into the official Voters' Pamphlet distributed to each registered voter by the Oregon Secretary of State. This research is the first opportunity to assess the impact of a small deliberative group (i.e., the CIR panels) on a large-scale electoral process. In doing so, this project will address two questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the research assesses whether the CIR process maintains its design integrity and leads its citizen panelists to engage in high-quality deliberation that yields a well-informed and reasoned Pamphlet statement. To address this question, the project's research team assesses the CIR itself: its overall design and the soundness of its deliberation and judgments. This involves creating and analyzing transcripts of the CIR panel meetings, as well as archival records of the CIR planning process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, the investigators explore whether the CIR's statement in the Voters' Pamphlet has a substantial electoral impact: whether it changes how people choose to vote and the reasons they give for the voting choices they make. The bulk of this project's budget will measure electoral impact through a panel survey of likely Oregon voters, with the first wave occurring before the first CIR panel convenes and the second coming at the end of the election. The design and content of the survey will make it possible to discern the degree to which Oregon voters read or otherwise learned about the CIR statements in the Voters' Pamphlet and whether those statements influenced their vote directly or by shaping their perceptions of relevant pro-and-con arguments or factual disputes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help practitioners improve the ballot initiative process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From April-December, 2010, our team of researchers studied the legislatively authorized pilot of the CitizensÆ Initiative Review (HB 2895, adopted in 2009). Pursuant to HB 2895, our purpose was to determine the quality of deliberation that took place during the review process itself, as well as the utility of the resultant CitizensÆ Statements published in the statewide VotersÆ Pamphlet. By both of these metrics, the 2010 pilot of the CitizensÆ Initiative Review (CIR) received high marks.     Our research method included direct observation of the CIR panels; interviews with the panelists themselves; examination of full transcripts of the CIR panels; assessment of the CitizensÆ Statements, and analysis of large statewide surveys. Based on this research, our primary findings are as follows.     1. The two CIR panels convened in August 2010 engaged in high-quality deliberation.       The panels conducted a rigorous analysis of the issues and maintained a fair and respectful discussion of the issues throughout the proceedings. The CitizensÆ Statements included in the Voters Pamphlet were thoroughly vetted by the panelists and free of any gross factual errors or logical mistakes.       2. Were the CIR CitizensÆ Statements helpful for Oregonians when they voted?      Most Oregon voters who read the CitizensÆ Statements (65% of M73 voters and 57% of M74 voters) found the Statements to be helpful and gained new information or arguments; those voters who read the Statements also became more knowledgeable about the measures. Voters reported spending considerably more time reading the CitizensÆ Statements compared to other parts of the voterÆs pamphlet. Voters who carefully read the CitizensÆ Statements were much less likely to support M73 and M74. The net result was narrowing the margin of passage for M73 and increasing the opposition to M74 from a small to a larger majority of voters.      The principle investigator on this study was John Gastil, a professor in communication  and political science at the University of Washington (UW). He has published five scholarly books and dozens of articles on democracy and group behavior, and he has helped lead four other NSF-funded projects during the past seven years. The projectÆs graduate research assistant was Katherine Knobloch, a UW Ph.D. student in communication. Other collaborators included Professor Mark Henkels of the Public Policy and Administration and Political Science Departments at Western Oregon University, Associate Professor of political science Katherine Cramer Walsh at University of Wisconsin-Madison, and UW communication Ph.D. candidate Justin  Reedy.     This research was funded principally through a grant from the National Science Foundation (Political Science Division), as well as with funds from the University of Washington   Royalty Research Fund.     It is likely that the timely distribution of our research findings through the Evaluation Report to the Oregon State Legislature (December, 2010), played a role in securing renewal of the Oregon CIR during the 2011 legislative session.
