<AbstractNarration>The Peers Organized by Discipline for Success (PODS) project is providing scholarships and intensive mentoring for 90 academically talented, financially needy science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students in the sciences, mathematics, and aerospace engineering technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The program is promoting academic success, retention, and completion through an enhanced academic support and peer-mentoring system called PODS in which small groups of 3-5 students, supported by a faculty mentor and peer tutors, form a "triangle for success". Recipients participate in "Ready, Set, STEM!" orientations, the College's STEM Club, "how to study science" seminars, and receive assistance from science and mathematics tutors. Activities include field experiences, site visits to STEM-related businesses and institutions, transfer workshops, "Speaking of STEM" lectures, career development activities, and scientific internships and symposia. PODS is providing financially needy STEM students with additional financial, academic, transfer and career assistance to increase their chances for success. The College is well qualified to implement PODS because of past success with NSF grants and a variety of programs to assist financially needy students. The PODS team includes faculty with proven mentoring experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Information gained through PODS is help improve academic success, graduation and job placement for students beginning higher education at community colleges, institutions rapidly becoming one of the pipelines for STEM majors.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Objectives for this program were 1) Fill the financial need gap for the students, 2) Provide an enriched learning environment, 3) Engage the students in learning activities, 4) Decrease time to completion of the AA and 5) Increase transfer to a baccalaureate granting institution or employment in a STEM field. We sought to do this by organizing the students into PODS (Peers Organized by Discipline for Success), meeting with each student on a regular basis (weekly), provide fields trips to schools of interest, participation in the Florida-Georgia LSAMP, participation in outreach programs.</p> <p>Through this program we have been able to award 202 scholarships to 111 unduplicated highly qualified, needy undergraduate students. Several students received scholarships in multiple years. Students selected for scholarships earned a GPA that ranged from 2.45 - 4.00 and averaged 3.42. Over the seven years 93 males and 109 females received scholarships based on need. There were 10 students who stopped participating in clubs and interacting with faculty members. Another 6 students GPA fell below the minimum. While we reached out to all of the students, only 2 responded and were able to return to funded status. 87% of the students received an Associate of Arts degree in a STEM related discipline or an Associate of Science (workforce) degree. Those earning an AS degree (32) entered the workforce directly. These students earned degrees in Computer Science (26), Biotechnology (5), and Biomedical Technology (1).&nbsp; 52 students continued in school, earning a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in a STEM discipline. The degrees were represented through the following disciplines, Biology (32), Chemistry (2), Mathematics (3), Engineering (5) and Computer Science/Technology (10). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>It was through STEM related club activity we have been able to educate and engage the students at FSCJ about STEM-related opportunities. The student&rsquo;s participation in the clubs has had a positive outcome for both awardees and non-awardees as they have participated in several outreach programs whether they are receiving a scholarship or not. We were able to take our students to the Peach State LSAMP Expo where they could network with other students, learn about Summer Research Experiences, and receive information about degree programs at other institutions. We also were able to take students to the Florida Research Conference where the students learned about research opportunities at Florida Schools. The impact of the clubs is that students are becoming engaged in STEM activities and are focused on completing degrees, learning about preparing for employment and possibly continuing their education. While 52 students moved on to earn a Bachelors&rsquo; degree, only 7 continued on to a graduate degree, 6 in biology and 1 in chemistry. Several students are now pursuing professional degrees (Medical (2), Pharmacy (7), and Veterinary (1) schools). The undergraduate schools to which our students have transferred include, University of North Florida, University of Florida, University of Central Florida, Florida State University, Clemson University, Cornell University and Florida State College at Jacksonville. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>We were able to provide an enhanced learning environment for both STEM scholarship students and STEM non-scholarship students. This was accomplished through the participation in Club activities, use of STEM tutors, and faculty mentoring. Within one year of being awarded a scholarship students were able to complete the AA or AS degree. A primary reason for this was that students were applying during their last year of the AA or AS degree program. It has been through the faculty working as advisors in a wide range of clubs that students have learned about opportunities for summer research experiences, internships, employment and undergraduate programs.&nbsp;</p> <p>It has been through the club activities that we have met the goals for this project. We were able to identify under-represented high performing students with financial need. As word spread about students receiving scholarships club participation increased. It has been through the club activities that we were able to organize the students by discipline (PODS) to achieve success. This was achieved for both awardees and non-awardees as all students were able to derive benefit from club participation. We will continue encouraging student participation in club activity, providing opportunities to learn about career pathways available across disciplines. Club advisors served as mentors and would be better served if all advisors could meet to organize student activities across club disciplines. This is one area that needs more work to minimize duplication of activities and efforts.</p> <p>Through the efforts of this NSF funded grant we were able to fill a financial gap for many students. We provided an enriched learning experience by engaging students in several activitie outside of the class. Through these activities we have increased the student&rsquo;s interest in continuing their education and entering STEM careers at many different levels. Many of these activities are no-cost to the institution and will continue. The school will need to encourage faculty participation in these programs. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/17/2017<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;D&nbsp;Stittsworth</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
