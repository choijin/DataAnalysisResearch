<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research, and education on supermolecular assemblies of nanoscale filaments. Biofilaments present inherent challenges to theoretical study owing to the flexibility of the filaments themselves and the complexity of interactions among them. These effects are governed by long-wavelength physics, representing both soft deformations along filaments, as well as collective effects of inter-filament packing geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate the statistical and thermodynamic properties of filamentous assemblies that derive from the common structure of biological filaments. Namely, biofilaments are universally long, flexible and helical. The research addresses three aims: 1) establish the role of chirally-induced topological defects in finite-diameter bundle formation; 2) build a statistical theory of protein-mediated bundling of filamentous actin; and 3) explore the statistical mechanics of crystallization of pure and inhomogeneous filament assemblies.&lt;br/&gt;Project (1): The PI will establish a fundamental consequence of the geometric frustration between two dimensional and chirally ordered materials in the context of dense biofilament bundles. The PI will focus on the role played by disclinations that screen long-range stresses, which are themselves induced by chiral interactions between neighboring filaments. The PI aims to illuminate the influence of chirality on molecular assembly and provide insight into assembly mechanisms of biological filaments that are inherently limited in size. &lt;br/&gt;Project (2): The PI aims to construct a statistical mechanical framework, a coupled lattice-gas and lattice spin model, to explore the assembly thermodynamics of parallel actin bundles. The goal is to determine how an intrinsic frustration between the respective helical and six-fold symmetries of f-actin and bundle assemblies gives rise to cooperative binding of cross-linking proteins and influences bundle formation. &lt;br/&gt;Project (3): The PI will investigate the critical properties of filamentous systems as they pass through an unusually complex phase transition from two dimensional liquid-crystals to true three dimensional solids. The PI further aims to assess the role of quenched impurities inherent to crystallization of polydisperse filaments and expand our knowledge of the role of disorder in soft materials.&lt;br/&gt;The education component supports an effort to develop a new educational program that leverages existing center and faculty resources to create a Soft Matter Research in Theory summer program for undergraduate students. The program is designed to enhance the skills of students and enable them to participate in ongoing theoretical research projects. This program introduces students to the methods and challenges of modeling soft materials and the excitement of research in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research, and education on assemblies of filaments composed of large molecules that have dimensions on scale of a nanometer ? a billionth of a meter. Filamentous assemblies like these are found inside biological cells and play an important role in giving them structural integrity. This award supports research to understand how filamentous assemblies organize themselves into more complex structures. This has important consequences for the structural and mechanical properties of filamentous assemblies. Aspects of the research will be done in collaboration with experimental efforts that use x-rays to study filament bundling in cells. The PI seeks to uncover fundamental principles that will also apply to the design of new synthetic materials that are structured on the nanometer scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is an example of fundamental research in the mathematical and physical sciences at the boundaries with biology which has the potential to advance both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education component supports an effort to develop a new educational program that leverages existing center and faculty resources to create a Soft Matter Research in Theory summer program for undergraduate students.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit &ndash; Project outcomes include theoretical models of complex structure in self-assembled soft matter, with a particular focus on assembly of multi-filament bundles and fibers, a prototypical yet poorly understood class of structures in biological and synthetic materials.  A. Geometry of multi-filament packing &ndash; A key outcome of this project is a new geometrical framework for understanding how non-parallel alignment of filaments in complex structures, like twisted bundles, imposes constraints on their nearest-neighbor spacing.  This framework shows that lateral ordering in bundle cross sections can be mapped on to packing on a non-Euclidean 2D surface whose shape (curvature) depends on the bundle geometry.  This mapping provides powerful and intuitive picture into both what local (nearest-neighbor) and global (inter-filament pattern) arrangements are possible given an imposed geometry, such as twisting (Fig. 1).  This framework lays the groundwork for new approaches to understanding and engineering optimal multi-filament structure across seven orders of magnitude in size scale, from macroscale (ropes, cables, textiles) to molecular (nanotube yarns, extracellular fibers).  B. Optimal structure of frustrated chiral filament bundles &ndash; Building from the geometric framework for multi-filament packing developed in this project are new physical models for structure and thermodynamics of self-twisting bundles of chiral filament bundles, a model relevant to extracellular and pathological biological fibers, from collagen to sickle-cell hemoglobin.  By exploiting the mapping of filament packing in twisted bundles onto the packing of elements of spherically-curved surfaces, we have shown that packing "frustration" gives rise to host of new and complex structural behaviors in self-assembled fibers.  First, we have shown for the first time that "defects", irregularities in the periodic packing of neighbor filaments, are actually favored features of the lowest energy states of bundles (Fig. 2), an anamolous behavior that chiral bundles share with other geometrically-frustrated systems, like crystalline packings on curved surfaces. Second, we have shown that packing frustration may also give rise to a transition in bundle shape, or morphology, from round, cylindrical cross-sections to elongated, strip-like sections.  Determining the bundle shape phase diagram we have applied our geometrical/physical model to successfully explaine observed morphology transitions from cylinder to tape-like fibers of self-assembled amyloid proteins (Fig. 3).   C. Defects and wrinkles in surface-confined assemblies &ndash; Sheet-like assemblies with curved geometries are prototypes of both microscopic assemblies (particle coated-droplets) and nanoscale biological structures (viral capsids, protein shells).  Due to the stresses caused by curvature, these assemblies are subject to two distinct instabilities:  those characteristic of thin sheets (wrinkles and folds) and those characteristic of 2D solids (lattice defects).  This project developed the first approach to address the interplay between these two distinct instabilities, and more important, to determine the key parameters that select between the resultant deformation given stresses imposed by geometry (Fig. 4A).  Exploiting a previously unknown connection between patterns of wrinkles and patterns of defects in stress membranes, the project also revisited unsolved aspects of the century-old Thomson problem, which seeks the optimal states of ordering on curved spherical assemblies.  Significantly, a new argument provides a quantitative prediction for the optimal symmetries of defect "scar" patterns on curve membranes in the realistic limit where particles are much smaller than the membrane size (Fig. 4B-C).
