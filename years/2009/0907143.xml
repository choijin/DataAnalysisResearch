<AbstractNarration>The Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) is a continuous model of two-dimensional systems in statistical mechanics at criticality.&lt;br/&gt;The proposer will study the detailed fractal and multifractal properties of SLE paths.  A  goal is the further understanding of  the relationship between microscopic rules and macroscopic behavior for critical phenomena and the effect of boundary conditions and other global geometry on the behavior.   Another is to establish  the multifractal formalism for a model with nontrivial self-repulsion interaction.  A long-range hope is to use this structure to understand configurational measures on discrete paths such as the problem of the self-avoiding random walk.&lt;br/&gt;The proposer will also try to understand what  ideas  can extend to dimensions other than two, in particular for random walks with self-repulsions in three dimensions,  where conformal invariance is not expected.  In higher dimensions,  the loop-erased walk, Laplacian walk with exponent and continuous analogues, and Brownian intersection problems will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of critical phenomenon, i.e. the behavior of a system at or near the point at which it changes state, leads to a number of mathematical constructions.  For example, interfaces between different phases or materials can be viewed as a curve or a surface.  At criticality, these curves and surfaces have ``fractal'' behavior which means that they have scaling properties like spaces of unusual, often fractional, dimension.  For two dimensional systems (or three dimensional systems constrained so that they are almost two dimensional), a stronger property called conformal invariance has been observed.  The proposer will continue study of a major new model in this area, the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) with a particular emphasis on the detailed fractal geometry of the curve and the interaction of the curve with outside boundaries or walls.  The proposer will also explore similar questions in three dimensions which are of great interest, but much more difficult because of the lack of conformal invariance as a tool.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main focus of this study was the fine structure of random paths that arise in the study of critical phenomenon in statistical physics. For systems in two dimensions, there is a family of curves called the Schamm-Loewner evolution (SLE) which are candidates for these limits. These curves exist ``fractal behavior'' and a number of results were proved describing and establishing this behavior rigorously.   The Minkowski content of SLE paths was established.  This is a way to make precise the notion of "d-dimensional" length of a curve where d &gt; 1.  This is important in understanding scaling because in many models one of the terms contributing to the total energy is the length of the curve.  This content was shown to exist and can be used to define the SLE curves in a natural way that was not available previously.  In related work, the SLE "Green's function" was shown to be the scaled limit of the probability of getting near a point and the multipoint Green's function was shown to exist.   One of the lattice models involved is the loop-erased random walk (LERW) obtained from ordinary random walk by erasing loops and producing a path with no self-intersections. A major step was made to show that the scaling limit of the length of LERW on the discrete level converges after appropriate normalization to the Minkowski content.   In particular, an asymptotic formula was given for the probability that loop-erased walk uses an edge.   There was also significant progress in understanding the "multifractal spectrum" of the tip which is one way of describing how irregularities appear in random curves.    Other properties such as Holder continuity and continuity at the endpoint were proved as well as a greater understanding of the critical kappa = 8 case for SLE.  The PI also gave a defintion of SLE for regions with holes. The PI continued study of the self-avoiding walk although this work is unfortunately not mathematically rigorous.  However, there is a greater understanding of what should be true for such models.  For broader impact, a book  on stochastic calculus designed for students at the masters level in quantitative finance was completed.  He has also been in charge of a new major in Computational and Applied Mathematics at the University of Chicago.
