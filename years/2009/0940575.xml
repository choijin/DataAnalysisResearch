<AbstractNarration>Miami Dade College, California State University San Marco, and the University of Texas Pan-American propose a program-called SACI for "Scaling and Adapting Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) Inititatives" which will join with CAHSI and apply CAHSI best practices to advance student success among Hispanics and other groups underrepresented in computing fields. CAHSI is an NSF-funded Alliance with seven universities that has developed and demonstrated the effectiveness of a series of initiatives. The SACI partners will adapt five CAHSI strategies: (1) a new introductory course designed to attract students and prepare them for majors in computing fields, (2) a peer-led team learning structure, to provide academic support and motivation for students to persist in computing disciplines, (3) an affinity research group model, to promote undergraduate retention through early research experiences and prepare students for success in upper-division and graduate studies, (4) faculty and peer mentoring, to improve student retention and success, and (5) outreach workshops, to stimulate interest in computing careers among high school and undergraduate students and to disseminate project research and evaluation findings.  SACI will join CAHSI, significantly extending the Alliance and its impact, and leveraging the Alliance's educational and research strengths; SACI will participate in the CAHSI Alliance-wide evaluation.</AbstractNarration>
