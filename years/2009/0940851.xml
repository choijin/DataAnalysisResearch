<AbstractNarration>Many of the most important functions in society are undertaken by large groups or teams. Emergency response, product development, health care, education, and economic activity are pursued in the context of large, dynamic, interacting networks of groups. Theory and research on such networks of groups is much less developed than research on isolated small groups or formal organizations. A major challenge for research on networks of groups is the difficulties that accompany the collection and analysis of the huge bodies of high resolution, high volume, observational data necessary to study these large, dynamic networks of groups. The goal of this project is to address this challenge by applying advanced computing applications to capture, manage, annotate and analyze these massive observational sets of video, audio, and other data. The resulting data analysis system, GroupScope, will enable breakthrough research into social interaction in large, dynamic groups to be conducted much more quickly and with much higher reliability than was previously possible. It will do this by automating as many functions as possible to the highest degree possible, including managing huge volumes of video, audio, and sensor data, transcription, parsing audio for critical discourse events, annotation and indexing of video streams, and coding interaction. These first pass analyses can then be supplemented by human analysts (and their analyses in turn will feed into machine learning that will improve the computerized analysis). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GroupScope will be developed with the collaboration of social scientists studying emergency response teams, children's playground behavior, distributed teams, and product development teams. When developed, GroupScope will be deployed in a cyberenvironment, a Web 2.0 based cyberinfrastructure that enables a community of researchers to collaborate on common problems. The cyberenvironment will enable multiple researchers to analyze and code the same group data for both small groups and large dynamic groups and networks. Multiple analyses and codings working from diverse perspectives will enable discovery of previously unsuspected relationships among different levels and layers of human interaction. They can also be linked to survey responses from participants, enabling linkage to the realm of perceptions and traits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the most fundamental advances in science have come through the development of new instruments, such as more powerful telescopes or microscopes that can allow scientists to view molecules. In the same way GroupScope will shed light on the workings of critical functions performed by real world groups such as emergency response units, health care teams, stock exchanges, and military units. GroupScope will also have applications in the training of those working in multi-team systems, such as first responders to disasters. It can be used to record and "grade" training sessions, giving participants feedback on both strengths and weaknesses of their approaches.</AbstractNarration>

These include manipulating communication channels, proximity, team identification, trust, and distribution of information within and between teams in the MTS.  Results for the 4-person study indicate that the performance of the multi-team system is not always aligned with the performance of specific subsystems (the team tasked with dealing with insurgents versus the team tasked with dealing with improvised explosive devices). We also found that network linkages between teams are much more influential in determining multi-team system performance than network linkages within the teams. Examination of team-initiated organizational network reconfigurations in the 4-person study of trust and network configurations showed that no matter whether they started with a fully peer-to-peer connected configuration or a hierarchical chain connection configuration, teams were likely to switch to the other configuration at some point during the extended task. However, a greater percentage of fully connected teams switched to chain connections than vice versa. Additionally, we found that chain connected teams reported higher team adaptivity and better teamwork than fully connected teams. Another surprising finding was that teams in the high trust, completely connected condition were more likely to be reckless, moving the convoy more quickly and sustaining more damage.  We performed analysis of the 20-person communication channels and collocation study using relational events analysis. This technique is used to find statistically significant temporal sequential structural signatures using detailed team action/communication logs. Our analysis was twofold: first, we identified patterns that were consistent across experiments, such as (1) component teams tended to communicate with themselves (2) leaders tended to coordinate amongst themselves (3) information coordination was an emergent characteristic, but took various forms. The second tier of our approach was to use the variation in behavioral patterns to explain differences in performance. We found that (1) information flow from the system to the component teams resulted in higher sub team performance but lower MTS performance (2) when individuals in similar roles coordinate, the MTS performance improved (3) high levels of leader-to-leader communication actually hurt overall MTS performance. Using these results, we see that certain communication structures clearly lead to higher performance. Further, the manner in which information is shared as well as how leadership is coordinated has a direct impact on the overall unit.   We studied the behavior of individuals within a multi-team system in two unique ways. First, we examined the structural patterns of the communication network and how relationships between key MTS members affect the performance of the system. In the 20-&shy;person MTS experiments, all communication was transactional? in other words...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
