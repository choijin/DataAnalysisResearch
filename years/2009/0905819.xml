<AbstractNarration>There has recently been a tremendous amount of progress in the areas of Kleinian groups and the geometry of 3-manifolds. Several long-standing conjectures have been solved, the most spectacular being Perelman's proof of the Geometrization Conjecture, but also including the Ending Lamination Conjecture (Minsky, Brock and Canary) and the Tameness Conjecture (Agol, Calegari-Gabai).  The goal of this proposal is to get a more exact understanding of how geometric structures on 3-manifolds are reflected in their topological properties.  Since hyperbolic structures on closed manifolds are unique, studying them through families typically requires allowing singularities or obtaining them by gluing flexible manifolds with boundary.  Getting explicit, quantitative information about a geometric structure requires a refined understanding of the flexible structures from which they are obtained. These variational techniques can also be applied to understand other types of geometric structures, such as projective and Lorentzian structures, that don't have an invariant metric.  We will also consider interesting questions about geometric structures in other dimensions (hyperbolic structures in high dimensions, projective structures on surfaces).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal we wish to study geometric structures in dimension 3, as well as other dimensions, using a combination of analytic, geometric, and topological tools.  This is a very active and interesting area that has recently had an influx of new ideas and techniques.  Geometry in dimension 3 is particularly appealing because it is visually accessible to many people, including beginning mathematics students and those with less technical backgrounds.  It also has applications to physics and has led to the creation of a number of graphical interfaces that have been widely utilized.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to study the topology and geometry of low-dimensional objects, such as surfaces and knots in space.  One of the main themes that has run through this field in recent years is how the flexible shape (the "topology") of such objects interacts with particular realizations of them, where rigid notions such as length, area and angle (the "geometry") make sense.  The geometry used is not just the familiar Euclidean geometry but other types, like hyperbolic geometry, where, for example, triangles can have angles that add up to less than pi.  Many people have experienced this geometry in the designs of Escher.  The ability to convey some of the ideas of this field by visual means makes it accessible to people with many different backgrounds.  During the life of the award, research was completed on 4-dimensional hyperbolic spaces, not exactly "low-dimensional", but some of the results were related to symmetries of polyhedra that could be described both by 3-dimensional pictures and by combinatorial diagrams.  There were also results on symplectic structures (a concept that originated in physics) on some of the spaces that parametrize types of shapes of surfaces ("Teichmuller spaces" and spaces of "projective structures"). It was also the beginning of the study of a new geometric concept, called "transitional geometry" that describes the process of moving from one kind of geometry, like hyperbolic geometry, to another, like Euclidean geometry, to yet again another, like spherical geometry, all on a single topological object.  During the life of this award, 6 PhD students were supported.  Five completed their degrees and are currently in academic jobs in mathematics.  The other one is expected to finish his degree in 2019.             Last Modified: 11/16/2016       Submitted by: Steven P Kerckhoff]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
