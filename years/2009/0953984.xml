<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to systematically investigate high-temperature metallic systems through electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory. The specific goals of the present research program are: (i) to develop practical approaches to treating anharmonic effects on the thermodynamic and structural properties of materials designed to operate at high temperatures; (ii) to assist in the development, by a close collaborator of the PI, of high-temperature Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy to measure high temperature elastic constants. (iii) to systematically model the influence of configurational defects on the properties of intermetallic compounds, with special emphasis on their effects on structural stability, allowing the development of alloying guidelines to optimize high temperature properties; (iv) to develop a framework for the integration of multiple atomistic simulation tools for the automated prediction of material properties as well as to generate material property databases in the spirit of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) approaches.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program addresses problems that are essential for the further development of high temperature intermetallics and alloys. Through this work, a fundamental understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that influence the high temperature thermo-mechanical properties of metals will be achieved. The proposed curriculum innovations will allow the scaling up of undergraduate research experiences. The PI will collaborate with the NSF-RET program to provide research experiences for secondary math and science teachers. Proposed undergraduate research activities (linked to the minority-focused, NSF-funded LSAMP IV program) as well as collaborations with Mexican institutions will broaden participation and enhance international perspective of undergraduate/graduate students. This CAREER award will also contribute to the formation of human resources by: training students in computational materials science; fostering students' communication skills through manuscript preparation and conference presentations; introducing the students to the scientific community by encouraging participation in scientific meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The quest toward improved performance and efficiency in power generation and aerospace propulsion systems has resulted in increasingly higher operating temperatures of system components. Current operating temperatures of these systems are at the stability limit of the most advanced Ni-based high temperature materials. Further developments in thermal management technologies are unlikely to ease current operating constraints, making necessary the development of novel high temperature materials.Materials development, however, is time-consuming and costly relative to overall systems design. Unfortunately, thermodynamic, kinetic, structural and thermo-mechanical property data for high-temperature metals and alloys are often unavailable.The goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive research program to predict the high temperature properties of promising structural alloys and intermetallic phases likely to be used as stress-carrying components, strengthening phases or bond coats in thermal management applications. The methods used were based on electronic structure calculations within Density Functional Theory, and incorporated corrections to take into account the contributions of different degrees of freedom on the finite temperature properties of intermetallic compounds.  The individual objectives were:  i. To develop and evaluate practical approaches to treating anharmonic effects on the thermodynamic, structural and thermo-mechanical properties of structural materials designed to operate at high temperatures.  ii. To compute the temperature dependence of the elastic tensor and to assist the development, by a close collaborator of the PI, of high-temperature Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy techniques to measure the elastic properties of structural materials at high temperatures.  iii. To systematically model the influence of configurational defects on the properties of intermetallic compounds, with special emphasis on their effects on structural stability, allowing the development of alloying guidelines to optimize high temperature properties.  iv. To develop a framework for the integration of multiple atomistic simulation tools for the automated prediction of material properties as well as to generate material property databases in the spirit of ICME approaches.     The educational goal of this award was to increase exposure to research among undergraduate students, increases the participation of underrepresented groups in graduate education and incorporates an international perspective towards research at both the undergraduate and graduate levels:  i. To assess the impact on learning of already-implemented student-centered research-based curriculum innovations in undergraduate materials science courses.   ii. To leverage the proposed student-centered research-based curriculum innovation  by linking it with existing outreach programs within the PI's institution.  iii. To incorporate an international component to the education of graduate students by leveraging ongoing collaborations with institutions of higher education as well as materials research centers in Mexico.   iv. To improve minority representation in graduate education.  The major outcomes of the project were:  1. Understanding of effect of composition and temperature on the properties of structural and multi-functional metallic alloys, intermetallic compounds as well as layered ceramics. The methods developed in this research program were validated against available experimental data.   2. The temperature dependence of the elastic constants of the intermetallics studied was observed to be a function of temperature. In some specific cases, the predictions were compared to investigations using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) measurements, achieving good qualitative/quantitative results.  3. Over the past five years, the PI and his group has developed a tool that automates and simplifies the very expensive and complicated calculations that are necessa...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
