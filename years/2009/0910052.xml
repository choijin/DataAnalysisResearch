<AbstractNarration>When a pathogen is transferred to an alternative host, its virulence may increase in the alternative host, while attenuating in the original host, a process that is used to make attenuated vaccines. This general finding demonstrates that pathogens can quickly adapt to different hosts and provides a powerful experimental tool to characterize pathogen adaptation. This project uses serial passage methodology to explore the relationship between pathogen adaptation and host genetic diversity and increase understanding of the underlying genetic causes of evolution of virulence in nature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding pathogen evolution has broad basic and applied relevance to health, including biomedical problems in domestic animals, wildlife, and people, such as cancer, autoimmunity, emerging disease, and vaccine design. For instance, this research will quantify the disease-associated risks of low genetic diversity, which could lead to improved captive breeding designs that increase the viability of endangered species and to increased pathogen resistance of domestic livestock. Undergraduates and the graduate student CoPI will receive research-based training through this research, and the CoPI will continue educational presentations in public schools.</AbstractNarration>
