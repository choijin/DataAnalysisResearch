<AbstractNarration>Many fundamental questions in earthquake physics remain unresolved, largely because of&lt;br/&gt;difficulties in obtaining high-quality, near-source recordings of small earthquakes and&lt;br/&gt;deriving reliable source parameters. The overarching goal of this project is to provide an&lt;br/&gt;improved understanding of earthquake source processes for a wide magnitude range&lt;br/&gt;(approximately -4 to 4). We are performing detailed seismological investigations of&lt;br/&gt;source properties that characterize several distinct classes of seismic events (earthquakes,&lt;br/&gt;rockbursts, and blasts) in a 3.6 km deep South African mine. We will also conduct a short&lt;br/&gt;field campaign to record seismic events at the extremes of the magnitude range and in&lt;br/&gt;close proximity to fault structures. Full source tensor inversions, second moment&lt;br/&gt;analysis, and spectral methods will be used to determine comprehensive sets of source&lt;br/&gt;properties including scalar potencies/moments, focal mechanisms, corner frequencies,&lt;br/&gt;strain/stress drops, radiated energies, rupture velocities, and source time functions.&lt;br/&gt;Special effort will be devoted to detecting isotropic components of faulting. Theoretical&lt;br/&gt;calculations of expected radiation from different event types will help in the&lt;br/&gt;interpretation of results.&lt;br/&gt;Applying the above analysis to the small-magnitude, near source seismic data will allow&lt;br/&gt;us to obtain constraints on many aspects of earthquake physics including nucleation&lt;br/&gt;processes, the prevalence of isotropic components of seismic radiation, changes in the&lt;br/&gt;physics of rupture with event magnitude or with proximity to geologic and mining&lt;br/&gt;structures, and source parameter differences between earthquakes, explosions, and other&lt;br/&gt;seismic sources. The high-resolution results on seismic source properties and scaling&lt;br/&gt;relations will significantly impact the earthquake physics and rock mechanics&lt;br/&gt;communities by helping to resolve long-term controversies on earthquake nucleation and&lt;br/&gt;rupture processes, scaling of laboratory results to natural faults, and earthquake energy&lt;br/&gt;budgets, among others. In addition, the findings on spatially dependent seismic properties&lt;br/&gt;will be useful for decision-making concerning when and where to suspend mining&lt;br/&gt;activities to enhance underground safety</AbstractNarration>
