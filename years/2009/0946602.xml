<AbstractNarration>The ultimate goal of this project is to understand how ionic solids respond to the combined electrical, electrochemical and mechanical loadings.  To achieve this, the research is organized into four components: (1) to develop and validate a scientific theory that account for the interaction between electrochemical reactions and mechanical stresses in ionic solids, (2) to develop a numerical method for solving the nonlinear equations in the new theory, (3) to gain better understanding of the coupling between electrochemistry and thermomechanical stresses in ionic solids near microscopic defects such as voids and crack, and (4) to conduct experimental validation of the new theory.&lt;br/&gt;Ionic solids such as yttria-stabilized zirconia and gadolinium-doped ceria are commonly used to make electrolyte - a key component in solid oxide fuel cells.  Solid oxide fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts hydrogen into electricity without releasing harmful pollution.  It is considered as one of the most promising green energy conversion technologies of the future.  However, to make solid oxide fuel cell commercially variable, fracture failure of the electrolyte under combined mechanical and electrochemical loadings must be fully understood. This research is to meet such need.  Besides contributing to science and engineering, the research activities will also have a broader impact on educating students. Key aspects of the educational plan include integrating research results into existing courses, involving undergraduates in engineering research, bridging graduate research across different disciplines, and engaging students from underrepresented groups in engineering research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
