<AbstractNarration>Quantifying lateral flow of water in alpine snowpacks&lt;br/&gt;using high resolution geophysical techniques&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;In addition to inherent variability in falling snow, both wind redistribution and variations in radiation balance cause large spatial variability in the timing and location of input of snowmelt to the ground.  However, even when these major drivers are accounted for, physically based hydrologic modeling is challenging, suggesting that there may be other processes controlling when and where snowmelt enters the subsurface.  Most snowmelt models treat the snowpack as homogeneous, and assume that all meltwater moves vertically to the ground.  Numerous experiments have shown that snowmelt follows a complicated path through the snowpack, moving both laterally along stratigraphic boundaries and vertically in concentrated cylindrical channels.  While theoretical approaches have been developed to account for heterogeneities such as stratigraphy and vertical preferential flow paths, they are not applied in practice due to a lack of quantitative field-based measurements.&lt;br/&gt;We suggest that lateral movement of liquid water during melt and rain-on-snow events can be an important mechanism of water redistribution in steep, snow-dominated catchments. Flow of water within snowpacks is a complicated and poorly understood phenomenon.  Permeability boundaries cause slope-parallel lateral flow over large distances, and coupled with cylindrical, vertical melt pathways, there is a resulting large spatial variability at the slope scale.  An improved understanding of the lateral flow of water in snow will have impacts for a broad range of problems including: 1) rain-on-snow events which have the potential to cause flooding and landslides.  The snowpack provides a large mass of water to melt, and may provide a faster route for the rainwater to enter streams.  2) A quantitative understanding of the timing and location of snowmelt within the seasonal snowpack is necessary in order to evaluate the importance of lateral flow on the seasonal hydrograph in snowmelt-dominated basins, and 3) quantifying lateral flow in snow is important for estimating the travel-time of meltwater traveling from polar ice caps and glaciers to the ocean which in turn is a basis for predicting time scales of sea level rise.  Understanding the importance of lateral flow during rain-on-snow is important for forecasting floods, wet snow avalanches, and landslides, as mid-winter rain may become more common in a warming climate.&lt;br/&gt;This project will leverage state-of-the-art geophysical tools that already exist in-house at our institution to quantify lateral flow of water in alpine snowpacks.  These include 1) measurements sensitive to microstructure which controls hydraulic conductivity, 2) rapid, non-destructive methods for measuring snow stratigraphy, depth, snow water equivalent, and liquid water content of both snow and the underlying soil, and 3) direct in-situ measurements of liquid water content.  These measurements, combined with tracer experiments, will be used to characterize the snowpack conditions at the microscale that lead to lateral flow.  The detailed snow and soil characterization will be used to estimate hydrologic properties for initial model conditions.  Field data will be used to develop hydrologic models (using HYDRUS2D) of the experimental hillslopes to evaluate the relative importance of lateral flow in snow and soil in snowmelt-dominated catchments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Snowmelt from the seasonal snowpack provides 50-80% of the water supply in the Western U.S., and over 1 billion people worldwide depend on snow water resources.  The timing of snowmelt, and estimating its impact on stream flow, is critical for hydropower and flood forecasting.  While the physics of the energy balance and melt at the snow surface is fairly well understood, the dynamics of water flow through snow remains a complex problem that is challenging to model.      At the onset of melt, variations in the snowÆs hydraulic properties, combined with capillary forces, cause vertical water channels to form that route melt from the surface towards the soil.  The layered nature of the snowpack, due to large variations in snow porosity between different storm events, causes water to flow parallel to the surface along layer boundaries.  This complex flow of water causes large variations in liquid water content at the meter scale, and persists until late in the spring, when the snowpack eventually becomes completely saturated and homogeneous.  Increases in mid-winter rain and melt are causing this transition period, from completely dry snow to completely water saturated snow, to span larger periods snow season and simultaneously cover larger elevation ranges.  While modeling water flow in completely saturated ripe melting snowpacks is well understood, our understanding of this important transition period remains poor.     This project performed the first intensive quantitative observations of water flow in snow on steep terrain.  Previous work on unsaturated flow of water in snow has focused only on flat terrain, where the layered structure of the seasonal snowpack causes water to pool at layer boundaries.  In steep terrain, water flowing along layer boundaries can reach streams much more quickly than when traveling through soil, due to the high porosity of snow, and may be a significant factor for rain-on-snow flood events.  Redistribution of water downslope has an impact on available water for plants and soil erosion.     We developed two intensive study sites in sloping terrain, covering a range of elevation, aspect, and slope angle, to quantify the amount and timing of downslope movement of water within the snowpack.  Over 4 years we operated continuous tower-mounted and upward-looking radar systems, to measure the evolution of snow depth, stratigraphy, snow water equivalent, and liquid water content.  We installed 10 lysimeters with custom tipping buckets, which measured the timing of water reaching the soil surface.  Half of these water collection experiments were contained to only allow water from directly above, and half also allowed flow of water from upslope within the snowpack to reach the collection area, to quantify the volume of water moving laterally within the snow.     Soil moisture probes and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) measurements tracked changes in water within the soil, and tracked the large gradients in soil moisture that developed downslope.  Weekly manual snowpit observations were performed all 4 winters, and included in-situ measurements of snow density, temperature, stratigraphy, microstructure, liquid water content, and isotopic chemistry.  Geochemical analysis at high vertical resolution provided further evidence that the majority of water moved in the upper layers of the snowpack for over one month after the onset of melt, with the lower snow layers remaining largely dry. Full energy-balance weather stations adjacent to the study sites provide the necessary forcing data for modeling snowmelt, and stream gauges in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed allowed us to assess the impact of lateral flow on streamflow.  We captured 4 seasons of snowmelt, and multiple significant rain-on-snow events.      Intellectual Merit: This project, for the first time, provided comprehensive quantitative observations of lateral flow of water in snow on slopes, using a wide range of geophysical techniques, co...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
