<AbstractNarration>Richard Schwartz plans to continue his research in geometric dynamics. A central focus of his research is the study of outer billiards. In 2006, Schwartz resolved the central problem in this 50-year-old subject, the Moser-Neumann problem concerning the stability of outer billiards orbits.  Schwartz will continue to develop the theory, exploring connections to self-similar tilings, limit sets of discrete groups, and renormalization.  Schwartz also plans to continue studying irrational polygonal billiards, with a focus on the Triangular Billiards Problem, which asks if every triangular shaped billiard table has a periodic billiard path.  Finally, Schwartz plans to study basic geometric iterations such as those defined by iterated barycentric subdivision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The common theme in Schwartz's proposed research is the analysis of what happens when a simple geometric construction is repeated over and over again. For example, in outer billiards, a toy model for planetary motion, a point (the satellite) moves around the outside of a convex planar shape (the planet) according to a simple geometric rule. Resolving a 50 year old question about this system, Schwartz found examples of convex shapes, and starting positions for the point, such that the point wanders unboundedly far away from the shape while following the rules of the game. One might say that these shapes are examples of planets whose satellites can wander off into space. Iterated geometric constructions such as outer billiards are intellectually appealing and scientifically important because their simple definitions sometimes lead to extremely rich and mysterious behavior, as do analogous systems in the natural sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the period of my grant, I studied a number of problems of the following flavor.  You start with some simple geometric construction and investigate the consequences of doing it repeatedly.  I will give two examples of this.  In one case, I studied something called a polytope exchange transformation, which you could think of as an idealized system of hitting a glass polyhedron with a hammer and seeing how the cracks divide the thing up into smaller polyhedra.  As the process is repeated, cracks appear at finer and finer scales, and sometimes produce a beautiful and mathematically significant pattern.   I have attached one of the images produced by a 2-dimensional version of this process.  In another case, I studied an operation one performs on a polygon which I am calling "projective heat flow".  This operation produces another polygon with the same number of sides, in a way that is specially tailored to projective geometry, the geometry of our vision.  The operation tends to make the polygon look more symmetrical, though for some special polygons one sees really erratic behavior.  I had the idea of trying to come up with a process like classical heat flow which was more related to the geometry of our vision.  In all cases, my method was to investigate the phenomena using computer programs I wrote myself.  I use these programs as experimental tools, much like a biologist might use a microscope. The difference is that I then look for rigorous justification of the phenomena I find (rather than, say, statistically significant correlation).  Also, to be honest, I like making the programs and then pushing the buttons on them and seeing what happens.  In concrete terms, my research resulted in a handful of articles as well as a research monograph which will be published by the American Math Society. Also, in my spare time, I wrote and illustrated a children's picture book about really big numbers.  This book will also be published by the A.M.S.
