<AbstractNarration>The St. Edward's University (SEU) Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program (STEP): CASAR (Community for Achievement in Science, Academics and Research)-Science Living Learning Community (LLC) Project is increasing the numbers and retention of students, particularly women and underrepresented minorities, in the STEM disciplines through an interdisciplinary academic living learning community comprised of faculty, staff and students that supports the academic success of students as they move into, through and beyond SEU.  The LLC students enrich their research skills by working in multicultural teams on scientific projects that include cross-disciplinary laboratory experiences.  Students begin with a one-week Freshman Accelerated Research Methods summer program prior to the start of their first academic sessions, followed by a year residing in the CASAR LLC.  At the end of the first year, interested CASAR students participate in a summer undergraduate research program on campus, mentored by the faculty.  During the second year, the students have the option of continuing in the CASAR-Science LLC.  In their junior and senior years, students are encouraged to participate in other existing summer undergraduate research projects both locally and at off-campus sites, and serve as mentors to incoming freshmen and sophomore LLC participants. Faculty are intimately involved at all stages of the program along with support staff, such as academic advisors, residence life personnel, counselors, tutors, and the Office of Graduate Fellowships.  As a Hispanic Serving Institution SEU is attracting and retaining traditionally underrepresented students into STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit  CASAR implemented several high impact practices to achieve this result, including a pre-college bridge program - the Freshman Accelerated Research Methods (FARM) Workshop, freshman seminars, the LLC, common intellectual experiences via cohort scheduling, and undergraduate research.  Of the 47 STEM graduates from Cohorts 1-4, 27 of them plan to apply or are currently admitted to graduate or professional programs of study.

Enrollments in the School of Natural Sciences, plus Behavioral Neuroscience and Environmental Science majors (in the School of Behavioral and Social Sciences) increased from 132 in Fall 2010 when the grant was awarded to 235 STEM majors in Fall 2017, a 78% increase.  This project supported 92 of the 157 students in CASAR Cohorts 1-7 in summer research.  All but seven of the 44 Science LLC graduates from Cohorts 1-4 participated in the summer research program.  All but 2 of the expected 14 Cohort 5 STEM graduates participated in research.  In addition, the university development office began promoting faculty-student research to donors and is raising funds to support it.  STEM faculty received additional grant support from the Keck Foundation, TG Public Benefit Program, NASA, USDA, NIH, NOAA, NSF, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the Welch Foundation, and the Capital Area Council of Governments.  STEM majors participating in undergraduate research have won awards for their presentations.  A former LLC participant was awarded an Erasmus Mundus scholarship, another won a full Fullbright Research Fellowship, and a third was awarded an NSF Graduate Fellowship.  Other students have been accepted into doctoral programs with full support.  STEM faculty participation has increased from the original five STEM faculty in 2010 to 28 STEM faculty in the 2017-18 academic year.  Broader Impacts  The collective average STEM graduation rate for CASAR participants is 52%, including the projected graduation numbers for Cohort 5, who are expected to complete their degrees in May 2018.  This graduation rate exceeds that reported by the Higher Education Research Institute ("https://heri.ucla.edu/nih/downloads/2010 - Hurtado, Eagan, Chang - Degrees of Success.pdf") for all groups discussed in their report, especially including Hispanics.  Of the 40 Hispanics in Cohorts 1-5, 18 of them completed/will complete a STEM degree, a 45% success rate.   Of the 76 women in Cohorts 1-5, 43 of them completed/will complete a STEM degree, a 57% success rate.  All but three of Cohort 1-4 students completed their degree in four years or less.  From the HERI report on completion rates for freshman STEM aspirants matriculating in 2004: "White and Asian American students who started as STEM majors have four-year STEM degree completion rates of 24.5% and 32.4% respectively. In comparison, Latino, Black, and Native American students who initially began college as a STEM major had four-year STEM degree completion rates of 15.9%, 13.2%, and 14.0%, respectively. "  Eleven students from Austin Community College participated in 6-week summer research projects in Summer 2016.  This supplemental project was a pilot to determine if a STEM transfer pipeline could be initiated.   All 11 students reported a very satisfying experience, however, the tuition differential between the state community college and the private college was too great for the students to enroll, even with financial support.  Only one of these students plans to transfer to SEU.          Last Modified: 12/04/2017       Submitted by: Richard L Kopec]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
