<AbstractNarration>0960487&lt;br/&gt;Williams &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University and Internet2 will hold a US-India Networking and e-Science Workshop in Bangalore jointly hosted by Indiana University, Internet2, the Indian Education and Research Network (ERnet), and the Indian Department of Information Technology (DIT).  The workshop will be convened at the Indian Institute of Sciences (IISc), Bangalore in early March 2010 and will bring together key research and education network service providers and a group of leading researchers from both countries.  They  will discuss network developments, collaborative research activities, and how both countries can ensure that network cyberinfrastructure will be available to support and foster scientific collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This workshop will engage the Indian network cyberinfrastructure community, which has  been long absent from the global research and education networking community.  This, in turn, has meant that the Indian science community has not been well-connected with their colleagues or with the scientific instruments and data increasingly located around the world that are necessary for them to be part of the global science community. This workshop will begin to bridge those gaps for the Indian science and network cyberinfrastructure communities, benefiting not only the Indian community but also  those in the U.S. who wish to pursue scientific challenges with Indian counterparts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include bringing together network cyberinfrastructure practitioners&lt;br/&gt;with key science communities dependent on that infrastructure in a way that we believe will lead to ongoing, sustainable interactions between the two communities. Much as the astronomy and climate change communities are learning from the high energy physics? communities decades-long planning of data models and bandwidth needs for the Large Hadron Collider experiment, we expect that a number of the planning and application methods here will be transferable to other science communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
