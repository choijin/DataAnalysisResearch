    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for a US electromagnetic (EM) geophysics community-wide workshop. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together academia, industry, and federal agencies to develop a coherent, coordinated plan to insure a strong EM geophysics future. The workshop will address recent concerns and set strategies to meet current and future research and workforce demands for more highly trained EM geophysicists in the US. EM techniques are in the forefront of geophysics in addressing many of today?s pressing societal concerns such as energy and mineral resources, monitoring environmental problems, and investigating near-surface regions of potential natural and man-made hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds ($20,000) will be used to partially cover travel, living expenses, and incidentals for ~ 30-35 invited participants. These funds will be augmented by industry support to complete the estimated cost to hold the workshop. The workshop will be held at the University of California, Berkeley Faculty Club in March, 2009.</AbstractNarration>
