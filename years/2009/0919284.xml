<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolution typically leads to organisms that are increasingly complex in the way they look, the sorts of chemicals they produce, or the way their cells function.  However, complex and costly characters can also be lost. For example, many lineages of birds have lost the ability to fly. Are very simple organisms evolutionary cul-de-sacs? By looking at the spore producing structures in mosses, this research will examine whether complexity can be lost and then re-evolve. The evolutionary history of the moss family Funariaceae will be assessed through analyses of DNA sequences.  Meanwhile, morphological complexity will be quantified through electron microscopy and morphological measurements. In particular, this research will assess the evolutionary history of species that look quite simple, such as Physcomitrella patens, a new model organism in genomic research. The research will also test whether more complex spore-bearing structures help to keep the spores from drying out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite their ecological and evolutionary significance, mosses receive no attention in K-12 education. Educational materials will be developed with high-school teachers to promote curricular integration of mosses and to increase general literacy in plant biology. The project provides training opportunities for one post-doctoral researcher, one female graduate student, and undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
