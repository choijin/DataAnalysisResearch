<AbstractNarration>This proposal from four physicists at the University of Kentucky  concerns recent theoretical developments at the border between high-energy physics, mathematical physics, and condensed-matter physics. Over the past decade, the so-called AdS/CFT correspondence has proven to be a very useful theoretical "tool" for analyzing strongly coupled theories, i.e., theories for which a standard perturbative mathematical treatment is ineffective.  This tool, which resulted from developments in theoretical high-energy physics, has already been used in order to study systems at the interface of high-energy and nuclear physics, such as the quark-gluon plasma.  However, just in the past few years, a new direction for the AdS/CFT tool has become apparent --- this is to study strongly coupled systems in condensed-matter physics. This proposal aims to develop teachniques using the AdS/CFT correspondence in order to address difficult problems in equilibrium and non-equilibrium many-body systems near or at their critical points. The PI's also aim to study the entanglement entropy of topological states of matter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this would represent an entirely new way of attacking extremely difficult problems in condensed-matter physics, and has the potential to lead to important new insights in both condensed-matter physics and for the mathematics of the AdS/CFT correspondence itself.  Thus, this proposal is not only interdisciplinary in its scope, but also potentially transformative in its research potential, exploiting the synergy between theoretical high-energy physics, mathematical physics, and condensed-matter physics.   Additional broader impacts of this proposal are focused on the training of postdoctoral researchers who will work in this newly emerging discipline.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project has sought an improved understanding of a cluster of problems of common interest in condensed matter physics and high energy physics.    A major thrust of the project was to study the properties of condensed matter systems cooled down to absolute zero, which are on the verge of changing from one phase to another.  Such "quantum critical points" offer a window into a new regime of quantum physics that is poorly understood but yet relevant to experiments carried out on a number of physical systems ranging from complex materials to ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices.  Our activities included studies of quantum critical points in specific systems of experimental interest, including single-layer graphene in a magnetic field, where we were able to understand the transition from an insulating state to a conducting one as the field strength varies.  We also performed a numerical investigation of the entanglement properties of a one-dimensional collection of particles near a quantum critical point, and found good agreement with analytic results.  In addition, using purely analytic methods, we discovered a set of unexpected properties common to all theories describing quantum critical points in one dimension.  Another aspect of the project explored the process by which systems equilibrate, e.g. how the heat from a fire in the middle of a room spreads out and makes the whole room warm. In this project, techniques of quantum theory were used to understand several aspects of this process, especially for systems close to a quantum critical point. One of the main findings is a mechanism which gives rise to universal behavior common to a large class of such systems.   Finally, the project opened a new line of investigation into a class of systems exhibiting motion in their lowest-energy states.  These so-called "time crystals" have unique critical properties, and might arise in certain superfluids, cold atom systems, or cosmology of the very early universe.  Applications are currently being explored.    The broader impacts of the project included training of three graduate students and two postdocs.  The work on time crystals received attention in the nontechnical scientific and popular press, including Scientific American, New Scientist, Science News, Nature News, and numerous science blogs.
