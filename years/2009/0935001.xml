<AbstractNarration>Award: AST-0935001&lt;br/&gt;Inst: American Astronomical Society&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kevin Marvel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the third Women in Astronomy Conference held on 21-23 October 2009 at the University of Maryland.  The conference will be a forum for discussion of women in astronomy and space science with a focus not only on gender, but also on minorities and the new generation of scientists.  A diverse range of topics will be discussed including statistics and demographics, best practices, creative solutions to problems faced by women and minorities in astronomy, and broader issues affecting women in the workplace.  The meeting will focus on issues concerning the success of those already working in the field and, in particular, apply the lessons learned to minorities in science.  Conference organizers plan to produce a ?Handbook of Best Practices? based on the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
