<AbstractNarration>The 5th Gordon Research Conference on Protein Folding Dynamics and the accompanying Graduate Research Seminar, which is a workshop for graduate students and post docs addressing the methods and models of protein folding will take place at the Ventura Beach Marriott,Ventura, California from January 9-10 (GRS) and January 10-15 (GRC), 2010.  Funding from the NSF will allow a broad participation from both young and established scientists working in this field. Protein folding is a multidisciplinary area of research addressing fundamental problems in biology. Consequently, few other fields see such a successful blend of physical and biological sciences. Progressively, more studies that bring together experiment and theory are being published, and this combination is advancing our fundamental quantitative understanding of the information encoded within protein sequences. Technological and theoretical advances have altered our view of the protein folding and dynamics. Fast events can be observed experimentally on timescales that approach those accessible by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. New,sophisticated models of proteins allow ensemble kinetics to be sampled and compared to experiment.&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference in Protein Folding Dynamics, is a relatively new conference,first set up in 2002, aimed specifically to bring experiment and theory together to explore advances in the field and to serve as a forum to discuss fundamental problems from polypeptide energetics and dynamics; to chaperone assisted folding and the relationship between protein misfolding and disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: As the field matures and development in the physical sciences are being applied to important problems in protein dynamics and energetics, it becomes even more important to provide this venue to foster this communication and training at this interface between theory and experiment. The GRC fosters an environment that attracts the brightest and the most interactive members of the community. The ideas and hypotheses developed at this conference will continue to advance the field of protein folding dynamics as well as larger community interested in understanding the information encoded in protein sequences, fields as diverse as biomaterials to human genetics.&lt;br/&gt;The Graduate Research Seminar in Protein Folding Dynamics is a meeting being organized as a satellite to the GRC in Protein Folding Dynamics. This workshop serves as a venue for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists to i) develop background on current techniques, theories and models in preparation for the GRC in Protein Folding Dynamics, ii) share their knowledge of protein folding methodologies and techniques and iii) meet each other and discuss their own research. The involvement and inclusion of young and developing scientists represents a key objective in the vision of the conference to provide this vibrant multi-disciplinary research area with scientists who are broadly based in both experimental protein folding methodologies and the models and theories that provide a basis for the interpretation of experiment in this field.</AbstractNarration>
