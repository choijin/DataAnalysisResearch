<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Judy E. Kim of the University of California, San Diego, and her graduate and undergraduate student colleagues will study amino acid radicals that play important roles in long-range electron transfer and catalytic reactions. Special focus will be placed on the aromatic residue tryptophan. A unique aspect of this research is the assembly of a suite of powerful spectroscopic techniques, including picosecond time-resolved and UV resonance Raman, transient absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance, to probe the structures and kinetics of radical intermediates. Several topics will be explored, such as the role of the protein microenvironment and pH on radical stability as well as kinetics associated with radical formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from these studies will not only enhance our understanding of biological radicals, but may impact the design of protein mimics and other synthetic systems for critical catalytic reactions. In addition to providing students with the opportunity to participate in interdisciplinary research, the current proposal strongly promotes teaching, training and learning. Undergraduate and graduate education will be bolstered through the integration of a diverse set of students in these projects. Involvement with the community and K-12 students will foster the development of a close relationship between the UCSD Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the local community. In general, the current research and education activities are poised to benefit society through (1) critical discoveries in electron transfer reactions that impact fields in chemistry, biology, and physics, and (2) educational enhancements for undergraduate and graduate students as well as community members. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was inspired by one of the simplest chemical reactions in Nature &ndash; the transfer of a single electron from one molecule to another molecule via an intermediate.  We focused on biological molecules that are capable of serving as these intermediate "hopping spots" during long-range electron transfer reactions.  The intermediates in our studies are two of the natural amino acids, tryptophan and tyrosine.  We utilized a model protein system called azurin, and used a variety of optical, magnetic, and computational techniques to characterize the structures and dynamics of tryptophan and tyrosine intermediates during electron transfer events in the protein.  Our results revealed different signatures of the intermediates that directly reflect the local environment, such as polarity and hydrogen-bonding strength.  In addition to this characterization, we also investigated a mutant of azurin in which the electron transfers between tyrosine and tryptophan upon absorption of light.   This is a more complex reaction because not only does an electron move within the protein, but protons may also transfer from the amino acid to the solvent.  We quantified the probability for these events for different mutants, and hypothesized conditions that might enhance the transfer of electrons and protons from/to these amino acids.  This is an especially exciting portion of the project because our findings pave the way for bio-inspired materials that may allow the conversion of solar energy to chemical energy.
