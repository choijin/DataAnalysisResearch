<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to document instances of naturally occurring speech in Kuna, a Chibchan language spoken mostly in the Panamanian-Colombian border area. The data obtained from this documentation effort will then be used to produce processed texts and a comprehensive grammar of the language, with an emphasis on community interests of strengthening and revitalization.  The initial stage of the project will focus on collecting already-recorded, but unpublished, texts and making new audio and video recordings of Kuna speech. The purpose is to enrich and complement the existing collection of recordings by adding genres that are not represented currently in the language archives.  Just as importantly, the project will produce several hours of processed texts for community use, through careful transcription, translation and morpheme-by-morpheme glossing of selected recordings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also seeks to train native Kuna speakers in basic linguistic descriptive terminology and documentation methods. The participation of Kuna speakers in the process of documentation, through workshops and seminars, is important because it places value on community input and ensures continual support of the community in strengthening and revitalization efforts. The objectives of the project are lined up with the growing awareness of language and cultural loss among Panamanian-educated Kuna. This has resulted in an interest in rescuing the use of Kuna language and the exercise of cultural practices of dancing and chanting in urban centers. The project can have a lasting impact within the community of Kuna speakers if its members are encouraged to carry out their own documentation projects and share new materials with the community.  The work presented here, therefore, serves as a complement to work already started within the community.</AbstractNarration>

Another aim of the project was to train community members in the use of documentation tools and methods so that they can also carry out the documentation of the language.  The training of two members of the community was done through the Congreso General Kuna (Kuna General Congress), an institution that represents the interests of the Kuna people on the national stage; these members of the community will continue working with the Congreso as volunteers to continue teaching what they have learned because the Congreso has expressed interest in starting their own documentation projects.  The two native Kuna speakers, Pailiber Rodriguez and Yageri Perez, were trained in the use of the audio and video recorders, the transfer of files to a digital format, and the use of different annotation tools for transcription and translation.   The student researcher also held different linguistic workshops using the materials we gathered.  An average of 30 attendees were present for an 8 week discussion class (starting on February 2011 and ending on May 2011) on linguistic topics in Kuna. There was an attendance of 109 Kunas for the first class, evidence that the community is really excited about continuing to document and preserve the Kuna language. Due to different factors, many were not able to continue but expressed interest in these kinds of seminars in the future.
