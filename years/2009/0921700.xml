<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Yasaki, Dan    &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0921700&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of North Carolina Greensboro &lt;br/&gt;Title: Southeast Regional Meeting on Numbers (SERMON) 2009&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) will host the 21st annual South East Regional Meeting On Numbers (SERMON 2009) on April 18-19, 2009. SERMON is a two-day combinatorics and number theory meeting held annually each spring semester at rotating institutions; it is attended by faculty and students from various colleges and universities in the southeast. SERMON originates from UNCG where the first conference was held in 1988. Since then it has taken place every year at various universities in the southeast including University of Georgia, University of South Carolina, Citadel, College of Charleston, Wake Forest, Virginia Tech, Furman, and Clemson University. This yearly conference features 20 minute talks by students and faculty as well as one hour talks by one or more noted mathematicians. This year, SERMON will host Professor Paul Gunnells from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and Professor David Ford from Concordia University, Montreal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One goal is to encourage collaborative efforts among number theorists and combinatorialists in the southeast by providing a friendly, informal setting where they can come together and hear about recent research in number theory and combinatorics.  In addition to plenary and contributed talks, there will be a session devoted to discussion of open problems in the area. It is also an opportunity for graduate students in the region to meet, interact, and speak about their work with senior researchers. SERMON has a unique familiar atmosphere. The social gathering in the evening traditionally takes place at the home of one of the faculty members. These activities help strengthen bonds between graduate students and senior researchers to facilitate future joint projects.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
