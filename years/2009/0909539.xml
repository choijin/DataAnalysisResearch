<AbstractNarration>Ecological edges are transition zones between adjacent environments (e.g., forest and field). Plants, animals and other entities respond strongly to edges, and these responses are not static. In fact, responses to a given edge can change dramatically depending on what environments are nearby, and how these environments are configured in space. In particular, responses can be altered by the presence and configuration of other, nearby edges. Worldwide increases in anthropogenic habitat fragmentation motivate an improved understanding of edge interactions. As landscapes become more fragmented or patchy, edges become more tightly packed, and edge interactions become more important. This research will therefore focus on understanding edge interactions and their implications for the management of fragmented landscapes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is located in a Kenyan savanna ecosystem, where livestock coexist with diverse and abundant wildlife. New livestock management practices are increasing the patchiness of this working savanna. Using large-scale manipulative experiments, this study will investigate the prevalence, causes, and consequences (for plants, wildlife and livestock) of edge interactions in the increasingly patchy landscape. Results will provide an integrated understanding of edge interactions in a model system, and will improve conservation, restoration and management efforts in fragmented landscapes worldwide. Locally, findings will be discussed with managers and community members via newsletter publications, presentations, workshops, and an online forum. This study will also involve the education of three Kenyan field assistants, a Kenyan Masters student, and local elementary school students.</AbstractNarration>
