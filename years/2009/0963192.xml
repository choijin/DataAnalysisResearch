<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Energizing Research through Cyberinfrastructure (ERTC) project will address the impact of the growth of cyberinfrastructure by renovating the research data center (RDC) located in the Mathematical Sciences Building (Math Building) at Purdue University. The research data center is the hub for Purdue's cyber-enabled research.  In 2000, Purdue faculty research used 628,000 CPU hours from Purdue resources. By 2008, the usage had increased to over 57.4 million CPU hours.  As a result of this growth of computational research, the electrical and cooling infrastructure has been fully utilized, limiting researcher's ability to expand their computational research programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will improve the reliability of the research data center and increase the electrical and cooling capacity to support the addition of two more research computing clusters scheduled for 2012 and 2013.  Currently, loss of power to the data center could result in the significant loss of work for the researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data center is the home of the community cluster program which impacts a broad range of scientific research from nanotechnology to climate modeling to structural biology. The two existing community clusters support 66 faculty members representing over 20 departments from 7 of Purdue's 10 Colleges/Schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ERTC project will have a significant local and national impact on the scientific community. Locally, the renovation will allow the computing community cluster program to continue to grow--allowing faculty members to focus on their science, maintaining high utilization, and achieving the highest levels of operational excellence. On the national scale, the project will allow Purdue to expand the resources available to the national research community, to which Purdue provided over 16 million CPU hours in 2008.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Once used by a handful of elite researchers on select problems, cyberinfrastructure has become a widely employed, essential tool in quantitative research of all kinds and, in many fields, changed the way research is accomplished. Central elements of a cyberinfrastructure include high-performance computing hardware, software, networks, data storage and digital resources for other purposes, such as creating online collaborative communities of researchers, or visualization of research results, the better to probe their meaning and make them more readily understandable to a variety of audiences.     Energizing Research through Cyberinfrastructure addressed growing demand from researchers at Purdue University and national and international collaborators by renovating the main research data center at Purdue to improve its reliability and its electrical and cooling capacity. Among other things, this permitted the installation of new nationally and internationally ranked supercomputing systems in 2011, 2012 and 2013 along with related networking and data storage systems.     These additions have permitted hundreds of researchers to work on solving a variety of problems the answers to which are benefiting, and will continue to benefit, society. Consider:     In electrical and computer engineering, researchers employed the systems to help develop the world's smallest silicon wire, an atom tall and just four atoms wide, and a single-atom transistor, landmarks in the progression of practical nanotechnology that will drive development of the next generation of electronics.      Biologists used the systems to map the structure of viruses at near-atomic resolutions with an eye to finding new ways of targeting their basic functionality, the better to treat viral diseases ranging from the common cold to AIDS.      Chemists made use of this computing power to examine the molecular workings of chemicals that promote global warming and to begin drafting blueprints for building new synthetic chemicals with more benign properties from the molecules up.       Other researchers are using the resources to develop improved forecasts of severe weather, giving those in the path of a tornado or hurricane, for example, more time to move to safety, and to develop improved evacuation plans, to make a move to safety smoother and faster.      Finally, availability of these systems has allowed Purdue to extend high-performance computing to the classroom, providing a resource to help train the next generation of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) experts, a potential shortage of which has become a significant economic concern for the nation.      This is a sampling of work enabled by Energizing Research through Cyberinfrastructure in literally dozens of fields and illustrates the projectÆs considerable success.
