<AbstractNarration>This project includes plans to increase the number of bachelor degrees in natural science and engineering at California State University Northridge (CSUN) by increasing retention rates of first-time freshmen and of transfer students. The goal is to develop a support network for success based on national and established campus best practices.  Major components of the project are: 1) fostering success in lower-division mathematics, 2) a summer interdisciplinary team experience after the first year, and 3) career awareness activities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the additional degrees are expected to be earned by underrepresented students given that the institution is designated as Hispanic-serving.  In addition, CSUN serves a region in which a majority of college-bound students are economically disadvantaged and are the first generation to pursue a college degree.</AbstractNarration>
