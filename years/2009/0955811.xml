<AbstractNarration>This Career award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Georgia Institute of Technology is to study the mechanistic understanding of the link between the properties of hyaluronan (HA)-rich materials and biological functions. A number of advanced micro-characterization techniques that are rarely used in cell biology studies will be applied in this study, including passive microrheology, fluorescence recover after photobleaching, optical force probe microscopy and osmotic pressure studies. These biophysical and soft condensed matter tools will be used for a systematic investigation of the structural properties (network architecture, heterogeneity, mesh size, bundling, shape) and mechanical properties (compressibility, loss and storage moduli) of two major categories of HA-protein systems. In a first thrust, model HA-protein solutions will be used to investigate HA interactions with versican, a protein found in the extracellular matrix, and with the presumptive HA crosslinking proteins TSG-6, heavy chain and PTX-3. The second thrust directly tackles the pericellular coat, a HA-protein network anchored to many cell surfaces. Recent studies have indicated that mechanical and topographical features of HA-protein structures imparts onto its biological environment a diverse range of structural and viscoelastic properties with far-reaching consequences for cell physiology and pathology such as fertilization, cell migration, inflammation, and cancer metastasis. Overall, this project is expected to provide both a very fundamental scientific knowledge in biomaterials and cell biology. As part of the outreach activities, these research studies will be integrated into the Direct to Discovery program at Georgia Tech that provides seamless video conferencing between researchers and classrooms using Georgia?s Peach Net high-speed internet infrastructure, and working closely with a designated teacher in a rural, socioeconomically-disadvantaged community to develop new teaching and training modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hyalrunon polymer plays an important role in many body functions - both physiological and pathological - such as lubricating fluid in cartilage, fertilization of human egg, joint inflammation and spread of cancer. Yet, very little is known about these various hyaluronan architectures, and their functions and properties. Using novel tool and approaches, this project is expected to provide both fundamental scientific knowledge of this biomaterial and cell biology, while simultaneously providing new insights to a material whose therapeutic use is well established. As part of the outreach program and working closely with a designated teacher in a rural, socioeconomically-disadvantaged community, this research project will be integrated into the Direct to Discovery (D2D) program at Georgia Institute of Technology that provides seamless video conferencing between researchers and classrooms using Georgia?s Peach Net high-speed internet infrastructure. Modules will be designed to combine the teacher?s lecture material with (virtual) visits to the PIs Lab using D2D technology, giving students an opportunity to explore cell culture, study viscoelastic properties of materials, and use of different experimental tools ? all the while reaching educational goals to learn topics such as the ?structure and function of cells?, ?nature of matter?, and ?conceptual laws of forces?.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our work led to two emergent stories about unusually thick, natural and synthetic hyaluronan polymer brushes and their relevance to biological function, disease, and biomaterials applications. The polymer hyaluronan is ubiquitous in human tissues and is a common material used in tissue engineering, drug delivery, cosmetics, treatments for osteoarthritis, wound healing and much more.</p> <p>The first story focuses on the cell-surface bound polymer brush formed by many cell types &ndash; a hyaluronan-rich glycocalyx. We demonstrated that this thick afro-like structure on the surface of cells plays an underappreciated role in mediating cell surface access to nanoparticles and molecules. Further, our data suggest that gigantic molecules of hyaluronan at the cell substratum can exert a significant repulsive force which mechanically regulates cell adhesion in concert with more well understood adhesive molecules. This result raises important questions about whether cell integration into tissues is regulated by the orchestration of repulsive and adhesive elements, as opposed to the current paradigm which describes regulation as arising solely from adhesive-type interactions mediated by integrin.</p> <p>In the second story that emerged from this funded project, we discovered a new class of regenerative polymer brushes and hyaluronan biomaterials, fabricated by dense distributions of the enzyme hyaluronan synthase. Again, using an analogy with hair growing from a head &ndash; the enzyme hyaluronan synthase fabricates and extrudes the polymer hyaluronan like hair from a pore. When bound to a surface at high densities, the hyaluronan synthase can generate biomimetic versions of the cell surface glycocalyx. These brushes are among the thickest reported in the literature, are biocompatible and biodegradable, are stimulus responsive, easily functionalized, extremely non-fouling and most uniquely can be regenerated after removal. Experiments demonstrate that the interfaces may be particularly good at repelling the adhesion of bacterial biofilms, at facilitating integration of implants into tissues without infection, and may be easily tailored for specific applications. This broad range of properties is should be useful for the design of dynamic, smart materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The work accomplished during this project provides both fundamental insights into the role of cell surface bound hyaluronan in the body as well as an entirely new class of hyaluronan biomaterial with a spectrum of exciting potential applications. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Jennifer&nbsp;Curtis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0955811/0955811_10013457_1493478246881_CurtisNSFCAREER_2NaturesPolymerBrush-theglycocalyx--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0955811/0955811_10013457_1493478246881_CurtisNSFCAREER_2NaturesPolymerBrush-theglycocalyx--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nature's Polymer Brush - Hyaluronan rich glycocalyx"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0955811/0955811_10013457_1493478246881_CurtisNSFCAREER_2NaturesPolymerBrush-theglycocalyx--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nature's Polymer Brush - Hyaluronan rich glycocalyx"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Top Left: Particle exclusion assay reveals the cell surface grafted polymers that exclude objects from reaching cell surface.
