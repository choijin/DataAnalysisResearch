<AbstractNarration>Nutrient Co-limitation in Young and Mature Northern Hardwood Forests&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temperate forests have long been thought to be nitrogen (N) limited, but chronic N deposition from air pollution should reduce N limitation over time, and theory suggests that ecosystem productivity should be co-limited by multiple nutrients. Experimental tests of N vs. phosphorus (P) limitation in temperate forest systems are lacking.  This study will combine modeling and field studies to explore nutrient limitation in relation to successional change in managed forest ecosystems.  An improved understanding of ecosystem optimization of resource use is important to forest management, environmental protection, and basic scientific knowledge. Balanced nutrient cycling is essential to maintaining forest sustainability, and scientists and managers at the White Mountain National Forest will evaluate silvicultural practices in light of results from the proposed research.  For example, their forest management plans require justifying intensive harvest removals in terms of the ability of forests to acquire nutrients for regrowth.  Feedbacks such as the biological enhancement of mineral weathering when nutrients are limiting are clearly relevant to this appraisal.&lt;br/&gt;The Multi-Element Limitation (MEL) model includes P as well as N, carbon, light, and water, and is being applied to simulate succession in northern hardwood forests. Using nutrient additions of N alone in some forest stands, P alone in some forest stands, N+P in some forest stands,  in replicated stands of three ages (~20, 30, and &gt; 100 years) at the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, the investigators will test the patterns of resource limitation.  The model predicts a greater response of aboveground productivity to N+P than N or P alone. In older stands, it predicts a greater response to N than to P addition, but in younger stands, the model suggests that the supply of N from detritus should be sufficient to create P limitation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Experimental tests of N and P limitation in temperate forest systems are few, and those few have been short-term with very high rates of fertilization. In 2011 we began long-term low-level additions of N, P, and N+P in 13 forest stands distributed across three sites in the White Mountain National Forest of New Hampshire (Figure 1). At Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF), which is underlain by granite, we have three young, three mid-aged, and three mature stands. At both Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HB), on granodiorite, and Jeffers Brook (JB) on amphibolite (metamorphosed basalt), we have one mature and one mid-aged forest stand. Each stand has four plots treated annually with N (30 kg N/ha/yr as NH4NO3), P (10 kg P/ha/yr as NaH2PO4), both N and P, and control. These relatively modest rates are designed to alter site fertility while minimizing artifacts associated with high doses of fertilizer. These treatments allow us to test for NP co-limitation and to challenge balanced forest nutrition and thereby induce mechanisms that maintain co-limitation (Figure 2).</p> <p>Foliar N:P in the untreated mid-age and mature stands indicate that most of our sites are P-limited rather than N- limited (Figure 3). Consistent with P limitation, plots receiving P moved into the co-limited range, and those receiving N were even more P limited after 5 years of treatment, according to their foliar N:P ratios (Figure 3). Tree growth responded more to P addition than to N addition in mid-aged and mature stands (p=0.02; Figure 4). These results are surprising because temperate forests on glaciated soils have been presumed to be N- limited, but they are consistent with predictions of the MEL model, parameterized for our experimental conditions (Figure 5). We can speculate that P limitation is a result of decades of anthropogenic N deposition.</p> <p>Given the evidence for P limitation to aboveground growth, we expected to find reduced soil respiration under P addition, reflecting reduced C allocation belowground. Instead, we found soil respiration significantly reduced by N addition (p=0.02). &nbsp;There was no effect of P (p=0.50) and the interaction of NxP was also not significant (p=0.30) (Figure 6). &nbsp;This result is consistent with a depression of decomposition rates; longer-term monitoring will be required to determine whether this results in a greater accumulation of soil C.&nbsp; A better understanding of the capacity of ecosystems to balance the acquisition of limiting resources is needed to manage ecosystems in the face of continuing environmental change.</p> <p>The benefits of this project to society go beyond the findings from the proposed research, because the continuing NxP treatments in our 13 stands provide infrastructure for an endless variety of research and educational activities. Many new investigators have been attracted to this project and have initiated projects on the effects of nutrient additions on, for example, introduced pests, understory community dynamics, plant and mycorrhizal control of the hydrologic cycle, plant-insect interactions, and bird activity.</p> <p>This project has involved an impressive array of early career scientists and potential scientists, including 30 graduate students, 108 undergraduate students, 82 high school students, 4 teachers, and 255 middle school students.&nbsp; The more senior of these, along with the PIs, have produced 6 theses and dissertations (since 2010) and 31 journal articles (since we started working in these sites in 2003).</p> <p>Since 2011, we have had 8 REU supplements on this project (all collaborators combined). Undergraduate students have conducted research projects on tree height, sap flow, decomposition, beech bark disease, arthropod communities, germination, mycorrizal types, sap flow, N mineralization, and responses to nutrient additions, and have made presentations at the summer Hubbard Brook Cooperators meetings.

Many of the students devoted enough time to the project to earn a college credit. The students processed root samples from various soil depths, sorted leaf litter by species, evaluated herbivory by insects and counted maple leaf skeletonizers (found while sorting litter), analyzed soils, identified snails, built sap flow sensors, and learned to do data entry and analysis.
