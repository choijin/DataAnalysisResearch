<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of providing seamless, integrated querying over multiple&lt;br/&gt;interrelated sources of information has been plaguing the database,&lt;br/&gt;information management, information retrieval, and artificial&lt;br/&gt;intelligence research communities for decades. There have been&lt;br/&gt;successful lines of research addressing specific components of the&lt;br/&gt;data integration problem, and large "one-off" systems have been built&lt;br/&gt;that successfully integrate specific information sources in specific&lt;br/&gt;domains. However, a completely general solution to the data&lt;br/&gt;integration problem is thought not to be realizable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is developing a new type of information integration&lt;br/&gt;system that is both novel and realizable. It is based on the following&lt;br/&gt;premises and components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) The system provides a general data integration solution targeted&lt;br/&gt;for a certain type of environment: when multiple sources have joining,&lt;br/&gt;overlapping, and potentially conflicting information about the same or&lt;br/&gt;closely related real-world entities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) The system permits and exploits uncertainty as an integral part of&lt;br/&gt;data integration: Uncertainty may be present in source data, source&lt;br/&gt;schemata, the integration process, integrated schemata, and integrated&lt;br/&gt;data. In fact, uncertainty can play a key role successful information&lt;br/&gt;integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) The system relies on general-purpose entity-resolution as a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental building block of the integration process and the&lt;br/&gt;integrated information. Furthermore, the system retains both the&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty and the lineage associated with the entity-resolution&lt;br/&gt;process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) The system incorporates powerful lineage capabilities, tracking&lt;br/&gt;where, when, and how data was produced, how it has evolved over time,&lt;br/&gt;and how it has been combined and manipulated as part of the&lt;br/&gt;integration process. Lineage is used to enhance the integration&lt;br/&gt;process, and it is offered to the end-user in a variety of forms for&lt;br/&gt;data understanding and conflict-resolution purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on the project can be found at the project web&lt;br/&gt;page: http://infolab.stanford.edu/udi/&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
