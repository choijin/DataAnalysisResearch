<AbstractNarration>Peter Pulay of the University of Arkansas and Michel Dupuis of Washington State University are supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to develop methods that extend the current limits of applicability of electronic structure methods in two currently difficult research areas.  They are developing algorithms to reduce the computational cost of ab initio based QM/MM (quantum/molecular mechanics) Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics free energy calculations of molecules electronically embedded in a medium (solvent or protein matrix) by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, they are working on a method that replaces atom-centered basis functions for the diffuse part of the electron density by plane waves in accurate quantum calculations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software and algorithms originated by these scientists have become widely adopted by the community. Pulay and Dupuis are exploiting  the educational possibilities of computer modeling  through graphical computer simulations. These ideas are implemented in a three week course being presented to undergraduates at several colleges and universities including an Historically Black University.</AbstractNarration>

We have developed a computer program which is improves the speed of the most widely used method for accurate QM/MM computer simulation of molecules in solutions by about four orders of magnitude (10,000 times or more) by eliminating quantum calculations in the simulation. The main idea is to precalculate the response of the QM system (the solute) to the electric field generated by the solvent, instead of carrying out a quantum calculation (other interactions, like Pauli repulsion and dispersion attraction, are highly localized and can be included at low cost, in contrast with the long-range Coulomb force).

Without second-order (polarization) contributions, absolute energies have rather large errors (~5-6 kcal/mol) with a broad distribution. Our method has negligible errors.  Achieving such efficiency and accuracy will undoubtedly have a significant effect on QM/MM simulations, particularly for enzyme reactions.
