<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to address the critical issues of throughput, repeatability, scalability, and limited functionality of probe-based nanofabrication by designing, fabricating, and testing a novel active cantilever probe with an automated ability to interchange probe tips (tools). Probe-based fabrication enables unmatched spatial/feature resolution and the ability to assemble and pattern hybrid (inorganic and organic) device architectures. However, practical nanofabrication with probe tips is limited by the issues of throughput, tip wear, tip chemical cross contamination, and scalability  all of which act to decrease the quality, reliability, and efficiency of probe-based fabrication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique nano probe system addresses these issues by enabling automated interchanging of probe tips. By simply switching tips, the probe can be used for nano deposition, patterning, machining, metrology, and various other nanofabrication processes. Located at the distal end of an SPM cantilever is an electrically activated MEMS-based microgripper, which is designed to automatically load/unload tips from an array of modular probe tips (tools). Automation is achieved using a novel control scheme to determine the relative location between the microgripper and tool tip. This research will contribute new knowledge via feasibility studies of (1) active cantilevers for SPM probe-based fabrication and (2) thermal-proximity sensing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This system is a nanoscale analog of macroscale computer numerical control (CNC) manufacturing machines that have the ability for fully-automated rapid tool changes without operator interruption. The ability to provide fully automated on-demand probe tip changes will improve the overall efficiency of probe-based nanofabrication, allow for multifunctional probe capabilities, and improve process reliability and quality by enabling the ability to replenish/replace worn or chemically fouled tips in an efficient manner. In addition, this research program will broaden participation of underrepresented students in engineering by providing training for undergraduate and graduate students in nanotechnology, participation of underrepresented students through recruitment and support of graduate research assistants and mentoring of undergraduate researchers, and outreach to K-12 schools in the greater Richmond area through a unique "Nano Day at VCU" event. Additionally, the proposed research will be integrated into the mechanical engineering curriculum by creating teaching modules in nanoscale control systems, sensing, and probe-based nanofabrication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
