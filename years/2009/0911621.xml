<AbstractNarration>Professor Daniel A. Scherson of Case Western Reserve University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the mechanism of heterogeneous redox reactions associated with the reduction and oxidation of nitrogen and sulfur oxides and their oxyanions in aqueous electrolytes, as well as other redox active species of relevance to energy conversion and electrosynthesis. Special focus is on the in situ static and dynamic characterization of irreversibly adsorbed electrocatalysts for these reactions, as well as the effect of the microtopography of selected bare and atom-modified single crystal metal surfaces on the nature of adsorbed intermediates and other interfacial properties. Insight into these issues will be gained from coupling of microelectrodes, charge injection, and an array of complementary microscope-based spectroscopic techniques, including UV visible reflection spectroscopy, resonance and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopies and second harmonic generation. The success of this work would provide a means for extending in situ spectroelectrochemical techniques into the nanosecond range, allowing the study of the dynamic aspects of electron transfer events of relevance to a variety of other fields, including electrocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion, sensors, and environmental science. Students involved in this research will be trained in a broad range of fundamental and applied disciplines, and will be exposed to an international research experience at the Central Electrochemical Research Institute in India.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Human activity during this past centuy has led to complex environmental problems which unless properly addressed will impact adversely life on earth as we know it today. In addition to global warming, which is derived primarily from the continuous burning of fossil fuels and natural gas, the invention of artificial methods for the production of fertilizers has led to imbalances in the nitrogen cycle leading to the accumulation of nitrate in lakes and rivers which over time contribute to the development of dead zones.  Electrochemistry affords, in principle, viable means for mitigating some of these problems by converting nitrate ions into dinitrogen which can be safely released to the atmosphere. This process is highly complicated as it involves the transfer of ten electrons and can generate rather inert intermediate species such as nitrous oxide which has a warming potential more than two orders of magnitude higher than carbon dioxide. This work focused on search for electrocatalysts with the required potency and specificity to carry out the entire process with optimum faradaic efficiency. As such it hinged  critically on the development and refinement of in situ, quantitative, spectroscopic and structural methods of the highest sensitivity, specificity, and temporal resolution. Equally important are advances in theory, both in terms of the analysis and interpretation of experimental data, as a guide toward the design of novel electrocatalytic materials, as well as measurement techniques. The sections below outline the major research accomplishments resulting from this NSF supported project.  Rational Design of Electrocatalytic Interfaces - An electrode incorporating two distinct heterogeneous electrocatalysts acting in series was specifically designed to promote the reduction of nitrate beyond the nitrite stage in weakly buffered aqueous solutions (pH=3) containing Cd2+. This novel interface consists of Au nanoparticles, Au(np), on which underpotentially deposited Cd reduces nitrate predominantly to nitrite, dispersed on a hemin-modified glassy carbon (GC) surface, Hm|GC, where nitrite is further reduced to yield hydroxylamine as the only detected product (Figure A).  The Oxidation of Hydroxylamine on Gold Electrodes in Aqueous Electrolytes - In situ infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) were employed to examine the oxidation of hydroxylamine on Au electrodes in aqueous buffered solutions over the range 1 &ndash; 7 Two distinct spectral features were observed at potentials , E, within the range in which hydroxylamine oxidation was found to ensue, attributed to adsorbed nitrite and adsorbed NO2 (Figure B). In situ infrared measurements provided evidence for N2O being produced at the same onset potential of NH2OH oxidation (Figure C). In related studies the onset potential for the reaction on Au(100) is more negative, and the current in the region of small overpotentials is higher than for Au(110) and Au(111) regardless of the pH of the solution.   Electrocatalysis at Microelectrodes - The influence of the shape of individual electrocatalytically active, axisymmetric particles supported on an inactive substrate, on the current associated with heterogeneous redox reactions involving solution-phase species was examined theoretically. Analyses of arrays of electrocatalytically active disks embedded in a planar inactive support revealed that values of ilim very close to those expected for fully catalytic surfaces could be achieved for disk coverages on the order of 1%.   Novel Techniques   1. A probe beam deflection method that allows for the heat generated or absorbed during an interfacial process to be determined in situ was developed using a collimated laser beam propagating parallel to the interface through the back of a flat, optically transparent ZnSe crystal that supports a very thin film of a metal electrode in contact with the electrolyte solution (Figure D).
