<AbstractNarration>Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S., with most cases acquired from blacklegged ticks. These ticks are found throughout the eastern U.S., yet 93% of LD cases occur in ten states found in the Northeast and Upper Midwest.  Various explanations have been proposed for the puzzling absence of LD in some areas where blacklegged ticks occur, but no agreement has been reached. The absence of an explanation contributes to uncertainty and confusion felt by citizens and healthcare providers faced with expanding tick populations in many parts of the U.S.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team represents five universities as well as national and international governmental agencies. They have a strong commitment to disseminating research findings to scientists, public health agencies, land managers, and the public.  They will test three key hypotheses concerning LD distribution using field, laboratory, and computer modeling studies.  Data on tick-host relationships, tick seasonal biology, and tick genetics will be collected from field sites in four widely-separated regions of the eastern U.S.  Application of modeling and molecular tools will reveal the ecological and evolutionary processes responsible for the variation in LD risk in different regions of the U.S., as well as help predict how climate change could alter this risk.  Furthermore, this improved understanding of factors determining the distribution and abundance of infected ticks will assist in human disease diagnosis and treatment, tick control measures, and public education on regional differences in the risk of LD and other tick-borne disease.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes and Findings Report     Overall: This study involved expertise from a team of PIs from five universities and with affiliations to national and international governmental agencies. The lead P.I. was an Asian-American female and one co-investigator is a female from a smaller university with a large African-American student body. A post-doctoral scholar, two doctoral, five masters, and &gt;30 undergraduate students received specific training within the project.  The scientific and public health outcomes include improved understanding of the spatial distribution and abundance of infected LD ticks, especially in the South, which will assist in human disease diagnosis, vector management, and public education regarding regional variation in risk of LD and other tick-borne disease.     Burke Lab  This project greatly enhanced my interest in and commitment to the educational and public health benefits of this research topic.  I have incorporated many aspects of these findings into my undergraduates and graduate classes, thus disseminating findings to &gt;200 students in classes such as general ecology and disease ecology.     Through this project I have trained 2 MS students (Kerr and Ross) for whom this project was the main focus of their research, 2 MS students (Duchak and Kanonik) who worked on this project secondarily, 2 BS students (Anicito and Damiris) and one high school student (Stewart).  Kerr presented her results as a poster at the 2012 meetings of the Ecological Society of America, and Ross will present her results at the 2014 meeting of The Wildlife Society.  Anicito presented her results in an Undergraduate Research Day (Hofstra University May 2011) and Damiris will do the same in May 2014.  Stewart prepared a poster on her work for the Long Island Science and Engineering Fair (Feb 2014) and won first place as a local LISEF finalist, she is advancing on to International Science and Engineering Fair (May 2014).  This project integrated cutting-edge molecular techniques with field ecology and provide Hofstra university students, which are generally only experienced with urban settings, with an opportunity for field ecology/wildlife experience.     Participation of underrepresented groups  Of the Burke lab students involved in this project, the majority of the graduate students (3/4), half of the undergraduate students (1/2) and the high school student are female.      Enhancing infrastructure for research and education  This study leveraged expertise from multiple disciplines at six universities in the U.S. and Canada. The PIs all work in or are affiliated with universities that collectively cover a spectrum from highly research-oriented to a primary focus on their teaching mission.  As a co-P.I. from a medium-sized primarily undergraduate institution, I especially benefited from collaboration with colleagues from more research-based institutions.      Dissemination  In addition to the conferences and poster day events described above, I was an invited speaker at Savanah River Ecology Laboratory (July 2013) to speak on my involvement in this project.  There will be additional opportunities for outreach through professional activities such as conference attendance, as well as specific efforts initiated by the PIs.  My home institution disseminated this project in several ways.  They made a major news release http://www.hofstra.edu/home/news/pressreleases/archive/092309_lymediseasestudy.html and http://www.hofstra.edu/alumni/hofmagazine/hofmag_w10_dep_facnews.html which resulted in interviews with me by local newspapers.  I was invited to submit an article for Hofstra Horizons, the UniversityÆs Journal of research (Burke and Kerr 2013 http://www.hofstra.edu/about/administration/provost/hofhrz/hofhrz_spring2013_burkekerr.html).     Benefits to society  This study will enhance understanding of the processes leading to the patterns in distribution and abundance of the LD pathogen, particularly in the South.
