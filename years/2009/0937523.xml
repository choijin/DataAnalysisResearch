<AbstractNarration>This project will support US researchers' active involvement in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) project, one of the National Major Scientific Projects of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Construction of the LAMOST facility is complete, and the telescope is undergoing engineering tests. The principal investigator, with previous NSF support, has established close collaborative ties with the Chinese leadership of the project, and has been a member of the working group tasked with defining the Galactic survey, one of two major projects to be undertaken in LAMOST's initial years of operation. Funding of this project will permit establishment of a partnership between US astronomers and LAMOST. This partnership will formalize participation in the Galactic survey and guarantee the ability of US researchers who join the PLUS collaboration to propose and be PIs on 10% of LAMOST key projects, and to have early access to data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project produced high impact scientific results through a collaboration between US and Chinese astronomers interested in better understanding our Milky Way galaxy, using data obtained from the 4-meter class Chinese Guoshoujing Telescope (formerly named the Large Area Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope; LAMOST).  As a result of this collaboration, 16 Chinese scholars traveled to the US to work with US astronomers on Milky Way science, and US astronomers contributed to the design of the LAMOST spectroscopic survey of Milky Way stars.  Nine US astronomers were granted the same rights to use data from the LAMOST spectroscopic survey as our Chinese colleagues enjoy, based on their technical and scientific contributions to the Chinese survey.  The head of this project (Heidi Jo Newberg) was named as the head of the Key Project to map the substructure of the Milky Way stellar halo; the substructure is formed by small galaxies falling into the Milky Way and being ripped apart by the Milky Way gravity so that the small galaxies' stars are pulled out into long streams and are then incorporated into our galaxy.  At the completion of this project, a total of 5,755,126 spectra,  of which 3,177,995 are spectra of Milky Way stars with sufficient quality to measure the properties of the stars, are available to the collaboration in Data Release 3 (DR3). In addition, preliminary versions of the data from an additional half year of observing are available, bringing  the total number of spectra to 6,988,109 (3,914,349 quality spectra of stars). Many of these are repeated observations of the same  object, so that of the total of ~3.9 million spectra of stars, a total of  roughly 3.1 million individual stars have been observed.  This project introduced 14 undergraduate students to astronomy research for the first time.  Many of these students have gone on to successful graduate school careers; some went directly to STEM employment and others are still undergraduate students.  It also partially supported two high school research projects.  One of the high school students was named a finalist in the Intel Science Talent Search 2013 and is now studying astronomy in college.  The grant contributed to the publication of 36 research papers published in refereed journals.  These papers described the Chinese LAMOST survey, measured the properties of the stars in the Milky Way's disk and in star streams in the halo, cataloged unusual stars in our galaxy, and developed techniques for better astronomical calibrations.  Below we describe the results four noteworthy papers from this list.  The paper "LAMOST Experiment for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (LEGUE) &mdash; The survey's science plan" by Deng et al. (2012) described the data that was taken with the Guoshoujing Telescope.  It was co-authored by the members of the US and Chinese collaboration, and it won the RAA Excellent Paper Award as one of the most highly cited papers in 2015.  The paper "Substructure in Bulk Velocities of Milky Way Disk Stars," by Carlin et al. (2013) used LAMOST spectroscopic survey data to show that there is previously unknown substructure in the velocities of stars in the Milky Way disk.  In particular the stars in our local neighborhood appear to be moving closer to each other (a compression wave), showing that the structure of the disk is not a simple as previously though, and changes with time.  The first author, Jeff Carlin, is a postdoctoral researcher supported completely by this grant.  The paper "Rings and Radial Waves in the Disk of the Milky Way," by Xu et al. (2015), showed that the plane of the Milky Way disk is not flat as previously thought, but is instead rippled like a corrugated roof.  This ripple is believed to be caused by the gravitational force of small galaxies in orbit around our galaxy making wavelike patterns in the disk.  This dynamic process could be related to the creation of spiral structure in galaxies.  This result was listed #59 on Discovery Magazine's list of the top 100 science stories from 2015.  The first author was a Chinese visiting scholar working under Prof. Newberg at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  The paper "The First Hypervelocity Star from the LAMOST Survey," by Zheng et al. (2014) identifies a Milky Way star moving at a speed of over a million miles per hour.  These very fast stars might tell us about the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, or help map the mysterious dark matter thought to surround our galaxy.  The first author of this paper is Prof. Zheng from the University of Utah.  The publication of this result also attracted the attention of the worldwide press.
