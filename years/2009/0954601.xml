<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber-physical systems comprising hardware interacting with control and computational units are omnipresent in our lives from high-tech cars to smart infrastructure. The tight interaction between analog and discrete dynamics gives rise to complex verification and synthesis problems. The challenge of synthesizing correct-by-design controllers for these systems remains daunting. This proposal presents an ambitious research agenda dedicated to fundamentally and holistically addressing this challenge. Specifically, we propose to develop a unifying framework built around the use of finite state automata as nominal models of both physical and computing processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research addresses fundamental problems at the interface of control theory, computer science and mathematics, potentially leading to transformative breakthroughs. Anticipated theoretical contributions include understanding the fundamental limitations of using finite memory models to approximate infinite memory systems, and developing analytical methods for establishing both a priori and a posteriori error bounds. Anticipated algorithmic contributions include developing efficient recursive schemes for constructing the approximate models as well as efficient techniques for solving specific combinatorial optimization problems. Finally, it is the hope that the ubiquitous problem of scalability can be finally overcome through the combined use of theoretical and algorithmic developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research project would result in a computer-aided approach for systematically synthesizing cyber-physical systems in a verifiably correct manner, a freely distributed collection of software toolboxes, and a carefully crafted set of benchmark problems that can be used to evaluate and guide further research progress. The proposed research will drive the development of a new curriculum for undergraduate control education employing finite state automata as vehicles for introducing advanced control concepts. The research results will be incorporated in the development of a new graduate level course and manuscript on hybrid systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work laid theoretical foundations for systematically designing controllers for systems that involve software and hardware, using an approach in which both software and hardware are modeled and represented similarly as finite state machines, allowing one to systematically reason about their behavior and interactions.  The research examined various questions such as: How does one generate approximate finite state machine representations? How does one do it efficiently? How does one quantify the modeling error? Under what conditions is this representation an exact one? If it isn't, what does one lose by using it to design the control system? How can one use such representations to model fairly complex systems and still be able to provide guarantees about the outcome?  Specific technical outcomes of the research included:  - Motivating and proposing new notions of output observabilty for systems over finite alphabets, opening up new avenues of exploration for this class of systems.  - Developing topological conditions for characterizing existence of uniform bisimulations for classes of systems, thereby proposing new directions for this relatively mature area of study.  - Developing various approaches for improving scalability of approximation algorithms.  - Approaches for exploiting algebraic structure to improve scalability of underlyng optimization problems.  This research was incorporated into both undergraduate and graduate classes, was disseminated in multiple peer reviewed publications, and was presented at multiple conferences and workshops. Several graduate students were trained through their participation in this research program.       Last Modified: 10/24/2017       Submitted by: Danielle C Tarraf]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
