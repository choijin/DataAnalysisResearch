<AbstractNarration>This project contributes to the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM)  Focus Group on the early stages of the onset of a magnetospheric substorm.  It will systematically analyze the plasma instabilities of the pre-onset, near-Earth plasmasheet substorm events.  The plasma sheet conditions will be reconstructed using magnetohydrodynamic simulations with the OpenGGCM MHD code.  Once the plasmasheet configuration is known, it will be possible to examine the stability of the configuration to macroscale instabilities such as ballooning, kink, and tearing modes. Both analytical eigenvalue methods and MHD simulations will be used in the stability analysis. The project will examine the signatures and consequences of the plasma instabilities and compare the results with observations made by the NASA THEMIS mission. The linear and early nonlinear instabilities of the plasmasheet during substorm growth phase are the keys to understanding the initial stage of the substorm expansion onset. The accuracy of the stability analyses relies on the detailed knowledge of the plasma sheet configuration model. THEMIS substorm observations will provide more input conditions and constraints that will enable the OpenGGCM simulation to reconstruct a sequence of accurate and realistic plasma sheet configurations during the substorm growth phase. The stability analysis will help resolve many remaining controversies on the onset process and bring in new perspectives on the substorm onset problem. The project will help provide quantitative interpretation of THEMIS substorm events, and will bridge the gap between theory, analysis and observations.</AbstractNarration>

First time mapping between auroral finger structure and the onset of ballooning instability in the near-Earth magnetotail from global MHD simulation of a realistic substorm event.  To find the possible potential footprints of the magnetotail ballooning instability as well as their evolution in pre-onset auroral structures, a time sequence of ballooning instability structures obtained in the global MHD simulation of the realistic THEMIS substorm event as described in the previous achievement, are mapped along the magnetic field lines to the ionosphere region. The resulting pattern is the expected pattern of ionospheric emissions caused by the ballooning mode through magnetotail-ionosphere coupling.  The morphology of the ionospheric signatures is very peculiar. First, the spacing of the "beads"  is approximately 2.2 degrees in longitude. This compares very well to auroral images, both from the ground and from space. Each wave crest is not simply a spot, but elongated in latitude, thus forming small streaks.

First time demonstration of ballooning instability-induced plasmoid formation process in the near-Earth plasma sheet from MHD simulations.  The formation of plasmoids in the near-Earth magnetotail is believed to be a key element of the substorm onset process.
