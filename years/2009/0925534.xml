<AbstractNarration>Objective: The motivation for the proposed research comes from the brain, where nonlinear dynamics are believed to be at the heart of computation, signal processing and control. The brain suggests that nonlinear dynamics and control have a robust, synergistic relationship.  This proposal offers an integrated research program for the fundamental limitations and robustness analysis of nonlinear systems with control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit derives from the proposed unified framework for fundamental limitations and robustness analysis of nonlinear feedback systems. A variety of system theoretic problems can be cast within the proposed framework, which can lead to transformative advances in the fundamental understanding of nonlinear dynamics in brain functions. The project will develop algorithms and software for model reduction, enunciation of control architectures that are best suited to exploit synergies between nonlinear dynamics and control and development of software tools for modeling the neural circuits in the brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The theoretical aspects of the proposed research address fundamental limitations in control of nonlinear systems, which have broad applicability. The brain itself offers a unique paradigm that can lead to novel ways to leverage nonlinear dynamics in current and future engineering applications. In addition the research plan is closely integrated with an educational plan. Several educational initiatives will help disseminate the methods, outcomes and the interdisciplinary synergies. This project seeks to develop a strong undergraduate involvement in research, interdisciplinary outreach activities, exposure to the central role of dynamics and control and to foster symbiotic relationships between university research and the industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are two major outcomes that resulted from this NSF award:(i) Development of methods and algorithms for control of nonlinear systems and (ii) a new startup aimed at commercializing some of the research findings.    The theoretical outcomes included fundamental performance limitations in feedback  control of nonlinear systems; methods and algorithms for model reduction of large scale Markov chains; information theoretic metrics for robustness analysis; and feedback particle filter algorithm for nonlinear filtering.  These research results were disseminated through four journal papers, several conference presentations.  For the theoretical work, PI's students received two Best Paper Awards at the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control.  PI along with his graduate student Adam Tilton co-founded Rithmio, a startup based in Chicago.  Rithmio's achievements been widely covered in media. Rithmio won the prestigious  COZAD competition at the University of Illinois awarded on an annual  basis to the best new student-led startup on the UIUC campus.  The award also helped supported Ph.D. work of three graduate students at the University of Illinois; provided research opportunities for 10 undergraduate students; helped PI develop a new graduate course at the University of Illinois.  Two of the students, Yu Sun and Tao Yang, supported by the grant are employed at the Siemens Research Center and the GE research center, respectively.  Another student, Adam Tilton, is running his startup Rithmio.         Last Modified: 10/10/2014       Submitted by: Prashant Mehta]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
