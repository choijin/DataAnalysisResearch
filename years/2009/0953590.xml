<AbstractNarration>Career: Multiscale Stochastic Simulation for Complex Biochemical Systems with Visualization Tools&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop efficient simulation techniques for stochastic biochemical models, particularly the cell cycle model. Cell cycle is the sequence of events whereby a living cell replicates its components and divides them between two daughter cells, so that each daughter has the information and machinery necessary to repeat the process. Cell cycle is related to many diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating cell cycle is a major challenge of contemporary cell biology. Biologists have developed complex mathematical models of cell-cycle control in budding yeast, fission yeast, and mammalian cells. These systems are so complex that its simulation and analysis present great challenges to computational science. The career goal of the PI is to address these challenges by developing innovative computational methods and rigorous mathematical theories to integrate the full gamut of continuous, discrete, deterministic, and stochastic models, and support dynamic, seamless and automatic switching between different models and algorithms as dictated by the scales of underlying problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on three specific aims in this project. The primary aim is to develop innovative computational algorithms and mathematical theories about a critical multiscale challenge: stiffness. This project will develop the theory of the stiffness in discrete stochastic simulation of chemically reacting systems and an automatic stiffness detection algorithm through a running-time profile analysis. The second aim is to develop hybrid algorithms to simulate biological systems with multistate species, a special challenge in biological systems with multiple binding sites. This project will develop hybrid methods to combine particle-based methods, designed for multistate species, and population-based methods, designed for general chemical reactions.  The third aim of this project is to develop algorithm and model visualization tools to introduce the algorithms and model development in computational biology to graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms developed in this project will enable biologists to efficiently model and simulate multiscale systems and will directly benefit the whole research discipline of systems biology. Moreover, the techniques about the stiffness are also applicable to multiscale simulation of complex systems in other areas. This research project also provides learning opportunities and training for students across the disciplines of computer science, mathematics, and biology. The biological models and simulation methods will be introduced in graduate courses on computational cell biology. The algorithm visualization tool will help students understand the important computational concept of stiffness. The model visualization tool and results related to the cell cycle model will be used in undergraduate research and education in Virginia Tech and Radford University, through collaboration with a professor in the Mathematics department at Radford University. This collaboration will help to attract more women and minority students into computational science areas.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Complex biological systems often exhibit multi-scale features: The systems incorporate a variety of physical processes or subsystems across a broad range of scales. A typical multiscale system may require scales with macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic kinetics, deterministic and stochastic dynamics, continuous and discrete state space, fast-scale and slow-scale reactions, and species of large and small populations. These complex features present great challenges for the simulation.&nbsp; The PI aims to answer these challenges by developing theories and algorithms for adaptive simulation using the full gamut of continuous, discrete, deterministic, and stochastic models, and supporting dynamic, automatic switching between different models and algorithms as dictated by the scale regime (as shown in Figure 1), based on rigorous numerical analysis.</p> <p>There were three specific aims for this project: i) to develop computational theories and algorithms for stiff problems in biochemical systems and mechanisms to automatically switch among stochastic simulation methods suitable for different scales, ii) to design hybrid methods to simulate biochemical systems with multistate species, and iii) to develop algorithm and model visualization tools and apply them in graduate and undergraduate education.&nbsp;</p> <p>During the six year period, we have made great progress towards the three goals. A main contribution is to categorize the stochastic simulation methods based on two scales (populations of species and firing frequencies of reactions). In the preliminary work before the project, we had analyzed the efficiency and accuracy of Gillespie&rsquo;s stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), the tau-leaping methods and developed the slow-scale SSA method (with collaboration with Gillespie). In this project, we gave detailed profile for these methods corresponding to different problem scales (as shown in Figure 2). Based on our analysis, our later focus was put on the hybrid ODE/SSA method, in which we proposed to simulate all dynamics related to genes and mRNAs through the SSA and the rest through ODEs. We analyzed the efficiency and accuracy of this method, proposed efficient implementation of this method, and applied it to the modeling of the budding yeast cell cycle control mechanism. During the project period, we had 18 peer-reviewed journal papers and more than ten conference papers published with support from this grant. In these publications, we developed a series of algorithms, models and analysis for multiscale and multistate stochastic systems and simulations. In order to make our work more accessible by the community, two of our algorithms have been incorporated into the widely used biological modeling and simulation package COPASI.</p> <p>Besides that, we have studied methods particularly designed for multistate systems. A new cell cycle model based on multiple-sites phosphorylation (Figure 3) was developed using our methods. &nbsp;The error analysis of the hybrid method is motivated by the development of this new model. Moreover, we have applied the algorithms to the mathematical modeling and visualization of by far the most complete model for the budding yeast cell cycle control mechanism. So far as we know, our stochastic model is the best stochastic model for budding yeast cell cycle control mechanism. as it achieved great matches (Figure 4, 5 and 6) with experimental data published in literature or obtained through collaboration with experimental biologists. Moreover, the simulation and development of the stochastic models have become very efficient. In our previous model, it took days to perform the simulation. Now the simulation only takes about 5 minutes for each run. This enable us to run tests against 131 mutant cases reported by experimental biologists in literature. Without the methods developed in this project, this achievement is almost impossible.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last
