<AbstractNarration>This research project focuses on how awardees in NSF's Innovation through Institution Integration activity ("I3") operationalize the meaning of "institutional integration" and "innovation" and seeks to quantify the nature and evolution of these campus-wide collaborative networks.  The project examines the extent to which changes occur in activities (planning, budgeting, scheduling, evaluating), organizational/social identity (identification with a single NSF program/and or group of people working on a grant as opposed to identification with NSF efforts more broadly and the people engaged in the work), and mental models or schema (shared cognition about the nature of the problem, what needs to be addressed, and appropriate strategies for addressing them).  This work is also looking at the extent to which the selection of particular themes identified in the I3 solicitation and around which projects must build integration - broadening participation, critical educational junctures, globally engaged workforce, integration of research and education, and research and evaluation - appear to affect project outcomes and success.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methodologically, the project employs two complementary approaches, Social Network Analysis (SNA) and case studies, to examine institutional integration of NSF programs.  SNA, a methodology that has only recently been applied to educational issues, provides a new way to study the interactions among individuals from disparate NSF programs within an I3 institution.  The research project studies networks as they are implicit in a wide range of social phenomena, and can provide an important perspective on the I3 activity and the partnerships that are so central to it.  The guiding assumption in the logic of SNA applications is that the overall structure of a network has consequences not only for its individual members, but also for the group, community, and institutional culture.  Therefore, SNA provides a tool for describing and assessing the quality of relations among people and understanding the pattern of connections.  To create a more comprehensive picture of not only the "what" but also the "why," the research includes case studies of I3 projects.  These studies are developed from 3-day site visits to the I3 projects by a multidisciplinary team composed of content (institutional change, organizational development) and evaluation experts, and include key informant interviews with individuals directly or indirectly involved with the project and review of documents.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Reacting to concerns that colleges and universities in the United States may not be adequately preparing students for careers in the STEM subjects, the National Science Foundation has instituted a number of programs aimed at enhancing postsecondary education.  These programs have two primary aims:increasing the quality of STEM education for all students and encouraging the participation of groups that have typically been underrepresented in STEM fields.     The Innovation Through Institutional Integration (!-Cubed) initiative was developed in 2008 to assist colleges and universities to create a more integrated approach to their STEM programs.  The initiative provided supports to institutions to integrate and cross-fertilize their STEM programs.  While NSF was clear about the goals it wished to see achieved, how these goals were to be achieved was left to the institutions themselves. Paths included courses changes, development of new courses and programs, enhanced outreach activities, revisions of policies, and creation of new structures and infrastructure to support communication and increased interaction across organizationally separate units.     The grant, Investigating Institutional Integration and Innovation in NSF's I-Cubed Activity, was designed to study the changes occurring at a purposeful sample of grantee institutions and develop an understanding of factors influencing the change process and its outcomes.  The study followed six grantees for five years, chronicling hos they approached the integration process, what changes occurred, and the challenges they needed to overcome.  Data collection involved review of extant documents,tow to three two-day site visits to the institutions, and surveys of participants to gather data on their interactions and relationships with other staff and how these  interactions and relationships changed over time (social network analysis).     We found the following:  Successfully changing IHEs requires a multi-dimensional orientation. Successful change does not emerge from a focus on a single aspect of the institution but must address multiple aspects of the institution at the same time.  These multiple aspects may be units or levels with the institution and/or the characteristics of institutions and the individuals within them. To understand institutional change, attention needs to be paid to external pressures or norms as well as internal ones. These external pressures can take a number of forms, including state policies or budget decisions, as well as standards set by perceived institutional peer groups.  A key external pressure found in our work is the NSF grant itself. This grant, although modest in size, was found to legitimize and add status to the change process. The history of the particular institution must be considered. It is not only the current context that shapes the change process, but also its past. History includes how the institution has evolved to its current status, how STEM reform has been successfully (or unsuccessfully) approached in the past, which individuals and units have been in the forefront of change, and what mistakes have posed barriers to previous efforts. Relationships are critical mediators in the change process. These may be formal relationships in the institutional structure, as well as less formal relationships that may often fly below the radar. Leadership is essential, but where the leadership comes from may vary. Further, both actual and symbolic leadership needs to be considered. We found in our work that symbolic leadership, i.e., having the Provost, Dean, or university President on the banner as the project's leader contributed significantly to the seriousness with which reform effort was taken. There is no one size fits all. What is effective in one situation may not be effective in another situation. The path to successful reform is not as simple as choosing a "best practice" and putting it in place. How and whether a change can be put in place must consider local conditions.      While a number of recent studies have identified factors similar to the ones cited above, there is a major difference between the emphasis in many of these contemporary studies and the principles emerging from our work. Our work emphasizes the importance of local context in identifying what is to be changed, as well as how change will be pursued. We suggest that more attention needs to be paid to the strategic identification of the optimal driver(s) of change, based on historical, as well as contemporary, characteristics of the culture and environment. Before deciding whether the path to change is through a new organizational unit, a new information sharing tool, or a new approach to course design and instruction, change agents must also consider institutional context, both internal and external, as well as past and present, to be maximally effective.
