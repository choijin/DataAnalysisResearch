<AbstractNarration>Daytona State College is adapting and implementing a series of best practices for recruitment and retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) associate of arts (AA) programs. The goal is to expand the talent and diversity of students entering and completing STEM degree programs. The STEM Community Scholars Program is motivating and recruiting graduating high school students and first-year college students to pursue STEM degrees by providing services that support participants' academic success, including setting high expectations, continual and intrusive academic advising, strong social ties, financial assistance, and transfer assistance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program strategies are helping students learn to be successful in STEM fields. The focus of the project is increasing enrollment in STEM programs; impacting graduation rates both in the program and across the STEM disciplines; assisting students in applying to STEM baccalaureate programs; and comprehensively evaluating the selected strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is serving nearly 300 students over five years. Underrepresented groups in STEM fields are being recruited to broaden the diversity in STEM fields. The project team consists of educators who are committed to ensuring the success of the students and institutionalizing the strategies and activities that are most successful.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[July 2010, Daytona State College was awarded a five-year STEM Talent Expansion Program (STEP) Grant from the National Science Foundation in the amount of $864,639 to support the STEM Community Scholars Program. A one-year no-cost extension was approved and the program ended on June 30, 2016. The program was designed to increase the number and diversity of students entering STEM disciplines by addressing barriers to retention, persistence, and completion in STEM fields. The program created an intensive learning community for students in STEM associate programs by integrating a series of best practices: high expectations, continual and intrusive academic advising, strong social ties through academic opportunities, extracurricular activities, financial assistance, transfer assistance.    The program has recruited and served STEM AA and AS degree-seeking students, and enrollment, graduation, transfer figures reflect both populations of students. Objective 1: Increase enrollment in STEM associate programs by 50 students (4%) annually. Outcome 1: The average increase in enrollment in STEM associate programs annually was 19% over the six-year period. Objective 2: Impact graduation rates in the program and across the college. a) Support at least a 70% graduation rate among participants. b) Increase the number of students obtaining STEM degrees by 20% annually beginning year two. Outcome 2: a) Resulted in a 63% graduation rate amongst participants. b) There were no increases of students obtaining STEM degrees annually between years 2-5; however, in year 6 there was an increase in enrollment of 16%. Objective 3: Assist 80% of participants in applying to a STEM-field baccalaureate program. Outcome 3: Assisted 58% of participants in applying to a STEM-field baccalaureate program. Objective 4: Institutionalize five strategies by the conclusion of the program. Outcome 4:  Five strategies were identified by the program team and Internal Advisory Committee to become institutionalized post-funding. They include:  One-on-one STEM mentoring;  STEM-focused Student Success Course (SLS1122) sections;  Computer science courses for dual-enrollment students at a local high school engineering academy;  Organizing internship and externship opportunities for STEM students through the Career Center; The continuation of the STEM Expo annually.  Objective 5: Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the strategies implemented in this program and produce a thorough summative evaluation report. Outcome 5:  Semi-annual and annual evaluation reports were completed in Years 1-6 and submitted to the National Science Foundation.  359 students were served by the program since inception, 246 students met the participation requirements and were stipend-eligible between spring 2011-spring 2016. Scholars earned 194 degrees/certificates while enrolled at Daytona State College, and 90 students continued their studies at the baccalaureate level.
