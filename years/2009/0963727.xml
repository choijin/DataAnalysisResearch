<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes an undergraduate summer school in mathematical logic,&lt;br/&gt;to be held at UCLA in summer 2010. The goals of the summer school are&lt;br/&gt;to introduce promising undergraduate students to graduate level material&lt;br/&gt;in mathematical logic, including central results and research techniques; ac-&lt;br/&gt;commodate a wide spectrum of experience with mathematical logic, ranging&lt;br/&gt;from students who have very little experience with the area to students who&lt;br/&gt;have already taken advanced courses in their home institutions; improve the&lt;br/&gt;students? mathematical problem solving skills; and encourage them to pursue graduate studies in mathematics. One such summer school had already&lt;br/&gt;been held, in 2009, with great success. The proposed school will continue&lt;br/&gt;the same innovative format, and build on the publicity and reach generated&lt;br/&gt;by the 2009 summer school to ensure continued success.</AbstractNarration>
