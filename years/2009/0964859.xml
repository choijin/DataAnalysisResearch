<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  Genes are the fundamental unit of biological information.  Most genes are discrete segments of DNA which are "expressed" by being used as the templates for RNA production (a process known as transcription); subsequent decoding of the RNA (a process known as translation) results in the production of a protein with a defined function in the cell.  Control of gene expression is critical for all organisms; regulation of the initiation of transcription is a critical step at which gene expression is controlled.  Regions of DNA flanking transcribed genes often contain short sequences termed cis-regulatory elements (CREs).  CREs are bound by proteins which in turn control initiation of transcription from the neighboring gene; this binding typically requires defined DNA sequences within the CREs.  CREs which are important maintain a constant sequence over evolutionary time, while the other DNA surrounding them is unconstrained and drifts in sequence.  Thus, a powerful method to identify important CREs is to align DNA sequences flanking transcribed genes from multiple, related species.  A major technical bottleneck of this approach is determining the flanking DNA sequences themselves.  This project seeks to develop a rapid and flexible method to quickly determine the DNA sequence surrounding a gene of interest in multiple species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project involves the training of a female Ph.D. student, and as such, addresses the need to broaden inclusion of women in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.  The methodology itself has the potential to catalyze the discovery of multiple CREs for critical genes.  The resulting understanding of gene regulation may in turn have positive impacts in many areas of the biological sciences, as well as potential practical applications in biotechnology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All information storage, and heredity, in living organisms is a function of DNA.  The sum total of all of the DNA inside a given organism is referred to as the genome.  Within a genome, discrete functional sections can be identified -- these are the genes.  In general, each gene encodes a single protein.  For the information in a gene to be used to create a protein, two things must occur:  First, the gene is copied into a short RNA polymer (this is termed "transcription").  Then, this short-lived RNA, called a "messenger RNA" is scanned and the specific sequence of letters used to direct the step-wise synthesis of the encoded protein (this process is called "translation").  Genomes typically contain between a few thousand to ~50,000 different genes.  Only a subset of all possible proteins are produced by each cell in an organism at any given time; each cell type has a characteristic and distinct profile of "expressed" proteins, and these profiles can differ substantially.  In addition, the profile of expressed proteins can change, often rapidly, inside a single cell in response to changing environmental conditions or cues from elsewhere in the body.  Differences and changes in protein profiles most often reflect whether or not a given gene is being transcribed.  Therefore, control of transcription (on or off) is a key component of gene regulation, and underlies the basic functioning of all living cells.  Control of transcription is largely dictated by DNA sequences immediately adjacent to the gene itself.  These control regions are critical to understand for a full picture of gene regulation.  There are many instances where knowledge of the control region of a gene of interest is desirable, but difficult, particularly when the entire genome of the organism in questions is not yet known.  This project attempted to develop a method to rapidly capture long stretches of DNA adjacent to a known gene sequence.  The basic idea is to obtain all of the DNA from a specimen (the whole genome, which is easily achieved), and then to "pull down" only DNA fragments that match a known sequence of interest.  The enriched sample that results would then be analyzed and its DNA sequence determined.  This would allow the rapid and easy discovery of control regions surround genes of specific interest.  Development of such a method could have a broad impact on the biosciences, as it is desirable to isolate control regions from known genes in a variety of disciplines and applications.  This project was an early concept / high-risk study.  We optimized our method to work for the selection of a specific type of gene (a microRNA) in the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana.  Our results indicated that a pull-down / enrichment strategy worked well in this species, which has a relatively small genome.  However, we were unable to make the method work acceptably for an organism with a much larger genome (Zea mays [e.g. corn]).  Our method of specific gene enrichment therefore shows promise, but more work needs to be done to make it into a generally usable protocol for the rapid enrichment and discovery of control regions flanking genes of interest.
