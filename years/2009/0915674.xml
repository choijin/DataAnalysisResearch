<AbstractNarration>Project Description.&lt;br/&gt;This research project studies the feasibility of constructing price indexes specifically for clinical trials, an important component of healthcare R&amp;D.  Increasing health care R&amp;D spending is an important policy issue, but changes in expenditure are very difficult to evaluate without knowing whether these increases are due to changes in the prices of inputs to biomedical research, as opposed to changes in the quantity of research being performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The project constructs a "price deflator" that decomposes growth in total expenditure into price and quantity components.  Very few of these price indexes have been constructed specifically for scientific research, not least because R&amp;D activities tend to be highly heterogeneous, and therefore difficult to compare meaningfully year-to-year or across different contexts.  Sufficiently detailed data make it possible both to make price comparisons that hold constant factors such as the stage of clinical development, therapeutic area, and number of patients, and to control for the complexity and work burden associated with different trial designs,  The methodology that is used "hedonic price analysis" has been well-established in many areas, such as constructing deflators for IT products, but not has not previously been applied to scientific research activity.  These price indexes, combined with data on clinical trial activity published in public registries such as clinicaltrials.gov, allow the construction of broad-based estimates of clinical trial expenditures broken out by state, country, and type of R&amp;D performer.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.&lt;br/&gt;Along with evidence on the evolution of the price of clinical research, this project sheds light on a number of methodological issues relating to the integration of R&amp;D investment into the national income accounts, and informs important policy debates surrounding the "outsourcing" and "offshoring" of US R&amp;D, and the global competitiveness of American medical research establishments.  Clinical trials are increasingly being performed outside traditional US academic medical centers, at physicians' offices, clinics, and provider networks, as well as by specialized for-profit entities.  Moreover, trials have become increasingly global, with a single protocol collecting data from sites in many different countries.  These new features of clinical trials are one example of broader changes under way in the distribution of R&amp;D activity across geographies, actors, and institutions.  This research project helps develop a better understanding of the economic forces underlying this phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This approach can be used by BEA and other agencies in developing estimates of the impact of R&amp;D on real and nominal gross domestic product, even at the state or regional level, which is very difficult to do with current data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this research was to examine the feasibility of developing a Producer Price Index (PPI) for clinical trials, using purchased data from a private sector vendor, MediData Solutions, Worldwide, Inc.  My coauthor, Professor Iain M. Cockburn, and I presented initial findings of this research at an invited session of the American Economic Association annual meetings in San Diego, CA, in January 2013.  We documented that it is feasible for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to develop, construct and publish a PPI for clinical trials based on private sector data such as that available from MediData, although the costs of conducting clinical trials varies substantially across therapeutic areas, indicating the value of having separate PPIs by therapeutic class.  However, since this would result in some therapeutic classes having very small samples, consideration should be given to collapsing the total number of therapeutic areas into a smaller number than we did.  Based in part on comments from our discussant at the American Economic Association meetings, we revised our draft manuscript.  Our paper, "Price Indexes for Clinical Trial Research: A Feasibility Study" by Ernst R. Berndt and Iain M. Cockburn, was published as National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper No. 18918, March 2013.  In April 2013 we submitted the paper for possible publication in the BLSÆ house publication, the Monthly Labor Review.  In order to gain feedback from government statistical officials, on May 9, 2013, at the invitation of the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), we presented the paper at a BEA seminar; we also met with BEA and BLS staff before and after the seminar.  The seminar was attended by about 30 individuals, and in addition to BEA and BLS officials, representatives from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics at the National Science Foundation (John Jankowski and Francisco Moris) participated.  After receiving encouraging reviews from the internal and external BEA referees, in July 2013 we submitted a revised version of our manuscript to the Monthly Labor Review editors.   A very reassuring finding we obtained from this research was that over the 1989-2011 almost quarter century time period, our hedonic constant-quality price indexes constructed using pooled data over time, a sequence of adjacent year regressions, and data from annual regressions all had very robust average annual growth rates (AAGRs).  More surprising, however, was that the AAGRs we obtained from the various hedonic regressions (with site work effort and number of patients per site as the two most important quality measures) were almost identical to those reported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biomedical Research and Development Price Index (BRDPI), constructed by the BEA under contract from NIH.   In February 2014 we received word from the Monthly Labor Review editors that our manuscript had been accepted for publication.  In March 2014 we were contacted by Misty Higgeness, Ph.D., in the NIHÆs Office of the Director asking whether we would be willing to present our research findings and discuss their implications at aworkshop organized by the NIH.  On June 11, 2014, we presented our research findings at an NIH workshop in Bethesda, Maryland, attended by about 25 participants, including NIH staff and government statisticians from BEA and BLS, and the original developer of the NIHÆs BRDPI, Dr. James Schuttinga.  Not entirely by coincidence, in early June 2014 -- almost simultaneous with our NIH workshop, our manuscript based on this NSF grant was published in the electronic version of the Monthly Labor Review.
