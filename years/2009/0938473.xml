<AbstractNarration>Starting in 2010, the University of Hawaii's Outreach College will assume management of the 22nd and 23rd Dissertations Symposium in Chemical Oceanography (DISCO), a conference originally begun in 1978.  The goal of the DISCO symposium is to provide recently graduated, or soon to graduate, PhD-level chemical oceanographers with an opportunity to present their dissertation research in front of their professional peers and to forge professional relationships that would facilitate their future research and academic careers.  DISCO XXII and DISCO XXIII will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii from October 3-7, 2010 and October 7-11, 2012, respectively.  Applicants eligible for participation in a given DISCO meeting are those individuals who have received their doctoral degrees in ocean chemistry within one year preceding that symposium or who are certified by the degree-granting institution as graduating within one year after that symposium.  An applicant pool will be developed for the DISCO meetings from a broad international announcement to chemical oceanographers at academic institutions in the US and other countries, as well as an announcement in EOS magazine.  From this pool, agency personnel will select invitees.  This symposium is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award provided funds to organize and conduct two conferences for newly graduated, or soon to graduate, PhDs in the field of Chemical Oceanography.  The new scientists selected to participate in this conference through a competitive process (~25 attendees from over 70 qualified applicants) are conducting research at the forefront of our knowledge of the oceans and are expected to represent the next generation of chemical oceanographers.  This conference is designed to enhance cohort group formation amongst these young scientists, to foster future collaborative interactions, which will forward progress in the field.  These conferences were held in October 2010 and October 2012.  The funds were used to develop a conference website, fund participant travel and hotel costs, and pay for meeting logistics such as conference rooms, audio-visual support, and meeting-related printed materials.  The purpose of the meeting website is to provide information about the meeting, application materials, and answer any frequently-asked-questions regarding the meeting.  To this end, we designed and published a site prior to the application deadline of the 2010 meeting, located at www.soest.hawaii.edu/DISCO. For the 2010 and 2012 symposia, posters were designed and ~75 copies were made and delivered to NSF to allow their distribution at the AGU Fall 2009 and 2011 and Spring Ocean Sciences 2010 and 2012 meetings, as well as any other locales they deemed appropriate. We also contacted various organizations and community-wide list serves within the oceanographic community and asked them to send an email announcing the symposium to their address list. Applications were solicited from qualified individuals via the means described above, with the application forms available on the meeting website. Completed applications were received via email to the conference organizers and compiled for transmission to NSF program managers after the deadline for application had passed.  We received 71 applications for the 2010 symposium and 80 applications for the 2012 symposium.  Once the participants were selected, we invited those people via email to the meeting.  Once positive confirmation of the intent to attend the conference was received for all available seats, unsuccessful applicants were notified that they had not been selected.  NSF program managers also chose guest speakers, who we then contacted to help with logistical support to attend the meetings.  Successful applicants were contacted with a request to provide travel information so the process of booking air tickets could commence.  To facilitate this process, a detailed travel form was developed and provided for participants to fill out.  Hotel reservations were also made for all participants.  During this time, we prepared the meeting agenda, abstract booklet and collected roster information from all participants.  We distributed an e-version and a printed version of this booklet to all participants at the meeting.  We also compiled the following materials for participants: name badges, local restaurant information, local maps, talk (speaker) evaluation forms and meeting evaluation forms.  The meeting evaluation forms were collected at the end of the meeting and feedback compiled into a summary worksheet sent to the NSF program managers.
