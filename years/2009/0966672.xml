<AbstractNarration>The next generation of conservation professionals will require a unique skill set encompassing trans-disciplinary problem solving, sensitivity to varying cultural and political norms, and creativity and rigor in the face of challenging research environments.  This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project seeks to train such professionals through directed undergraduate research conducted in neo-tropical Ecuador, in a cooperative initiative between the University of Idaho (UI) and the Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja (UTPL). Participating students from Idaho will work in small, vertically integrated, interdisciplinary teams (2-3 students) within the Andean Region of southern Ecuador, addressing individual research questions focused around an umbrella theme of biodiversity conservation and sustainable community development.  Specific projects include the conservation genetics of endangered Andean species, biodiversity assessment and restoration of endangered orchids, international protected areas management and policy, and invertebrate taxa as bioindicators in regional watersheds.  UI graduate students will serve as team leaders, while UTPL faculty and staff, coordinated by research vice-rector Dr. Juan Pablo Suárez, will serve as project leads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Southern Ecuador is noteworthy for its geographic, ecological, and cultural richness, and yet baseline knowledge is lacking for much of the country's natural heritage. This project's multinational research team encompasses expertise in landscape and organismal ecology, conservation biology, molecular systematics, landscape genetics, watershed management, environmental sociology, policy, sustainable community development, and education. Through targeted application of this expertise, the project will contribute to strategic conservation planning in the United States and other countries.   Participating U.S. students will also gain experience with a rich array of cultures, thus building a sophisticated, externalized perspective on science and collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

In the process, weÆve built long-term research partnerships, collected critical ecological and social data, and trained a cohort of international conservation professionals who will contribute to science and society for many years.  Our study region near Loja, Ecuador is one of the most diverse places on earth, with a rich tapestry of ethnicities and indigenous groups, and with a geography that evolves from Pacific coastal dry forest into high Andean tundra, and then down to the Amazonian rainforest&hellip; all within a distance of less than 100 miles. Biodiversity levels are staggering. At the same time, it is an area undergoing rapid cultural and ecological change- often in the absence of basic natural history information, or a comprehensive understanding of human needs and social dynamics in the area.  With funding from the National Science Foundation, we have sought to address some of these knowledge gaps through student driven research. In 2011, faculty from UI and UTPL identified three areas where students could work in teams to address cutting-edge, rigorous scientific questions in biodiversity conservation, aquatic ecology, social sciences, and population demography and genetics. However, students were trained to engage and conduct research across these areas of focus.   As one example, we initiated a three-year effort to assess the ecological health and social significance of a network of high Andean lakes near the city of Loja. Teams of students worked in two sites: a pristine Andean lake system called Tres Lagunas, and in an indigenous Shuar community called El Qiim.

Our project has produced multiple publications and meeting presentations in social and ecological sciences &ndash; all including student researchers.  We anticipate additional publications and ongoing collaboration with Ecuadorian scientists as a result of these research projects.
