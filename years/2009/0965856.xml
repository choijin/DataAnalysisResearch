<AbstractNarration>The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Jacob Esselstyn to work with Dr. Jatna Supriatna at the University of Indonesia in Indonesia and with Dr. Ben Evans at McMaster University in Canada.    This project focuses on the history of diversification in Southeast Asian shrews (Soricomorpha: Crocidura), with a goal of identifying the forces that have shaped current patterns of diversity.  Targeted fieldwork on the major islands of Indonesia is supplementing an existing phylogenetic data set with new specimens, allowing for improved estimation of inter-specific relationships and more accurate estimates of regional biodiversity.  Bioinformatic techniques and an in-progress shrew genome are being used to identify rapidly evolving nuclear genes appropriate for phylogenetic and phylogeographic inference in Southeast Asian shrews.  Phylogenetic estimates derived from the resulting multi-locus data set are being integrated with ecomorphological and climate data to explore the significance of ecological forces such as competition and specialization in shaping the processes of diversification and community assembly.      This project supports one post-doctoral researcher and builds collaborative relationships among U.S., Indonesian, and Canadian scientists.  The post-doctoral researcher is being trained in bioinformatics and molecular biology.  Anticipated results include improved estimates of biodiversity in a region undergoing severe degradation of biological resources and a greater understanding of evolutionary and ecological processes in island archipelagos.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aims of this project were to (1) investigate the evolutionary history of wild shrew species in island Southeast Asia, (2) illuminate the ecological factors associated with evolutionary diversification in this group, (3) train a post-doctoral researcher in bioinformatics, and (4) build collaborative relationships with Indonesian and Canadian scientists in the fields of biodiversity research and genomics.  Project funding supported extensive fieldwork in montane and lowland habitats on the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.  Research specimens of wild mammals were collected on each island and deposited in permanent natural history collections in the United States and Indonesia, where they provide an important source of information to biodiversity scientists.  Fieldwork resulted in the discovery of several species new to science, including species of shrews and rodents.  DNA sequence data were collected from many shrews and rodents and used to estimate the relationships between species and populations.  Analyses of these data have led to the conclusions that (1) mammalian diversity in Indonesia is severely underestimated, even in previously surveyed areas near major cities, (2) local community diversity of shrews tends to be high, with 5-6 species occuring together on individual mountains, and (3) differences in body size appear to facilitate co-existence among these species.  This project led to substantial, long-term collaborations among the U.S., Indonesian, and Canadian participants and provided the Principal Investigator with significant training in bioinformatics and genomics experience.  Significant collaborations were also established with Australian researchers.  Six undergraduate students, including 4 females, received training in biodiversity research techniques.  This project has resulted in five publications in scientific journals, including papers in Molecular Ecology, Evolution, Proceedings of the Royal Society, Journal of Mammalogy, and Biology Letters.  Ten seminars have been presented at universities or international conferences.  Several additional publications and seminars are anticipated.
