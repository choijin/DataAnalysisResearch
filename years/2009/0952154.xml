<AbstractNarration>These investigators, along with graduate and undergraduate students, are installing 83 broadband seismic stations from the EarthScope Flexible Array pool to explore the deep structure of the Mid-Continent Rift System (MCRS). The MCRS is the fossil remnant of an extensive rifting event that failed to split North America during the Middle-Proterozoic era. This event left a large volume of dense basalts and associated strong geophysical anomalies. By imaging the deep structure beneath the rift, this seismic experiment investigates how such rifts form and then die, rather than developing into oceanic spreading centers. The seismic stations are located around, across, and along the failed rift, from the Minnesota-Iowa border into Canada by Lake Superior. Imaging the deep seismic structure of a central part of the MCRS will be undertaken with receiver function migration, ambient noise analysis, teleseismic surface wave dispersion analysis, regional S- and surface wave-train fitting, teleseismic arrival time tomography, re-analysis of existing seismic reflection &amp; refraction data, and SKS-splitting analysis. These analyses are combined into a multi-resolution, three-dimensional image of the isotropic and anisotropic structure of the crust and mantle beneath the MCRS and its surroundings. Results of these analyses will illuminate the role of the mantle in the rifting process and its initiation and cessation. The results will also enhance our understanding of mid-continental earthquakes. This research project employs at least three graduate students, also involves undergraduate students, and fosters collaboration between researchers from Canada and the USA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The SPREE project installed more than 80 broadband seismic stations across Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Ontario, with the primary goal of studying the ancient Mid-Continent Rift (MCR) system.   The deployments occurred in 2011-2013 to coincide with the deployment of the Earthscope TA stations in this region.   The MCR was an incipient rift system active around 1.1 billion years ago, and shows extremely prominent gravity and magnetic anomlies, but is poorly understood in part because the relevant geological units are almost entirely covered by more recent rock and sediment.    The SPREE project imaged the MCR using waveforms from distant earthquakes and from ambient noise correlation, with methods including surface wave tomography and reciever function analysis.   These shear velocity images show that the rift is defined by prominent upper and mid-crustal low velocity anomalies.  The upper crustal anomalies are interepreted as resulting from thickened younger sedimentary rock units, and the mid-crustal anomalies from thick basalt sequences erupted along the entire length of the MCR.  By combining US SPREE and TA stations with SPREE stations in  Canada, the shear velocity structure beneath Lake Superior and Southern Canada can be imaged for  the first time, and shows the MCR velocity anomalies continuing beneath  the Lake and into Michigan.    Reciever function images show that the rift axis is characterized by in some places by an indistinct, gradual moho anomaly, and in others by two prominent discontinuities, instead of the usual sharp moho discontinuity between the crust and mantle.   The deeper discontinuity extends significantly deeper than the moho anomaly in adjacent regions off-axis.   This shows that the lower crust and upper mantle structure was greatly altered by the rifting event, with signficiant crust added by magmatic underplating.
