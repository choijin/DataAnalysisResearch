<AbstractNarration>This project will continue the development of phosphorus-carbon bond-forming reactions.  New catalytic reactions are proposed based on hypophosphorous acid and its derivatives, and on H-phosphinates to provide atom-economical processes.  Specifically, these efforts involve a) P-H activation in alkyl phosphinates under transition-metal catalysis, including further developments of the palladium- and nickel-catalyzed hydrophosphinylations discovered in the principal investigator's laboratory; b) P-H activation in H-phosphinates; and c) phasing out phosphorus trichloride in the manufacturing of organophosphorus compounds, thereby reducing the environmental impact and energy-demand associated with chlorine usage through the catalytic preparation and use of H-phosphinates. H-Phosphinate derivatives possess an oxidation state in the middle of the range for phosphorus, and they can be derivatized into a plethora of other important functional groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Jean-Luc Montchamp of the Department of Chemistry at Texas Christian University.  Professor Montchamp's research efforts revolve around the development of methodology for the formation of P-C and P-O bonds under catalytic conditions.  Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for the chemical synthesis of organophosphorus compounds, which are important in the manufacturing of many products, such as therapeutic agents, agrochemicals, and phosphine ligands for catalysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organophosphorus compounds are important materials in everyday life.  They are used as agrochemicals to improve crop yields, extractants for mining, flame-retardants to increase the safety of consumer products, etc.  Currently, all organophosphorus compounds are derived from hazardous phosphorus trichloride.  Approximately 450,000 tons of phosphorus trichloride is produced annually from elemental phosphorus and chlorine gas.  However, the final products do not contain chlorine, and chlorine is both a dangerous substance and it is energy demanding to produce.  The goal of this project was to investigate safer phosphinates as chlorine-free replacements of phosphorus trichloride.  Phosphinates are already produced industrially (50,000 tons/year) for use in nickel plating and related applications.  The project resulted in the development of a portfolio of methodologies for the preparation of various organophosphorus compounds from phosphinates.  The reactions include environmentally benign addition reactions catalyzed by palladium, nickel, and manganese.  Particularly, a chlorine-free catalytic process to convert hypophosphorous acid and alcohols into H-phosphonate diesters was developed.  H-Phosphonate diesters are major intermediates in phosphorus trichloride chemistry, therefore the project resulted in bypassing the use of chlorine altogether.  As a result of this research, safer and more economical processes should become available for the production of organophosphorus compounds.  This research should therefore decrease the environmental impact of industrial manufacturing.  Novel reactions allow the preparation of organophosphorus compounds more safely and efficiently.  While other scientists are devoting significant efforts in order to avoid phosphorus trichloride, these investigations rely either on elemental phosphorus P4 or phosphine PH3, which unlike phosphinates are both highly toxic and hazardous.
