<AbstractNarration>Studies of the marine archaeon (Nitrosopumilus maritmus) by investigators at the University of Washington established that ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA) are capable of growing under the extreme nutrient limited conditions characteristic of the open ocean, using ammonia and carbon dioxide as sole sources of energy and carbon. This remarkable feature and the high abundance of AOA among marine bacterioplankton together suggest they play a fundamental role in marine nitrogen and carbon cycles, and also compete with marine phototrophs for ammonia. In addition to their remarkable affinity for ammonia, the genome sequence of N. maritimus points to a capacity to make novel phosphorous compounds that may contribute to methane release from marine surface waters, the use of a copper-based respiratory system that could provide ecological advantage in iron-limited ocean waters, a novel mechanism of cell division, and a high adaptive capability conferred by an unusually large number of transcription factors. These investigators will collaborate with an international group of scientists to determine how AOA are able to grow on ammonia at vanishing low concentrations, maintain copper homeostasis, respond to changing environmental conditions, and possibly contribute to atmospherically significant gases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Marine systems are increasingly impacted by acidification and by atmospheric inputs of reactive nitrogen. Since these changes greatly alter nitrogen available to microorganisms, the research will advance understanding of the effects that acidification and anthropogenic nitrogen inputs are having on major ocean processes. The project will train one graduate student in environmental science and 1-3 undergraduates through mentoring by senior laboratory personnel. A postdoctoral associate will receive additional professional training through participation in the University of Washington Postdoctoral Association (UWPA), offering workshops in grant writing, teaching, publishing, oral communication, directing a laboratory, time management, crafting personal professional development plans, and faculty applications and hiring. The project will also serve as a vehicle for more general science education, taking advantage of existing outreach programs to promote better understanding by high school teachers and students of the critical role of microorganisms in global nutrient cycles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The discovery and characterization of the ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) made possible by NSF support has lead to major revisions in understanding of the nitrogen cycle, considered to be one of the most important nutrient cycles on earth.  Intense agricultural practice has doubled the amount of biologically available nitrogen entering the environment relative to natural sources.  Our characterization of a model AOA (Nitrosopumilus maritimus) paired with environmental studies of natural AOA populations has confirmed their significance to global nitrogen transformations, identified environmental factors controlling nitrification, and shown that increasing nitrogen inputs may depress their contribution to nitrification.  Notably, combined laboratory and environmental analyses have demonstrated that AOA will be less competitive at higher ammonia levels than faster growing competing microbial species that are very active in the production of nitrous oxide, an important greenhouse gas.  The discovery that AOA can contribute to methane production in the presence of oxygen, and that this metabolism is widely distributed in many marine microorganisms, has introduced novel biological source of another important greenhouse gas.   These studies have also provided new understanding of the diversity of cell division machinery used by microorganisms, identified a novel and energetically efficient system for CO2 fixation, and confirmed the importance of these organisms in nitrogen transformations in the expanding oxygen minimum zones of the oceans.
