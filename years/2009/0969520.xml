<AbstractNarration>Cal Poly University - Pomona plans to increase STEM graduation rate from 28% to 48% to match the rate for the rest of campus.  The program has three components: 1) course development in three gateway courses that are prerequisites for further STEM study, 2) enhanced first year experiences including an innovative orientation course, and 3) apprenticeship opportunities for students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gateway courses in physics, calculus and chemistry are being revised to incorporate interactive teaching, inquiry-based learning and assignments that reveal the societal benefits of STEM fields.  The revised freshman orientation course promotes community, engages students in problem-solving activities, introduces college survival skills and stimulates interest in STEM careers.  Students are provided apprenticeship opportunities to build community and establish relationships with other students and faculty.  Cal Poly - Pomona has a diverse student body and produces the largest number of underrepresented engineers and computer scientists in the state.  Successful strategies will be replicated at other California State Universities.</AbstractNarration>
