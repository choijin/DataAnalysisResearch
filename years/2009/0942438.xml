<AbstractNarration>Research and Assessment (91)&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is a mixed-methods study that is collecting time-sensitive and critical data that document classroom, faculty and departmental change that are part of the Science Education Initiative (SEI) at the University of Colorado. It is exploring the extent and nature of the changes made to date, and seeking to understand the processes by which these have come about. The results from this study are illuminating the attitudinal and cultural shifts necessary in individual faculty values and within departments to bring about widespread adoption of classroom practices that embody understanding of how students learn most effectively. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is exploring two research questions.  First, what are the linkages between individual faculty members' instructional practices and their belief systems around teaching and learning, and what consequences do these have for the extent and pace of uptake of research-based STEM educational approaches?  Second, what are the linkages between individual faculty members' belief systems, and departmental and institutional structures and cultures that affect the uptake of research-based STEM educational approaches? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research design is using embedded case studies. Five departments are being studied. Each represents a culture of faculty belief systems.  Case studies can increase understanding of complex social phenomena in a way that allows investigators to retain the holistic and meaningful characteristics of processes or events. Other social science methods, such as experiments, often separate a phenomenon from its context in an attempt to control variables. Case studies, however, investigate phenomena in their real-life context and are thus better able to explain the social and cultural processes by which outcomes are achieved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a mixed-methods study exploring the processes and outcomes of a major STEM transformation effort at a research-extensive university. Results from this study illuminate the attitudinal, behavioral and cultural shifts necessary in individual faculty values and within departments to bring about widespread adoption of classroom practices that embody understanding of how students learn most effectively. For the purposes of this report, this change initiative is referred to as the Undergraduate Science Education (USE) project.   Analyses of quantitative and qualitative data indicate a range of uptake in departments participating in the USE change effort. This is particularly true in terms of departments' review of their curriculum to determine desired learning objectives. In each of the participating science departments, faculty members worked with matched discipline-specific postdoctoral researchers interested in science education research to develop learning objectives for their introductory courses (as applicable) and to align content, resources, and learning objectives across the four years of the curriculum.  Analyses of change at the department level through case studies shows the complexity of factors that support or inhibit the uptake of change.  Case study analyses also highlight the tremendous range of departmental contexts and diversity of factors supporting and inhibiting change.   While some faculty members are clearly more active than others in their change efforts, overall, faculty resistance has not proved too detrimental to the progress of the USE initiative as a department-wide activity.  Barriers to participation are largely structural and can be linked to disciplinary traditions and differences, though there are some barriers that are attitudinal and normative to college teaching.  It is also clear from classroom observations that USE-reformed courses do not necessarily lead to increased student satisfaction and 'quality' student learning as compared to that which students experience in non-USE reformed science courses.   Three barriers have been identified as affecting uptake, success, and sustainability of the USE change effort: 1) lack of time and competing, 'more important' priorities, i.e., research; 2) lack of faculty professional development to better prepare faculty to teach with interactive, student-centered, research-based methods; and 3) the traditional rewards system of a research-extensive institution of higher education that does not reward quality teaching and student learning in its merit system.  Other findings show that, overall, factors supporting organizational change demonstrate that a 'middle-up-top down' approach can be effective. That is, department-level change agents, including multiple faculty and discipline-specific postdoctoral science education researchers, in conjunction with engaged communities of practice, and upper-administrative institutional support, are encouraging and sustaining the USE transformation effort in some science departments at the institution.  Within the field of science education research, findings concerning elements of the USE model show promise in encouraging and supporting faculty members to effectively implement interactive teaching strategies in large introductory courses. As well, results of the USE change effort show strong promise in developing, adapting, and validating the proposed change model directed at improving college science teaching and student learning, particularly in regards to levers of change found 'at the middle'.   In our research into this 'experiment' in science teaching reform, we find strong parallels to prior academic literature available on organizational change. Parallels are particularly clear in other researchers' studies of faculty attitudes and practices regarding pedagogical change in the classroom. Results from this study will also contribute to the literature on dissemination of change and innovation in ST...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
