<AbstractNarration>This proposal continues and expands the PolarTREC program that matches K-12 educators with researchers for field experiences in the Arctic and Antarctic. Annually the project will select 6-8 Arctic and 4-6 Antarctic projects to host teachers selected from nationwide applicants. Over four years, 48 teachers will go to the polar regions. The project has four objectives to: improve teacher content knowledge of multidisciplinary polar science; improve teacher instructional practices, especially the use of inquiry-based learning to translate polar science to the classroom; improve polar researchers? understanding of and engagement in K-12 education; and increase students? understanding of and engagement in the polar regions and polar science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) careers. The teacher experience includes an intense orientation focusing on having a successful field experience and translating that into the classroom, developing an education and outreach plan that focuses on their specific needs and goals, a final essay, submitting journals and photos to a website of real-time materials plus occasional live broadcasts from the field, follow up through a share fare to exchange activities and a network of teachers sharing ideas for incorporating the experience into their classrooms all backed up by external evaluation of the project using formative and summative techniques to address teacher professional development.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For more than ten years, the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS) has developed and implemented <em>PolarTREC</em>&ndash;Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating (<em>PolarTREC</em>), a teacher professional development program that brings together K-12 and community college teachers and polar researchers together through an innovative teacher research experience (TRE) model. <em>PolarTREC</em> is one of the few national TRE programs in the United States and is unique in its use of field-based experiences in the polar regions. Over 150 teachers from around the United States have spent three to six weeks in remote Arctic and Antarctic field camps from Toolik station in Alaska to Antarctica&rsquo;s McMurdo Station to Bering Sea ships, and working side-by-side with polar researchers to learn more about cutting-edge science, field technologies, engineering, and applied mathematics.</p> <p>The goal of PolarTREC (<a href="http://www.polartrec.com)">www.polartrec.com)</a> is to advance polar science education and understanding by bringing K-12 educators and polar researchers together through hands on field experiences. By fostering the integration of research and education, PolarTREC continues the momentum established during the International Polar Year in 2007. During their research experience, teachers become team members filling a variety of roles such as research technician, manual laborer, educator, data enterer, observer, and instrument operator.&nbsp; They also fulfill the distinctive role of public outreach officer, conducting live presentations from the research site to the public, keeping a web-based polar journal (including several in Spanish), answering the public&rsquo;s questions, and posting pictures of their daily experiences.&nbsp; Prior to their field season, teachers receive extensive training in logistics, outreach, and education planning.&nbsp; Upon their return, participants are expected to integrate their experiences into their classroom instruction and continue their public outreach, making the experience a part of their ongoing professional career development.&nbsp; Funding for <em>PolarTREC</em> has been provided through the National Science Foundation Division of Polar Programs.</p> <p>A major component of the the PolarTREC program is the evaluation that looks at program goals as well as if PolarTREC is advancing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) education. Based on a four-year evaluation of the program, PolarTREC teachers have significantly increased their own knowledge and use of inquiry science practice in the classroom, an important aspect of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This contributed to an increase in student interest and knowledge about the polar regions.&nbsp; Students reported increased experience using inquiry science practices, and knowledge about the polar regions, including knowledge of ice and snow, past human environments, ocean systems, tundra systems, engineering, and atmospheric sciences.</p> <p>An annual survey of PolarTREC teacher alumni shows that the benefits of the program persist. For years after the experience, teachers continue to bring what they learned about polar science and science teaching techniques to their students. They continue to consider themselves &ldquo;scientists&rdquo; and participate both alone and with their students in real research.&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, researchers were predominately positive about their PolarTREC experiences and reported increased understanding of K-12 education.&nbsp; The majority of current researchers developed positive, professional relationships with their partnering teachers.&nbsp; Several researchers have included educators in their research teams, co-presented at scientific or education related conferences, or co-written peer-reviewed journal articles. These are a testament to the potential to grow into long-term partnerships with the education community.</p> <p>Evaluation data, indicates that <em>PolarTREC </em>has clearly achieved it goals and strongly suggests <em>PolarTREC</em>&rsquo;s potential to transform the nature of STEM education by giving teachers the content knowledge, pedagogical tools, confidence, understanding of science in the broader society, and experiences with scientific inquiry they need to promote authentic scientific research in their classroom.</p> <p><strong>Publications and media related to this award: </strong></p> <p>Media coverage of teachers in the field are posted on the PolarTREC website here: <a href="https://www.polartrec.com/newsroom/archives">https://www.polartrec.com/newsroom/archives</a></p> <p>Photos related to this program and taken by participants are available to the public here: <a href="http://media.arcus.org/">http://media.arcus.org/</a></p> <p>YouTube videos used in lessons and online journals are available to the public here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqK85wHrdywiQbJ-rCtHftQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqK85wHrdywiQbJ-rCtHftQ</a></p> <p>Social media sites:<br /> <a href="https://twitter.com/polartrec">https://twitter.com/polartrec</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/254021044705820/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/254021044705820/</a></p> <p>Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS). 2015.
