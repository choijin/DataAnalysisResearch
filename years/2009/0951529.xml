<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the fifth meeting in the series of February Fourier Talks (FFT), held 18-19 February 2010 at the University of Maryland, College Park.  The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting includes invited lectures on topics of current research interest and also encourages poster presentations by students and recent Ph.D. recipients.  The conference brings together workers in a variety of different areas of research in harmonic analysis, with emphasis on facilitating the process of making pure mathematics applicable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://norbertwiener.umd.edu/FFT/&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
