<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for Dr. F.M. Sciammarella (PI) to travel to South Africa in June of 2010 with an NIU postdoctoral student to visit the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). This visit will help solidify the existing relationship that the PI cultivated with the CSIR and strengthen their laser materials processing research proposals for future NSF funded projects. Dr. Sciammarella's research in laser assisted machining is just one of the research efforts that he will present to the National Laser Center (NLC) of the CSIR. The NLC conducts research on the laser deposition of advanced alloys, under the guidance of Herman Burger, director of the NLC's laser materials processing group. The PI will present micromanufacturing research results from NIU to other CSIR divisions. CSIR will make presentations on their research in laser cladding and host round table discussions on current trends in advanced manufacturing capabilities available in South Africa. This type of exchange will facilitate the discussion on how to proceed with future collaborative efforts and facilitate the exchange of research approaches and goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, the goals of this visit are to 1) discuss a model that can be used to create an international, interdisciplinary experience for both undergraduates and graduates; 2) work on generating at least two proposals to NSF in laser materials processing to the Materials Processing and Manufacturing (MPM) Division; 3) make available any initiatives and/or outcomes generated during this planning visit to the manufacturing industry in the US and South Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Creating three dimensional structures (i.e. biomedical implants, gears, turbine blades) using lasers for all aspects of manufacturing is relatively new. The main advantage of laser processing is that it is possible to make the properties of the new parts better than the original ones. One drawback to laser technologies is that repeatable properties even within the same batch are often times difficult to obtain. This is attributed to the lack of a comprehensive analysis on laser/materials interactions. This planning visit would establish an international collaborative effort to resolving this and other issues related with laser materials processing. With the wide range of experience between Dr. Sciammarella in laser assisted machining using diode fiber lasers and Mr. Burger's in laser cladding usingCO2 and Nd: YAG lasers a great deal of laser materials interactions can be put into a comprehensive research effort. One such interaction that is important to understand is net power absorbed in laser material processing. This net energy determines a majority of the metallurgical and mechanical properties of the material undergoing laser treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: This planning visit will result in a series of research proposals that will enable continued growth in laser materials processing. This will benefit the U.S. and South African manufacturing industry, as they will be able to build very intricate components with relative ease at lower costs. Furthermore, new channels of communication between these two continents will create more opportunities for industrial growth. The educational component will have a high impact since a postdoctoral student will be involved for this planning visit. With this trip, the postdoctoral student will gain the necessary experience to work on future collaborations with the CSIR. This project will also have a direct impact on younger African American students from Chicago's Austin Polytechnical Academy a public engineering high school. The PI has done volunteer work with them in the past and served as mentor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering, with co-funding from the Engineering Directorate's Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation.</AbstractNarration>
