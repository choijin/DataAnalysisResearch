<AbstractNarration>0918629&lt;br/&gt;Wyner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City College of New York and the American Museum of Natural History propose a  three-year research and development project to refine and test case study units based on existing museum-developed scientific content on contemporary issues in ecology for students underserved in their connection to nature.  The resources are designed to be used by teachers of middle and high school biology, ecology, and environmental science classes. The project will produce three complete curriculum modules. They will include new scientist at work profile videos that will be disseminated online through a web interface that enables teachers to select and customize scaffolding and to address their particular students' needs in the classroom. The program will also develop in-person and online courses at CCNY and AMNH for local New York City public school teachers and teachers nationally to explore their own connection to environmental issues and ecology and to reflect upon the role of scientific inquiry in building understanding of the natural world. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
