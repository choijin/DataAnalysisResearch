<AbstractNarration>The Ross Sea continental shelf is one of the most productive areas in the Southern Ocean, and may comprise a significant, but unaccounted for, oceanic CO2 sink, largely driven by phytoplankton production.  The processes that control the magnitude of primary production in this region are not well understood, but data suggest that iron limitation is a factor. Field observations and model simulations indicate four potential sources of dissolved iron to surface waters of the Ross Sea: (1) circumpolar deep water intruding from the shelf edge; (2) sediments on shallow banks and nearshore areas; (3) melting sea ice around the perimeter of the polynya; and (4) glacial meltwater from the Ross Ice Shelf.  The principal investigators hypothesize that hydrodynamic transport via mesoscale currents, fronts, and eddies facilitate the supply of dissolved iron from these four sources to the surface waters of the Ross Sea polynya. These hypotheses will be tested through a combination of in situ observations and numerical modeling, complemented by satellite remote sensing. In situ observations will be obtained during a month-long cruise in the austral summer.  The field data will be incorporated into model simulations, which allow quantification of the relative contributions of the various hypothesized iron supply mechanisms, and assessment of their impact on primary production. The research will provide new insights and a mechanistic understanding of the complex oceanographic phenomena that regulate iron supply, primary production, and biogeochemical cycling. The research will thus form the basis for predictions about how this system may change in a warming climate.  The broader impacts include training of graduate and undergraduate students, international collaboration, and partnership with several ongoing outreach programs that address scientific research in the Southern Ocean. The research also will contribute to the goals of the international research programs ICED (Integrated Climate and Ecosystem Dynamics) and GEOTRACES (Biogeochemical cycling and trace elements in the marine environment).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Ross Sea continental shelf is among the most productive areas in the Southern Ocean, and may comprise a significant but unaccounted for oceanic CO2 sink, in large part driven by phytoplankton production.  However, the processes that control the magnitude of primary production in this region are not well understood.  During summer, an observed abundance of macronutrients and scarcity of dissolved iron are consistent with iron limitation of phytoplankton growth in the Ross Sea polynya, as is supported by results of shipboard bioassay experiments.  Previous field observations and model simulations indicate four potential sources of dissolved iron to surface waters of the Ross Sea during the growing season, after the 'winter reserve' (supplied by deep winter mixing) has been consumed: (1) circumpolar deep water intruding from the shelf edge; (2) sediments on shallow banks and nearshore areas; (3) melting sea ice around the perimeter of the polynya; and (4) glacial meltwater from the Ross Ice Shelf.  Our project aimed to assess these sources, and has achieved what we believe to be the most quantitative regional-scale estimates of iron supply and demand in an Antarctic marine ecosystem to date.  Our results from the Ross Sea polynya show that supply and demand estimates agree to within their associated uncertainties, which is a significant finding unto itself.  Moreover, the combination of observations and models facilitate assessment of the relative importance of these various iron sources.  Specifically, detailed profile data reveal a significant benthic source of iron, an input that has been inferred in other areas but seldom documented with near-bottom measurements.  The benthic source, which also sets the winter reserve, is on par with that of melting sea ice, which is the other major dissolved iron contributor in the Ross Sea.  This is in marked contrast to recent data from the Amundsen Sea, where glacial meltwater is the dominant source of iron.  These findings highlight the marked heterogeneity of iron supply in Antarctic shelf ecosystems &ndash; an aspect that must be explicitly accounted for if we are to understand and predict how these systems will respond to climate-driven environmental changes.  Broader impacts of this project include the research and professional training of a number of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and the development of educational materials for K-12 STEM students.
