<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor &lt;br/&gt;Bruce A. Parkinson and colleagues Carrick M. Eggleston, Susan M. Swapp and Jinke Tang from the University of Wyoming will acquire a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), e-beam lithography, electron beam induced current (EBIC), scanning transmission electron (STEM), and a low-voltage, high-contrast detector. The award is aimed at enhancing research training and educations at all levels especially research ranging from microbiological interaction with minerals to nanocomposite or nanoparticles alloys, solar energy research involving nanostructured films of photocatalytic oxides and photovoltaic materials, nanoparticle energy storage and conversion materials as well as research on microbial and biofuel cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a widely used technique for providing images of surfaces. The FESEM is equipped with a cathode in the electron gun. The images are obtained from scanning the surface with a beam of electrons that are accelerated under the influence of a strong electrical (field) voltage. This important technique enables scientists to see the ultrastructural details of fabricated systems, molecular arrangements of man-made nanostructures and the subtle changes associated with friction and wear in surfaces. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry, materials chemistry, geology, biochemistry and the environment. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research in solid materials has become increasingly focused on smaller and smaller particles.  Extremely small particles are commonly termed "nano particles", and research in the fabrication of and study of the unique properties of these nano particles has become a primary focus in many fields, including chemistry, engineering, physics, and geology, among others.  Prior to 2010, the University of Wyoming lacked the capability to image and characterize nano particles, and this lack of instrumentation was a serious impediment to both teaching and research in these fields and techniques.  Acquisition of a new and state of the art field emission scanning electron microscope enabled the University of Wyoming to offer training in these modern techniques to our undergraduate and graduate students, to support our researchers in all manner of investigations involving nano particles, and to more successfully recruit graduate students, post docs, and faculty conducting these kinds of investigations.   We acquired an appropriate instrument and installed it in a facility specifically designed for electron microscopy.  We developed protocols for use and offered formal training in an Applied Scanning Electron Microscopy course.  This course has been used by more than 75 praticipants including undergraduate and graduate students, post docs, and faculty.  All of these trainees have acquired valuable and widely applicable skills in this very general method and are now qualified for employment in any venue utilizing these techniques.  The techniques have also been broadly utilized by researchers on this campus, including members of more than 10 research groups.  This utilization has enhanced the ability of investigators to conduct important research and to attract new research funding for future projects.   We anticipate that useage will continue to increase on this campus, as will use by investigators from around our geographical region.  We plan to continue to offer formal training, to continue to provide constant support for all users, and to strive to keep our facility in optimal operating condition into the future.  We believe that this award has greatly enhanced our ability to train new scientists and to conduct fundamental research.
