<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to create and explore novel methods for detection of emerging events in massive, complex real-world datasets.  The approach consists of new algorithms to efficiently and exactly find the most anomalous subsets of a large, high-dimensional dataset, as well as methodological advances to incorporate incremental model learning from user feedback into event detection, incorporate society-scale data from emerging, transformative technologies such as cellular phones and user-generated web content, and augment event detection by creating methods and tools for event characterization, explanation, visualization, investigation and response.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental research is integrated with a multi-pronged educational initiative to incorporate machine learning into the public policy curriculum through development of courses and seminars, workshops in machine learning and policy research and education, and establishment of a new Joint Ph.D. Program in Machine Learning and Policy.  The results of this project will be incorporated into deployed event surveillance systems and applied to the public health, law enforcement, and health care domains, enabling more timely and accurate detection of emerging outbreaks of disease, prediction of emerging hot-spots of violent crime, and identification of anomalous patterns of patient care.  Project results, including publications, software, and datasets, will be disseminated via project web site (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neill/CAREER).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed a variety of novel methods for accurate and computationally efficient detection of emerging events and other patterns in massive, complex datasets.  We translated these methodological advances into real-world systems that can benefit public health, safety, and security, in areas including:  * Disease surveillance: we used electronically available public health data such as hospital visits and medication sales to automatically identify and characterize emerging disease outbreaks in their very early stages.  * Law enforcement and urban analytics: we were able to accurately predict geographic hot-spots of violence up to a week in advance using crime offense reports and 911 emergency calls, and to identify emerging citizen needs using 311 non-emergency calls for service.  * Health care: our methods were able to discover anomalous patterns of patient care with significant impacts on outcomes, and to automatically detect prostate cancer in digital pathology slides.  * Social media analytics: we used Twitter data to accurately predict civil unrest, identify emerging patterns of human rights abuses, and detect outbreaks of rare diseases.  * Other applications included detecting intruders in a computer network, customs monitoring of container shipments, and infrastructure monitoring (e.g., detection of contaminants spreading through a water distribution system).  In all of these domains, our methods demonstrated substantial improvements in the timeliness, accuracy, and specificity of pattern detection as compared to the previous state of the art.  We developed the CityScan methodology and software that were incorporated into the Chicago Police Department?s day-to-day policing operations for crime prevention through targeted deployment of patrols, and have provided the CPD with substantial value in their day to day operations. They have noted that "based upon deployment suggestions indicated in the CityScan intelligence reports, important arrests were effected, weapons were seized, and crimes were prevented." Working with Chicago city leaders, we also applied CityScan to prediction and prevention of rodent complaints. Through advance prediction of locations where rodents are likely to occur, CityScan enables cities to more precisely target proactive rodent baiting and other prevention measures.  Key methodological contributions of our work include "fast subset scan" approaches which can efficiently identify the most interesting, anomalous, or relevant subsets of data records without an exhaustive search.  This enables us to solve detection problems in milliseconds that would previously have been computationally infeasible, requiring millions of years to solve.  Our fast subset scan methods can find optimal subsets subject to constraints on spatial proximity, graph connectivity, group self-similarity, or temporal consistency. They can be applied to univariate, multivariate, or multidimensional datasets, spatial or non-spatial data, including complex data such as text, images, and social media, and can track and source-trace dynamically spreading patterns.
