<AbstractNarration>Modern automobiles are no longer mere mechanical devices; they are pervasively monitored and controlled by dozens of digital computers coordinated via internal vehicular networks and bridged to external networks as well.  While this transformation has driven major advancements in efficiency, safety and convenience, it has also introduced a broad range of new potential risks.  In this effort, we are evaluating these risks by experimentally mapping the attack surface of the modern automobile, identifying architectural security and privacy vulnerabilities, and developing new defense methodologies that can provide safety within the rubric of the existing automotive design ecosystem.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project focused on understanding the nature of automotive cybersecurity.  While it is unintuitive to many, the modern automobile is in fact a complex distributed computer system in which virtually all functions of the vehicle are computer controlled or mediated.  Moreover, for reasons of efficiency, integration, and capability, the tens of computer inside the modern automobile are themselves networked internally and, increasingly, to the outside world as well.  Our work sought to understand the security implications of this design and then understand the constraints in improving it.  Our best known results are captured in two papers, one from 2010 (IEEE Security and Privacy) and other in 2011 (USENIX Security), that explored the security issues in a pair of unmodified commercial sedans.  In the first paper, we explored the internal resilience of the vehicle and showed that the internal networking allowed a compromise of even a minor component (e.g., the CD player) to compromise all vehicle systems and directly control engine and brakes among other services.  This first paper was predicated on an adversary with physical access to the vehicle and thus our second paper explored the issues of external connectivity (e.g., various digital signals that the car would accept either wirelessly or via some other indirect channel).  Here we identified a range of concrete vulnerabilities by which the car could be completely compromised including playing specially modified songs on the CD player, via the hands-free Bluetooth interface, via the wireless interface of dealership shop tools and, perhaps most concerning, at arbitrary distance over the cellular channel used in the car's telematics system.  We demonstrated these results for car manufacturers, regulators and other key stakeholders in controlled settings.  Moreover, in extensive talks with this group we reached the conclusion that our findings likely generalized beyond a single make and model to the entire industry (a hypothesis since validated by independent researchers who have replicated our results on other vehicles).  Among the most interesting part of this work has been in understanding the sets of complex constraints -- both technical, structural and economic -- that car manufacturers must work with.  Thus, seemingly obvious solutions such as "separate the safety critical components in the car from the non-safety critical parts" are quickly revealed as unrealistic once the complex coupling between components in normal use is understood.  Another unintuitive example is that solutions based on source code analysis are difficult to apply in automobiles due to the fact that much of the code is not available to car manufacturers (it is supplied in purely binary form by their vendors who closely protect their intellectual property interests).  We thus spent significant time with manufacturers are regulators exploring the best options -- both short term and longer term -- for their industry to improve security.  The result of this effort is that, in addition to our academic impact (with over 600 citations to just those two papers), we have had significant real world impact as well. The Society of Automotive Engineers has launched a cybersecurity standardization effort (with support from "Big 3" automakers) following the work from this team.  Automotive manufacturers have started to dedicate significant resources to automotive security (one manufacturer publically stating an "order of magnitude increase in security staffing") and there have been direct changes to development methods in turn based on our recommendations.  On the government side, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's focus on cyber was also driven by our work (and it was highlighted in the National Academies report on the Unintended Acceleration issue) and our findings were the genesis of DARPA's $60 HACMS program focused on improving vehicular cybersecurity.  Finally, it is fair to say that the ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
