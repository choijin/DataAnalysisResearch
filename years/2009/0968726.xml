<AbstractNarration>Non-local dynamics is an emerging interest in physics across many disciplines, from condensed matter physics to particle physics to quantum gravity. This project explores the effects of non-local dynamics as realized in the context of a certain class of string theory models of particular interest to cosmology. The string theory embedding of these models assures that the exotic frameworks encountered are physically and logically self-consistent. Yet, such non-local systems remain poorly understood, with many counter-intuitive features and apparent paradoxes. This project aims to unravel general features of non-local dynamics as they arise in this class of string theory models, and apply these results to modeling the primordial plasma of the universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also involves undergraduate education as an integral part. This is achieved through a two-pronged approach: (1) through the direct participation of undergraduate students in the research within a program that has already proven to be highly successful in involving undergraduate seniors in string theory research; and (2) through the development of a senior-level undergraduate course and textbook to help prepare students for competitive graduate programs in theoretical physics. The project also includes a multi-pronged community outreach component involving a web-based instructional resource, and a public lecture series on current topics at the frontier of theoretical physics.</AbstractNarration>
