<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award investigates how humans integrate a wide variety of  &lt;br/&gt;information sources to achieve rapid, accurate natural language  &lt;br/&gt;comprehension subject to the physical and cognitive constraints under  &lt;br/&gt;which it takes place.  The project's primary empirical focus is on  &lt;br/&gt;reading, a mode of information exchange of unexceeded importance in  &lt;br/&gt;literate societies.  Reading involves a rapid sequence of targeted eye  &lt;br/&gt;movements throughout a text -- recordable through modern eye-tracking  &lt;br/&gt;technology -- from which noisy sensory input are obtained and  &lt;br/&gt;integrated with prior knowledge to resolve perceptual and linguistic  &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty.  The central goal of this project is thus to develop,  &lt;br/&gt;implement, and test a computational model of language comprehension  &lt;br/&gt;and eye movement control in reading built on principles of  &lt;br/&gt;probabilistic inference and rational action, using the tools of  &lt;br/&gt;natural language processing (NLP) technology, reinforcement learning,  &lt;br/&gt;and behavioral psycholinguistic experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this project is likely to have major impact in the  &lt;br/&gt;field of human sentence processing, bringing a new level of nuance and  &lt;br/&gt;detail to both theory and data analysis, and will bear on broad  &lt;br/&gt;current debates in cognitive science regarding rationality in  &lt;br/&gt;cognition. Additionally, the results of this basic research project  &lt;br/&gt;have a wide range of potential applications ranging from intelligent  &lt;br/&gt;tutoring technology to language-impairment diagnosis to cognitive  &lt;br/&gt;ergonomics. Together with this research program, the project involves  &lt;br/&gt;an educational program including a new textbook on probabilistic  &lt;br/&gt;models in the study of language, new undergraduate and graduate  &lt;br/&gt;courses, and tutorials and courses on computational psycholinguistics  &lt;br/&gt;at major conferences and summer institutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award is co-funded by two directorates:: CISE/IIS and SBE/BCS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Humans are able to use language to communicate with incredible flexibility and speed.  Every day we produce and understand hundreds of sentences that we have never encountered before.  This ubiquitous communicative success is especially impressive given the many challenges that successful language use faces: words and sentences are ambiguous, the communicative environment is noisy, our memory capacity is limited, and our knowledge of our interlocutors is incomplete.  The central goal of this CAREER project was to account for our successful use of language by developing, implementing, and testing a computational model of language comprehension built on principles of probabilistic inference and rational action. Research conducted in this project advanced our understanding of real-time language understanding in several respects.  A central thrust of our research focused on the development of a "noisy-channel" probabilistic model of sentence understanding, which went beyond previous models in not assuming a division between processes of individual-word recognition and grammatical analysis.  Rather, our new model takes the input to the language comprehension system as a set of uncertain perceptual inputs (auditory information in speech comprehension, visual information in reading); word recognition then turns out to be an incidental byproduct of the general process of probabilistic inference.  In this project we worked out several key mathematical and computational aspects of the architecture of this model.  Additionally, we tested several crucial predictions of the model using controlled psycholinguistic experiments investigating the interplay between word-level recognition and sentence-level comprehension.  Furthermore, by combining this model with reinforcement learning methods from artificial intelligence, we were able to develop a new model of eye movement control in reading, and have shown that it derives a range of hallmark patterns found in human eye movements in reading. Throughout the course of this project, we have disseminated our research results in over twenty peer-reviewed publications, and numerous conference presentations and invited seminars.  The project also supported considerable educational efforts: five students obtained their PhDs for work relating to the project, the PI developed and taught twice a new undergraduate course in computational linguistics at UC San Diego, and the PI taught five special summer courses and gave two summer-school and/or conference tutorials based on project research.  The project also supported work on a new textbook on probabilistic models in the study of language. The research on this project has advanced our understanding of the fundamental architecture of human language comprehension, one of the signature human cognitive capabilities, and has contributed evidence bearing on central and long-standing debates on rationality in human cognition. The results of this basic research project also have a wide range of future potential applications ranging from intelligent tutoring technology to language-impairment diagnosis to cognitive ergonomics.
