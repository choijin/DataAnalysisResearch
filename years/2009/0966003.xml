<AbstractNarration>This project is awarding scholarships to eighteen full-time students each year for 4 years. An annual award of $7,200 for up to four years will help support the scholars through degree completion. The scholarships are awarded to students in pursuit of Baccalaureate degree or enrolled in two year Associate degree program that plan to pursue a 4-year degree. Programs affected by this project include: Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Civil Engineering Technologies; Engineering Science and Alternative and Renewable Energy Applications of Engineering Technology. Scholars may minor in Physics or Mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

A no-cost extension of the program was requested and approved for 2014 to 2015 and 2015 to 2016; hence, the total duration of the program was six years (9/1/2010 to 8/31/2016).    The requirements for students enrolled into the S-STEM program included: 1) Citizenship or permanent residency of the United States; 2) Financially disadvantaged, evidenced by documentation such as a signed tax form or social services documentation; 3) Academically talented, evidenced by documentation such as transcript showing grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or better or high school records with Regent exam scores of 80 or above and above average in standardized test (ACT or SAT); 4) Two recommendation letters; 5) Essay requiring no less than 500 typed words about their life, accomplishments, and the future they would like to build for themselves, family and community.  Priority was given to women and under-represented ethnic minorities who met the requirements.  Each S-STEM scholarship recipient was awarded $7,200 per year for up to four years to enable them earn Bachelor's degree and/or Associate degree in one of the following programs: Mechanical Engineering Technology, Civil Engineering Technology, Electrical Engineering Technology, Alternative and Renewable Energy Applications and Engineering Science.  We had two cohorts of students: (a) The first cohort of 18 scholars recruited in the first year by fall 2011; and (b) The second cohort of 12 scholars who were recruited to replace any of the first cohort scholars who had graduated with Associate degree or left the program.  In total, 30 students participated in our S-STEM program.  Overall Outcome of our S-STEM Scholars:  Number of scholarship recipients: 30 scholars Percent of recipients graduated/retained: 77 % (23 scholars) Percent of graduated/retained recipients receiving Bachelor's degree: 74 % (17) Percent of graduated/retained recipients with Associate's degree: 26 % (6) Percent of graduated/retained recipients earning minor in Applied Physics and/or Math: 74 % (17) Percent of under-represented (women and ethnic minority) scholarship recipients: 60 % (18 of 30) Percent of graduated/retained under-represented scholarship recipients: 89 % (16 of 18)    Other Achievements: SUNY Canton S-STEM program achieved the following:  Provided professional development for all scholars (Conference attendance) Provided educational field trips for all scholars Provided a summer program in Physics and Mathematics Provided academic and enrichment support programs/mentorship for all scholars STEM seminars Presentations of the progress and outcome of the S-STEM program at national conferences A Publication in peer reviewed journal Supplemental recruitment activities Institutionalization of S-STEM tutoring center now Engineering Tutoring Lab   Intellectual Merit:  The project had a great impact on the principal field of engineering technology; and in physics and math.  It produced twenty-three (23) educated and skilled graduates with bachelor's and/or associate's degree within the discipline of engineering technology.  In addition, the cooperative summer program in physics and mathematics implemented in the project added to the fields of Physics and Mathematics.  Seventy-four percent (74 %) of our S-STEM graduates earned a minor in Applied Physics and/or Mathematics, producing engineers with solid backgrounds in Physics and Math.  Broader Impact: The S-STEM project targeted low income students, women and ethnic minorities. The effort yielded 60 % (18 of 30 S-STEM scholars) minority students in the program.  Our S-STEM program therefore, produced diverse set of skilled graduates going into the workforce in technical fields.   Beyond the bounds of science, engineering and the academic world, this project has impacted the society.  SUNY Canton is located in St. Lawrence County, one of the counties in the economically depressed region of rural northern New York State often referred to as the North Country.
