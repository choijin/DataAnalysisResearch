<AbstractNarration>In this project four collaborating labs -- Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of Rhode Island, University of Minnesota and Lamont-Doherty -- will undertake measurements on the US GEOTRACES North Atlantic section of the dissolved and particulate concentrations of 230Th and 231Pa, two isotopes designated as "key" or critical to the success of the GEOTRACES program. In addition, they will measure 232Th concentrations and provide supporting analyses of particle composition. The proposed work fulfills scientific objectives defined in the U.S. GEOTRACES North Atlantic Implementation Plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new 231Pa, 230Th and 232Th data are expected to lead to improved models of material exchange between the boundaries and interior Atlantic on a basin-wide scale. This project will permit the research team and the marine radiogeochemical community to test hypotheses regarding the relative importance of regional variations in circulation, particle composition, and particle flux that influence the redistribution of particle-associated elements, including carbon, trace metals and contaminants, between the continental shelf/slope regions and interior basins in the Atlantic. Furthermore, obtaining new water column 231Pa and 230Th data will allow testing of a key hypothesis: that 230Th is largely removed within the North Atlantic, whereas nearly half of the 231Pa produced in-situ is exported with North Atlantic Deep Water. Sedimentary 231Pa/230Th ratios have become the principal proxy used to evaluate past changes in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Completing the proposed work will characterize the importance of particle composition for 231Pa/230Th fractionation, and thereby constrain the potential bias in using 231Pa/230Th as a kinematic proxy for AMOC. These results, in turn, will lead to a more reliable assessment of the role of AMOC variability in past climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts The hypotheses and objectives outlined in this proposal are central to the International GEOTRACES program, whose focus is on the global-ocean distribution of trace elements and isotopes in seawater. 231Pa and 230Th are designated key parameters in the GEOTRACES Science Plan as their measurement on all sections is deemed to be critical to the success of this international ocean science program. The proposed research will provide new opportunities for graduate student (LDEO) and post doc (UMinn) research experience, enhance ocean science interactions between several US institutions (LDEO, URI, UMinn, WHOI), foster collaboration with international GEOTRACES colleagues, and contribute to existing science education programs designed for teachers and the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Trace elements such as iron, zinc and cobalt  serve as essential nutrients that influence the fertility of marine ecosystems.  Trace elements such as lead, mercury and copper also occur as contaminants in the ocean due to human activities.  Finally, trace elements, and their isotopes, serve as tracers for processes that we cannot observe directly, such as ocean circulation and the delivery of freshwater to the ocean via submarine groundwater discharge.    The international GEOTRACES program was designed to investigate the marine biogeochemical cycles of trace elements and their isotopes.  In other words, investigators seek to determine the sources of trace elements at ocean boundaries, including the interfaces with the atmosphere, the coast, and the sea bed, as well as to establish the processes that remove trace elements from the ocean, including active biological uptake by organisms and passive sorption to particles that settle from the sea surface into the abyss.   This project supported our work in the context of the U.S. GEOTRACES study of trace elements and their isotopes in the North Atlantic Ocean.  Our project uses naturally occurring radionuclides to determine locations of trace element supply and removal, while using radioactive disequilibria between soluble uranium isotopes and their insoluble decay products (thorium and protactinium) to determine the rates of those processes.   We found evidence for:  1) Boundary scavenging - enhanced removal of trace elements in regions of high biological productivity and particle flux off the coast of NW Africa.  2) Enhanced scavenging and removal within the extended hydrothermal plume emanating from the Mid Atlantic Ridge.  3) Enhanced scavenging and removal within benthic nepheloid layers, where resuspended particles provide abundant mineral surfacess for adsorption and removal of trace elements.  4) The predominant scavenging (removal) of dissolved Th and Pa by sorption to lithogenic minerals and to calcium carbonate.  Particulate organic matter has an order of magnitude affinity for sorption of these phases than we found for lithogenic and carbonate particles.  Opal was not an important particulate phase removing these tracers simply because of its very low abundance in the tropical North Atlantic.   We are also interpreting the combined distributions of Th-232 and Th-230 to provide estimates of:  1) The rate of supply of trace elements from dissolution of mineral aerosols in surface waters, and  2) The rate of supply of trace elements by exchange with sediments at ocean margins.  Results from our collaborative project were included in eGEOTRACES, an electronic atlas of selected static sections and 3-D animations created to visualize preliminary results from the GEOTRACES program. eGEOTRACES is publicly available at http://egeotraces.org.
