<AbstractNarration>This research program is aimed at performing three precision experimental searches for new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics.  The experiments use a maser operating simultaneously with Xe-129 and He-3.   By stabilizing one of the noble-gas masers to a frequency reference, the PI's group can control the environment of the masers and then use the other maser as a sensor for new physics.  The experiments to be carried out include:  (i) a sensitive test of the fundamental Lorentz invariance (one of the fundamental aspects of the theory of relativity) and CPT (Charge conjugation, Parity, and Time reversal) symmetry for the neutron; (ii) an order-of-magnitude improved search for the effects of torsion gravity, which arises if spacetime has a Riemann-Cartan geometry; and (iii) a sensitive search for anomalous spin-spin interactions in the neutron sector.  For experiment (i) and (ii) the project is expected to provide an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to the best previous limits. Much of our understanding of fundamental physics would have to be radically altered if an effect is observed.  Experiment (iii) will provide a first sensitive search of this effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the program include the application of the atomic physics based precision measurement techniques of this research into the development of novel biomedical imaging tools (for example magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at low magnetic fields of hyperpolarized noble gas inhaled into human lungs), as well as the development of a high-sensitivity magnetometer using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond.  Other broader impacts include extensive student training with continued successful focus on inclusion and training in precision measurements techniques of students and postdocs who are members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we performed upgrades of a two-species (3He and 129Xe) noble gas maser &mdash; a kind of atomic clock &mdash; to enable: (i) a sensitive test of fundamental spacetime symmetries for the neutron, and (ii) an improved search for the effects of torsion gravity.  We also performed a new analysis of experiments using rotating cryogenic sapphire oscillators, which set improved constraints on the possibilities of there being either an isotropic shift or anisotropies of the speed of light.  These experiments employ high-precision measurements tools such as atomic clocks to provide a complementary, small-scale approach to answering "big science" questions such as whether there is a preferred reference frame to the universe, and how can we reconcile the (at times) inconsistent predictions of quantum theory and relativity.  As a broader impact of this research, we continued development of precision optically-probed magnetometers using polarized electronic spins associated with nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers found in diamond.  Such NV-diamond magnetometers may have wide-ranging impact in both the physical and life sciences.  Students and postdoctoral researchers were active participants in all phases of this research: design, construction, and execution of experiments; detailed calculations; analysis of data; presentation of results at scientific meetings; and writing scientific papers.  In addition, the Principal Investigator (Dr. Walsworth) described the scientific process and results from this NSF-supported research in a wide variety of presentations ranging from scientific conferences and seminars to public lectures.
