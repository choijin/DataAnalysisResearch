<AbstractNarration>DRL: DR K-12&lt;br/&gt;PI: Wiburg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project Math Snacks:  Addressing Gaps in Conceptual Mathematics Understanding with Innovative Media, led by mathematics and education faculty at New Mexico State University, is developing and evaluating effectiveness of 15 - 20 short computer mediated animations and games that are designed to:  (1) increase students? conceptual understanding in especially problematic topics of middle grades mathematics; and (2) increase students' mathematics process skills with a focus on capabilities to think and talk mathematically.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The basic research question of the project is whether the planned collection of computer-mediated animations and games can provide an effective strategy for helping students who experience difficulty with core middle grades mathematics concepts and whether the same material can be a useful tool for ordinary classroom instruction.  The project is developing and testing the effectiveness of an extensive set of such learning tools, companion print materials as needed to assist learners in developing conceptual understanding, and short video clips documenting best practices by exemplary teachers using the developed materials with students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pilot study in year 3 and a substantial randomized control trial in year 4 are testing the effects of using the Math Snacks software on student learning and retention of middle school mathematics, as measured by performance on disaggregated strands of New Mexico state mathematics assessments. Thus the project will produce software applets, teacher materials, and useful empirical evidence about the efficacy of their use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the key features of the Math Snacks project is development of the mediated games and simulations in a form that can be used by students outside of normal classroom settings on media and game players that are ubiquitous and popular among today's young people.  Thus the project holds the promise of exploiting learning in informal settings to enhance traditional school experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ OUCOMES REPORT  Math Snacks:  Addressing Gaps in Conceptual Mathematics Understanding with Innovative Media was funded to develop, test and research innovative media designed to fill conceptual gaps in mathematics learning for middle school students.  Besides the learning tools (games, animations, teacher and learner support materials), other important outcomes of this project include: (1) Evidence that games used with classroom inquiry increase math learning; (2) The power of an interdisciplinary Learning Games Design Model; and (3) Sustainable partnerships resulting in extensive worldwide use of Math Snacks.     (1)  Evidence that games assist with mathematics understanding.  Findings from several large studies, including a randomized control trial showed increased and sustained learning after using the Math Snacks Intervention. In the random-controlled study with 741 fifth-grade students in fourteen schools, Math Snacks, when used in the classroom along with the curriculum, helped students achieve higher learning gains in the content areas number and operations, proportions/ratios, coordinates and fractions. Students also expressed more confidence about being able to do math in the future, most significantly with regards to content addressed in the games.

Click on Research     (2)  The Effectiveness of an Interdisciplinary Learning Games Design Model  Students, teachers, mathematicians, mathematics educators, game designers, and industry experts worked as a team throughout the design process to develop Math Snacks.  The final development of the products includes six animations, five games, teacher support materials including teacher guides, learner guides, "teaching with" videos filmed in classrooms, and comic book transcripts for animations.  All Math Snacks are freely accessible online and student materials are also available in Spanish. All Math Snacks products can be found at MathSnacks.org.

(3)  Partnerships and Sustainability  In order to ensure the sustainability of Math Snacks there is a system in place to manage the MathSnacks.org website, partnerships, social media, and distribution agreements.     MathSnacks.org provides a portal where all Math Snacks materials are freely available.  BrainPOP, a leading portal of educational media for schools, offers Math Snacks games at its GameUp site in both English and Spanish, where the materials are used millions of times per year.  GlassLab Games has integrated the Math Snacks game Game Over Gopher into its learning assessment system, which provides dynamic reports on student performance and helps teachers evaluate conceptual understanding.  PBS Learning Media has also licensed two Math Snacks games and several animations for their MathCore project.  The online portal Hippocampus (part of the NROC project) hosts the full set of Math Snacks tools.  Math Snacks animations, gameplay videos, and teacher support videos have received more than 450,000 views o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
