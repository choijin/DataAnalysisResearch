<AbstractNarration>Ecologists continue to debate the relative importance of biotic interactions such as predation, competition, and herbivory versus abiotic factors such as climate in regulating population and community dynamics. This project, now in its twentieth year, started as a large-scale investigation of the importance of biotic interactions in a Chilean semiarid thorn scrub community. Excluding predators has had significant though transient effects on plants, herbivores and their predators, while high rainfall events have resulted in dramatic responses by all community members.  Three of 5 El Niño (high rainfall) events during the last 10 years portend more frequent and intense El Niños, a predicted consequence of global climate change.  These in turn may significantly alter the dynamics of important community components.  This project will assess the impact of changes in precipitation patterns on native vs. introduced species (especially rabbits and hares), in light of recent changes in the precipitation regime.  New experiments will  exclude rabbits or hares, and both rabbits or hares and small mammals, allowing the investigators to quantify the impacts of these herbivores while testing predictions for how global climate change-related alterations in precipitation will affect native plants, primary consumers, their predators, and interactions among these components.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing evidence for effects of stronger and more frequent El Niño events in this Chilean community will provide a baseline for comparison with ongoing changes in arid and semiarid systems worldwide.  The project depends on a strong, intellectual collaboration with Chilean scientists and their students, and provides valuable training for students and technicians in the fields of ecology, environmental biology, environmental management and conservation, and global change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our long-term research in north-central Chile has now completed its 26th year of field effort. Initially designed to evaluate the relative importance of competition vs. predation in this semi-arid system, the importance of abiotic, extrinsic influences became evident when rainfall associated with the El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exceeded 200 mm in both 1991 and 1992 (the long-term mean is about 123 mm), and the project shifted into a study on the relative importance of biotic (predation, competition) and abiotic (rainfall) factors.  By about 2003 we had experienced three El Ni&ntilde;o/wet periods and the responses by plants, small mammals, and predators were qualitatively similar.  Plant productivity increased dramatically, feeding an increase in small mammal numbers, which resulted in greater food for predators; however, the dry phase of the ENSO cycle returned within 1-3 years, with resulting reduction in plant and small mammal abundance.  We initiated inventories of birds and insects around this time in order to compare their responses to those of small mammals to rainy/dry periods. However, since about 2000-2002 our site appears to have experienced a major change in rainfall patterns, with moderately increased mean annual rainfall coupled with significantly reduced variation across years; since 2002 only three years (2004, 2006, 2011) have exceeded the long-term mean annual rainfall. Note, however, that the past 3-4 years have been characterized by drought in this region of Chile, and 2014 was the fourth driest year since this project was initiated.  One apparent consequence of the altered rainfall regime has been elevated dominance of one small mammal species, the degu (Octodon degus), which has comprised at least 50% of the biomass of small mammals at our site in all periods since 2001 (and &ge;60% since 2010).  Since 2011 this species has comprised approximately 80% of small mammal biomass, and thus, may reflect a fundamental assemblage shift at this site.  Degus are diurnal and an important food source for many predators at this site.  They also are herbivorous and they indirectly facilitate the establishment of non-native annual plant species by reducing cover by native plant species.  Given these observations, research currently emphasizes monitoring of diverse elements that comprised the initial emphasis (ephemeral plants, shrubs, small mammals, predators) as well as groups that have since come to our attention as potentially important here.  Introduced lagomorphs (European rabbit, European hare) also facilitate invasion of exotic plants and appear to have sporadic population density in response to rainfall.  Bird community structure and composition fluctuates seasonally and we continue to monitor this in preparation for wetter times.  Insects are now monitored as key food for birds as well as one core small mammal species, the marsupial mouse (Thylamys elegans).  Recent efforts have produced a manual to avian plumages which will allow researchers to document ages and sexes of most species at this site, in turn allowing for non-invasive documentation of avian recruitment in response to wet and dry periods.  We hope to seek additional funds to add this element to our research program.  Finally, work by one of our Chilean collaborators has documented that mycorrhizal fungi are significantly more abundant in control plots relative to plots that excluded small mammals, and saprophytic soil fungi were less abundant in the presence of small mammals.  We also look forward to further work to document the "hidden" influence of small mammal exclusion on soil chemistry and biota.  To our surprise, small mammal numbers continue to remain relatively high given the limited rainfall in recent years.  This past year (2014) was a dry year (45 mm) and followed two dry years, but small mammal numbers on our core 16 grids remained much higher (16,742 captures of 1820 individuals) than in the last year with similar rainf...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
