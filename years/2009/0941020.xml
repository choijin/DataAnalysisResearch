<AbstractNarration>This project is developing a set of learning materials and laboratory modules in tele-healthcare to be used in undergraduate electrical and computer engineering curricula.  The materials are organized into five project-lab trees and ten topic-subject trees that are self-contained and that may be used in any order.  Specific topics covered by the new laboratory materials include design project in cardiac monitoring, mental health monitoring, medical security and long-distance medical transmission.  The learning materials are being developed using a four-dimensional pedagogy that engages students with different learning preferences and allows for asynchronous delivery.  The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an experienced independent evaluator.  The evaluation plan is designed to establish the quality of the materials and to ensure the project goals are met.  The projects results are being disseminated through conferences and journal publications and through direct contact with four other institutions of higher education with diverse student bodies.  The materials developed in this project are being placed in the NSF sponsored National Science Digital Library.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This educational development has successfully achieved the following 5 outcomes: (please refer to our project website: http://feihu.eng.ua.edu/NSF_TUES/ for our developed course materials)  (1) Course - One semester course on telehealthcare engineering: Although Tele-Healthcare Engineering is such an important field, unfortunately most schools do not have systematic undergraduate educational materials on tele-healthcare design.

(4) Students training: Attracted more engineering students to pursue telehealthcare research: By learning our developed tele-healthcare course and labs/projects, the students have shown stronger desire to pursue biomedical research. Some of them decide to pursue graduate studies in biomedical fields. The senior design teams have found the telemedicine hardware/software designs are extremely helpful in putting what they have learned in ECE major together into a complete project. Some of them successfully obtained good jobs in relevant fields.  (5) Benefits to higher education: Results have been disseminated to other schools: We have broadcasted our course materials to other schools through emails, phone calls, publications, and websites. Our results have been presented in ASEE conference. And we have published a book called "Tele-Healthcare Computing and Engineering: Principles and Design," Publisher: Science Publishers, CRC Press, Apr 2013. ISBN 9781578088027. Because our development crosses both biomedical and computer engineering fields, it is an excellent complement to existing healthcare education in colleges.  In summary, the intellectual merits of this project include (1) a series of telehealthcare course materials (labs, projects, lectures, etc.), (2) a novel teaching methodology that uses build block style to decompose the labs into mini-labs for effective learning, and (3) a research-oriented lab design that motivates the students to seek more research materials during the lab process. The broader impacts of this project include (1) an effective training of undergraduate students in tele-healthcare hardware an...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
