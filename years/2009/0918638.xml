<AbstractNarration>The mating system of the acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) is among the most complex of any vertebrate: groups consist of up to seven breeding males, as many as three reproductive females and a variable number helpers (offspring of previous years that remain on the natal territory and do not breed).  Males compete to mate and females lay their eggs communally in the same nest.  Breeders of the same sex are almost always close relatives, either siblings or parents and offspring. Previous work showed that joint-nesting groups of females, unlike males, share parentage equally. This project will determine the factors that influence reproductive sharing in acorn woodpecker societies by combining fieldwork on color-marked birds with modern molecular techniques to identify individuals that successfully produce young within social groups and to quantify their behavior.  A primary goal of the project is to understand the fitness consequences of cooperative breeding and to integrate findings into the larger questions of the evolution and ecology of group living in highly social species, including humans.</AbstractNarration>

Funding for this project allowed us to critically evaluate the limits of kin selection theory and fitness measures for predicting social behavior in complex vertebrate societies.  Acorn woodpeckers are a keystone species within California oak woodlands, a habitat threatened due to urban development, poor regeneration, and "sudden oak death". These oak woodlands include some of the most extensive old-growth forests remaining in North America (and are part of the California Floristic Province, a "biodiversity hotspot" containing a disproportionate share of endemic and threatened species). The work we completed has been particularly instructive with respect to understanding the role of cavity limitation for a species that is a critical member of the California oak woodland "nest-web".  The project included a significant educational component in the form of research training of undergraduate students in molecular biology at Gonzaga University (10 participated extensively; 16 others did short-term projects).
