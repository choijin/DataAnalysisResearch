<AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to improve the retention and graduation of undergraduate engineering students. The investigators are designing several interventions that will enhance the students' interest and self-efficacy, two key factors that have been shown to be strongly predictive of academic choice goals in engineering and non-engineering students.  The components of the program include a first-year summer experience, peer mentoring for first-year students and new transfers, living and learning communities, a transfer student seminar, and research fellowships. Each component of the program provides critical support at key junctures in the students' academic careers and provides reinforcing experiences so that the students can begin to see themselves in an engineering career. These components are designed to: (1) facilitate the first-year students' and new transfer students' transition into the school of engineering; (2) increase students' commitment to engineering majors through career clarification and goal setting; (3) reduce the barriers to success that students may face, particularly those for women and underrepresented students; and (4) enhance the positive personal and environmental factors for students in engineering.  The evaluation effort is being led by a experienced evaluator and is analyzing institutional data, satisfaction and attitudinal surveys, annual student academic and career plans, and two career interest inventories (i. e., the Strong Interest Inventory and the Skills Confidence Inventory). Broader impacts include the focus on underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

The SEEDS Program was designed to provide support programs to improve the retention and graduation rates of undergraduate engineering students. The goals included: (1) facilitating first year and new transfer student transition into the Clark School, (2) reducing barriers that students may face, particularly those for underrepresented racial/ethnic minority students and women, (3) enhancing positive personal and environmental factors for students, and (4) increasing students? commitment to engineering.  Building on successful retention programs in the Women in Engineering Program, SEEDS consisted of five interventions that provided critical support at key points throughout student academic careers: the First Year Summer Experience (FYSE), the Peer Mentoring Program, Flexus and Virtus Living &amp; Learning Communities (LLCs) in engineering, and Research Fellowships.  The FYSE was a three-week residential summer program that provided a math-intensive, engineering problem-solving course focused on ensuring that students have the foundational pre-calculus skills to succeed in engineering coursework. Engineering students with relatively poor math preparation, as well as students who indicated they were interested in engineering on their college application but were admitted to Letters &amp; Sciences (L&amp;S), were invited to participate in FYSE.  The Flexus (women) and Virtus (men) engineering LLCs are two-year cohort-based programs for first-year engineering students. Participants share a common floor in a residence hall, and take key first-year math, science, and engineering courses together. In addition, Flexus and Virtus students participate in a one-credit seminar each semester of the program, which provides academic and social support.  Through the SEEDS Peer Mentoring Program, peer mentoring was available for all new engineering students. In the fall semester, there was a formal program for first-year students, including the L&amp;S FYSE participants and new transfer students. For transfer students entering in the spring semester, the Peer Mentoring program extended into the spring semester to serve new spring transfer students.  Students who participated in one or more of the SEEDS programs were eligible to apply for SEEDS Research Fellowships. Research fellows worked with a faculty mentor during the academic year or over the summer on a research project.  To increase retention, specific objectives were identified and mapped to the SEEDS Program interventions:  Develop community among new students (addressed by the LLCs, mentoring, and FYSE). Provide an introduction to engineering problem solving and honing pre-calculus knowledge (addressed by the LLCS and FYSE). Provide mentors and role models (addressed by the LLCs, mentoring, FYSE, and research fellows). Work with students in Letters and Sciences who are interested in transferring into engineering (addressed by FYSE).   First-year students who participated in one or more SEEDS programs have been positively impacted since the grant?s inception. As reported by Smith, Kurban, and Amelink (2017), among the fall 2010 to fall 2015 first-year engineering cohorts, there were 1,707 first-year engineering student who opted to participate in SEEDS and 1,899 students who opted not to participate. SEEDS participants (79.8% of 1707 students) were retained at significantly higher rates in comparison to those students who did not participate (75.9% of 1899, p&le;0.005, X2=7.928).  Students who participated in both an engineering LLC (Flexus or Virtus) and peer mentoring were retained at the highest rate (83.9%) (p&le;0.002, X2=14.533), followed by students who only participated in an LLC (81.7%) or only mentoring (78.1%).
