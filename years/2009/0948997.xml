<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, a scalable approach to enable students to acquire important attributes of global competence will be developed. The central idea behind the research is to bring together international student design teams which collaborate on design projects via Internet-based communication and design tools. At the same time, the teams will be used as a test bed to study and develop methods for collaborative design education. Thus the research has two main objectives: 1) to develop and refine a scalable framework and&lt;br/&gt;supporting infrastructure that allows engineering students to learn and practice best-in-class methods for global engineering design, and 2) to provide an environment to study, develop, refine and validate methods and technologies for Internet-based collaborative, global engineering design education. These two objectives are synergistic and will be pursued simultaneously. The research will be conducted as a pilot program run for two years. During the first year, teams at Brigham Young University will be matched with teams abroad on a design-and-build project. The project will be conducted within the context of a class. The main focus of the first year will be on understanding implementation issues, i.e., answering questions such as ?How should projects be selected?,? and ?How can technology be used to support effective collaboration?? For the second year, teams at four universities in the U.S. will be matched with teams abroad. The focus of the second year will be on evaluating how well this approach is able to develop key attributes of global competence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the research could be far reaching and significant. The research is seen as a necessary first step towards the possible development of a national network of U.S. teams partnered with international teams. Although we are here proposing only a pilot program, we consider a main criterion of success to be whether the program is extensible to schools beyond those in the pilot. If successful, many students could thereby acquire and practice global engineering skills.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Engineering is increasingly taking place in a global environment. Accordingly, a 2008 NSF summit on the globalization of engineering called on educators to "integrate global education into the engineering curriculum to impact all students, recognizing global competency as one of the highest priorities for all graduates." The development of global competence for engineering students is, however, a challenging task. Traditional approaches to developing global competence, such as faculty-supervised study abroad programs, are resource intensive and often involve only a small fraction of students. Expanding these programs for more students is difficult due to the corresponding scaling of scarce faculty resources.  One alternative approach is global, virtual (GV) teams. These types of teams are usually defined as being geographically dispersed, spanning several different countries or cultures, being composed of team members with little prior association or common background, and communicating through electronic means. Although some GV teams travel at the beginning or end of a project, travel is not required. Thus GV teams can be a less expensive means of providing students with a global experience.  The main objectives of this research were 1) to assess if GV teams could be a means of developing important attributes of global competence, 2) to compare the effectiveness of GV teams to more traditional study abroad programs, and 3) to better understand the issues involved in running GV teams in an academic setting.  The main activities of the research were the following:  Both academic leaders and leaders from industry were surveyed to develop a ranked list of attributes associated with global competence.  GV teams were introduced as part of Mechanical Engineering (ME) 471, Advanced Computer-aided Design Tools, a senior level course taught at Brigham Young University (BYU). BYU students were matched with students at universities in Korea, China, Taiwan, Mexico, Canada and Brazil to form GV teams. Additionally, a few GV teams were incorporated as part of ME 475/476, Mechanical Engineering Capstone Design. Assessment of learning in the GV team structure was conducted through surveys, observations, and interviews.  Engineering Study Abroad programs at BYU were surveyed two years to determine the competency levels of students in those programs. These included programs in China, Mexico, Peru, Europe and Singapore. These were compared to competency levels of GV teams.  The main findings of the research indicate that GV teams can be a means of developing important attributes of global competence such as using electronic collaboration tools in intercultural interactions, developing multicultural team skills, developing multicultural leadership skills, and understanding how culture influences team processes.     In comparison with GV teams, technical study abroad programs were found to be superior in developing many of the "dispositional" attributes of global competence such as appreciating and respecting cultural differences, developing a desire to learn about different cultures, and practicing tolerance and flexibility when involved in intercultural interactions.  Through an analysis of communication messages and interviews, students who had instruction about GV team principles during their GV team experience established deeper levels of trust on a GV team.  Much experience was gained in running GV teams and a set of best practices was developed. There was agreement among a set of universities engaged in GV teams about the high learning value of a global project, from both a technical and professional growth perspective.
