    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to overcome barriers limiting multicore processor clock frequencies and to achieve faster clock and data throughput rates with technology scaling than currently possible. The approach is to design hardware and software infrastructure into multicore processors that enables low cost comparison testing of the individual processor cores and test driven tuning of processor circuitry for high-speed core operation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work lies in the ability of the underlying test and adaptation algorithms to extract the maximum amount of performance from the process cores that they are capable of delivering under inter and intra die process variations and electrical field degradation. Such adaptation is achieved with limited test and diagnosis cost while allowing possible "test escapes" to be handled in a fail-safe manner that does not result in a system crash. The diagnostics information generated is used to tune individual processor core circuitry for speed purposes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include the ability to run advanced applications on multicore processors in, for example, future 4G mobile wireless systems including high definition video, interactive displays, image processing, data mining algorithms and other pervasive computing tasks that demand high processor throughput at low power for low heat dissipation and high device reliability. The project will also enable training of students and industry personnel in a new interdisciplinary field that involves fundamental concepts from electrical engineering, device physics and computer science through prototype demonstrations, seminars, workshops, cooperative research and student internships in industry.</AbstractNarration>
