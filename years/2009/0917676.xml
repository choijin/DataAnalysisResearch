<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the development of mobility strategies for&lt;br/&gt;Robotic Sensor Networks (RSNs) which are networks of robots equipped&lt;br/&gt;with communication, computation and sensing capabilities.  For RSN&lt;br/&gt;technology to be utilized in critical applications such as emergency&lt;br/&gt;response and environmental monitoring, mobility algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;operation in dynamic and complex environments are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, three novel mobility problems which arise in many RSN&lt;br/&gt;applications are introduced. These problems are general enough to&lt;br/&gt;capture the interplay between communication, sensing and&lt;br/&gt;mobility. Yet, they can be succinctly formulated as geometric&lt;br/&gt;optimization problems. This work will focus on solving these mobility&lt;br/&gt;problems which will yield provably correct solutions for numerous RSN&lt;br/&gt;applications. In addition, bounds on the performance of a given RSN in&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems such as tracking, collaborative sensing and&lt;br/&gt;estimation will be established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The output of this research will be a significant step toward enabling&lt;br/&gt;the use of fully autonomous RSNs for crucial applications in emergency&lt;br/&gt;response, energy and environmental monitoring, and health care&lt;br/&gt;automation.  Sensing and actuation play important roles in the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of information technology. The project will contribute to&lt;br/&gt;this evolution through the development of novel distributed sensing&lt;br/&gt;and control algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A robotic sensor network is a network of robots equipped with sensing capabilities.  In this project we have introduced three novel robotic sensor network tasks:  Mobile observers whose goal is to station themselves to  observe (stationary or mobile) phenomena Mobile routers whose goal is to main the connectivity of a user to a base station Mobile beacons whose goal is to accurately localize targets.    For these three sets of problems, we developed strategies with provable performance guarantees. In particular, we studied them under a game-theoretic framework where we assumed that the targets are actively trying to make the network fail. The advantage of this formulation is that if we can guarantee performance under this model, we can achieve it no matther haw the targets move.   The project has been a rich source of intellectually stimulating research problems for graduate and undergraduate students, and led to numerous journal and conference publications.  Three groups of undergraduates (total of 12) have participated in summer research experiences based on these problems. Ph.D. students supported by this project worked on theoretical problems and collaborated with other students working on field systems to deploy their algorithms in field applications.  This CAREER project played a significant role in the PI's career development who is now a tenured Associate professor.
