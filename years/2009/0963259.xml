<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) to renovate the west wing of Stanley Hall, constructed in 1972 and shared by faculty in biology and chemistry. The renovation will affect about 5000 sq. ft. of laboratory space, which will be organized into "research neighborhoods". The theme of each research neighborhood will be dominated by the instrumentation it houses (analytical, biochemical, molecular, synthesis, and support). The renovation will provide house utilities that are currently inadequate or lacking, such as house air, vacuum, purified water and nitrogen gas, as well as improved storage, shelving and bench configuration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The faculty in chemistry and biology have a strong track record of collaboration. The renovated and reorganized space is expected to foster and stimulate further collaboration, new research projects, student research training and recruitment of new faculty as well as competitiveness and productivity of current faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earlham College serves a student body that includes 12% underrepresented minorities as well as students from underserved and rural areas. These students will benefit from enhanced research training. In addition, the renovated facility will be used for outreach activities and to stimulate collaboration with local industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of Earlham CollegeÆs grant was to update and reorganize our  research facility in Stanley Hall to facilitate the type of science  research that is currently being done.  To that end, we proposed  reorganizing our space into research neighborhoods that would be  organized by function, promote efficient/effective use of space, and  foster even greater interactions between faculty and students. We also  had a goal of modernizing the space by incorporating house utilities  including compressed air, 18MOhm water, nitrogen and vacuum throughout  the facility.  Receiving this NSF award inspired EarlhamÆs board of  trustees to commit to raising additional funds for more extensive  renovation and construction of a new teaching and research facility for  physics, astronomy, and mathematics that will break ground in 2014.     The constructed research neighborhoods included Analytical (sample  preparation and instrumentation), Biochemistry, Molecular and  Physiological, Synthesis and Support. In total, the actual NSF  renovation was 6275 sq.ft. compared to 4274 in the original grant, for a  47% increase in research neighborhood space. In addition to improving  the facility in terms of collaborations and efficiency/effectiveness,  the spaceÆs energy efficiency will be approximately 50% of its  pre-renovation usage.  The original grant called for a 14% Earlham match  to account for the percentage of time that the research areas would be  utilized for teaching purposes.  Because of the increased scope of work  in the research neighborhoods, the total cost was $1,823,708.77, which  was much larger than the original proposal. Therefore, the college match  was $1,015,914.77 or 56% of the total cost, and the NSF grant  ($807,794) was only 44% of the total cost.  This spending contributed  significantly to the local economy as 76% of the direct cost dollars for  the project went to Wayne County-based contractors.  If specialties  with no Wayne County providers are factored out, then the local  participation amounts to 97% of the total direct costs.  This local  economic impact is consistent with the goals of the ARRA of which the  NSF-ARI-R2 grant was a part.     The NSF-ARI-R2 grant that supported renovations to Stanley Hall has  had a transformative effect on EarlhamÆs CollegeÆs science department.     The development of research neighborhoods and the inclusion of  dependable, on-site molecular grade water, vacuums, air and gas at lab  stations, has greatly ensured that students can efficiently conduct  research from one central location. Further, faculty say there is  confidence that the research being completed will have a successful  endpoint and yield more publishable results for students, further  increasing their marketability to employers or admissions counselors at  post-graduate institutions.     Already, one in every 10 Earlhamites complete some form of doctoral study.  From 1992 to 2006, the College ranked 10th among 1,533 institutions of higher learning in the U.S. in the  percentage of graduates who went on to receive Ph.D.Æs in the biological  sciences, according to a study by the Higher Education Data Consortium.  Of those receiving Ph.D.Æs in the life sciences in general, Earlham  ranks 14th, according to the same study.     With state-of-the-art resources in the sciences and an increased  emphasis on collaboration between science disciplines, Earlham faculty  will also be better equipped to work alongside students and guide them  in empirical research in a variety of scientific disciplines. About 85  percent of faculty report having worked collaboratively with students on  meaningful research, which is a key element of our strategic plan.     The construction was completed in mid-August in time for the start of  the fall semester.  Because of this timing, the amount of research and  research training thus far has been more limited.
