<AbstractNarration>This research revisits records of Holocene ice rafting (IRD) events in the North Atlantic that were originally interpreted as evidence that solar irradiance was an important driver for centennial- to millennial- scale climate changes in that region (Bond et al., 2001). The research addresses several key issues that have arisen since the original publication of the IRD records by: 1) replicating the published Holocene results using the same samples and techniques, 2) generating new Holocene records from cores throughout the region of interest, and 3) comparing results with beryllium-10 and radiocarbon records, which are proxies for solar variability through time. Results bear on the important question of whether and how small variations in solar forcing can influence climate. Funding supports a postdoctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to study climate variability in the western North Atlantic during the current interglacial period, which started around 10,000 years ago. During interglacial periods climate variability was not as abrupt as during glacial periods but we can see variations in the climate. The cause of that climate variability is still not fully understood.   In order to study climate fluctuations in western North Atlantic we used indicators of changes in iceberg and sea ice discharges from the Arctic and the East Greenland coast southwards. Those indicators are small pieces of rock carried by the icebergs and sea ice from the continent to the sea, called ice-rafted debris. The ice-rafted debris are deposited in deep sea sediments when the icebergs and sea ice melt at southern latitudes. The occurrence of ice-rafted debris in deep sea sediments off Greenland coasts indicates that icebergs and sea ice were passing by and melting. The frequency of those debris indicates periods of higher/lower ice discharges.  Our study of sea ice conditions during the last 150 years at the East Greenland coast close to Denmark Strait reveals that this area was almost perennially ice covered until 1910, and seasonally open after that.  Our study south of Greenland reveals that ice-rafting was strong during the late Medieval Warm period (Medieval Warm period lasted approximately between 950 and 1250 yr AD), when temperatures in Europe and the eastern side of the Atlantic were as warm or even warmer than at present. This strong ice-rafting was probably linked to warm temperatures over Greenland that induced strong calving in Southeast Greenland glaciers. Ice-rafting was also strong during the Little Ice Age (which lasted from 1400 to 1850 yr AD) when the climate in Europe was colder than at present. But a big part of those debris came from the Arctic transported by sea ice because during this period the sea ice flux from the Arctic strengthened due to the colder temperatures and favourable atmospheric conditions. The ice-rafting occurred during the Medieval Warm period due to warming may have contributed to cool the subpolar gyre which would have reduced deep ocean circulation.  A similar interval of high ice-rafting occurred 3000 years before present and that event is linked to a reduction in deep ocean circulation.  The study of the minerals present in the sediments indicates where the ice-rafted debris came from and help us to understand the role of iceberg and sea ice discharges on climate. Understanding the role of ice discharges to the subpolar gyre may be a key factor to make accurate predictions of future climate       Last Modified: 03/24/2014       Submitted by: David J Hollander]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
