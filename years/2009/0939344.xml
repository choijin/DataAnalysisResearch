<AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, "A Practical Approach to Integrating Nanotechnology Education into Undergraduate Curriculum", at North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NCAT), under the direction of Dr. Dhananjay Kumar, will bring together a team of engineering faculty members who are actively involved in nanomaterials-based research to enhance undergraduate nanoscience and engineering education in the area of devices and systems. The goal of the project is to expose undergraduate students to the design, manufacturing and characterization of nanostructured materials systems and device prototypes. An interdisciplinary nanotechnology course (Nanotechnology I) with a significant hands-on laboratory component will be developed as a preparatory course and will be offered as a junior-level technical elective open to all engineering majors.</AbstractNarration>
