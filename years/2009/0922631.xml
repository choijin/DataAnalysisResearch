<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combined use of microscopy and high-resolution fluorescence imaging is a fundamental tool for exploration of the physical and biological world. This Major Research Instrumentation grant from the NSF provides the Dartmouth community with a state-of-the-art multi-photon microscopy facility that will drive three broad lines of scientific inquiry. The first research area is exploring fundamental properties of the mammalian central nervous system, including neural development and neuronal signaling, in vitro and in vivo. A second line of research is investigating fundamental aspects of cellular biology, including cellular signaling and intracellular trafficking of proteins. A third avenue of research will explore novel uses for multi-photon imaging for biological and non-biological applications. All of these research areas benefit from the increased quantum efficiency and reduced phototoxicity and photo-bleaching that are inherent in multi-photon imaging. The NSF-provided multi-photon imaging facility greatly enhances and expands the research capabilities of a broad range of laboratories at Dartmouth, and is fostering new collaborative research projects among a diverse group of users. New findings will be disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations, and local media. In addition to facilitating research, the multi-photon imaging facility is advancing the education and training of the next generation of scientific investigators. Training in advanced optical techniques is made available to more than 200 laboratories across the institution, including more than 250 graduate students. Access to this new instrumentation increases the research opportunities and experiences available to Dartmouth graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>
