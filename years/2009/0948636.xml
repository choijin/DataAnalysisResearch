<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to provide a much improved understanding and characterization of the process of fission-track annealing in the mineral apatite.  Fission tracks form when uranium decays by spontaneous fission, and the damage caused by the fissioning particles anneals (is repaired) at a rate determined by the ambient temperature.  Fission-track analysis has thus proven to be a powerful tool for determining the thermal history of rock bodies, and is widely used for tectonic studies, landscape evolution, and petroleum exploration, among other fields.  The advances created by this research will be used to discern the nature of faulting that caused the final stages of uplift of mountain ranges in southern and west-central Arizona.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Although apatite fission-track thermochronology is a well-established and robust technique, our understanding of how annealing occurs, and how it is affected by apatite composition, remains extremely vague. Experimental studies have shown that impurities such as chlorine, iron and manganese can increase temperatures required for annealing by several tens of degrees, but the experimental database is currently far too sparse to determine how impurities work individually and/or in concert to bring about these changes.  This study will vastly expand the annealing database by utilizing an efficient procedure to determine the relative annealing properties of 30 apatites with widely varying compositions and unit cell dimensions.  These data will provide insight not only into compositional effects, but into the annealing mechanism itself.  The resulting new model of fission-track annealing will be used to examine the relative roles of high-angle and low-angle normal faulting in the final stages of core-complex exhumation in the Arizona Basin and Range.  Recent work has suggested that low-angle faulting may have accelerated to near-plate-tectonic rates.  However, the data may also be explained by a transition from low-angle to high-angle faulting.  These two scenarios make different predictions about how cooling rates vary in time and space depending on proximity to faults.  The improvements in the fission-track method will be used to test these predictions, either confirming a dramatic transition in movement rates possibly caused by the migration of the slab window off of western North America, or illuminating how the nature of unroofing can change during a continuous episode of exhumation. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project had two primary components.  The first was to acquire experimental data to better understand how fission damage anneals in the mineral apatite.  When uranium spontaneously fissions in natural materials, the result is a damage trail that can be revealed by chemical etching and measured under a microscope.  This damage heals (anneals) when the mineral is heated, and by counting fission tracks and measuring their lengths we can reconstruct the thermal histories of rocks (i.e. what temperature they were at what time).  The most-used mineral for fission-track analysis is apatite, but the temperatures required for damage annealing can vary considerably with apatite composition.  This study acquired new data that documented how various atomic substitutions affect annealing rates.  While work is ongoing, the end result will be a new model that better reflects compositional effects, and thus will be useful across a range of fields that utilize thermal history analysis.  The new model promises to be widely used for a range of applications, from petroleum exploration to reconstructing the history of basins and mountains.   The second component was to acquire apatite fission-track data to examine the uplift history of two metamorphic core complexes in Arizona, and Santa Catalina-Rincon Mountains near Tucson and the Harcuvar Mountains in west-central Arizona.  The detailed thermal history information provided by apatite fission-track analysis and modeling provides new insights into how and when these mountain ranges formed, and in particular the roles played by different types of faults.  Most attention has been focused on the low-angle detachment faults that bound these ranges and enabled several kilometers of unroofing.  However, results of this study suggest that later, high-angle faults also played an important role in the final stages of deformation, and in particular altered the patterns of rock exposure that have been used to estimate rates of movement along the detachment faults.  Finite element modeling demonstrates these effects and corroborates the fission-track measurements.       Last Modified: 03/22/2017       Submitted by: Richard A Ketcham]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
