<AbstractNarration>This Phase 2 project addresses improvements in student pedagogy and educational materials for the engineering thermodynamics curriculum by completing the development of an "Engineering Scenario" based learning model. Engineering Scenarios are textbook supplements based on actual engineering facilities and equipment. They expand on the case study concept by including skills-based problems written in the context of the real-world environment, as well as additional design problems based on design methods and actual solutions at real facilities that can be used in place of traditional homework problems.  Accompanying supplementary and background information promotes increased inquiry-based or student-centered learning, better addresses student real world expectations, and leads to an increase in overall student engagement. A CCLI Phase 1 grant allowed for the development and repeated formative assessment of a single scenario. Based on considerable assessment and student feedback the original concept has been refined to the point of full development. This project creates a final product ready for widespread dissemination as a textbook supplement.</AbstractNarration>
