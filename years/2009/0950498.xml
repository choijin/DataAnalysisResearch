<AbstractNarration>0950498&lt;br/&gt;Coats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER research is to (1) identify proteins statistically relevant to the feast-famine process for microbial synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and (2) integrate proteomics and statistics to develop a preliminary understanding of feast-famine PHA synthesis.  These are first steps in a vision to create microbial processes for producing plastics through fermentation from wastes such as manure and wastewater.</AbstractNarration>
