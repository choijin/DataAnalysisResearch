<AbstractNarration>Doctoral candidate Carwil R. James (City University of New York Graduate Center), with the guidance of Dr. Marc Edelman, will investigate the spatial logic and effects of urban protest activities, with a particular focus on  disruptive mass protests in public space, such as road blockades and occupations of city centers. Have these mass protests, as some observers suggest, introduced and facilitated new ways of "doing politics"? By studying these protests as transformative events, this study will advance social scientific understanding of the social protest and the political use of space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in two sites in Bolivia, Cochabamba and Sucre, both known for urban protests.  The researcher will use a mixture of social science research methodologies to gather data, including: participant observation in social movements; interviews and extended life histories of organizers, participants, and state actors; and analyses of a variety of media and archival sources. Through these methods, the researcher will determine (1) the political and racial geography of the city; (2) the agendas and alliances of active social movements; (3) and connections between their political goals and their practices of protest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important for social science because it will pioneer new methodologies for investigating short, impactful events in ethnographic depth. Through its close attention to multiple aspects of political life, this research also will contribute to understanding the effects of public, space-claiming protest activities on the participants, the political system, and politically and racially stratified urban geography. Supporting this research also supports the education of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project examines large-scale protest events where participants take over or claim urban space. These protests which have been a critical part of major shifts in the politics of Bolivia since 2000. The research centers on analyzing a series of emblematic moments have come to symbolize the Bolivian upheaval, including:  the takeover of downtown Cochabamba during the April 2000 "Water War;"  blockades by campesinos, teachers, miners and others in Sucre during the June 2005 "Gas War" that prevented the right-wing senate president from assuming power;  competing demonstrations that devolved into street battles in Cochabamba in January 2007;  and the mobilization of as many as 100,000 people to surround parliament in October 2008 to secure a referendum on a new constitution.    The resulting dissertation argues that events like these are not just symbols of upheaval. Instead, when social movements took over BoliviaÆs central physical, political, and symbolic spaces, they were both demanding political change and illustrating it. By examining their actions in terms of the meaning of the spaces they claimed for governing and for BoliviaÆs longstanding racial divides, the dissertation explains why and how such space claiming has been so dramatically consequential.  This research makes contributions to the study of social protest in Latin America, the theory of social movement practice, and the importance of geographic meanings to political protest.
