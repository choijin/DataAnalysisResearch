<AbstractNarration>Beyenal, Haluk   &lt;br/&gt;Washington State University&lt;br/&gt;CAREER:Electrochemically Active Biofilms&lt;br/&gt;0954186&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrochemically active biofilms (ECABs) where microorganisms are grown through the direct electrochemical stimulation via electrodes, as opposed to being exposed to chemicals that serve as electron donors and acceptors, are widely used in bioremediation, wastewater treatment, biofuel and biochemical production, microbial fuel cells, corrosion studies, and in sensor development.  The electron transfer processes between biofilm cells and the solid electrodes, however, are poorly understood.  This research quantifies redox-mediated electron transfer rates with the goal of determining fundamental scientific understandings of how to stimulate or, depending on the application, limit electrochemically-induced cell growth rates and/or product formation. The work will also create a quantitative, mechanism-based, mathematical model that can be used to predict rates of biofilm cell growth and product formation using electrochemical, diffusion-reaction, and genome-scale constraint-based models to predict electron transfer rates and their impact on microbial metabolic processes. Research will involve experiments with three model organisms: Geobactor sulfurreducens, Zymonmonas mobilis, and Acinetoobater baumanii.  Experiments will be carried out in flat-plate reactors and constant-depth film fermentors.  Critical aqueous phase characteristics and electron transfer rates will be measured using innovative voltammetric techniques, microsensors that can measure local chemistry, and the electrochemical activities of the biofilms.  Biofilm structure will be examined via confocal scanning laser microscopy.  Broader impacts of the work are far-reaching and include potential societal and economic implications related to microbial fuel cells, biofuels, bioremediation, and biomedical applications.  The project will produce the first mathematical model for predicting electron transfer rates and their correlation to microbial metabolic reactions, which can be used to predict metabolic reactions and cell growth and biofilm production rates.  In addition, the project demonstrates the strong integration of education and research that includes creation of a novel, hands-on, microbial fuel cell education module for college undergraduates and another for high school students.  High school teachers and students from schools in Idaho and Washington State with high Hispanic and Native American enrollments will be engaged in the project to try and broaden participation of minority students in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of our project was to establish a research and education program that could advance our understanding of electron transfer processes in electrochemically active biofilms (ECABs). The central research hypothesis was that the electron transfer processes in biofilms could be controlled using electrochemical techniques. The sub-hypotheses were that by stimulating electron transfer processes in ECABs 1) it was possible to increase or decrease cell growth rates and 2) it was possible to increase or decrease product formation rates.     We had three specific aims for our project:     Quantify direct and redox-mediated electron transfer rates and      acquire an understanding of the factors affecting electron transfer rates: For this specific aim 1) we designed      reactors to study electron transfer rates, 2) we discovered limiting      factors in electron transfer rates, 3) developed methods to separate      extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from biofilm cells and quantify      its composition for electron transfer studies, and 4) developed      mathematical models based on results generated in this aim.      Stimulate cell growth rates or product formation rates by      delivering electrons to ECABs or accepting electrons from them: For this specific aim we stimulated metabolic reactions in ECABs      to increase/decrease cell growth rates or product formation. We applied      our new approaches 1) to control biofilm formation and 2) to increase product      production. We successfully found the mechanism of action for biofilm      control and used this knowledge for a novel application  developed electrochemical scaffold. In      addition, we deployed electrodes in natural system and stimulated      metabolic reactions while monitoring electron transfer rates.       Develop mathematical models to describe how electron transfer      processes can stimulate metabolic reactions, cell growth rates and product      formation: We developed a model integrating      experimental results generated in the project.        In summary, we developed a new way of controlling biofilms, invented electrochemical scaffold for wound healing and demonstrated its effectiveness to remove biofilms from wound surfaces, discovered electron transfer pathway for electrofermentation. During the project we generated more than 17 peer reviewed publications.
