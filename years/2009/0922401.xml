<AbstractNarration>Market-based emissions trading programs ("cap-and-trade") have moved to the front and center of industrial environmental regulation. When designing an emissions trading program, one of the most contentious issues a policymaker faces is the question of how to allocate emissions permits to stakeholders. How permits are allocated can have significant implications for both who bears the costs and how the required emissions reductions are achieved. Although the theoretical literature addressing the efficiency and distributional implications of permit allocation design has become quite sophisticated, empirical research is limited. The proposed work brings a detailed understanding of the electricity and cement industries, two major polluters, careful empirical analysis of firm-level decision making, and state-of-the-art econometric methods to bear on this first-order policy question.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the literature at the interface of industrial organization and environmental regulation in several important ways. First, the researchers propose a novel source of exogenous variation to identify the effects of the permit allocation design decision on short-run firm behavior by exploiting panel data variation in allocation rules in the NOx Budget Program (NBP). This provides a unique opportunity to cleanly estimate the short-run response of firms to a full range of allocation mechanisms. The proposed research also investigates long-run dynamic effects of these regulations. Previous work in this area has largely focused on non-strategic simulation models of the industry using calibrated parameters. This project extends this literature through the use a fully-strategic equilibrium model of industry behavior based on econometrically-based parameters. Finally, the project makes an important contribution in its application of methodologies developed in the industrial organization literature on dynamic games to policy-revelent questions in the field of environmental economics.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Social Impact: Research findings would directly inform the design and implementation of future market-based environmental policies. The research provides evidence on the magnitude and direction of firms' responses to alternative emissions permit market designs. The proposed integration of empirics and applied theory will yield insights into how the permit allocation design decision can affect producer profits, consumer welfare, and the ability of the permit market to efficiently coordinate emissions abatement activities in real-world regulatory environments.&lt;br/&gt;Educational impact: Students working on this project will acquire hands on experience working with rich firm-level data sets, and build core competencies in applied econometrics and industrial organization. Both researchers will present research findings at academic and policy conferences and look forward to integrating research results into their graduate course curricula. Both MIT and UM have programs designed to integrate undergraduates into ongoing research. This project will nicely complement these undergraduate research&lt;br/&gt;programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Recently, a number of regional market-based climate change policy initiatives for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions have been enacted, such as the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) in the European Union and California's greenhouse gas emissions trading program. In these ``cap-and-trade'' programs, regulators impose a cap on the total quantity of emissions permitted and distribute a corresponding number of tradeable emissions permits.  To mitigate potentially adverse competitiveness impacts, and to engender political support for the program, it has become standard to allocate some percentage (or all) of these emissions permits for free to industrial stakeholders. In Fowlie, Reguant, and Ryan (forthcoming, Journal of Political Economy), we explore both the static and dynamic implications of several different permit allocation mechanisms.    Theory suggest that, under strong conditions, an emissions trading program designed to equate marginal abatement costs with marginal damages will achieve socially optimal outcomes. Unfortunately, real-world policy settings are typically characterized by several pre-existing distortions that complicate the design of efficient policy. We focus on two distortions in particular: the exercise of market power in the product market and incomplete regulation.

Second, regional climate change policies are textbook examples of "incomplete" regulation. When an emissions regulation applies to only a subset of the sources that contribute to the environmental problem, regulated sources can find it more difficult to compete with producers operating in jurisdictions exempt from the regulation. Shifts in production and associated "emissions leakage" can substantially offset, or paradoxically even reverse, the reductions in emissions achieved in the regulated sector.    Designing a policy that strikes the appropriate balance between curbing domestic GHG emissions and protecting the competitive position of emissions-intensive manufacturing sectors requires detailed knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the industries subject to the regulation.

Moreover, import penetration in the domestic cement market has exceeded 20 percent in recent years, giving rise to concerns about the potential for emissions leakage.    We extend the dynamic oligopoly framework developed in Ryan (2012) as the foundation for our analysis. Our model is estimated using twenty five years of detailed data on the Portland cement industry. We use this model to simulate the dynamic industry response to four counterfactual, market-based emissions policy designs: permit auctioning (isomorphic to a carbon tax), grandfathering, dynamic allocation updating, and a border tax adjustment which penalizes imports according to their average carbon content.    When the permit price fully reflects social costs, we find that all four policy designs reduce net social welfare for SCC values below $40 per ton of carbon dioxide. Echoing Buchanan, the combination of emissions leakage and welfare losses in the product market exceed the benefits of carbon mitigation. Losses are particularly acute for the auction/carbon tax scenario in which firms bear the full cost of compliance.  The magnitude of the losses is substantial ($18 billion under auctioning/carbon tax when the carbon value is $30).  Grandfathering helps slow the rate of firm exit, but does nothing to incentivize cement production. Consequently, grandfathering also results in substantial welfare losses at carbon values below...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
