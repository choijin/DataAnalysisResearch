<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Project will develop a thermal storage system combined with solar thermal heating and waste heat recovery allowing energy to be accumulated throughout the year to be used when needed in winter.  The use of a new phase change material as the energy storage device, combined with the use of winter and summer heat generation will make feasible the storage of sufficient heat for a typical family residence in an acceptably small storage space. Storage of thermal energy is the single largest barrier to large scale implementation of solar thermal collection.  Currently, no viable option exists for heat storage in a reasonable volume.  The objective is to develop a solar thermal heating system with sufficient heat storage capacity to allow heat to be generated and stored throughout the year and used to provide heating in winter.  During phase I a prototype system capable of generating and storing 300MJ of heat, or roughly the daily heat requirement for a domestic house in winter, will be developed.  The techniques and data developed during this work will provide the necessary basis to develop a full scale system capable of providing heating throughout the winter to a typical domestic house. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in making &lt;br/&gt;localized solar heat generation for space heating a viable option for domestic as well as commercial, institutional and industrial buildings a commercial practicality.  It is estimated that approximately 40 million buildings in the US are suitable for implementation of solar thermal heating.  This represents a US-based manufacturing opportunity of &gt;$400 billion.  Successful implementation on this scale could result in annual energy savings of 300billion kWh corresponding to $30 billion in energy costs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this Phase I SBIR was to:  Develop a solar heat generation system with heat storage capability sufficient to demonstrate the feasibility of uninterrupted heat supply to a building.  Measure and verify the effectiveness of the system and determine design values for future larger systems.   The system developed used a novel Phase Change Material salt with a melting point of 150C as the heat storage mechanism.  The salt was encapsulated in stainless steel packs designed to have large surface area for effective heat transfer. Multiple packs were contained in a secondary vessel.  Heat transfer oil was heated using novel partially focused solar thermal panels and used to heat and melt the PCM.  The system worked well.  On moderately sunny days, summer or winter it was possible to completely melt the PCM and achieve temperatures up to 200C in the storage cylinder.   Based on calculations from the measurements taken it is feasible to create a larger system capable of providing inter-seasonal heat storage for a house (ie store heat from the summer for use in winter).  The dimensions of the storage tank for such a system would be approximately 8Æx 8Æ x8Æ which is considered reasonable for most situations.  While the project was considered a technical success it was not possible to move onto Phase II or to continue to commercialization due to problems in obtaining the salt in sufficient quantities.
