<AbstractNarration>This project will involve investigators from eight institutions working to resolve evolutionary relationships within the euteleost fishes, which represent over one third of vertebrate diversity. An important component will be education of the public on the importance, evolutionary history, and diversity of these animals. Phylogenetic analyses will employ DNA sequence data from 20 genes in 1,500 species representing all euteleost families, and approximately 450 morphological characters from 300 euteleost lineages. Resulting phylogenetic hypotheses will be used to facilitate understanding of the evolution of fish diversity and re-assess and revise the systematics of euteleosts. Research on the euteleost tree of life will be integrated into science education by using euteleost phylogeny as a framework for exploring the evolution of morphological, genetic, developmental, and behavioral diversity of fishes. This will be developed as an instructional guide, a "Fish ToL Activity Book," directed at upper elementary and middle school children and disseminated in non-formal and school settings working in partnership with the National Science Teachers Association Press and the National 4-H Afterschool Council. Undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs will participate directly in the research project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The euteleosts include some 346 families, 2,935 genera and 17,419 species. Over two thirds of all fishes and nearly a third of all vertebrates are euteleosts, which include most of the economically important fishes such as salmons, basses, cods and tunas. This study will facilitate informed predictions about the poorly known characteristics of most euteleosts and will considerably improve the evolutionary context for understanding model organisms such as zebrafish, pufferfish, cichlids, medaka, and stickleback, which are central to the burgeoning fields of functional genomics, genetics and evolutionary developmental biology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Assembling the Euteleost Tree of Life (EToL) collaboration brought together the research efforts of a team of biologists with expertise in systematic biology of fishes to examine the evolutionary relationships between major living groups of fishes.  The project generated an extensive set of DNA sequences from well over 1000 species of fish and from 20 different genes.  This dataset served as the foundation for comparative analysis aimed at producing and testing different theories on the degree of relatedness between groups of fishes.  The figure provides a graphical representation of the outcomes of this study.  The DNA sequences generated in this work were examined using a diverse array of analyses techniques designed to estimate the most likely genealogical associations between different lineages.  These techniques use the information contained in the observed variation between the DNA sequences found in the species examined and the accumulated knowledge on how DNA mutation process generate that variation to evaluate alternative models of the evolutionary history of a set of lineages. In this collaboration, the focus was the set of lineages to which over 90% of living fish species belong, a group know in the technical literature as the Euteleostei.  The results of the phylogenetic analyses (outlined in the figure) provide corroboration for associations that had been proposed earlier.  For example, the close relationship between the lineages that include all the salmons and their relatives (Salmoniformes) and all the pikes and their relatives (Esociformes).  The results also showed the limit of resolution provided by this approach.  For example, the flatfishes (Pleuronectiformes) is a group that is broadly expected to be easily identified by the information extracted in DNA sequences because all members of the group share a distinct and striking anatomy with bodies that are asymmetrical.  However, different analyses of the DNA sequences generated in this study produce unstable results that are sensitive to changes in the treatment of types of mutations and in the criteria that are used to evaluate alternative evolutionary arrangements. As progress on understanding the tree of life continues, an important challenge for the community of systematic biologist will be to develop methods to incorporate this type of uncertainty and instability on the biological classification systems that are used in other fields of science and that demand a moderate degree of stability.  In parallel to the broad examination of euteleost evolution, we conducted focused studies to bettern understand the relationships and patterns of evolution in euteleost subgroups, including coastal sculpins and the greenlings of the Pacific Ocean.  Our findings show novel relationships between species currently included in these groups and, once again, reveal the inherent conflict between developing systems of classification that closely match our best understanding of evolutionary history and the need to have a stable system of names that other researchers can use to mantain an accessible body of scientific knowledge.  The project provided training and experience in research for two graduate students, four undergraduate students and nine pre-college students.  They all participated in data collection activities and had varying levels of participation in data analyses and interpretation of results.  All of these students were able to integrate these research experiences in their career development.       Last Modified: 12/27/2013       Submitted by: Juan A Lopez]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
