<AbstractNarration>This research award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by Professor Abel Baerga-Ortiz at the University of Puerto Rico to lead an investigation into how omega-3 fatty acids are made by marine micro-organisms using a polyketide synthase enzyme complex. The structure and mechanism of the different enzyme components will be studied separately using enzyme kinetics, site-directed mutagenesis and x-ray crystallography. The goal of the research is to delineate exactly (i) how these enzymes work and (ii) whether they can be altered to produce new compounds which resemble the parent fatty acid molecule in structure and physical properties. In addition, the PI will supervise a course aimed at Puerto Rican science undergraduates, graduates and faculty members, but open to science journalists and communicators, to raise awareness about the history and current status of natural products chemistry in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, with an emphasis on its potential to develop new technologies and new enterprise. This initiative will link well with on-going outreach efforts by the PI with the Puerto Rico Medicinal Plants Garden and with workforce re-training efforts with the Puerto Rico Chemists Association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids have tremendous potential as therapeutics, food additives, lubricants or biofuel components. Detailed knowledge about how omega-3 fatty acids are made in nature could be used to expand the chemical diversity of this class of useful compounds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF-CAREER project titled "Biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids in marine bacteria" consisted of three (3) major scientific aims, plus one aim to enhance the public understanding of the proposed science.   Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), also known as omega-3 fatty acids, are extremely important compounds in human nutrition, agriculture and biotechnology. PUFAs are efficiently made by several species of deep-sea bacteria using a previously undescribed enzyme chemistry that is fundamentally different from the one observed in land-based bacteria. Our laboratory sought to study mechanistic and structural aspects that were unique to the enzymes from the deep-sea systems and never seen in land-based enzymes.  The scientific aims of our work centered on the biochemical mechanism by which PUFAs are made in these deep-sea bacteria.  We aimed to answer the following questions: 1) How are PUFAs made in deep-sea bacteria? 2) How do deep-sea enzymes differ structurally and functionally from land-based enzymes? and more importantly 3) Can we use the knowledge obtained from the deep-sea enzymes to increase the production of fatty acids in bacterial fermentations for applications which range from pharmaceuticals to biofuels?  With the support of the NSF, we were able to answer many of these questions while also driving the project in the direction of its practical applications.
