<AbstractNarration>Access to the scientific literature has changed significantly due to the immediate availability of most new research over the World Wide Web. Taking advantage of this opportunity, new search engine tools have been developed such as Google Scholar and CiteSeer followed by CiteSeerX. CiteSeerX has become one the most comprehensive and widely-used online public resources for the CISE research community. The Semantic CiteSeerX project builds upon the work of CiteSeerX and will continue its original goal of research assistance. It will also provide more tools and features. Using the established CiteSeerX infrastructure, Semantic CiteSeerX extends and enhances this resource for community development. Semantic CiteSeerX will expand the CiteSeerX architecture to increase use, performance, reliability and applications while continuing to expand the breadth and depth of CiteSeerX's collection. In addition new metadata such as algorithms, figures, tables and equations will be extracted and indexed and this data will be provided as an RDF resource. Personalized CiteSeerX search and author recommendations through an extension of MyCiteSeerX will be developed by useing individual search histories combined with exploiting patterns of citations and searches within the community. The impact of CiteSeerX and new features will be evaluated and methods will be explored to increase the availability of CiteSeerX as a community resource. As in the past all software will be released open source. For more information please see: http//citeseerx.ist.psu.edu</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CiteSeer is a digital library containing hundreds of thousands of research papers about computer science and technology.  We have developed a way to recommend research papers to researchers so that they are made aware of high-quality publications in their area of research.  They get customized recommendations to help them keep up to date more easily.  Researchers no longer have to search for new information - the information finds them.  Our topic-based approach was found to be more accurate than existing approaches, and should help researchers spend more time doing novel research.  Our newest advance was a new approach to identifying papers that were not just on-topic, but also papers that were high-quality and likely to be of more benefit to the researcher.     We also developed new ways to help identify where a researcher should submit their papers for publication.  There are many conferences to which a researher could send a new manuscript.  If they pick the wrong one, the paper may be rejected, causing a delay in the dissemination of research results.  We treat the authors of papers cited by the manuscript and the program committees who make decisions about which papers to accept as social networks.  By comparing the two social networks, we can predict which conferences are the best match for a manuscript.     Finally, it can be very hard to evaluate the impact that a young researcher is likely to have on their field of research.  Established researchers are generally evaluated based on their paper citations over time.  However, new researchers do not have a large collection of publications and citations that can be used to predict their likely future research success.  We were able to use social network analysis on authors with very few publications and, based on their connected research colleagues, predict which were most likely to have papers that were widely read and cited in future years.
