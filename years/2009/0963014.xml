<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding to extend an existing chilled water loop to the Eaton/Lansing science complex at Hobart and William Smith (HWS) Colleges.  The complex serves 35 research laboratories, 5 research and teaching laboratories, and related support space.  Air handling for each space will be integrated into the campus-wide HVAC control system.  Constructed in 1954, the building was not designed for summer research and originally did not contain dedicated research spaces.  Since the facility was opened, laboratory climate control was addressed on an ad hoc basis and incorporated window-mounted A/C units.  As a result, the climate control infrastructure is inadequate to meet the needs of research-active faculty and their students at this primarily-undergraduate institution.The faculty of HWS, and in particular the most recently hired faculty, run federally and privately supported research programs. Adequate research facilities will enable more productive (uninterrupted) research, especially with students, and help to attract research active new hires. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research to be undertaken in the renovated facility will include utilizing zooplankton to resolve questions concerning species establishment and community composition; developing new molecular wire candidates incorporating materials that may be used to replace current silicone chip technology; and researching topics of thermal noise and higher-order statistical noise in gravity wave detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will enhance infrastructure for research.  The renovation will improve research facilities with a positive effect on research productivity.  Heightened research productivity is expected to increase the number of students involved as well as to lengthen the duration of the summer research program. Instrumentation is expected to operate more reliably in a stable environment, thus also increasing research productivity and competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The science complex at Hobart and William Smith Colleges currently consists of three buildings (Eaton, Lansing, and Rosenberg) connected to one another through walkways.  Rosenberg was constructed in the 1994 and it is equipped with central air-conditioning as well as a cooling tower with capacity adequate to handle cool the Eaton and Lansing wings as well.  However, these buildings were not connected to the cooling tower until the receipt of this award.  NSF funds were used to extend the existing chilled water loop from the chiller located in the penthouse of the Rosenberg wing to all four floors (including basements) of the Eaton and Lansing wings.  In each space, air-handling equipment was installed or modified for climate control, and all conditioned spaces were integrated into the campus-wide cooling system.     HWS is a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI) with faculty who are committed to advancing their individual research programs.  These scholars have actively and successfully sought external funding to support their work and routinely devote an extensive amount of time to training undergraduate research students, many of whom then choose to enter a STEM profession.      From an institutional perspective, the proposed cooling loop has brought a number of benefits including: 1) enhancing the capacity of many of our science faculty to conduct research, while training a new generation of undergraduates; 2) advancing the overall quality and effectiveness of the student research experience, particularly during the intensive summer months; 3) improving the safety of the Colleges√Ü research labs and chemical storage spaces, thereby reducing risk to both faculty and students, and 4) improving the ability of the Colleges to attract and retain research-active faculty who choose to make their careers at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution.     The cooling loop was installed during the first two years of the project and was fully functional during this past summer.  A number of students and faculty benefited from the controlled laboratory atmospheres and most of these students presented the results of their research at the Summer Research Poster Session held during Family weekend in September 2013.  Furthermore, a number of these students and faculty are in the process of writing publications for peer-review or preparing to present their work at regional, national, and international conferences.
