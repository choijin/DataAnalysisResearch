    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0915200 &lt;br/&gt;Semerjian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This request is for a workshop entitled Leadership Workshop and Graduate Student Travel Grant. Funds are requested to support approximately 20 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the 30th and 31st (these two workshop are in two successive years) Council for Chemical Research (CCR) Annual Meetings to participate in Leadership Workshops and to interact with the industrial, academic and government leaders in the chemical research enterprise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second workshop will be provided for up to 20 Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Department chairs attending the CCR Annual Meeting. Funds will be used to pay for the facilitators of the Leadership Workshops and travel expenses for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will benefit intellectually from direct interactions with research leaders from industry, academia, and government and from participation in discussions about pressing research and related issues. Students will gain valuable negotiation and leadership skills to help advance their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Students will gain additional professional skills by participating as facilitators and recorders in the discussion breakout sessions, which will provide them with hands-on experience and personal interactions. Students will also participate in preparing reports on the breakout sessions for presentations to the entire group of meeting attendees at the conclusion of the conference. The students will be introduced to leadership practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF funds will be used to cover the expenses of students, faculty, workshops, facilitators and staff support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The travel support is provided by Chemistry and the CBET Divisions.</AbstractNarration>
