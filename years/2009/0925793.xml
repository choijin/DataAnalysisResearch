<AbstractNarration>Homo erectus, a species of human ancestor, has skull bones four times thicker than the&lt;br/&gt;modern human average. This research will investigate how cranial vault thickness (CVT) develops in modern mammals in order to test hypotheses for why some fossil species had such well developed vault bones. The function of the cranial vault is to protect the brain and to serve as an attachment site for many muscles, but molecular influences on the development of its three layers of bone are not well understood. For example, the effect of exercise on hormone levels, which may in turn influence cranial bone development, is uncertain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both comparative and experimental studies will be used to test hypotheses for increased CVT. Previous studies have limited their measurement of CVT to total thickness; this study measures all three layers of the bone. These measures will be correlated (in a sample of 70 nonhuman primate and 10 hominin species) with several characters preserved in the cranium such as the size of chewing muscles and brain case shape. Once correlations are established, a second phase will establish causative relationships. For this phase, the effects of artificially increased masticatory strain and variation in growth hormone levels on CVT will be investigated in a model organism (Mus musculus).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits of this project include expanding current knowledge of physiological processes in osteological development, providing a better understanding of endocrinological influences on cranial vault development, and testing hypotheses for increased and decreased skeletal robusticity throughout human evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the heart of the study is an investigation of a paleoanthropological question, the methods used implicitly relate to topics of modern human, non-human primate, and non-primate mammalian health and development. Thus, the broader impacts of the study include widereaching implications for subjects as varied as human consumption of exogenous hormones, traumatic brain injury treatment, exercise and endocrine physiology, and osteoporosis.  This doctoral dissertation research will contribute to the training and development of a female graduate student.</AbstractNarration>
