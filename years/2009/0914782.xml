<AbstractNarration>Influencing and Improving Networks Formed by Strategic Agents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An increasing number of networks on the forefront of scientific research, and of great importance to our world, are developed, built, and maintained by a large number of independent agents, all of whom act in their own interests. Such networks with strategic agents include the Internet, peer-to-peer file sharing schemes, business contracts between companies, and social networks representing relationships between groups of people. While these networks cannot be fully controlled, they can often be influenced in a limited way, sometimes resulting in dramatic improvement of the global network behavior. For example, this influence can include giving a few agents incentives to behave differently, altering a small part of the network, or even providing some extra information that makes a huge difference. This project will develop methods and algorithms with provable guarantees for influencing networks of strategic agents in order to improve the overall network behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the formation of various networks by strategic agents, and will especially focus on the system of customer-provider and peering contracts between Autonomous Systems (AS's) in the Internet. In the process of this research, new approximation algorithm concepts will be introduced, and will yield techniques for improving the global qualities of a network, and for preventing undesirable entities from gaining undue influence over it. While interactions of self-interested agents have been studied in numerous fields, a systematic study of how to influence such agents with only a limited amount of power has never been done. Besides contributing to algorithmic game theory and the study of networks, this research will open up new research directions in economics, AI, and the social sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
