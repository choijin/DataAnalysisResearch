<AbstractNarration>This 3-year research and education program entails collaboration between Prof. Scott Husson at Clemson University and Dr. Earl Wagener of Tetramer Technologies, L.L.C. (Tetramer) in Pendleton, SC. Our overall goal is to develop fundamental structure-property relationships for perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) polymer thin films and use these relationships as the foundation for improved molecular architecture design and production practices of PFCB-based membranes with enhanced resistance to compaction and plasticization by CO2 and hydrocarbons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tetramer's PFCB polymers are new to the membrane art. They have a significant percentage of fluorine in the backbone and structures designed to increase free volume. No previous plasticization/compaction studies have been performed on these polymers. Partnership with Tetramer will give Clemson researchers access to these promising new membrane polymers. A variety of standard and new to the membrane art analytical techniques are proposed to determine the fundamental structure-property relations for a set of PFCB polymers having a range of molecular architectures. A better understanding of how the structure of the membrane separation layer affects its susceptibility to plasticization/compaction/physical aging would allow better prediction of performance and may lead to new ways to limit their negative impacts. Tetramer plans to use the data generated to determine which mitigation techniques, such more rigid backbones, crosslinking, or even segmenting the architecture, would be most effectively applied to increase their competitive advantages over current commercial products. New knowledge on plasticization and compaction phenomena also will contribute to membrane technology in general. CO2 and hydrocarbon-induced plasticization deteriorates the performance of polymer gas separation membranes. Thus, our effort to suppress its negative effects would have great beneficial impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will enhance the infrastructure for research and education at Clemson and Tetramer. The PI and his students will gain valuable access to new membrane production and performance testing facilities. Tetramer will extend its in-house research capabilities to understand the fundamental physical changes PFCB polymers undergo during performance testing.  Prof. Husson and his students will (1) conduct weekly research meetings, (2) carry out research on membrane preparation and performance testing, and (3) present industrial seminars to be given by Prof. Husson each year. Students in this industry-university collaborative research program will gain exposure to the workings of industry and receive mentoring from industry collaborators, as they perform some of their research at Tetramer. Our work will have immediate commercial relevance. Thus, contributing to the university mission to put research to use in teaching and economic development and advance knowledge on functional membranes, which play a vital role in the US economy. A diverse group of students will be recurited, as Prof. Husson has done successfully throughout his career. This diversity extends to gender, race, disability, academic major, and stage of academic progress. One of the points considered in team member selection will be the contribution to diversity. Our work would provide technical knowledge needed to design molecular architecture and production practices to produce more selective, more permeable, and more robust membranes for CO2 separation from natural gas. A result would be a lower cost operation for natural gas pretreatment. Since natural gas is the fastest growing primary energy source in the world and provides over 20% of all energy used in the US, the economic impact could be tremendous.</AbstractNarration>
