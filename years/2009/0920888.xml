<AbstractNarration>The main goal of the project is to compare the structure as well as the interpretation of the noun phrase in languages with articles and languages without articles. With a few exceptions, it is standardly assumed that languages without articles have a phonologically null (i.e. unpronounced) article, so that the difference between English "The stone broke the window" and Russian "Kamen' razbil okno" is essentially phonological, the article being null in Russian. The project hypothesizes that there are more substantive differences in both the syntax and the semantics of noun phrases in languages with and without articles. In particular, an important piece of structure that is present in the noun phrase of languages with articles and is missing in languages without articles. The project will explore a number of cross-linguistic generalizations where articles seem to play a crucial role and attempt to explain how they follow from the hypothesized structural difference. Some of the phenomena involved in the generalizations include question formation, relative clause formation, adjectival placement, negation interpretation, free word order, number morphology, null pronominal subjects, superlatives, tense, and nominal complementation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A goal of this research is to show how one salient property of a language--the presence or absence of articles--accounts for a wide range of seemingly unrelated phenomena in that language. This research will thus contribute to a view of language as a complex system in which small changes in one area have significant ramifications throughout the grammar. The project will involve several subdisciplines of formal linguistics (syntax, morphology, semantics, typology) and, given the nature of the generalizations under investigation, will have important consequences for several fundamental domains in linguistic theory. The research will also inform work in language acquisition and neurolinguistics, as articles are typically absent in early child speech and in the speech of some aphasics. Independent of the theoretical contributions, the project will contribute data on numerous understudied languages, for example American Sign Language, Native American languages, as well as languages of Asia and Africa.</AbstractNarration>

In contrast to this view, the project has  shown that there are radical differences in both the structure and the  interpretation of both the nominal domain and the clausal domain between  languages that have a definite article and languages that lack a  definite article. This was done by establishing more than twenty wide  ranging crosslinguistic generalizations where languages differ with  respect to a number of syntactic and semantic phenomena depending on  whether or not they have a definite article. These generalizations  concern phenomena as different as the availability of free word order in  a language, the locality of syntactic dependencies, and the  interpretation of tense, negation, and superlatives, to mention just a  few, all of which have been shown to be crucially affected by the  presence vs absence of a definite article in a language. The project has  thus shown that whether or not a language has a definite article has a  fundamental impact on a number of syntactic and semantic phenomena that  were previously considered to be completely unrelated. In fact, it is  fair to say that very few properties of human languages have such a  profound impact on the complex system of the human language grammar as  the lack vs presence of a definite article in a language. In addition to  establishing a new typological division, and contributing to our  understanding of the syntax and semantics of a number of linguistic  phenomena, the project has significant consequences for the hotly  debated issue regarding what kind of syntactic and semantic variation  can be found in human languages. The project has investigated more than  one hundred languages. It has also involved investigation and data  collection on languages that have not been well-studied, enhancing our  understanding of the structure and the interpretation of a number of  constructions in these languages. The project thus also has considerable  descriptive value. Given that the lack vs presence of a definite  article in a language has a crucial effect on a number of superficially  unrelated syntactic and semantic phenomena, reducing the superficial  complexity in this domain to a single determining factor, the findings  of the project are expected to have consequences for the studies of  language acquisition within both psychology and linguistics, which have  to explain how children acquire the phenomena in question. The findings  of the project are also expected to have consequences for the studies of  language acquisition regarding the more narrow question why definite  article is typically absent in early child speech as well as for the  studies of aphasia regarding the absence of definite article in the  speech of some aphasics.</span></span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/17/2016<br>      Modified by: Zeljko&nbsp;Boskovic</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
