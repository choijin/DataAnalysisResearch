<AbstractNarration>Land processes play a key role in the earth system, and their treatment is crucial for climate system modeling. The overall goal of this project is to improve the understanding and modeling of land processes in the new version of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4.0) whose land component is the Community Land Model (CLM4.0). The investigators build on their significant progress under prior NSF support in addressing various interdisciplinary issues related to the land-atmosphere-ocean interface processes, as evidenced by the implementation in CLM4.0 of their improved parameterizations related to five different aspects of land processes, the implementation in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) of their ocean skin temperature scheme, and the testing and implementation of their new formulations of land surface roughness lengths for momentum and heat in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) regional and global forecasting models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address four questions through extensive in situ and satellite data analysis, process studies, and global modeling: a) How realistic are the land surface energy/water/carbon cycles and dynamic vegetation from CCSM4.0? b) How does CNDV (carbon and nitrogen cycling with dynamic vegetation) affect the energy/water/carbon cycles in CLM4.0 and how can its treatment be further improved? c) How does groundwater affect other land processes in CLM4.0 and how can its treatment be further improved? and d) How to use the insights gained from these efforts to better understand the uncertainties in the future climate projections of land processes from CCSM4.0?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed work include: a) improving the understanding of energy/water/carbon cycles, improving the treatment of two important processes (i.e., groundwater and dynamic vegetation with carbon and nitrogen cycling), training students, and incorporating research results in teaching; b) upgrading and maintaining a computer cluster for interdisciplinary research; and c) broadly disseminating results through peer-reviewed publications, presentations at conferences and workshops, web page, and lectures to the general public.</AbstractNarration>

Based on our outstanding achievements, we received a "special creativity two-year extension for additional support of the project" from NSF. We have made substantial progress in reaching our goals in this combined 6-year project through 24 peer-reviewed papers, 1 book chapter, and 2 submitted manuscripts. Major scientific findings include:     The first      observational data-driven model for climate change projections (Zeng and      Geil 2016) A new method for      areal snow mapping from point measurements (Broxton et al. 2016). A new finding on      polar temperature amplification (Wang and Zeng 2015)   A new statistical      model for the seasonal prediction of North Atlantic hurricane numbers      (Davis et al. 2015) A surprising      finding of nearly half of Earth system models having spurious oscillations      near steep topography (Geil and Zeng 2015) New insight on      diurnal temperature range over northern high latitudes (Wang and Zeng      2014) Identification of      a robust quantity in the terrestrial carbon cycle (Shao et al. 2013) Quantification of      Earth system model hindcast skills (Sakaguchi et al. 2012a,b). Improving the land      skin temperature modeling over semi-arid regions (Zeng et al. 2012) New insights on      carbon cycle models (Sakaguchi et al. 2011). A new indicator for      the land-precipitation coupling strength (Zeng et al. 2010).      The major scientific impacts of our work can be illustrated by     Our new scheme to      improve land skin temperature treatment in semi-arid regions (Zeng et al.      2012) has been implemented in our NationÆs operational weather forecasting      global models, and this has substantially increased the amount of satellite      radiance data assimilated and improved the weather forecasting over      semi-arid regions. We have developed      the method to implement our global 1 km bedrock depth data in the      Community Land Model (Brunke et al. 2016). Our bedrock data will be      implemented in the Community Earth System Model. Our      newly-developed global 0.5 degree hourly land surface air temperature      dataset from 1948-2009 (Wang and Zeng 2013) has been archived and      distributed by National Center for Atmospheric Research (with a DOI; Wang      and Zeng 2014). This global dataset has been submitted as one of the      candidate datasets for future Intergovernmental      Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) model evaluations. Our seasonal hurricane      forecasting study (Davis et al. 2015) was selected as a Paper of Note in      the July 2015 issue of Bulletin of American Meteorological Society.

Our paper on our      newly-developed method for areal snow mapping from point measurements      (Broxton et al. 2016) has been selected as a Highlight in American Geophysical      Union (AGU) Eos.     This project produced three Ph.D., two M.S., and supported two additional Ph.D. students. It also supported two undergraduate interns and four postdoctoral or junior researchers. Results from this project have also been used in the PIÆs college teachings of undergraduate and graduate students.     Our value-added data sets of 1.53 t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
