<AbstractNarration>Multi-functional analytical and sensing devices based on graphene encapsulated noble&lt;br/&gt;metal nanoparticles and their nanowire-based heterostructures&lt;br/&gt;PI: Nitin Chopra, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa.&lt;br/&gt;This research endeavor focuses on novel multi-functional and multi-component analytical and detection&lt;br/&gt;devices based on graphene encapsulated noble metal nanoparticles (GE-NMPs). Fabrication of a&lt;br/&gt;continuous and non-porous graphene shell offers a unique way to stabilize noble metal nanoparticles&lt;br/&gt;(NMPs) lending multi-functionality and unique properties to these hybrid nanomaterials. Such&lt;br/&gt;nanomaterials are of enormous importance for homeland and border security, sensor industry, and&lt;br/&gt;analytical device technology.&lt;br/&gt;The research involves studies on the growth of GE-NMPs and their nanowire-based heterostructures&lt;br/&gt;using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. The information will be broadly applicable to many&lt;br/&gt;materials systems that have an ability to catalyze carbon growth and will be a notable advancement in the&lt;br/&gt;area of novel graphene-based nanomaterials and devices. These materials are highly robust and can be&lt;br/&gt;readily functionalized for further applications. The approach is to fully utilize the functions of the individual&lt;br/&gt;components (graphene and noble metal nanoparticle) to locate, detect, separate, and assemble chemical&lt;br/&gt;species with enhanced signals. In addition, hybrid nanomaterials will be vital in realizing advanced&lt;br/&gt;engineering applications, including, chemical and biological sensors and novel spectroscopy substrates&lt;br/&gt;that integrate a uniquely heterostructured nano-electromechanical system (NEMS). These devices will&lt;br/&gt;have high resolution, chemical selectivity, improved sensitivity and detection limits, reversibility, and&lt;br/&gt;robustness. The research program is multidisciplinary and has strong fundamental and technological&lt;br/&gt;components allowing students to work and gain experience in cutting edge nanotechnology research.</AbstractNarration>
