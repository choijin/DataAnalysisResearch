<AbstractNarration>The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the efforts of Professor Kenneth M. Nicholas of the University of Oklahoma Norma Campus to test the hypothesis that efficient and selective homogeneous transition metal catalysts can be evolved by templating dynamic (equilibrating) metal complexes with substrate and transition state analogs.  Three classes of important addition reactions will be studied: a) carboxyl ester and amide hydrolysis, b) ketone transfer hydrogenation, and c) [4+2] cycloadditions.  Results from these studies may provide a deeper understanding of metal-centered reaction transition states, which could impact the design of both heterogeneous catalysts with commercial, energy-saving and environmental benefits, and the development of enzyme inhibitors with biological and health implications.  The project will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, including African and Native Americans, by actively recruiting researchers into an internship program at the Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics and the Oklahoma University Minority Engineering Program.</AbstractNarration>
