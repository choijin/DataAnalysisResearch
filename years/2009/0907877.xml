<AbstractNarration>This collaborative award will fund continuation of a project to measure distances to the Galactic high velocity clouds (HVCs), massive clouds of neutral hydrogen gas moving at velocities incompatible with a simple model of differential galactic rotation. Since they stand out from the gas in the Galactic Disk, they can be used as test particles for energetic phenomena in the Milky Way.  The program will study HVC metallicities and distances using interstellar absorption lines in the spectra of stars projected against the clouds. The results of this project will be important for estimates of several fundamental parameters of Galactic evolution, including the rate of infall of low metallicity gas, the potential of the dark matter halo, the rate of circulation of gas between Disk and Halo, and the fraction of ionizing photons escaping the Disk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of this program include training of graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
