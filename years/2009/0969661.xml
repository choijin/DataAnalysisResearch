<AbstractNarration>Air shower detectors have observed cosmic rays with ultra high energies. However, their sources, nuclear composition and acceleration mechanism(s) remain unknown. Some possible sources include active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursters, and/or supernova remnants. In contrast to charged cosmic rays which bend in interstellar magnetic fields, the neutrinos that are expected to be produced in these accelerators travel in straight lines, so do point back to their sources. The IceCube observatory being built at the South Pole to search for these sources will soon reach 1 cubic km in volume. The accompanying 1 square km surface array (IceTop) detects air showers with energies above 300 TeV. Combining shower data with measurements of TeV muons from IceCube makes it possible to study the cosmic-ray composition. By using IceCube to veto events containing muons, it is also possible to identify photon-initiated showers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funds to study three topics pertaining to the origins and composition of cosmic rays: a search for a diffuse neutrino flux from the entire sky, a measurement of the transverse momentum (pT) spectrum of high pT muons in air showers, and a search for PeV photons from the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. During the three years of this grant, they will either observe extra-terrestrial neutrinos or set limits below the Waxman-Bahcall bound.  The pT spectrum of these muons can be calculated using perturbative QCD, thus avoiding the phenomenological models that are required in other composition studies. The group will continue contributing to IceCube Maintenance and Operations work in the areas of optical module simulation and calibration, detector verification and calibration and in Monte Carlo simulation production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Education and Outreach component will communicate this forefront research to students and the general public, through presentations at elementary through high schools and public lectures. They educate both undergraduate and graduate students, by involving them in their research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our group is searching for the sources of the ultra-energetic cosmic-ray particles that we observe striking the Earth.    We are looking for high-energy neutrinos that should also be produced in these accelerators; the neutrinos will travel in a straight line to Earth, so we can point them back to their sources.   We do this with the 1 km^3 IceCube neutrino observatory, whch consists of 5,160 optical sensors which are buried in the south polar ice; they detect light produced by the charged particles produced when neutrinos interact in the ice.  IceCube construction was completed in 2010, so we are just beginning to study data taken with the full detector.  Over the period of this grant, the IceCube collaboration made the first clear (4-sigma level) observation of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos.  These neutrinos came from all parts of the sky, so no single source is evident.  However, the sample of 28 events tells us that the neutrino flux is at the high-end of the range of theoretical flux predictions, showing that these cosmic accelerators emit a substantial fraction of their energy in the form of neutrinos.  Our group also found one neutrino event with an energy above 2 PeV (2*10^{15} electron volts) - 250 times the energy of the protons accelerated at CERNS Large Hadron Collider. This is by far the most energetic neutrino event ever observed - by IceCube or any other experiment.  The two figures show side and top views of the Big Bird event display, showing the enormous amount of light observed - over 100,000  photons detected by 378 optical modules.  We have also meausred the energy spectrum of these events; the absence of any events with energies above 2 PeV indicates that whatever is producing these neutrinos has a maximum energy not too far above 2 PeV.  This is in contrast to the conventional charged particle cosmic rays, where energies up to 3*10^{20} electron volts have been observed - roughly the energy of a well-hit tennis ball, or enough to light a 50 watt light bulb for 1 second.
