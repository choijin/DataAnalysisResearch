<AbstractNarration>Geminiviruses are plant pathogens that seriously threaten agricultural crops worldwide. Obtaining new information about interactions between geminiviruses and plants will advance our understanding of normal physiological processes in plants, and how viruses exploit the host to induce infection. The investigators will identify and characterize host genes involved in geminivirus pathogenesis. Tomato golden mosaic and Cabbage leaf curl viruses produce a protein, AL2, which interacts with a host protein, PPD2. The overriding goal of this proposal is to therefore characterize the interaction between AL2 and PPD2 and define its role in suppressing host defenses, which is currently unknown. This project will use molecular, biochemical, genomic and genetic approaches to achieve this objective. We expect to characterize the role of the AL2::PPD2 complex in activating host defenses, and to identify host genes activated by this complex. The broader impacts of this research include providing information leading to the identification of networks of genes involved in host defense. This is expected to provide a basis for new resistance strategies, based on disrupting interactions critical for viral pathogenesis, which could translate into developing crops resistant to geminivirus disease. This would have a direct economic benefit to the local farmer, and will be important for decreasing the use of harmful pesticides and increasing the food production needed to sustain a growing human population. This project will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and a post-doctoral scientist, to gain knowledge in current topics related to plant molecular virology. UTSA demographics suggest one or more of these will be members of historically underrepresented groups. Opportunities for collaborations with scientists in Mexico and Central America may arise, where geminivirus diseases are devastating to local economies, and help facilitate exchange opportunities for both faculty and students.</AbstractNarration>
