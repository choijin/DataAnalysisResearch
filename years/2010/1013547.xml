<AbstractNarration>Funds are requested to support attendance at the 11th International Conference on Mechanisms of Plant Development, which will take place from August 15-19 2010 in Saxons River, Vermont. This semi-annual conference will bring together biologists studying plant developmental mechanisms using genetic, genomic and cell biological approaches.  This meeting will cover broad areas of plant development, including sessions on patterning, short and long distance signaling, cell type differentiation, epigenetics in development, and evolution and development.  Invited speakers include a combination of worldwide leaders in plant developmental research as well as younger scientists who are in the early stages of their independent careers.  The small size of this meeting (approximately 130 participants) will facilitate discussion and insure close and sustained interactions. Three poster sessions are planned.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be strongly encouraged to submit poster abstracts; approximately 25% of the speakers will be chosen from these submitted abstracts.  Participation by minority and female scientists will also be strongly encouraged; this will be achieved by identification and encouragement of individuals, as well as by advertising the conference widely.</AbstractNarration>
