<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Thomas Goodwin and colleague Christopher Marvin and Andres Caro from Hendrix College will acquire a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as synthesis of pyrrole-based, biologically active marine alkaloid analogues and isotopically-labeled warfarin metabolites; discovery and characterization of mammalian chemical signals and metabolites, e.g., in elephants, lemurs, and maned wolves;  development of green microscale experiments for the introductory organic chemistry laboratory; desymmetrization of achiral/mesodienes via diastereoselective alkene cross metathesis; development of catalytic photoredox processes for the synthesis of heterocyclic molecules; synthesis of antibacterial and cytotoxic flavanones; and study of oxidative mitochondrial damage by cytochrome P450 isoform 2E1 in hepatocytes by measuring bioenergetics using 31P NMR and by correlating fatty acidmethylene/methyl ratios (1H NMR) corresponding to the onset of apoptosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.</AbstractNarration>
