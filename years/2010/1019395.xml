<AbstractNarration>Planning Visit Concerning Electric and Electro-mechanical Properties of CNT-polymer Nanocomposites: An Experimental and Multiscale Modeling Approach&lt;br/&gt;Gary D. Seidel, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, OISE - 1019395&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports two planning visits to Mexico by Prof. Seidel and two of his graduate students.   These researchers will travel twice to the Centro de Investigacion Cientifica de Yucatan (CICY) in Merida, Mexico. The purpose of the visits is to conduct preliminary experiments and to prepare research proposals for study of composite materials composed of polymers containing single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNT) that provide a sensing capability through their piezoresistivity. Such materials may find use as indicators of deformation and damage in civil structures as well as in automobiles and aircraft. The two planning visits to Merida are scheduled for the summers of 2010 and 2011 to investigate PET-CNT nanocomposite films and vinyl ester-CNT composites.  Their Mexican collaborators will similarly travel to Virginia Tech with CONACyT funding to pursue the joint research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning visit aims to advance a collaboration in the study of polymer-CNT nanocomposites, their synthesis and processing, and their ability to serve as sensors of structural deterioration and damage. This is a current topic of interest in the application of nanotechnology and is intellectually both challenging and rewarding. The work should reveal interesting macroscopic electro-mechanical effects and how they depend on the microscale composition and structure.  While promoting international research collaboration among the participants, this project will enable the two graduate students from Virginia Tech to establish professional relationships with their Mexican peers. Success in the development of effective and inexpensive materials and devices for monitoring structural health could have significant benefits by preventing catastrophic failures.</AbstractNarration>

The focus of thecollaboration has been  on the development of polymer nanocomposites based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes which can display a coupled electromechanical response in the form of piezoresistivity, and therefore have the ability to perform as sensors in structural health monitoring applications (i.e. to sense deformation and cracking in struructures, e.g. airplanes, bridges, auotmobiles, etc).  The project consisted of planned activities for the Virginia Tech and CICY teams over a two year period in which preliminary studies have  been conducted in an effort to obtain initial results and publications for the preparation of a full proposal on structural health monitoring nanocomposites to NSF and its Mexican government counterpart (CONACYT).  The focus of the Virginia Tech team led by Dr. Gary Don Seidel has been on the development of  multiscale modeling tools to assist in nanocomposite design.  The focus of the CICY team led by Dr. Francis Aviles Cetina has been on nanocomposite preparation and characterization. Each year of the project involved travel by researchers from each team to the partnering institution for focused discussions, presentation of short courses, and preparation of materials for dissemination of preliminary results and for extended collaboration.  It is believed upon completion of the project that the combined team is in a good position to submit not only a highly competitive continuation funding proposal for the team's efforts, but also a proposal for hosting a workshop on nanocomposites preparation, characterization, and modeling for structural health monitoring applications.     In terms of intellectual merit, the collaborative comparing and contrasting of experimental and modeling results has enabled the identification of some of the key mechansims at the nano- and microscales (where carbon nanotubes deform and interact with one another) which govern the macroscale (human application scale) strain and damage sensing responses.     In terms of broader impacts, the collaborative effort's focus on deformation and damage detection materials has far reaching significance towards improving structural safety, and hence human saftey,  in a wide range of applications.  In addition, these types of technologies can lead to significant operating cost reductions for high maintenance civil infrastructure, e.g. airplanes, trains, bridges etc.  More directly, the project has broaden the horizons in terms of the benefits of international collaborative research for over 20 graduate and undergraduate students, making them better positioned to be successful in a  future where such collaborations will be a necessary aspect of doing highly relevant research.
