<AbstractNarration>1004000&lt;br/&gt;Levin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial support for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and assistant professors in the United States to attend the 27th International Symposium on Rarefied Gas Dynamics to be held during the summer of 2010. The Symposium is a premiere meeting for modeling and simulation of low density, nonequilibrium flows and will return to the United States after a twenty-two year absence. It typically attracts about 200 participants from 30 different countries, spanning academia, government, and industry. Members of the organizing group are experts in rarified gas dynamics from academia, government, and industry. The conference will be run by Penn State Conferences and Institute and has received support from the Department of Aerospace Engineering and the College of Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact:  The Symposium includes topics in nanotechnology and plasmas, both of which we are paying particular attention to attract more of the more semiconductor community participates by locating the meeting close to Silicon Valley.  Since its initiation, the Symposium topics have grown to include both the engineering applications of plasma processing, space, materials, and propulsion, as well as, the basic physics of molecular interactions, gas-surface interactions, kinetic theory, astronomical observations, transport, multi-phase flows, combustion, and non-equilibrium hypersonic gas dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 27th International Symposium on Rarefied Gas Dynamics (RGD27) was held at the Asilomar Conference Grounds, Pacific Grove, California, USA from July 10 to July 15, 2010.  The Symposium returned to the U.S. after a 22-year hiatus from when the RDG16 was held in Pasadena, California in 1988.  Since the first symposium held in 1958 in Nice, France, the RGD Symposia are recognized as the principal forum for the presentation of recent advances in the field of Rarefied Gas Dynamics.  The Symposia participants are a highly interdisciplinary group of engineers, physicists, chemists, and mathematicians whose research encompasses applications of space, materials, and propulsion, as well as the basic physics of molecular interactions, gas surface interactions, kinetic theory, astronomical observations, gas transport, multi-phase flows, combustion, non-equilibrium hypersonic gas dynamics and plasma processing.     The 27th RGD Symposium included technical sessions in the following topics:  Boltzmann and Related Equations; Clusters and Aerosols; DSMC and Related Simulations; Experimental Procedures in RGD; Gas-Surface Interactions; Hybrid Methods; Jets and Plumes; Kinetic and Transport Theory; Micro-Nano Scale Flows and Devices; Molecular Beams and Molecular Collisions; Molecular Dynamic Simulations; Numerical Solutions of Kinetic Equations; Plasma and Materials Processing; Plasma Propulsion; Radiation and Plasma Flows; RGD in Astrophysics; Reaction and Relaxation Processes; Space Vehicle Aerodynamics; State-to-State Methods; Turbulence; and Vacuum Gas Dynamics.     Two plenary lectures, according to tradition, highlight the Symposium.  The Harold Grad Lecture was presented by Prof. Francois Golse from Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Mathematiques of Palaiseu Cedex France.   The Grad Lecture was inaugurated at the 17th RGD Symposium to present recent developments from a premier theoretician.   The Lloyd B. Thomas Memorial Lecture was presented by Prof. Barker, Physics and Astronomy, University College London, London, United Kingdom.  This lecture was established at the 19th RGD Symposium to draw researchers who have made outstanding contributions in the field of experiments in rarefied gas phenomena.     Presentations were made in honor of two leaders from the RGD community that have passed away during 2010.  Professor Carlo Cercignani was celebrated for his extraordinary scientific contributions as well as for his warm personality and generous spirit with brief speeches, reminiscences and pictures by Prof. Aldo Frezzotti, Prof. Kazuo Aoki, Prof. Aleksey Rebrov, and Prof. Francois Golse.   Also, a remembrance of Professor Franklin Hurlbut was presented by Dr. Lawrence Gochberg highlighting his distinguished career as a leader in measurements and rarefied gases.     Nearly 300 abstracts covering the above diverse aspects of rarefied gas dynamics were received from approximately 25 countries.   There were 20 invited lectures spanning the traditional as well as new focus areas for RGD.  The Symposium participation was truly international.  Since students represent the future researchers in our field, it was considered vital that students be encouraged and helped to participate in the symposium.  We devoted a substantial portion of the support funding toward enabling students who would be paper presenters to attend and participate.      The Symposium sponsors were the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the U.S. National Science Foundation; The Pennsylvania State University College of Engineering, San Jose State University, Spectral Sciences, Inc., and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
