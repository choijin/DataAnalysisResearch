<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My doctoral research at the University of Chicago focuses on the scientific practice of gerontology, the study of aging and the aged, in Japan.  gerontology utilizes scientific research to develop means and methods for intervening in the disabling effects of aging so the elderly may remain healthy and active members of society.  With one of the oldest populations in the world and projected half of the population being over the age of 50 by 2025, æagingÆ and æthe agedÆ have become topics of political and economical concern in Japan. As scientists and members of Japanese society, gerontologists work directly with local, national, and international communities to help build social policies that improve the well being of elderly and the aging society.  My 2010 EAPSI project was to uncover how and in what way an anthropologist could join a multi-disciplinary gerontology team and positively contribute to 1) the gerontological goal of improved well-being for the elderly, their caregivers, and society and 2) national and international research cooperation and social policy planning.  Qualitative researchers, such as anthropologists, are specially trained to usefully analyze cultural practices.  They can provide valuable insight into cultural differences in how aging is understood and these insights could improve research design, analysis, and more readily guarantee the successful implementation of social policy and planning at local and global levels.   In the summer of 2010, I conducted anthropological research at the Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital and Institute of Gerontology (TMGHIG). Founded in 1972, TMGHIG is the oldest specialized research facility dedicated to gerontological research and development in Japan. I requested to do my research a TMGHIG because one of their fundamental aims has been to take a multiple-disciplinary approach to gerontological research&mdash;including the fields of medicine, psychology, and sociology. In this environment I could observe how qualitative research is currently being used and therefore how an anthropologist might contribute to such dynamics.  Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital and Institute of Gerontology additionally encourages cross-national research collaboration by incorporating foreign scientists and scholars into their research teams as well as partnering with international gerontological research institutes.  Cross-cultural comparative studies bring vital insight into the unique cultural values that shape the lives and care of elderly but also shed light on similarities and differences across cultures and nations.
