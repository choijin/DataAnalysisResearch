<AbstractNarration>The goal of the Arctic in Rapid Transition (ART) Initiative is to better understand multifaceted climate processes across the land-ocean-atmosphere system.  The Initiative began in response to the last International Conference on Arctic Research Planning (ICARP), which identified the need for synthesis activities across Arctic system science.  Subsequently, the ART program was established and has two phases.  The first phase was completed in early 2010 with the drafting of a science plan that was the product of a three day workshop hosted at the International Arctic Research Center in Fairbanks, Alaska.  The workshop brought together more than 50 scientists from nine counties to outline the priorities to be considered within the ART Initiative.  The science plan was presented to the Arctic Ocean Science Board (AOSB) and endorsed by the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) during their annual meeting in Nuuk, Greenland. With the science plan written, vetted and endorsed by the broader Arctic science community phase two of the Initiative can now begin.  A workshop will be held at the Freshwater Institute in Winnipeg Canada from October 18 - 20th to draft an implementation plan based on the research priorities identified in the science plan.  The implementation plan will focus on linkages within the marine system, including contributions from land-ocean gateways, shelf seas, and the deep ocean. A range of time scales will also be explored, from Paleoclimates to the rapid change currently being observed in the Arctic.  As with the science plan, the implementation effort will be organized and executed almost entirely by early career scientists from five different nations (U.S., Canada, Norway, Germany, and Sweden) making the ART Initiative a unique international effort.</AbstractNarration>

The persistent mismatch between observed and projected patterns makes planning and mitigation activities in the Arctic region complicated.

The Arctic in Rapid Transition (ART) implementation plan initiative was an effort to build an integrative, international, interdisciplinary, pan-Arctic network to study the spatial and temporal changes in sea ice cover, ocean circulation and associated physical drivers over multiple timescales to better understand and forecast the impact of these changes on the ecosystems and biogeochemistry of the Arctic Ocean. The ART Initiative was initiated by early career scientists in October 2008 and over the course of five years hosted two international workshops and a number of special sessions at science meetings that fostered the development of unique hypotheses to test the current understanding of the Arctic.  This effort led directly to a large multi-disciplinary field program in the European science community and has helped principal investigators develop proposals for funding calls from major U.S. agencies.
