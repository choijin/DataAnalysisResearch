<AbstractNarration>With this award, Professor Neubauer will pursue a five-year plan to develop strategies for processing, analyzing, and visualizing vast quantities of data obtained with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In collaboration with personnel at the University of Chicago, hardware will be developed for a fast hardware tracker (FTK) system as an upgrade to the current ATLAS trigger system. Designed to exploit unique tracking signatures produced by events of interest, this system will be crucial for maintaining good efficiency and operational stability of the ATLAS trigger. Data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC will be analyzed in novel ways to try to elucidate the unknown physics behind electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and discover new physics at the TeV scale. Course materials in multivariate analysis and scientific GPU computing that will cut across departmental boundaries will be developed for a new special topics graduate-level class, Advanced Analysis Techniques. Finally, curriculum developed for the NSF sponsored EnLiST-L program (Entrepreneurial Leadership in Science Teaching and Learning) will be more widely disseminated through the use of technology, thereby increasing the engagement of underserved individuals and communities, including at-risk youth in the Chicago area and the hearing-impaired. The project will also enhance existing infrastructure to support collaborative science requiring data-intensive computing in the U.S. through active participation in the Open Science Grid.</AbstractNarration>

Since we know through observation that the EM force is much stronger than the weak force, electroweak symmetry is a broken symmetry. We also know that most fundamental particles have mass, including the weak force carriers that are massive and have a short-ranged interaction. Exactly how this symmetry is broken and how fundamental particles acquire their mass without violating gauge invariance is one of the most important questions in particle physics and a primary focus of this project.  The SM provides a mechanism that answers both of these questions simultaneously. Particle masses arise when the electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken by the interaction of massless fields with the Higgs field, an invisible, spinless field that permeates all space and has a non-zero value everywhere, even in its lowest energy state. A would-be massless particle that interacts with the Higgs field is slowed down from the speed-of-light due to this interaction and consequently acquires a non-zero mass. This Higgs mechanism makes the remarkable prediction that a single massive, neutral, spinless particle called the ``Higgs boson''---a quantum excitation of the Higgs field---must exist. Equally remarkable is that we have progressed technologically to be able to produce Higgs bosons in the laboratory. While Higgs boson mass is not predicted by the SM, it must be less than ~1000 times the mass of the proton to avoid the infinities previously mentioned.  The primary goals of this project were to (1) study W/Z/h boson pair production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to elucidate the mechansism behind electroweak symmetry breaking and to search for new physics beyond the SM, (2) develop electronics for a massively-parallel system to perform particle tracking for the ATLAS trigger and (3) employ modern tools and techologies from particle physics research and data science to advance education and outreach.    The major activities of this project in pursuit of these goals were (1) the analysis of diboson production in proton-proton collision data from the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, (2) development of the second-stage processing electronics for the Fast Tracker (FTK) upgrade to the ATLAS trigger system, and (3) development of curriculum for new course within the University of Illinois Physics Department on data analysis and machine learning applications for physicists.  The work supported by this project contributed to the 2012 Higgs boson discovery at the LHC through an analysis of the W boson pair production. Through the project, a precise measurement of the Higgs boson couplings to other particles and an observation of the Higgs boson decaying to W boson pairs was achieved.

The firmware we have developed in this project and experience we have gained with the FTK system provide important input to the ATLAS Phase-2 hardware track trigger upgrade planned for use during HL-LHC running.  A new undergraduate physics course utilizing open source data and modern tools from data science has been developed through this project, designed to teach basics of scientific data analysis and applications of machine learning in physics. We live in a data-centric world, with people and machines learning from vast amounts of data. Early-career physicists need a solid understanding in the basics of data analysis, data-driven inference and machine learning, and a working knowledge of modern tools and techniques from data science. This course will educate and train the next generation of physics students at Illinois in data science and machine learning applications for physics.
