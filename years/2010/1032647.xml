<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The number of wind turbines (WT) in a park is usually restricted to a fixed, limited geographical area.  This BRIGE project is a wind tunnel experimental study to test new possible parameters, which can impact the extracting capabilities of the wind turbine, thus providing new insight in wind turbine array design. The wind tunnel experiments will be carried out at the new state-of-the-art wind tunnel facility at Portland State University.  The obtained data will be used to address the following issues for the various configurations: (i) test parameters such as turbine height, rotation, spacing and tip-speed ratio as well as geometrical arrangement to understand its impact on the power extraction, (ii) use Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (Tomo-PIV) to measure high-resolution velocity maps in wind tunnel models of WT arrays under the selected tested configurations and understand these more in depth, and (iii) employ Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) data analysis technique to observe the flow structures and more importantly to identify the energy containing modes.  Results will provide tools for designing optimal WT arrays, lead to economic impact and potentially aid computer modelers in simulating such arrays.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The planned research will advance the applicability, efficiency, and understanding of the long-term sustainability of wind energy extraction from the atmospheric environment. The project will also have several outreach components including: (i) expose a PhD student to an international experience in Oslo, Norway (with Norwegian Defense Research Establishment), (ii) work with a high school in Portland (Gladstone High School), which has a sustainability background, to raise their awareness in the area of wind energy and to keep students motivated in the area of STEM, (iii) recruit undergraduate students from Puerto Rico to attend summer programs and mentor them for academic careers in the fields of energy and sustainability, and (iv) involve hired undergraduates and graduate students in the already-in-place MESA day.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The number of wind turbines in a park is usually restricted to be placed within a fixed, limited geographical area. Behind a wind turbine, a wake is formed where the mean wind speed decreases and the turbulence intensity increases. The distance between the turbines is among other things dependent on the recovery of wind energy behind the neighboring turbines and the increased wind load.  Under such naturally highly variable conditions, this placement may prove to be key in the efficiency of the energy extraction. With anticipated large-scale implementation, even if only a few percent increase in wind-turbine capacity factor could be achieved through careful optimization, significant economic impact could be expected.   Wind tunnel experiments using laser-based techniques were performed in the Portland State University facility to understand the flow fields and power extraction capabilities of wind farms given different parameters such as turbine height, direction of rotation of rotors, horizontal spacing and turbine alignment.  In each of the parametric variations, an increase in power production is attained for cases different than the canonical aligned wind farm.  The power is then related to the flow field providing an understanding of the flow behavior and physics within the wind parks.  The cases result in a significant improvement of power extraction based on the acquired data.  Data analysis techniques are applied to further understand the flow physics within the wind turbine array.  Via the results, it is also possible to provide tools for designing improved WT arrays leading to economic impact and in addition provide ways to simulate such arrays including further physics.  Through the life of the grant, several outreach components were carried out.  These include: a.) exposing a students to an international experience in Norway, France, Germany, Denmark and Switzerland; b.) recruit undergraduate students from Puerto Rico to attend summer programs and mentor them for academic careers in the ?elds of energy and sustainability; c.) involve graduate, undergraduates, visiting international and high school students in summer research programs; d.) partner with national and international institutions; e.) partner with local institutions to engage scientifically in renewable energy; and f.) encourage high school students to pursue STEM oriented careers by exposing them to the current research and our facilities.  The dissemination of the technical work is done via peer-reviewed publications as well as presentations at national and international conferences.
