<AbstractNarration>Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical and computational research and education where techniques from statistical and computational physics are applied to a variety of nonlinear problems in the mechanics of solids, mainly but not exclusively involving fracture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some particular questions to be addressed include:   How do cracks choose their direction? What are the fracture properties of graphene? Why does the method of creating graphene with tape work? How does rubber behave when stretched at high rates, and how does this behavior affect fracture? What are the laws of adhesion and friction that govern practical attempts to build optical nanostructures? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions come from many different subdisciplines of physics and engineering, but are unified by underlying theoretical techniques, by a common set of numerical tools, and by an overarching theme of materials research which seeks to answer: How do macroscopic phenomena follow from microscopic foundations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parts of this research may have engineering applications. The PI will provide support to instructors around the world after completion of a second edition of a textbook on condensed matter physics. He will complete a textbook for an undergraduate course on how to conduct scientific research. He will use techniques from statistical physics to analyze data from high-stakes public school tests and develop new ways to assess schools and teachers. He will continue to oversee the preparation of science and mathematics teachers at his home institution, as well as a rapidly growing national network of universities replicating the UT Austin program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education with the aim of understanding how the behavior of materials follows from underlying physical laws. In particular, the PI aims to understanding the atomic-scale underpinnings of mechanical behavior, such as how solids stretch, bend, flow, and fracture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the outstanding problems in the theory of fracture is how cracks choose which direction to go.  The problem is particularly difficult when the cracks are moving fast, and particularly important when the crack is an earthquake that may or may not hit a densely populated area. Some hints at how to proceed come from experiments on the rupture of rubber, and the PI will actively pursue these hints. Another problem concerns the formation of graphene, a promising candidate material for electronic devices of the future. It was first obtained by pulling on graphite with adhesive tape. Why does such a simple process work? Can it be optimized to make very large strips of graphene? The PI will try to answer that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second part of the proposal concerns education. The PI is just finishing a graduate text on the whole field of Condensed Matter Physics, and will provide supporting materials. He is finishing an undergraduate text on how to conduct scientific research, and will provide supporting materials. He is applying techniques from statistical physics to the analysis of high-stakes test scores, which may influence how these scores are used to evaluate teachers, schools, and districts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Project Outcomes for DMR 10002428   This project concerned research where techniques from statistical and computational physics were applied to a variety of nonlinear problems in the mechanics of solids, mainly but not exclusively involving how they break apart.     Intellectual Merit   Graphene Fracture    One of the activities was to study the breaking of graphene. Graphene is a new material, a layer of carbon one atom think, with fascinating electrical and mechanical properties. A goal was to figure out how these layers ripple and how they break apart. During the course of the work, we performed detailed numerical simulations of the breaking process and also constructed a fairly simple theory making it possible to predict the conditions of breakage based on how hard the graphene was being pulled (Figure 1)  Here are links to some movies of graphene fracture:  http://youtu.be/Jx6yqbQTcGI   http://youtu.be/Dn4be5uOAfI   How does rubber behave when stretched at high rates, and how does this behavior affect fracture?    We carried out detailed numerical studies of this problem, and compared the results with experiment. Our numerical models succeeded in capturing the deformation of rubber around rapidly moving ruptures in reasonably fine detail (Figure 2).     How do cracks choose their direction?      Another primary effort  in this project was to understand rules that dictate how cracks choose  their path. The questions were inspired by experiments in rubber where  cracks spontaneously oscillated. It is easy to see the phenomenon just  by popping a balloon, but the implications extend to large and more  threatening cracks such as earthquakes.  (Figure 3) We succeeded in building numerical simulations of breaking rubber when the cracks oscillated in a manner similar to experiment. An example is here:     We also constructed a theory for how the  oscillations work, and for a while were satisfied with the comparison  with experiment. Then we identified a  problem with the theory, noticing that in many cases it predicted cracks  that would along exponential paths away from the starting crack line,  instead of oscillating as seen both in experiments and numerical  studies.     Analytical Models of Atomic Fracture    I had been working for nearly 20 years on exact methods to find the motions of atoms surrounding a crack. Even after this long time, I had never completed the process of finding all the atomic locations explicitly when they were fully free to move in two dimensions. During this granting period I finally worked with a graduate student long enough to carry out all the necessary steps and finish this problem (Figure 4).       Hydrofracturing    Over the course of the grant we began applying principles of fracture to the collection of gas and oil from hydrofractured wells. In part the work directly built on the numerical simulations that had been used to study rupture of rubber, although this effort was not completed during the granting period. What was completed was a method to predict the gas output from a well for years in the future based on its past history. This method was used to summarize data from many thousands of wells near Dallas-Fort Worth (the Barnett Shale), was made part of an interdisciplinary effort to predict US shale gas reserves, and won the Cozzarelli Prize for best paper in applied sciences in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences for 2013 (Figure 5)    Broader Impacts.    Condensed Matter Physics    Just prior to awarding of this grant, I finished the second edition of a graduate textbook on condensed matter physics. I had promised to prepare instructor materials in support of the book, including solutions for all the problems and lecture notes for use by instructors, and I did so.    Research Methods for Science:    During the grant I completed a second textbook, on scientific methods for undergraduates, specifically aimed at future science and mathematics teachers. I also prepared...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
