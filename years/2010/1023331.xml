<AbstractNarration>The Arctic Ocean ecosystem may respond dramatically to climate change through already observed modification of the physical environment (e.g., hydrography and ice cover). A better understanding of the coupled biological-physical ocean ecosystem, and its interannual variability, is necessary to predict and understand these potential impacts of climate change on the Arctic ecosystem. The Chukchi-Beaufort Sea region near Barrow, AK, including coastal waters, has been identified as key because it lies at the junction of several ocean regions and downstream of the Pacific Arctic gateway and hence is influenced physically and ecologically by input from Bering Strait. Researchers have conducted oceanographic sampling of the coupled physical and biological marine environment in the Chukchi and near-shore Beaufort Seas for five years (2005 ? 2009), including coastal waters, using boat-based surveys during late summer and short-term (month) and year-long bottom-mounted moorings, and have observed significant interannual variability. They will now establish annual surveys of the pelagic marine environment and deploy a year-round mooring in Barrow Canyon as components of the Arctic Observing Network (AON). The surveys will measure a range of biological and physical parameters including hydrography, currents, plankton standing stocks, nutrients, and plankton genetics. The mooring will measure ocean currents, near bottom temperature and salinity, and acoustic backscatter (zooplankton proxy) in Barrow Canyon at a location typically within or beneath the Alaska Coastal Current.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this AON component will provide a 10-year record and enable a better understanding of inter-annual variability in the physical and biological characteristics of the Barrow area ocean confluence. Based on these data, changes in biological characteristics that respond to larger climate change can be detected. This proposed AON component includes measurements of key oceanic biological and chemical parameters, and their coupling to physical parameters from a region sensitive to climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will actively communicate plans and results with the community of Barrow through formal and informal discussions and presentations. They will also support the participation of a teacher in fieldwork for two of the years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two major seas, the Beaufort Sea to the east and Chukchi Sea to the west, meet near Point Barrow, the northernmost point in Alaska and in the United States.  Over the last decade, these seas and the region have experienced dramatic environmental changes.  Point Barrow lies just north of the city of Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), an important I?upiat (Eskimo) community and the seat of the expansive North Slope Borough.  The seas around Utqiagvik have provided subsistence food for the I?upiat community for centuries.  In particular, bowhead whales may be found in large groups near Point Barrow during their fall migration from the Canadian Arctic to the northern Bering Sea, providing important hunting opportunities for the local community.  Point Barrow lies in the shipping pathway between the Bering Sea and the petroleum fields of the North Slope, Canada, and the Northwest Passage to the east.  In recent years, in part because of the changing environmental conditions, oil and gas prospects have been explored in the Chukchi Sea to the west. With the ongoing environmental changes also comes the potential for the development of commercial fisheries in the region.  Thus the ecosystems of these seas are potentially vulnerable to disruption from the environment as well as from multiple human activities.  Such disruptions could threaten the subsistence lifestyle and success of northern Alaskan communities.  It is important to understand the environmental changes, the impacts to the ecosystem, and the interannual variability in those changes and impacts.  This six year, Arctic Observing Network project described the interannual variability in ocean conditions in late August 2010-2015 across sentinel lines in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas near Point Barrow.  Oceanographic sampling was conducted from a small (43? or 50?) research vessel across the transect lines that originated near the coast and extended across the shelf to the deeper water to the north in the Beaufort Sea or across a submarine canyon, Barrow Canyon, that lies to the north and west of Point Barrow. Data on ocean temperature and salinity and currents and samples for water nutrients and chlorophyll content and microzooplankton and mesozooplankton abundance were collected.  Data were archived at the Arctic Data Center.   We found substantial interannual variability in ocean conditions, especially water temperatures and the presence of sea ice melt water, that was related to broad-scale winds and sea ice cover over the Chukchi Sea during the summer.  Together with data collected from 2005-2009 as part of previous efforts, we found that the large groups of bowhead whales that are found near Pt. Barrow in fall co-occur with dense patches of their prey (krill which are small crustaceans). The patches form in response to local wind conditions coupled with the current pathways in the region.  Easterly winds bring krill onto the shallow shelf to the northeast of Point Barrow where they are trapped and concentrated between two currents, making the krill more available and concentrated for the whales.  This in turn suggests that years with few easterly winds in fall would be years in which whales might not be found near Point Barrow and thus not be as available to the local I?upiat hunters.
