<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research project is to expand the understanding of Atomic layer deposition (ALD) operation at atmospheric pressure and open new opportunities for low cost high speed coating.New methods to produce thin film coatings for electronic devices and improved textile materials are important for passivation and protection, and can provide new function. Most common methods are not compatible with temperature and throughput needed for coating high surface area polymer fibers.  ALD is a relatively new coating process that can produce extremely well controlled coatings at low temperatures compatible with plastics.  One downside to ALD is that it generally requires samples to be placed in a vacuum chamber, which can be costly and slow.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The work has the potential for broad impact because it will define a new methodology for nanomanufacturing of organic electronics and nonwoven fiber surface stabilization.  The work will advance discovery through the work of two PhD graduate students.  Students from underrepresented groups will be recruited to participate. Research infrastructure will be enhanced by supporting existing shared user facilities, and by expanding the availability of ALD reactors at NC State.  The PIs will also introduce these Nanotechnology concepts to middle and high school students through their participation in annual NC State University sponsored events.</AbstractNarration>
