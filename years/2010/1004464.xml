<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The primary objective of the research funded by this fellowship was to use new geometric techniques in order to study symmetries that arise in  algebra, number theory and other parts of mathematics.  Over the course of the fellowship, the Principal Investigator (PI) worked on three central projects.    The  first, a continuation of earlier work, laid out geometric foundations  which have since been used to answer a number of open questions,  including one of the central questions in the field of modular  representation theory, a branch of algebra.  The second project  resulted in the discovery of a geometric symmetry and the formulation of  a collection of conjectures connecting its existence to the structure  of fundamental objects in algebra.  The third project explored the  ramifications of a geometric duality recently introduced independently  by mathematicians and physicists.  Following this motivation, the PI and  a collaborator defined a new class of algebras with a number of  striking properties.  These algebras are defined from combinatorial  structures, like the hyperplane arrangement in the attached image.  Broader Impacts  Over  the course of the fellowship, the PI began two new collaborations, with  a mathematician at Louisiana State University and another at the  University of Massachusetts Amherst.  The PI also continued a fruitful  collaboration with two mathematicians in France and Germany  respectively.  The research done was disseminated in preprints on  the web and in publications.  The PI also gave over 20 presentations on  his research in seminars and conferences on a range of topics in algebra  and geometry.  The PI had the opportunity to teach a graduate  course, also attended by students from surrounding universities, and a  course for both undergraduate and graduate students on algebraic  geometry with connections to combinatorics.  During the final year  of the fellowship, the PI was invited to continue his research at the  Max Planck Institute in Bonn, Germany, and as of January 2015, will  begin work as a tenure-track professor at the University of California  Riverside.
