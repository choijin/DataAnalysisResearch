<AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place July 10-23, 2011, at the Instituto Geof√≠sico of the Escuela Politecnica Nacional in Quito, Ecuador.  This PASI is a collaborative effort by Olga Cabello of the Incorporated Research Institutions of Seismology Consortium (IRIS) in the United States, and the Centro Regional de Sismologia para America del Sur (CERESIS) in Ecuador.  The PASI will gather together early-career researchers to develop a basic understanding of sustainable network operations and earthquake science, as well as to facilitate data exchange and collaboration.  It is designed to enable graduate students and post-docs who have a strong background in the fundamentals of seismology to begin collaborating in seismological research internationally and to facilitate future collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to transform the culture of how seismic networks and scientists operate throughout the Americas by encouraging greater data archiving, standardization and sharing.  Participants will gain the ability to implement modern seismic methods, including improving earthquake locations and source mechanisms detected by their network.  Capacity building for seismic networks across the Americas will benefit the U.S. seismological community by increasing the potential for scientific collaboration with other countries where success of a project often depends on the availability of collaborators and access to reliable data.  Expected outcomes for this PASI include: 1) a guide to sustainable network operations; 2) a publically distributed inventory of networks in the Americas; and, 3) a digital index of software and a portal to facilitate future international research.  The PASI results will be disseminated through electronic devices for educational purposes with links, updates and logistic information, guides to the network operations, and an inventory to provide the latest data on research problems.</AbstractNarration>

This institute was possible by the participation of fifteen volunteer senior faculty and investigators from the U.S. and the Americas.  The Institute curriculum was designed to achieve four objectives: 1) Assist the participants in developing an understanding of the principles of sustainable network operations, 2) Promote open access and exchange of data within and between countries in support of research, education, and hazard mitigation, 3) Examine recent advances and current challenges in estimating earthquake source parameters and imaging Earth structure, and 4) Facilitate future research collaborations.  The Institute engaged graduate students, post-doctoral students, and new faculty from across the Americas in an interactive collaborative learning environment including modules on techniques such as double-difference earthquake location and tomography, regional centroid&ndash;moment tensors, and event-based and ambient noise surface wave dispersion and tomography.  Under the faculty guidance, participants initiated promising research projects about surface wave tomography in southeastern Brazil, near the Chilean triple junction, in central Chilean Andes, at the Peru-Chile border, within Peru, at a volcano in Ecuador, in the Caribbean Sea region, and near the Mendocino triple junction.

In order to track the progress of the participants and measure the overall effectiveness of the Institute a reunion is planned where the PASI alumni will present the result of their research that was initiated in Quito  Achievement of the Institute√Üs primary objectives was assessed by comparing responses to two targeted surveys completed by all participants before arrival to the venue, and upon completion of the course. Comparative results reveal a substantial increase in the understanding of sustainable network operations, the significance of open data policies, and the importance of international collaborations in seismology.  The high quality and diversity of the research projects initiated on site, as evidenced by the participant presentations and the end of the Institute, and the subsequent evolution of some of these projects indicate the achievement of the latter two objectives.
