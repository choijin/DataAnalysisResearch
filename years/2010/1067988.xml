<AbstractNarration>The objects of study are Schrödinger operators whose potentials are obtained by sampling with a continuous function along the orbits of an ergodic transformation on a compact metric space. This framework covers many examples of interest, such as almost-periodic potentials and random potentials. The spectral properties of such operators are closely linked to the dynamical behavior of an energy-indexed family of cocycles over the given ergodic transformation. The problems the proposer intends to investigate include the following: an analysis of Schrödinger cocycles over uniformly hyperbolic transformations and an analog of the Kotani Support Theorem in this context, sufficient conditions for the absence of non-uniform hyperbolicity for general cocycles over subshifts, eigenvalue statistics for the critical almost Mathieu operator, the structure of the spectrum of square Fibonacci Hamiltonian at intermediate coupling, denseness of uniform hyperbolicity for cocyles over strictly ergodic transformations beyond the continuous category, inverse spectral theory in the presence of absolutely continuous spectrum, direct and inverse spectral theory for quasi-periodic Schrödinger operators with applications to the KdV equation, and the study of measures on the unit circle associated with almost periodic Verblunsky coefficients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum mechanics is a fundamental branch of physics whose foundations were established during the first half of the twentieth century. The study of quantum mechanical phenomena in disordered environments has been an area of ongoing active study since the 1950's. The mathematical study of electronic properties of disordered structures is carried out within the framework of ergodic Schrödinger operators. This project therefore has a potential impact on physics as it improves our understanding of quantum mechanical transport properties of media exhibiting certain kinds of disorder. Through the training of graduate students the project has in addition an impact on human resource development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated connections between spectral theory and dynamical systems. Primarily, the PI and his collaborators used tools from the theory of dynamical systems to answer problems of current interest in spectral theory that have resisted other approaches.     Significant progress has been accomplished on our understanding of the solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation with almost periodic initial data, especially when these initial data are small. In the latter case, global existence and uniqueness of the solution has been established. Moreover, a desciption of the isospectral torus of the initial condition has been obtained, and as a result the solution remains almost periodic in space at all times. These results pave the way toward an answer to a question of Percy Deift, namely, whether such solutions are almost periodic in time.     Other significant progress has been obtained in the study of mathematical quasicrystal models, and in particular their spectral and quantum dynamical properties. Several well-known open problems could be solved, including conjectures by Jean Bellissard and Barry Simon.     Two graduate students were trained in the context of this project. Each one of them has produced several research papers and a doctoral thesis, completed the Ph. D. degree, and landed a postdoctoral position at a US research university.
