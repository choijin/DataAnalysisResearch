<AbstractNarration>This research is designed to answer basic questions about how magmatic systems operate and how magmas change composition. The work is societally relevant in terms of advancing our understanding of geologic hazards associated explosive volcanic eruptions. It involves making a comprehensive set of laboratory experiments and geochemical analyses on previously collected ocean bottom volcanic rocks to understand the mechanism by which these magmas evolve in the magma chamber from low to high silica in content. Newly developed isotopic techniques will be used to test the novel hypothesis that high silica magmas form through magma based diffusional transport processes related to sustained temperature gradients across the magma lens at the top of the magma chamber. This hypothesis runs counter to the more traditionally invoked mechanism of assimilation fractional crystallization as the primary process causing the compositional differentiation of magmas. Broader impacts of the work include integration of training and research which involves a graduate student, a postdoctoral researcher, undergraduates, and middle school students. Results of the work will be incorporated into university courses in petrology, geochemistry and numerical modeling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Oceanic crust that makes up most of the solid surface of Earth is almost entirely hidden beneath the oceans.  Less than a few percent of it has been sampled and studied in detail yet its formation and composition are important for us to investigate in order to fully understand the ways in which the surface of our planet have formed and the chemical balances in the ocean.  Most of the oceanic crust is formed at rift zones &ndash; elongate volcanoes that erupt dense, low-silica basaltic lava &ndash; that are commonly associated with hydrothermal vents spewing hot, metal-rich fluids on to the sea floor and adding chemicals to seawater.  These magmatic systems known as mid-ocean ridge (MOR) spreading centers are very different from those that erupt on the continents where the lavas and associated plutonic rocks (solidified magma chambers) have high silica and volatile contents thus making them more explosive and dangerous. Typical continental volcanoes erupt andesites and dacites &ndash; rock types that are very rare at MOR.   However, recent detailed mapping and sampling at a number of different MOR settings have documented the eruption of oceanic andesites and dacites. High-silica plutonic rocks known at plagiogranites (somewhat similar to continental granites) have also been found in places where ancient oceanic crust has been thrust onto the continents. In both instances the origins of these types of rocks are poorly known. High-silica lavas erupted at different MOR, show remarkably similar major element trends, incompatible trace element enrichments, and isotopic characteristics suggesting that similar processes control their formation. Geochemical studies (including our previous research) have proposed that they are primarily produced by extreme fractional crystallization accompanied by some upper crustal assimilation but stable isotope results suggest other processes such as thermal diffusion may play a significant role as well.  The main goals of this research project were to use geochemical analyses including non-traditional isotope ratios in suites of oceanic high-silica lavas (andesites and dacites) and in plagiogranites from the Troodos ophiolite in order to better constrain and evaluate the various mechanisms that may have formed these rock types.  Samples from four different MOR locations (Galapagos Spreading Center, Southern Juan de Fuca Ridge (JdF), Axial Seamount, 9&deg;N EPR overlapping spreading center [OSC] ) were measured for major and trace elements, and radiogenic and non-traditional isotopes that allowed us to test mechanisms of magmatic differentiation involving fractional crystallization, crustal assimilation and thermal migration.
