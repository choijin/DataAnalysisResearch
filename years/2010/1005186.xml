<AbstractNarration>An award was made to the University of Hawaii at Hilo (UH Hilo) to provide research training for 10 students for eleven weeks in the summer, beginning 2011 through 2014. At least two students will continue their research during the academic year. The program is a partnership between UH Hilo and researchers from government agencies conducting research on the Island of Hawaii (e.g., USGS-Biological Resources Division, US Forest Service). The Island of Hawaii, with its diversity and high representation of almost all ecological niches found in the archipelago, presents an excellent living laboratory in which to train future researchers. The goal of this REU program is to provide an exciting and challenging summer research experience for undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary field of conservation biology and prepare them for future careers in science. To increase the diversity of students entering this field, this program targets those students with limited research experience, first generation college students, and under-represented minorities. The summer program will begin with a one-week orientation that will introduce the students to the university, research design and analysis, and report writing and presentation. The remaining weeks will consist of students working side by side with researchers on their projects. In addition, one day a week will involve lectures and field trips focused on different topics in conservation biology, and sessions on the responsible conduct of research, statistics, report writing and presentation, and graduate school and career presentations. Students will complete a written research paper and make an oral presentation at the undergraduate research symposium. The program will use an online assessment tool for evaluating the success of the program. More information is available at http://www.uhh.hawaii.edu/uhintern/, or by contacting Rebecca Ostertag (ostertag@hawaii.edu) or Sharon Ziegler-Chong (ziegler@hawaii.edu).</AbstractNarration>

In Hawaii, less than 30% of the research scientists and resource managers in our conservation work force are ethnic minorities and less than 35% of conservation research scientists are originally from Hawai&lsquo;i (although 75% of the state are minorities). The REU Program developed at the University of Hawai&lsquo;i at Hilo provides high-quality research experiences, training students in scientific research, writing, and communication skills as well as providing an understanding of larger conservation science and resource management issues. Each REU participant (a) experiences what it is to be a scientist, (b) develops independent research skills through a mentored experience that includes project planning, design, execution, data analysis, interpretation, and presentation, (c) gains a broader understanding of the issues and approaches to conducting tropical conservation science, specifically as it is experienced in Hawai&lsquo;i, and (d) develops networks and meaningful relationships with current research scientists and peers. The REU program&rsquo;s placement within the larger and long established Pacific Internship Programs for Exploring Science (PIPES, http://hilo.hawaii.edu/uhintern/) allows for REU participants to be exposed to broader research topics, management experiences, and environmental education experiences of other PIPES cohort interns. Each REU student completed an independent research project, prepared a final written report, and presented their findings to a large audience as part of a 2-day UH Hilo PIPES symposium.
