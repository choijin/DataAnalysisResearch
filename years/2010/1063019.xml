<AbstractNarration>This NSF award to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville  funds U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by the G8 Research Councils Initiative on Multilateral Research through the Interdisciplinary Program on Application Software towards Exascale Computing for Global Scale Issues. This is a pilot collaboration among the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Canadian National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), the German Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR),and the United Kingdom Research Councils (RC-UK), supporting collaborative research projects selected on a competitive basis that are comprised of researchers from at least three of the partner countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project across six countries focuses on three research topics that address limitations in numerical modeling of physics, chemistry and biology with the NCAR Community Earth System Model Version 1 (CESM1) and similar codes used by other countries. These research topics include new approaches to handle resilience, node level optimization and system level scalability. This research will enable the development of more scalable model ensembles. These will allow better evaluation of climate sensitivity and climate feedback processes, a better quantification of model uncertainty and a better understanding of the effects of natural variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide essential knowledge toward scaling climate codes for exascale and thus reducing current uncertainties on climate evolution; it will foster interactions between computer scientists and climate scientists; will foster international collaborations in the area of climate simulations and exascale computing; and will educate a new generation of researchers that understand both the application domain of climate simulation and high-performance computing</AbstractNarration>

Uninformed decisions, including ones of no action, could have a very high cost in money and lives. Therefore, it is essential to reduce, as soon as possible, the current uncertainties about future climate change. Numerical models of the physics, chemistry, and biology affecting the Earth-atmosphere climate system are key tools to these projections. Today, even as we prepare to run complex models of the EarthÆs climate system on petascale machines, we realize that despite the extensive capabilities that petascale will enable, a number of critical limitations in modeling the climate system require an exascale capability. One of the areas where research is necessary in order to allow the climate models to produce meaningful results is the area of fault tolerance.   The size and structure of future large-scale architectures increase the likelihood of a larger number of soft and hard errors impacting an applicationÆs execution, especially with long-running applications like the NCAR Community Earth System Model Version 1 (CESM1).

The expectation is that a single software approach, being system-level (checkpoint/restart) or application-level (algorithm based), is unlikely to succeed in all aspects, highlighting the path toward middle-ground hybrid approaches, where distinct solutions will be envisioned for each execution stage.
