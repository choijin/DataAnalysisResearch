<AbstractNarration>The seventh U.S.-Korea Forum on Nanotechnology focusing on materials and systems for nano energy on April 5th &amp; 6th, 2010 in Seoul, Korea is proposed. The previous six forums covered broad range of topics in nanotechnology such as nanomanufacturing, active nano devices &amp; systems, education, environment, health &amp; safety, sustainable energy, nano-biotechnology, nano-electronics and its fusion with bio- and energy- technology. The seventh forum will further enhance the scientific outreach of nanotechnology by promoting partnership in emerging nano-energy technology which covers novel nanomaterials, energy storage including batteries and supercapacitors, sustainable energy technology including fuel cells, solar energy as well as other energy technologies including thermoelectricity, hydrogen generation, and combustion engines. There will be roughly 32 presenters from both countries along with an audience of 200 researchers in the field of nanotechnology. This Forum focuses on collaborated plan between two countries, specifically, the mechanisms for cooperation and exchange of young scientists. The Forum proceedings and findings will be available to a broad audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit includes the focus on grand challenges faced to gain a fundamental understanding in nano-energy and feasibility studies of applications in emerging green energy technology. The broader impacts include potential collaborative research initiatives between industry, government and academia in the two countries by introducing timely technologies in nano energy that will greatly improve the energy scenario in the near future and have a tremendous impact on global education and human civilization in general.</AbstractNarration>
