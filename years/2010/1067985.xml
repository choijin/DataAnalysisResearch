<AbstractNarration>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors are undergoing a three year-long major upgrade. The new Advanced LIGO will significantly improve the sensitivity of the initial LIGO experiment and increase scientists' chances of directly observing the ``ripples in space-time'' first predicted by Albert Einstein almost a century ago. Advanced LIGO is expected to open a new exciting window on the Universe, heralding the beginning of gravitational-wave astronomy as a revolutionary, new observational field. This award provides support for the LIGO group at the University of Mississippi. Mississippi researchers will contribute to the Advanced LIGO endeavor in the areas of detector characterization, data analysis and public outreach. Detector characterization and data analysis activities will focus on research and development of new tools and methods for use in Advanced LIGO gravitational-wave searches. New innovative outreach programs related to gravitational-wave astronomy and fundamental science will inspire the wonder and beauty of science among the general public in Mississippi and nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research activities funded through this award will significantly contribute to the main goals of Advanced LIGO: i) make the first detection of gravitational waves and ii) move into a phase where gravitational-wave signals will be used for routine astronomical observations and for testing the fundamental nature of gravitation. This project will increase training and mentoring opportunities for Mississippi students and young researchers, as well as expand public outreach opportunities in the region. In addition to bringing the excitement of science to the general public, the outreach activities will promote diversity and engagement of students from traditionally underrepresented populations through a program of visits of women and minority speakers to Mississippi's educational institutions.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual merit  The UMISS group contributed to LIGO science in the areas of data analysis and detector characterization. Data analysis work focused on the study of stellar-mass binary mergers coincident with Gamma Ray Bursts, LIGO's searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background, and on improving data quality for LIGO's transient searches.

UMISS researchers also developed new methods for the characterization of non-astrophysical noise in the instruments, contributed to the calibration of the detectors and investigated environmental factors that affected gravitational-wave searches, such as seismic activity at the LIGO sites.  Broader impacts  The support provided under this award allowed UMISS researchers to develop educational material, create new public outreach initiatives and train two post-doctoral researchers and many graduate and undergraduate students participating in the project. Several of these students became full members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, earned LIGO authorship rights and continue to work in the gravitational-wave field or closely related fields to date. UMISS public outreach activities and other educational initiatives in schools helped promote science to Mississippi students and the general public. Professional development workshops for teachers helped bring more science and technology in Mississippi's schools. The Oxford Science Cafe' , which started under this award, still captivates the imagination of local residents thanks to monthly lectures on frontier science by renowned scholars. The Advanced LIGO film documentary "LIGO generations" will bring the science of LIGO, Mississippi and Louisiana to a wide, international audience for years to come.
