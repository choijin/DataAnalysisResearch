<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The objective of this BRIGE project is to establish innovative research that will implement a multi-signal real-time digital receiver capable of high-resolution spectral estimation on a hybrid high-performance computing platform. The main effort will center on efficiently implementing the hardware to enhance the performance of the digital receiver over its predecessor. Techniques including intelligent partitioning of the signal processing tasks that will utilize the best features of both off-the-shelf graphics processing unit (GPU) and field-programmable gate array to increase the parallel processing capability of the receiver will be thoroughly investigated. The proposed receiver design capable of high-resolution spectrum estimation will provide remarkable improvement in performance over its predecessor and can detect up to 5 signals simultaneously with high instantaneous dynamic range and frequency resolution.  This performance enhancement can be attributed to factors such as: 1) use of an analog-to-digital converter with a higher sampling rate and precision, 2) use of 4096-point fast Fourier transform to perform high-resolution spectral analysis, and 3) use of a GPU that can provide performance acceleration.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Implications:  The proposed research creates ways to make science and engineering more inclusive to underrepresented groups by integrating a number of meaningful education and outreach activities with the proposed research.  From an educational perspective, the proposed work will provide research experience to undergraduate students, at the California State University, Fullerton in the area of High Performance Computing (HPC) and digital receiver technology.  The other educational activities planned are integration of research findings into core computer engineering courses and introduction of a new specialty track in High Performance Computing for Computer Engineering undergraduates.  The outreach efforts will also be made to expose underrepresented minority students at local high schools and community colleges to high performance computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Currently researchers are utilizing cost-efficient common off the-shelf (COTS) processors to speed up specific processing tasks.  The main contenders for the accelerator market are FPGAs and GPUs;  GPUs depend on the use of a large number of processing cores to perform parallel processing, while FPGAs have gained popularity due to its deeper pipelines or chains and flexible architectures that can handle the intensive computing load. Due to their individual advantages, researchers have used FPGAs and GPUs for accelerating HPC applications.  However, it has been reported that not all HPC applications can be accelerated using just FPGAs or GPUs alone.  A more efficient approach was adopted as part of this research where the combination of FPGA and GPU, with the CPU as the backbone was used to realize a truly hybrid computing platform to benefit from the two architectures.  However, here the challenge was in the intelligent task partitioning, reduction of FPGA-GPU communication requirements by utilizing data locality, and workload balancing of the HPC application to benefit from both the architectures.  As a modern radar receiver must rapidly search a large frequency range with maximum sensitivity, capabilities such as high instantaneous dynamic range (receiverÆs ability to detect weak signals in presence of strong interfering signals), good multiple signal detection capability, wider bandwidth, high time and frequency resolution are indispensable. The objective of this effort was to establish innovative research that implements a multi-signal real-time digital receiver capable of high-resolution spectral estimation on a hybrid high-performance computing platform.  The main effort of this work centered on efficiently implementing the hardware to enhance the performance of the digital receiver over its predecessor.  Techniques including intelligent partitioning of the signal processing tasks that utilize the best features of both off-the-shelf graphics processing unit (GPU) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to increase the parallel processing capability of the receiver were thoroughly investigated.  The 3 giga-sample-per-second (GSPS) hybrid computing platform digital wideband receiver system that was realized for this research utilized two Nvidia Tesla C2050 GPUs and a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA for hardware acceleration to drastically improve receiver performance over its predecessor designs. The instantaneous dynamic range of this receiver was almost double of the predecessor designs along with improvement in frequency separation from 10 MHz to 3 MHz and frequency resolution from 10 MHz to 0.5 MHz; the receiver architecture also achieves high-resolution spectral estimation and employs a hardware reuse mechanism for multiple signal detection before the next set of data arrives for processing.  The research effort will have a broad impact by developing a high performance computing architecture using off-the-shelf graphics processing unit (GPU) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA).  The intelligent partitioning of the signal processing tasks between computing platforms and parallelization of existing designs will be widely adopted by design engineers to efficiently implement computationally intensive hardware.
