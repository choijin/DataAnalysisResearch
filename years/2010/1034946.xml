<AbstractNarration>The Space Science Institute (SSI), in partnership with the University of Colorado's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and Oregon State University, are developing a Track 1, pilot project, called Discover Earth: An Innovative Technology Program for Libraries and their Communities. The project uses current geoscience research data to illustrate important Earth science concepts (e.g. spatial/temporal scales, cycles, states of matter). It also promotes the geosciences and geoscience careers as exciting and highly relevant to modern society. Technology is transforming not only how we conduct scientific research and education (both formal and informal) but it also has had a profound influence on the way people can communicate and access scientific information. The purpose of the project is to develop, implement, and evaluate several innovative geoscience education technologies that are tested in a library setting on two types of display platforms (spherical and multi-touch flatscreen). The project team also studies what kinds of social networking technologies work best to build a library community of practice (CoP). Lastly, the project produces several Earth science resources and activities that librarians can use to enrich the exhibit experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The view from space has deepened our understanding of Earth as a global, dynamic system. Instruments on satellites and spacecraft, coupled with advances in ground-based research, have provided us with astonishing new perspectives of our planet. Now more than ever, enhancing the publicÆs understanding of EarthÆs physical and biological systems is vital to helping citizens make informed policy decisions especially when they are faced with the consequences of global climate change. The purpose of the proposed project is to develop, implement, and evaluate several innovative geoscience education technologies that will be tested in a library setting. Technology is transforming not only how we conduct scientific research and education (both formal and informal) but it also has had a profound influence on the way people can communicate and access scientific information.     The National Center for Interactive Learning (NCIL) at the Space Science Institute received funding from the National Science Foundation for "Discover Earth: An Innovative Technology Program for Libraries and their Communities" (DE/Geo). The project explored the effective use of digital media in a library setting on two different types of display platforms: Magic Planet globe and 42" touch table.  This project was conducted in concert with NCIL's STAR Library Education Network project called STAR_Net (NSF #1010844). For information about STAR_Net go to www.STARnetLibraries.org. Libraries across the country are envisioning ways to help their patrons build 21st Century skills, which includes providing hands-on STEM learning experiences. Together, these projects take advantage of the unique position that libraries have within their communities to bring science concepts to underserved audiences (such as rural communities and ethnic minorities).  The results of this study should be of value to the geoscience and informal education communities.  DE/Geo consisted of two phases:  Phase 1 was conducted at the Hatfield Marine Science Visitor Center and focused on user ability to accurately interpret geoscience visualizations (from NOAA) on the Magic Planet globe without additional interpretation. Many of the NOAA visualizations were difficult to understand without interpretation, and even those with keys and legends still presented a challenge. The results from Phase 1 were used to build the final Magic Planet interactive in the Discover Earth exhibition (part of the STAR_Net Project).  Phase 2 was conducted at the Cherry Hills Public Library in New Mexico, and consisted of comparing user interactions and impressions of a high resolution sea surface temperature visualization on both a Magic Planet and a touch table (see attached images).  We choose a sea surface temperature visualization that was both visually appealing, and didn't require a lot of interpretation. We discovered that library patrons were able to adequately describe what was happening in the visualization regardless of medium, but many reported that the Magic Planet was a better attractor (thereby, more likely to draw them in to view the interactive).  The Magic Planet component that was placed in the traveling Discover Earth exhibition features 8 different geoscience visualizations, along with complementary information and fun facts about each data set.  Patrons report a high level of understanding with these data sets, and both they and the librarians are very pleased to have quality STEM information being disseminated in their local libraries.
