<AbstractNarration>Species that arose through hybridization provide a unique opportunity to examine the origins of biotic diversity, because the genomes of hybrid species contain evidence of past evolutionary processes. This project will examine the process of hybrid speciation in four distinct evolutionary lineages of a well-studied butterfly. Comparison of the genomes of the lineages will be used to identify portions of the genome that are under natural selection and assess the extent to which the selective processes underlying speciation are homogeneous and repeatable or varied. The genomic data will be linked with detailed ecological information to increase the biological interpretation of the results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in the most comprehensive examination to date of the genomic outcomes of hybridization. Broadly applicable statistical methods for genome-level DNA sequence analysis will be developed and implemented in freely available software. The project will provide training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars, outreach programs for K-12 students and educators, training in natural history for interested community groups, and contributions to public education about evolution and genetics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Species can arise when populations evolve differences from ancestors and contemporary relatives that prevent them from successful interbreeding and that allow independent evolution.  Hybridization, or breeding between distantly related organisms, results in novel genetic combinations, which can be the basis for the evolution of novel species.  The importance of hybridization in the origin of new species of animals has historically been under-appreciated, but this is changing as the application of new molecular tools increases our ability to detect hybrid species.  We have been investigating how hybridization leads to new species of butterflies in the western United States (butterflies in the genus Lycaeides).   We have characterized the genetics of individuals from many populations and sequenced genomes of butterflies that we have inferred are ancestral species and those that likely originated through hybridization.  Results thus far have confirmed the importance of hybridization in the speciation process, and have included the investigation of the genetic basis of host plant use (a trait that is often implicated in the speciation of plant-feeding insects).  Other results from this work include the creation of analytical tools that other researchers can use to understand genomic variation in natural populations. We are continuing to analyze data as some parts of the collaborative research grant are on-going.  A final objective in our work is to learn about the predominance of idiosyncratic or deterministic forces in the evolution of new species.  Evidence for idiosyncrasy would suggest that further progress in predicting the outcome of speciation will be difficult, while more determinism will suggest future directions for research into the causes and consequences of organismal diversification.
