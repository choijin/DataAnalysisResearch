<AbstractNarration>The Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign to be conducted May-June 2012 is a multi-regional, multi-platform effort to determine the impact of deep midlatitude continental convective clouds and their intrinsic dynamical, microphysical, and electrification processes upon upper tropospheric composition and chemistry.  This award will support collection and analysis of surface mesonet data in tandem with lightning mapping array (LMA) and in-situ balloon-borne measurements characterizing the electrical and microphysical behavior of thunderstorm systems within the Oklahoma-Texas subregion of DC3.  This work will be done in coordination with airborne atmospheric chemistry measurements from by a specially instrumented NSF/NCAR GV high-altitude jet and NASA DC-8 platform.  LMA data will be obtained from both an existing Oklahoma array and a planned west-Texas network.  Mobile ballooning teams will work in close coordination with other NSF-supported investigators to obtain convective updraft profiles of electric fields, thermodynamics, airflow and videosonde measurements of hydrometeor size, shape, phase and number density and to interpret these measurements within the context of both fixed-based and mobile polarimetric radar observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research derives from improved understanding of processes influencing lightning rates and structure (viz. channel lengths, structure and three-dimensional distribution) and storm-scale electric field polarity as a function of storm lifecycle and in relation to storm kinematic/microphysical properties, which will in-turn allow improved estimation lightning-induced NOx production and associated chemical transformations pivotal to DC3 program objectives.  These measurements will also support improved numerical storm simulations through more accurate specification of storm environment and distribution of various hydrometeors throughout electrically active clouds.  Broader impacts will accrue through both graduate and undergraduate student education within a field-project setting, via public outreach, by aiding operational forecasters in the interpretation of total lightning mapping data as anticipated from the GOES-R satellite, and ultimately through improved knowledge of the influence of deep atmospheric convection on the chemical composition of earth's atmosphere in the presence of natural and anthropogenic emissions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The channels that comprise lightning flashes extend throughout thunderclouds, and the lightning channels cause chemical reactions that produce nitrogen oxides which are converted by solar energy into ozone. The lightning pathway is one of the major natural sources of uncertainty in the distribution of oxides of nitrogen. The vertical distribution of these reactions was one of the subjects of study of the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) experiment.  A key outcome of our work during the DC3 experiment was development of an approach for using both lightning flash size and rate information to quantify flash energy and channel length, two properties of relevance to quantifying lightning-driven chemistry. Prior to our DC3 studies, various studies had suggested that turbulence in thunderclouds was responsible for creating numerous small flashes in the heart of the thunderstorm, while the absence of turbulence resulted in large flashes extending long distances in thunderstorm anvils. We found surprising evidence that the energy in lightning flashes is distributed with flash size like the distribution of energy in turbulent eddies.  Another objective of the DC3 studies was to study factors which controlled the placement of lightning channels in the vertical. The so-called anomalously electrified storms commonly found on the US high plains had been shown to have most of their channels near the top of the cloud, and with opposite polarity from "normal" thunderstorms. Previous studies showed that the availability of water vapor near earth?s surface could explain this variability. Our work discovered that dry layers in the middle of the atmosphere can have a similar effect. The details of how the availability of water vapor controls the charging rate and polarity during collisions of individual ice precipitation particles remains a challenging problem, but our studies of this topic have led to greater understanding of where there are shortcomings in current theories.  During the award we have advanced the community infrastructure for processing and characterizing lightning data through the development, publication and use of open-source software tools. Three graduate students, all from underrepresented groups, were trained during this award. Our new techniques for working with lighting flash size data have been widely disseminated to both the scientific research and operational meteorological communities.
