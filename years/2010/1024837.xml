<AbstractNarration>This is an exploratory proposal which seeks to understand the interaction between complexity and rare events in financial systems.  Specifically, we seek to model the behavior of central counterparties and banks.  Rare events in such systems often come from interaction between various parts of the system.  We will use the tools of large deviations and noncooperative game theory to characterize various aspects of how systemic and idiosyncratic risk propagate through nonlinearities in high-dimensional financial systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this proposal is on two problems which highlight several aspects of complexity in several exemplary financial systems.  In particular, we are interested in central counterparties and banks.  The complexity which we wish to investigate is the variety of risks which can affect  financial systems, and the (nonlinear) feedbacks between them.  Our motivation in these problems is to understand and control pathways of financial collapse.  Assumedly, regulatory requirements make financial collapse rare.  Amongst these rare configurations corresponding to financial meltdown or market collapse, which ones are the ``most'' likely?  How can we efficiently simulate these scenarios?  Furthermore, can we control the system and design suitable market mechanisms so that meltdown, if it occurs, is most likely to occur in some ``preferred'' way?  An intrinsic part of this analysis is the inherently noncooperative nature of financial systems; they involve a large number of agents, each of whom seeks to maximize its own profit.  When considering the associated control problem, we observe that the large population of agents leads to high dimensional  problems that may often be intractable. We intend to examine whether mean-field approximations may be employed to obtain a characterization of aggregate behavior. Additionally, Our focus is the impact of this structure on rare events.    The competing interactions between the different parts of the system imply that the behavior of the system cannot in general be fully understood by looking solely at a part of the system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the course of the proposed work, we also found a framework for addressing some concerns in stress testing of financial institutions.  This was the main direction of our work in the 2014-2015 period.  This work was in collaboration with Mark Flood of the Office of Financial Research and Jingnan Chen, a graduate student in Industrial Engineering at the University of Illinois, and now a faculty member at the Singapore University of Technology and Design.  Some of this work was carried out while the PI was at the Office of Financial Research during the summer of 2012.   The goal of stress testing of financial institutions is to understand how the institution will respond to various economic shocks.  Scenarios X1, X2 ... XN are submitted to the financial institution, which then calculates a response function G of an institutions' portfolio to these scenarios.  Implementation, however, is complicated as large financial institutions have very complex portfolios.  As a result, there is effectively a \emph{scenario budget}; the scenarios should be picked efficiently.   We believe that this is a meaningful use case for understanding more precisely how the theory of rare events can be implemented in practice.  The problem was driven by underlying data, and has implications for actionable decisions.   We looked at this problem through a lens of uncertainty quantification as developed by Owhadi et. al.  Owhadi addressed a similar problem in the realm of certification of the nuclear stockpile; since nuclear detonations are prohibited by international treaty, various questions concerning our aging nuclear stockpile must be derived from legacy data from actual explosions.  As in the stress testing scenario, scenario analysis must be carried out carefully to most efficiently draw conclusions from a limited amount of data.  McDiarmid's inequality, a concentration inequality, allows one to proceed, and identify a might tighter confidence interval than one gets from Chebychev's inequality.  This tighter inequality allowed certification using a much smaller sample of data.   As a test case, we looked at a specific portfolio consisting of equal investments in Treasury instruments of different maturity (there are in fact 30 different maturities of Treasury instruments).  A PCA analysis allowed us to reduce this to 2 sources of randomness.  We then empirically carried out a Sklar representation, which allowed us to finally use McDiarmid's inequality.  The key component in this calculation is McDiarmid's distance, which quantifies fluctuation of a function in different directions.  The McDiarmid calculation is essentially nonlinear.  It also in some way separates randomness from uncertainty.  As part of our investigation, we computed McDiarmid's distance for historical samples of the treasury data. We believe that this has value as a new measure of economic uncertainty, and are in the process of comparing the McDiarmid distance to other seemingly related signals (viz., volatility and VIX).
