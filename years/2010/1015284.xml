<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ I am a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, where I study evolutionary biology.  More specifically, I study coevolution, which is when two or more species "evolve together" and influence the course of each otherÆs evolution, and the effects this coevolution has on how species split into new species.  This is important because coevolution is probably important in producing the biodiversity we have around us and upon which we depend for our well-being.  However, this biodiversity is threatened, and we have an incomplete knowledge of what is there and how it interacts, and what processes are responsible for making more of it.  In my research I am studying the coevolution of a group of trees called leafflower trees (Phyllanthus) and specialized moths called leafflower moths (Epicephala).  Leafflower moths are the only insects that pollinate leafflower trees, and they carry pollen from flower to flower of their host.  But their larvae feed on the seeds of these trees (more properly, they eat only some of the seeds).  Thus the trees and moths are dependent on each other and doubtless influence each otherÆs evolution greatly.  Since there are hundreds of species of leafflower trees worldwide and probably as many leafflower moth species, I am studying how they diversify into many species.  I took part in the NSF East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute (EAPSI) program, which is an exchange program that takes American graduate students for 2 months during the summer to one of seven Pacific Rim countries to initiate a collaborative research project.  My host researcher was Professor Makoto Kato, at Kyoto University in Japan, who I chose since he discovered the symbiosis between leafflower trees and leafflower moths, and because all of the previous research on the biology of these organisms was done by his current and former students.  I am the only researcher in the United States studying these organisms, so working closely with Dr. Kato and his students was essential to the success of my project.  During the summer I collected these plants and moths in the field in Japan and Malaysia, obtained DNA from the plants and moths, ran analyses on their DNA sequence information to better understand their evolutionary history, and dissected the moths to examine their genitalia in order to learn how to identify species.  I also presented my research at the Society for Evolutionary Studies, Japan conference in Tokyo, and discussed my research with a number of Japanese colleagues at Kyoto University, Hokkaido University, and the National Institute for Basic Biology.   Taken together, these results form an integral part of my PhD thesis and helped me understand how these moths and plants are coevolving, and how this influences their diversification into many species.  My thesis one of the few studies to examine coevolutionary diversification in detail and when the results are available, will make an important contribution to our understanding of this important process.  I have a paper in press with one of my colleagues at Kyoto (Hembry et al., in press) and am working on two more.  As a result this program also strengthened scientific collaboration between the US and Japan.  I am now submitting postdoctoral applications to work with one of my EAPSI hosts in Japan after I finish my PhD next year.  This project also helped me improve my fluency in Japanese.  In all these respects this program was an excellent opportunity to augment my graduate school training and to prepare me for a future career in research.
