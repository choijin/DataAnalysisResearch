<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of  Texas Marine Science Institute (UTMSI), which is located in Port Aransas, TX  and is part of the University of Texas at Austin. Each year, eight students will be supported during a ten week summer research program. The program will recruit nationally and from many Texas universities and colleges.  The main focus of the program will be independent research projects by the students, but the program includes a two day research cruise at the start of the program, a series of seminars in marine sciences, web-based communication and career workshops. At the end of the summer, REU students present their results during a student research symposium. Students also will be encouraged to present their results at national research conferences. Support provided by NSF includes funding for student stipends, student travel to and from the site, student housing and meals and some administrative costs.</AbstractNarration>
