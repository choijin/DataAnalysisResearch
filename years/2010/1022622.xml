<AbstractNarration>Physics (13)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception, Project CLEA's goal is to create a body of astronomy laboratory exercises and a cadre of faculty that will make it possible for college students to experience modern techniques in observational astronomy.  To increase accessibility, the Project CLEA staff are moving a number of CLEA's more popular laboratories to a web-based platform.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported the work of PROJECT CLEA (Contemporary Laboratory Experiences in Astronomy), which has been developing and disseminating computer-based modules for astronomy education since 1992.

The latest CLEA software enables students to operate simulations of large optical telescopes, radio dishes, infrared telescopes and x-ray satellite observatories.&nbsp; The instrumentation operates in a realistic mode, and students can analyze the data they receive with a variety of computer-based tools.

We spent time investigating the possibility of developing server-client based versions of the CLEA software, though we did not find an effective way of accomplishing this with the current structure of our programs.  We continued to distribute software on demand and augmented our website to make it possible for users to download all of the large CLEA databases directly from our website, so that CD distribution by mail is no longer necessary.  We actively promoted the use of our new all-purpose Virtual Educational Observatory (VIREO) software, which enables users to conduct most of the older CLEA labs, and provides an environment for developing many new discovery based exercises.
