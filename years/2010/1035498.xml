<AbstractNarration>This planning project is a partnership between California State University-Bakersfield's (CSUB's) School of Natural Science (NSM) and Teacher Education Department (TED), the Kern County Superintendent of Schools (KCSOS), strenghtening the partnership being established by the NSF-funded Great Valley Math and Science Partnership (GVMSP). The project entails the development of a Master of Arts in Science Teaching (MAST) program that focuses on enhancement of subject matter preparation and provision of credential coursework for individuals with existing science degrees, and that complements the Teacher Leadership program being developed by the GVMSP. A MAST development committee, composed of representatives from each of the partners, is addressing the needs of the different stakeholders and ensuring that MAST meets University and State requirements. As part of the planning process, the committee is: 1) using data collected by GVMSP to compare the characteristics of science teachers who reported that teaching was their first career to those for whom teaching was a second career choice, with an eye towards examining differences in academic preparation, credential pathways, preferences for professional development activities and interest in advanced degrees; 2) contacting local aerospace, agricultural, and oil industry employers to identify local STEM professionals; and 3) using this information to develop and administer two surveys, one to STEM professionals, and the other to recent CSUB STEM graduates, in order to assess interests for science teaching and identify effective incentives for successful recruitment. These data gathering and needs assessment activities are enabling the partners to design a comprehensive program intended to provide the following major benefits to STEM professionals: 1) add breadth and depth to their subject matter preparation to help them meet California's current subject matter requirements (SMR) in science; 2) provide courses and experiences that enable them to attain a preliminary teaching credential, and a Master of Arts degree in Science Teaching; and 3) provide post-credential support for them in the classroom, thus enhancing teacher quality and retention. The needs assessment process is helping the project team to identify factors that hinder and/or support STEM professionals entering the teaching profession, and is furthering understanding of STEM professionals' interests in becoming science teachers and of the incentives that would attract them to the profession. The process of developing MAST is fostering collaboration between TED, NSM, KCSOS and the selected non-profit organization, leading to improvements in science teacher preparation at this Hispanic-serving institution. Additionally, the program being designed is intended to target individuals who otherwise may not become science teachers because of the SMR hurdle, and thus has the potential to serve as a model in California and nationwide for programs aiming to increase the pool of highly qualified science teachers via a unique route to science teacher certification.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant supported the development of a cooperative partnership between the Kern County Superintendent of Schools, the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics  and the Department of Teacher Education at the California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB) that  resulted in the development of a proposal for a novel Masters in Science Education.  This program targets 2 audiences with different tracks: A research track targeting practicing science teachers and engaging them in science research experiences, and a Credential track targeting non-teaching scientists attempting to enter the teaching profession.  Both tracks include significant science content and pedagogy instruction, blending these two necessary ingredients of effective teaching.  This proposal has been submitted to the Chancellor's office of the California State University and has been approved (September 2011).  We also developed a proposal for the Robert Noyce Fellowship program to support students in the Credential Track of the Masters in Science Education.  This proposal was submitted in March 2011 has been awarded (NSF DUE-1136342).  Intellectual Merit: A novel path to the credential for science teachers in California was developed.  The implementation and outcomes of this program will be studied to aid understanding of Recruitment, Retention, Preparation and Teacher Quality of science teachers in California. As part of this grant, baseline data on how Science teachers are currently prepared in California was collected, which will serve as an important reference point for making comparisons with the recruits of the new program.  Broader Impacts:  This program can potentially serve as a model in California and nationwide for programs aiming to increase the pool of science teachers by attracting individuals from non-teaching backgrounds and enhancing the science breadth and pedagogy preparation of these individuals compared to both traditional and existing alternative routes to the credential.
