<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the sixth meeting in the series of February Fourier Talks (FFT), held 17-18 February 2011 at the University of Maryland, College Park.  The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting includes invited lectures on topics of current research interest and also encourages poster presentations by students and recent Ph.D. recipients.  The conference brings together workers in a variety of different areas of research in harmonic analysis, with emphasis on facilitating the process of making pure mathematics applicable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://norbertwiener.umd.edu/FFT/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was used to support participants to the February Fourier Talks (FFT) 2011, which  was held on February 17th and 18th,  2011 at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Maryland, College Park.  FFT  2011 was organized by the Norbert Wiener Center for Harmonic Analysis and its Applications (NWC).  The conference brought together 146 participants  including applied and pure harmonic analysts along with  scientists and engineers from industry and government for an intense and enriching two-day meeting. In particular, this award from the National Science Foundation for   FFT 2011 was used to support  35  junior participants, as well as 10 senior participants.  The structure of the conference is aimed at building bridges between pure harmonic analysis and applications thereof.  In particular,  FFT 2011 was formatted as a two-day single-track meeting with the following structure.   Fourteen 30 minute talks:  These talks were given by experts in applied and pure harmonic analysis, including academic researchers as well as invited scientists  from  industry and government agencies. More specifically, the speakers were:   Peter Basser (National Institutes of Health), `` Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance signal as a series of Hermite functions''  Jeffrey Bowles (US Naval Research Laboratory), `` Nearest-neighbor Search in High Dimensional Spectral Data''  Robert Burckel (Kansas State University), ``Absolute continuity and singularity of measures without measure theory''  Amit Chakraborty (Siemens Corporate Research), ``Power Flow Problems for the Smart Grid''  Michael Frazier (University of Tennessee), ``Global Estimates for Kernels of Neumann Series and Green's Functions''  Anne Gelb (Arizona State University), ``Reconstruction of Piecewise Smooth Functions from Non-uniform Fourier Data''   W.~David Joyner (US Naval Academy), ``A family of self-reciprocal polynomials arising in coding theory''  Bjorn Jawerth (5 Examples, inc.),``Weakly Rearrangement Invariant Spaces and Approximation by Largest Elements''  Shidong Li (San Francisco State University), ``High resolution image fusion via fusion frames''  Mauro Maggioni (Duke University), `` Multiscale Geometric Wavelet Analysis''   Nasser Nasrabadi (Army Research Laboratory), ``Joint Sparsity for Target Detection''  Manos Papadakis (University of Houston), ``First steps towards a virtual neuron''  Rosemary Renaut (Arizona State University), ``Sparsity enforcing edge detection method for blurred and noisy Fourier data''  Jeffrey Woodard (The MITRE Corporation), ``Bag-of-Words Computer Vision Methods for Forensic Applications  ''.   Norbert Wiener Distinguished Lecturer Series:  This lecture was delivered by Dr.~Ronald R.~Coifman of Yale University,  who spoke about ``Harmonic Analysis on Data Bases''.      Norbert Wiener Colloquium: This concluding lecture features a mathematical talk by a renowned applied or pure  harmonic analyst. The objective of the Norbert Wiener Colloquium is to give an overview of a particular problem or a new challenge in the field.  In 2011 Dr.~Andrea Bertozzi of the University of California Los Angeles  was unable to attend due to extenuating circumstances. In her stead, the organizers asked four junior participants to each give a fifteen minute talk. Drs. J. Christenssen (Postdoc at University of Maryland), J. Dobrosotskaya (Postdoc at University of Maryland), M. Ehler (Postdoc at the National Institutes of Health), and E. King (Postdoc at the National Institutes of Health) presented some of their work during the concluding Colloquium.         Keynote Address:  In contrast to the highly technical day sessions, this lecture is aimed at a general public audience and highlights the role of mathematics, in general, and harmonic analysis, in particular. Furthermore, this Keynote Address can be seen as an opportunity for practitioners in a specific area to present mathematical problems that one encounters in one's  work.
