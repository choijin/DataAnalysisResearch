<AbstractNarration>The massive release of oil from the Deepwater Horizon incident has been accompanied by the release natural gas, estimated at 40% the mass of the oil. Results from recent cruises to the area indicate that nearly all of the leaking gas is trapped at depths below 750 meters in the vicinity of the spill site. The impact and fate of this gas in the Gulf of Mexico is an important lingering question and the primary driver of this Major Research Instrumentation RAPID proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI requests MRI RAPID funding to acquire two cavity ringdown spectrometers for quantification of carbon isotope concentrations in methane and carbon dioxide, respectively. These laser-based instruments will be used to for quantification of hydrocarbon oxidation rates, for studies of microbial hydrocarbon uptake and conversion, and to aid in investigating the ecology of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria - all in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential to provide meaning full data on the potential impact of dispersant use which is of broad interest. Several Gulf related experiments will benefit from this instrumentation. The PI has given over 50 interviews to popular media since the spill began in the Gulf of Mexico, and has been quoted extensively in TV, radio, newspaper, magazines and the Internet; such activities will be continued.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this major research instrumentation award was to acquire two cavity laser ringdown spectrometers for the purposes of analyzing the concentrations and stable carbon isotope ratios of carbon dioxide and methane specifically related to the Deepwater Horizon event.  The award funds were used to acquire two such instruments which have both been installed and are functional.  Both instruments were used to analyze samples from the Deepwater Horizon event, to reduce the backlog of samples pending analysis from ocean going research expeditions.  One of the instruments measures the concentration and stable carbon isotope ratio of carbon dioxide and is proving useful for measuring both environmental samples as well as samples spiked with elevated levels of heavy carbon isotopes.  The second instrument measures the concentration and stable carbon isotope ratio of methane and is proving useful for both analysis of dissolved methane in ocean waters and for gaseous methane samples.  Both instruments increase institutional capabilities, and enable an ocean going capability.  One graduate student researcher benefitted from this award.  This graduate student developed valuable skills learning to install the instruments, and once completed used the instruments toward their dissertation research.  One undergraduate student also benefitted from this award, using one of the instruments for their summer research project, which involved tracking dissolved hydrocarbon gases in the ocean and identifying source regions based on the data generated.
