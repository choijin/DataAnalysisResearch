<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research between Florida State University and Texas A&amp;M University is to develop multi-accuracy predictive models that can enhance the prediction capability for bukypaper-based composite properties. The team will investigate proper modeling strategies to integrate the multi-accuracy information as well as the solution techniques that address the associated computational and design issues in order to guarantee the method's efficiency and practicality. Currently, a few mechanics models are available for making property predictions for bukypaper-based composites but most of them suffer from having low accuracy due to model inadequacy and uncertainty. The outputs from the mechanics models and actual physical experiments constitute a set of multi-accuracy information sources, reflecting the same physical properties from different perspectives. Our conjecture is that combining the multi-accuracy outputs could help enhance the desired property predication for bukypaper-based composites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful development of this new methodology will potentially enable stable, repeatable, and scalable production processes for bukypaper-based composites, which are one of the most sought-after nano-materials, due to its properties unfound in traditional materials and applicability to a broad array of applications. The High-Performance Material Institute (HPMI) at Florida State University, with which the lead PI is affiliated, is one of the best research facilities in the nation in terms of buckypaper R&amp;D and prototype production capabilities. Predictive models are the cornerstones for enabling any attempts of process and quality control in nano-manufacturing because only with these models can people identify the critical process variables for taking in-process measurements, or making adjustments, in order to yield expected outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

This report summarizes the outcome of the research efforts led by TAMU, as follows:  (a) TAMU team investigated different multi-accuracy and multi-fidelity modeling strategies.  The team discovered that in making the buckypapers, certain process conditions exist but they may not be directly observable.  These variables are labeled as latent variables, namely, hidden variables.  The research team developed new modeling and solution techniques to solve the multi-accuracy/multi-fidelity models with the presence of latent variables.  (b) TAMU team developed computationally competitive solution methods that can handle a large number of simulated data (physically datasets are usually small). The team explored two different approaches.  The first is a divide-and-conquer strategy that partitions the input space into smaller pieces and then handles each smaller problem individually.

The strategy embeds a stopping criterion that terminates the data collection process when any marginal increase in model capability no long justifies the cost and effort of collecting additional data points.
