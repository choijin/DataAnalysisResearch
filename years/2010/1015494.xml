<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work consisted of two projects.  In the first project, we focused on measuring the near-infrared extragalactic background from galaxies, which refers to all light coming to us from galaxies (beyond our own galaxy) at wavelengths of 1-2 microns.  The significance of this measurement is that it places a lower limit on the total light coming to us in this wavelength range from resolved galaxies. Any measured excess above this level may then be attributed to faint unresolved objects in the early universe.  In quantifying this excess, astronomers may place energy budget constraints on processes, such as star and black hole formation, in the early universe.    In the second project we focused on measuring the stellar mass and luminosity functions of galaxies in the local universe.  This is to say, we set out to measure the number of galaxies as a function of mass and luminosity in the local universe.  This measurement provides one of the fundamental parameters for comparing the observed universe with that predicted by cosmological models.    The results from the first project were accepted in August 2010 for publication in the Astrophysical Journal (first author R. C. Keenan). Results from the second project will be submitted for publication sometime in late 2011.   By spending the summer at the research institute (ASIAA) in Taiwan, I benefited from working in a new research environment with astronomers  from all over the world. I had the opportunity to give two talks at ASIAA, which helped me hone my presentation skills and improve my ability to communicate my work with other scientists.  Because of my experience in this summer internship, I recognized that Taiwan could be a place I would like to live and work someday.  As such, I applied for and received a postdoctoral fellowship at ASIAA that will begin in the spring of 2012.  In an effort to communicate my experience to my community back in the U.S., throughout the grant term I sent weekly radio broadcasts in English and Spanish describing my activities in this international internship. The broadcasts were played on the afternoon news each week at the local community radio station in Madison, WI (WORT 89.9FM).  The summer term in Taiwan was full of rich cultural experiences. Throughout the summer I took Chinese classes with a local tutor and learned the basics of this very challenging language. I also met several Taiwanese friends with whom I could do "language exchange" where we would spend part of our time working on their English, and part of the time working on my Chinese. These interactions served as rich "cultural exchange" as well.I had the opportunity to travel outside the city with some of my Taiwanese friends and I see more rural areas of the country. This was a great opportunity to experience the diversity of climates and cultures throughout Taiwan.       Last Modified: 07/04/2011       Submitted by: Ryan C Keenan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
