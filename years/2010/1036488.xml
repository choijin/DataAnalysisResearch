<AbstractNarration>The Chondrichthyans, or sharks, rays and chimaeras, are some of the best known marine animals in popular culture but poorly known in terms of their evolution. Despite being an ancient group, we know surprisingly little about the patterns and processes that gave rise to their current diversity - a diversity that is increasingly under threat through environmental and fishing pressures. This project will catalog the diversity of sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras, provide a genealogy of relationships based on DNA sequence comparisons, and provide a data base of 3-D virtual skeletons based on CT scan data to document all of the physical variations that characterize the major lineages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve the development of technologies that will impact the way DNA sequences are collected for the purpose of comparison across organisms. This could have far reaching benefits for disciplines such as comparative biochemistry, physiology and medicine that are based on comparative approaches. The outreach component of the project will exploit the popular appeal of sharks to show how modern molecular biology and computer visualization techniques are being applied to better understand the evolution of the world's increasingly threatened biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is part of a 10-year effort to digitize and mobilize the scientific information associated with biological specimens held in U.S. research collections. The images and digitized data from this project will be integrated into the online national resource as outlined in the community strategic plan available at http://digbiocol.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/digistratplanfinaldraft.pdf.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Utilizing computerized tomography (CT) to visualize skeletal anatomy in modern chondrichthyan fishes (sharks, rays, chimaeras), comparisons were made between modern chondrichthyans and their extinct (fossil) relatives; questions were posed about the evolutionary relationships of modern chondrichthyans within jawed vertebrates; modern chondrichthyan diversity was investigated; technical data were disseminated to scientists, students, educators and the general public; and educational and professional training was provided at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels.<br />Imagery was generated primarily by non-destructive tomographic segmentation of modern chondrichthyans, including many rare and irreplaceable specimens. Skeletons were digitally reconstituted in 3-D from the scans, using a process known as &lsquo;segmentation&rsquo; or &lsquo;digital dissection&rsquo;. Individual Standard Tessellated Language (&lsquo;STL&rsquo;) files were generated for literally hundreds of major skeletal components or systems (cranium, jaws, hyoid and gill arches, backbone, girdles, fins). The files are available for viewing on a dedicated website (sharksrays.org), in conjunction with data collected by other researchers involved with different aspects of the project (e.g., molecular phylogenies, global distribution data for extant species, scientific illustrations). Primary scan data and copies of the SLT files are currently stored on a Drobo backup system which comprises five Seagate 4TB drives RAIDed down to a total of 15.9TB, formatted in NTFS. This anatomical archive represents an enormously valuable resource for researchers, students, teachers and the general public; STL files are easily disseminated via email and internet, viewed using freely available software, and printed by 3-D printers.&nbsp;<br />Many new discoveries stemming from this project are related to inner ear structure in elasmobranchs (sharks and rays), including specializations related to semi-directional low frequency phonoreception in sharks and rays (e.g., an unusual &lsquo;tilt&rsquo; of the labyrinth in large lamnids; white, mako, mackerel sharks; see image). We also showed the potential of inner ear structure as a key area for future systematic and anatomical research on elasmobranchs, by mapping external (visible) and internal (hidden) features in combination. This approach revealed, for example, that the position of the craniohyoid attachment (binding the jaws to the cranium) has shifted forwards (relative to the ear region) in the evolution of suction-feeding elasmobranchs (e.g., rays, carpet sharks). This discovery thus has broad systematic, ecological and behavioral implications for future study.<br />Besides these discoveries, other significant findings included: resolving the structure of the sclerotic cup in the eye of sharks; growth-related changes in cartilage calcification in sharks; the extent of deformities (scoliosis, kyphosis) and the extent of idiopathic mineralization in the vertebrae and arcualia (ribs, neural arches) of the axial skeleton in aquarium-kept sand tiger sharks Carcharias taurus; and the structure of the unique pectoral 'pocket organ' as well as head and jaw structure in the pocket shark Mollisquama (we scanned one of only two known specimens at the European Synchrotron Facility in Grenoble, France; see image).<br />Results of grant-related research were published in peer-reviewed journals, including Copeia, Journal of Fish Biology, Journal of Paleontology, Revue de Pal&eacute;obiologie, Comptes rendus Palevol, and PLoS ONE. Oral presentations and posters were also presented at international professional meetings, including the ASIH (Albuquerque), 9th Indo-Pacific Fish Conference (Okinawa, Japan), Cuvier Symposium (Montb&eacute;liard, France), International Congress of Vertebrate Morphology (Washington D.C.), Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (Dallas). Grant-related data were also used in classes on vertebrate evolution at the Richrd Gilder Graduate School (AMNH). Many more research publications stemming from the project are still in preparation.<br />Grant-related public outreach activities included a &ldquo;Shark Day&rdquo;, in the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life, evening talks with AMNH Members, and production of three Science Bulletin videos, one on shark conservation, one on shark evolution, and one on the rare and miniscule pocket shark, Mollisquama:&ldquo;Opening Up the Pocket Shark&rdquo;: http://www.amnh.org/explore/science-bulletins/(subcategory)/24948&ldquo;Sharks&mdash;the Past&rdquo;:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVXqdaXQdq0&ldquo;Sharks&mdash;the Present&rdquo;:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6wYnGph4wo<br />The Science Bulletins department at AMNH is currently using data from the project to develop an augmented reality (AR) experience for museum visitors. By looking through an AR device (e.g., Microsoft HoloLens), visitors will be able to interact with 3D skeletons/skin of several sharks and rays in the context of the museum&rsquo;s halls. Accompanying audio will inform users how CT scanning is allowing scientists to study animals and fossils in new ways, and guide users to explore the skeletons/skin and make their own discoveries. Over the next six months, the Science Bulletins team will be testing prototypes of the sharks and rays AR experience. Results from user testing will inform the final development of the experience.<br />A total of four REU interns studied with the P.I. over the duration of this project, three of whom have successfully progressed to graduate-level study and the fourth is considering grad school options. The P.I is currently supervising a Graduate student working on extinct chondrichthyans and also supervised three Postdoctoral Fellows within the duration of the project (one funded through this Grant), two of whom now hold tenured academic positions at other institutions. The award has therefore provided pivotal work experiences for several young scientists.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/22/2016<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;G&nbsp;Maisey</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1036488/1036488_10021120_1474561137799_lower2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1036488/1036488_10021120_1474561137799_lower2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mollisquama lower teeth from synchrotron scan"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1036488/1036488_10021120_1474561137799_lower2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mollisquama lower teeth from synchrotron scan"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">lower teeth of the pocket shark, Mollisquama.
