<AbstractNarration>This research project addresses the general question of how evolutionary changes in preferences for species-specific calls track changes in the characteristics of those calls. The question is addressed through studies of artificially produced polyploid treefrogs in a complex in which a tetraploid (two extra sets of chromosomes) species has evolved multiple times. The main aim is to determine if the preferences of artificially produced autotriploids (one extra set of chromosomes) and autotetraploids shift in parallel with changes in call characteristics in male polyploids. Parallel change would facilitate rapid speciation and indicate that such coordinated changes in communication systems may occur in all animals experiencing polyploid speciation, including all vertebrates, for which there is evidence of two ancient chromosome-duplication events. Furthermore, a significant consequence of polyploidy is an increase in cell size. A shift in the preferences of artificially produced polyploids would have important implications for studies of the mechanisms of hearing in all vertebrates, including humans, in which some pathologies are correlated with cell-size changes. This research affords educational opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students (including currently enrolled minorities and women) working on this project. This laboratory has a strong record of publishing results in scientific journals and lay publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research has focused on acoustic communication in a complex of gray treefrogs in which females use sounds produced by males as the sole basis for mate choice. Some properties of the calls reliably indicate the species of the male.  Because there are two kinds of gray treefrogs that differ in chromosome number and are hence genetically incompatible, female selectivity with regard to such call differences is especially well developed. Other properties indicate heritable qualities of the male that will affect offspring quality; females are especially likely to reject males of their own species whose calls predict a male of below-average quality.   A particular goal of this research has been to discover the processes by which the gray-treefrog species with extra sets of chromosomes (a tetraploid) arose and became behaviorally isolated from the diploid parental species (a diploid). We were able to produce frogs with three sets of chromosome (triploids) by cold-shocking the eggs of fertilized diploid frogs. Previous studies showed that the calls of such autotriploid males shifted in a key property that indicates the maleÃ†s species &ndash; the shift was in the direction of the values typical of the tetraploid species. We succeeded in producing and testing the selectivity of autotriploid females. They showed a parallel shift in selectivity. These results indicate that the process of speciation by polyploidy not only results in genetic incompatibility between polyploids and their diploid "parents" but also leads to changes in behavior that reduce the chances that newly formed polyploids will attract diploid females and the chances that female polyploids will mate with diploids.  This allows polyploids to persist long enough to develop ecological differences that afford them better chances of co-existing with diploids or even out-competing them in some places.
