<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2010. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Brandi Coyner is "Landscape genetics of the Neotoma fuscipes species complex: evaluation of landscape variables as pre-isolating mechanisms of hybridization." The host institution for this research is the University of Nevada, Reno and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Marjorie Matocq&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geographic areas where hybridization occurs have long fascinated biologists in the ecological and evolutionary sciences and offer unique opportunities to study speciation. Physical barriers such as rivers and mountain ranges, behavioral differences related to mating season and mate choice, and reduced fitness and survival of hybrid individuals are mechanisms that can prevent hybridization and lead to speciation. Therefore, landscape characteristics have the potential to contribute to and explain patterns of hybridization. Four models have been proposed to explain the maintenance of stable hybrid zones, and each model predicts differences in hybrid versus purebred fitness and the distribution of pure and hybrid individuals across the landscape. Landscape genetics utilizes the power of geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial statistics to test environmentally-based hybrid models. This study uses a landscape genetics approach to evaluate landscape variation as a potential mechanism preventing or encouraging hybridization. Additionally, this study proposes to evaluate the four models explaining the occurrence of stable hybrid zones in the area where dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) and big-eared woodrats (Neotoma macrotis) hybridize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives of this research include expanding current and learning new laboratory and analysis skills. Broader impacts of this research include mentoring undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, outreach includes taking the research into high school classrooms through the sponsoring scientist's Molecules On The Road (MOR) program. This program teaches advanced laboratory and analysis techniques to minority, at-risk high school students to equip those students underrepresented in science to pursue scientific degrees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hybridization, mating between animals of two different species, is much more common than we think. While hybridization can result in sterile offspring, like the infamous ligers and mules, fertile hybrids are common in the plant and animal worlds. This project examined and characterized a hybrid zone that exists between two species of woodrats, Neotoma fuscipes and Neotoma macrotis, in central California where their geographic ranges overlap. We generated data for 2,550 individual woodrats, captured over multiple years, for 15 microsatellite markers.     Major findings:  The area where the species overlap is only 1 km, but 15% of the woodrats in that area were of hybrid orgin. Backcrosses to N. macrotis were more common than backcrosses to N. fuscipes. Hybridization appears to be directional, with all females mating with N. macrotis males while only N. fuscipes females and large hybrid females mated with N. fuscipes males. We found no habitat explanation to explain the location of the hybrid zone or each species distributions on either side. The directional hybridization is most likely explained by size differences in the species; N. fuscipes is much larger than N. macrotis.   Genomic data using the entire genomes of 736 woodrats, captured during a single year, is still being analyzed.     Implications:  These findings support the hypothesis that hybrids are difficult to identify in the field, especially hybrids that are multi-generational backcrosses. These results also indicate that behavioral differences between two species is driving directional hybridization and may account for their reproductive isolation. These results help us understand speciation, as hybridization occurs along the continuum that represents speciation.     Broader Impacts:  The research supported by this grant positively impacted science education at the high school level. Outreach programs at high schools in Reno, NV, and adjacent cities, introduced students to advanced molecular techniques, natural selection, and evolution, and to careers of women and minorities in science.
