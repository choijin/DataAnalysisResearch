<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The project is developing and disseminating systematic information regarding how recipients of bachelor's degrees in Physics impact the STEM workforce. The American Institute of Physics (AIP) has provided resource information in this area for many years and is in a unique position to develop and directly disseminate a wider array of information through its contacts with physics departments and with students. This project is founded on the premise that, in light of a documented lack of knowledge of the immediate career options of students completing the bachelors degree, Physics Departments, supported by the larger physics community and organizations like AIP and its Member Societies and some of its affiliates, should invest significantly more effort in helping undergraduate students make informed decisions about their future careers and the many career opportunities that are available to them. This is a pilot project that is identifying successful efforts and resources already in use and beginning  a program of publications (in print and on-line) to provide more support to departments and to undergraduate students in the future. It is also initiating a pilot program of alumni advisory boards, designed to institutionalize these advances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The work addresses each of the following broader impacts. It promotes teaching, training, and learning in STEM. It intends to describe and encourage implementation of practices that broaden the participation of underrepresented groups. Through contributions to the literature documenting the diversity of career options, the needs of employers, and such things as strategies for interviews and resumes, both in print and on-line, it enhances the infrastructure for research and education and encourages networks and partnerships. The project findings are being disseminated in seminars, workshops, and electronically, to enhance scientific and technological understanding. Providing more systematic information about the STEM workforce benefits not only scientists, but the broader society as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Expanding the STEM Workforce by Equipping Physics BachelorÆs Degree Recipients and their Departments to Address the Full Range of Career Options   ("The AIP Career Pathways for Physics Students Project")   The American Institute of Physics (AIP) Statistical Research Center (SRC) has monitored the demographics of the education and careers of students and alumni of physics and the Society of Physics Students (SPS) of the AIP Education Division has mounted programs supporting career development and diversity a concerted effort to encourage the physics community to be more welcoming to all students, regardless of background or graduate school ambition.

Undergraduate physics programs have the potential to add to the STEM workforce with effective recruitment, retention and appropriate preparation of their students. On average, over 40% of students earning the physics bachelorÆs degree enter the workforce within one year of graduation. Despite this, the focus of many physics departments is on preparing students for entry into advanced degree programs with little or no emphasis on preparing students to enter the workforce.  We set out to understand how physics departments can most effectively prepare students for the STEM workforce. We began with the careful selection of a set of physics departments with strong records of preparing undergraduate physics students who go into careers in the STEM fields for subsequent site visits. Site visits aimed discern effective career development practices. Schools were selected to represent a range of size, geographic location, and type. A total of eight site visits were accomplished and a comprehensive report of each visit was prepared and provide to site visit hosts.  Addressing Intellectual Merit  By careful examination of detailed site visit reports, we have developed a set of resources that will educate and inform the undergraduate physics community. The new information in these resources resulting from this research aims to make educators and students aware of both the nature of and the financial remuneration available for those equipped with a bachelorÆs degree in physics, as well as the broad scope of opportunities where a sound physics preparation can be of benefit. These resources are especially important for dedicated faculty mentors, since there may be ignorance about the pathways to careers outside of academe. We identified a set of common features that seem to have a positive impact on career development for physics undergraduates who desire to enter the workforce after receiving the baccalaureate degree. These common features are organized into curricular and extracurricular features, as shown below:  Common Features:  Curricular   -           Varied and high quality lab courses  -           Research opportunities for undergraduates  -           Curricular flexibility  -           Communication skills as part of the physics curriculum  Extra-curricular   -           Faculty and staff commitment to student success   -           Strong community of students  -           Connections with alumni  -           Relationship with the Career Services Office  -           Mentoring/advising in accordance with interests and goals  These features are presented in a report, Equipping Physics Majors for the STEM Workforce, with specific suggestions for how each might be implemented in a physics department and examples of how these common features are realized at site visit locations.       Addressing Broader Impacts  It was clear from the onset of this project that input from students would be critical in our investigations. Through three summers of work, SPS student interns  produced an impressive body of work, resulting in the development of an extremely well-received resource, The Careers Tool...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
