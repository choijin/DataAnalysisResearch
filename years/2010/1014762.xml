<AbstractNarration>Proposed is travel support for US graduate students to participate in the IEEE Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) conference.  IROS will be held in Taipei, Taiwan, October 2010.  A unique aspect of this proposal is lab visits.  Approximately 30 students will visit academic, government and/or industrial labs in Taiwan while in Taiwan for IROS.  These students will be hosted by Taiwanese graduate students.  The envisioned outcome is that the 30 students will reciprocate; they would host the Taiwanese students when future conferences are held in the US.</AbstractNarration>
