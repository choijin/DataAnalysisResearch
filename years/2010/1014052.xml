<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the incorporation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into the cross-section of fiber reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) laminates used for the repair of oil and gas pipelines.  The effects of the addition of CNTs will be improved creep-fatigue strength and life at operational temperatures.  Previous research indicates that fatigue failure within composite materials initiates at the fiber?matrix resin interface due to limitations in the physical properties of the resin and its inability to chemically bond with the fiber. Incorporating functionalized CNTs within the interfacial bondline region provides a chemical reinforcement to delay this initiation of failure, resulting in improved tensile strength and stiffness, and most significantly, an increase in fatigue life.  The Phase I research will test and optimize a method for CNT incorporation, and will perform mechanical, electrical, and thermal characterization of the resultant material.  It is also anticipated that the resulting material may also exhibit enhanced thermal and electrical conductivity, leading to secondary benefits for pipeline applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the development of a cost-effective, easy-to-install, in-situ composite product for pipeline repair, with an operational design life of over 50 years.  The anticipated result of this project will lead to a new and transformative composite material technology for the use in pipeline repair and for other civil infrastructure applications.  The significance of the development of high-strength and durable fiber reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) wraps based on nanomaterials, for applications in repair and rehabilitation of oil and gas piping and other civil infrastructure systems is fourfold.  First, the new product will result in direct sales revenues of the resulting material, creating manufacturing jobs in the US.  Secondly, efficient and economical methods to repair oil and gas piping systems will have a significant broader benefit for the world?s energy infrastructure.  Thirdly, costs related to demolition of old pipelines and new pipeline construction will be reduced.  Finally, the expansion of scientific knowledge expected during the development of this emerging nanotechnology will drive further research and innovation in this key area of technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research Summary  The objective of this research project was to evaluate the feasibility of developing a "high strength and durable composite" repair for the rehabilitation of piping and other civil infrastructure systems that "exceeds" the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) ruling for proving permanence of a composite repair system with an eventual broader goal of "re-defining" permanence of a composite system through increased fatigue life over conventional composite repair systems.     Pipe Wrap LLC evaluated two (2) laminate types - Polyurethane/Fiberglass and Epoxy/Fiberglass with various nano-particulate types and combinations.  The laminate types were determined based on the prevalent types that are available to the current marketplace.     The achieved results from the research reflect marked improvements for both laminate types with properly coordinated nano-particulates for the respective system.  The net results provided projected improvements in cycles to failure (1010 cycles or &gt;50 years) of approximately 40% for the nano-enhanced Polyurethane/Fiberglass and approximately 20% for the nano-enhanced Epoxy/Fiberglass laminates.  It is concluded that the feasibility research results support continued development of the respective systems to enable the Infrastructure Market to utilize the technological advancement of composites through the benefit of nanotechnology.     Conclusion  The Phase I Findings demonstrated that both the CNF reinforced PU e-glass composite and the NC reinforced EP e-glass composite were superior in strength and fatigue compared to their respective neat counterparts. The nanomaterials enhanced the ductility of the resin matrix and strengthened the e-glass fiber &ndash; matrix interfacial bonding to improve the mechanical properties. The fatigue strength of the nanocomposites at 1010 cycles or &gt; 50 years was measurably greater than the neat composite counterparts. The feasibility of CNF reinforced PU e-glass composite to sustain a &gt;50 year creep-fatigue life in pipeline applications has been demonstrated. The feasibility of NC reinforced epoxy e-glass composite to sustain a &gt; 50 years creep-fatigue life in industrial piping applications has been demonstrated.     Based on the results of the Phase I research of two (2) alternate system types, the pursuit of a Phase II effort for full development of the different and distinct configurations of NanoWrap&trade; (patent pending) is warranted.  This nano-enhancement concept for maintaining fatigue strength is therefore a realistic performance objective for Nanowrap&trade;.  This continued effort will result in the parallel development of two (2) specific products targeted for different sectors of the Oil &amp; Gas Industry.     An analysis of our preliminary results suggests that a Phase II effort for full development of the Nanowrap&trade; will be recognized by the Oil &amp; Gas Industry as both transformative and revolutionary.
