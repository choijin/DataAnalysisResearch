<AbstractNarration>This award will support modeling activities as part of the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign.  DC3 will study the impact of deep, mid-latitude continental convective clouds, including their dynamical, physical, and lightning processes, on upper tropospheric composition and chemistry.  Efforts in this project will be focused on improving model representation of the production of nitrogen oxides by lightning (LNOx) and estimates of the magnitude of the production per flash and per unit flash length, as well the vertical distribution of the resulting NOx mixing ratios.  Case studies will be simulated using the WRF-Chem model.  DC3 observations and the model output will be analyzed to determine the magnitude of resulting ozone changes both within the storm clouds and in the downwind cloud outflow.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Prior to the DC3 mission, test cases from the DC3 regions will be simulated using the WRF model.  The model output will be compared with Lightning Mapping Array data, which may suggest improvements or changes in the lightning prediction scheme.  The team will then participate in the May 2011 DC3 test flights through analysis and interpretation of output from WRF-Chem forecasts run operationally for the period.  This will be followed up with evaluation of the forecasts and making possible further improvements to the LNOx algorithms prior to the DC3 mission.  During the May-June 2012 DC3 mission, students will be in the field interpreting the WRF-Chem forecast output for flight planning.  They will examine likely areas where convection may occur, types of convection, magnitudes of predicted flash rates, amount of NOx production, altitudes of convective outflow plumes, and downstream ozone production.  Following the mission, individual observed storms for case study simulations will be selected.  Various lightning NOx schemes will be incorporated into WRF-Chem and evaluated using DC3 observations.  The case study simulations will be designed to yield estimates of lightning NOx production per flash and per unit flash length through comparisons with the anvil observations of NOx.  Model estimates of ozone changes due to convective transport and chemistry within and downwind of storms will be evaluated using field data.  Relationships between vertical wind shear, flash length and lightning NOx production will be examined, as well as relationships between atmospheric aerosol content and flash rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the participation of two graduate students in DC3 preparation, field activities, and post-mission analysis and modeling.  Improvement in the understanding of LNOx will be applied to larger-scale chemistry and climate models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported participation in the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field experiment (May and June 2012) and post-mission meteorological and chemical modeling.  In the field we participated in flight planning through use of chemical tracer model forecasts.  Storms that were observed during the project have been simulated using a cloud-resolving meteorogical and chemical model, with the objective of improving the prediction of lightning flash rates and determining the amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx) produced by lightning in the atmosphere.  The first two storms to be simulated were observed in northwestern Oklahoma and in northern Alabama.  Realistic simulations of these storms were obtained after a number of attempts using various combinations of initial conditions, starting times, and model physical schemes.  Also required for obtaining good simulations was the assimilation of lightning flash rate data into the model.  The Oklahoma storm simulation was used to test 16 lightning flash rate parameterization schemes.  Schemes involving use of updraft volume and cloud top height yielded the best predictions relative to observed flash rates.  Atmospheric chemistry simulations were conducted for these two storms with the objective of characterizing convective transport of trace gases such as carbon monoxide and ozone and estimating the average amount of NOx produced per lightning flash.  The Oklahoma storm simulation yielded an estimate of 125 moles of NOx per flash on average.  This value is smaller than has been obtained in other storm simulations in previous field projects over the United States.  It is believed that the relatively short flash lengths observed the Lightning Mapping Array were responsible for the small value of average NOx production in this case.  Estimates of convective transport of CO and O3 within the Alabama storm system were performed using the simulation output.  The largest convective outflow was at 10-12 km altitude for this storm.  Simulations were also performed for a complex of storms observed in northeast Colorado and an extensive convective system over Missouri and Arkansas.  Further work on these events will be conducted in under a new grant.  This grant has supported portions of the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy education of five UMCP graduate students.  Therefore, a significant number of UMD graduate students have been exposed to the data and model output that demonstrate the importance of deep convection for trace gas redistribution in the atmosphere and the importance of lightning NOx production for driving the upper tropospheric distributions of NOx and O3 over North America in summer.  Four of the five graduate students are female, thereby significantly adding to the population of this segment of the atmospheric sciences work force which has traditionally been underrepresented.  The PI presented a seminar at NASA GSFC that included results from this grant, thereby disseminating the research results to the broader scientific community in the Washington, DC area.  Results from this research have also been presented to even broader audiences by the PI and/or one of the graduate students at the following meetings:  2012 AMS Annual Meeting; 2012 Fall AGU Meeting; 2013 AMS Annual Meeting; 2013 Fall AGU Meeting; 2014 AMS Annual Meeting; 2014 International Conference on Atmospheric Electricity; 2014 Fall AGU Meeting; 2015 AMS Annual Meeting.  Dr. Pickering contributed to the Barth et al. [2014, BAMS] DC3 project overview paper.       Last Modified: 09/23/2015       Submitted by: Kenneth E Pickering]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
