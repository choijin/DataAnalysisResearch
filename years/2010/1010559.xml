<AbstractNarration>This project will engage underserved Native and non-native youth and adults in environmental science content and awareness through innovative exhibitions and hands-on activities. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and western science will be communicated and promoted within culturally relevant contexts as valuable, complementary ways of knowing, understanding, and caring for the world. The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI), the lead institution, and its partner organizations, The Indigenous Education Institute (IEI), The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI), the Tramastklikt Cultural Institute, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Hibub Cultural Center and Natural History Preserve (Tulalip Tribes) will work collaboratively to develop and deliver all aspects of the project. An estimated 1.5 million Native American and non-Native American youth and adults are expected to be engaged in the project's exhibits, website, and activity kits over the five year duration of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Native American and non-Native American youth (ages 11-14) and their families from the Portland area and visitors to national science centers, tribal museums, and members of Native American organizations and service providers will be targeted for participation in Generations of Knowledge activities. In addition, the Professional Collaborative component will bring professionals from the partnering organizations to share resources, professional opportunities, and document their collaborative process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OMSI, project partners, Native scientists, tribal museum partner, exhibit developers, advisors, and members of various Native American communities will work collaboratively to develop four integrated deliverables. Each deliverable will be interconnected and designed to accommodate a variety of venues and audiences. Project deliverables include: (a) a 2,000 sq ft traveling exhibition, (b) a small traveling graphic panel exhibition, (c) an online virtual exhibition, (d) an activity kit for Native youth in informal and formal settings, and (e) opportunities and resources for reciprocal collaboration between ISE and Native American partners through a professional collaborative initiative.       &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IEI and advisors from RMC Research and Native Pathways will conduct the external evaluation using a mixed method, community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. Formative and summative evaluative data will be used to monitor, assess, and inform the project and the extent to which project goals have been met and the intended impacts achieved. The anticipated project outcomes include (but not limited to): (a) an awareness and understanding of the interconnectedness of TEK and western science, (b) a recognition of the relevancy and value of TEK and western science for understanding and caring for the natural world, (c) intergenerational learning and discussions about related TEK and western science issues, and (d) an increased capacity, supported by evidence, among the project team and partners to facilitate reciprocal collaborative efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on a long history of successful NSF/DRL supported work led by OMSI and IEI. It also extends existing traditional ecological knowledge focused work through a culturally contextualized hands-on traveling and virtual exhibitions, a rigorous professional development component, highly visible national partners (e.g., NMAI), and a national reach to over one million Native American and non-Native American youth and adults over a five year period. The project's research and evaluation findings will add to the knowledge base on strategies that can be employed to communicate and promote TEK and western science as complementary, valuable was of understanding and caring for the natural world.</AbstractNarration>

The project explores the value, relevance, and complementary nature of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Western science for understanding the natural world. TEK is knowledge that Indigenous communities accumulate by living in a particular place for multiple generations. Like Western science, TEK is based on observation, adapts to incorporate new information, and recognizes the interconnectedness of all elements of nature.</p> <p>OMSI and IEI collaborated with four Native communities, three tribal museums, an expert advisory group, and a local Native Youth Advisory Board to create:</p> <ul> <li>A 2,000-square-foot traveling exhibition, titled <em>Roots of Wisdom: Native Knowledge. Shared Science.</em></li> <li>A 150 linear-foot traveling graphic panel exhibition created in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) and the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) for small tribal museums and other venues</li> <li>An interactive project website: <a href="http://omsi.edu/exhibitions/row/">http://omsi.edu/exhibitions/row/</a></li> <li>Opportunities and resources for reciprocal collaboration between informal science educators and indigenous partners, including a legacy document titled &ldquo;Reflections and Ideas about Collaboration with Integrity&rdquo; (available on the project website) </li> </ul> <ul> <li>An activity kit for Native youth that explores TEK and      environmental science</li> </ul> <p><em>Generations of Knowledge</em> explores environmental restoration projects in four geographically and culturally diverse Indigenous communities in the Pacific Northwest, Hawaii, and North Carolina. The project was collaborative and inclusive in many different ways. OMSI and IEI shared leadership. Both Native and non-Native evaluators led the project evaluation, with input on study design by project partners. The exhibits and programs were co-developed with our four indigenous community partners &mdash;Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR), Tulalip Tribes, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and the Pacific American Foundation and Waikalua Loko Fishpond Society in Hawaii &mdash;and created for Native and non-Native visitors at both science and tribal museums.</p> <p>The <em>Roots of Wisdom</em> exhibition opened at OMSI in summer 2014. The exhibition was then hosted by CTUIR&rsquo;s Tam&aacute;stslikt Cultural Institute in Pendleton, Oregon and the Tulalip Tribes&rsquo; Hibulb Cultural Center in Tulalip, Washington during 2015. Audiences at all of these venues participated in the project&rsquo;s evaluation.</p> <p>Independent evaluation by the Lifelong Learning Group and Native Pathways found that the exhibitions and activities provided multiple ways to engage visitors and deepen knowledge, interest, and awareness around Native cultures, practices and approaches to living in the natural world, and how science and TEK can work together. &ldquo;For Native youth and adults, there was a deepening connection to their cultural ways of knowing, and a sense of pride in seeing their community reflected in the exhibition or activities.&rdquo; (Stein and Valdez, 2016)</p> <p>For the professional audience, Stein &amp; Valdez found that: &nbsp;&ldquo;Partners clearly felt they gained skills and confidence in doing collaborative work; but it was the relationship and trust-building that served as the foundation for these other outcomes and supported the positive growth and learning on the project.&rdquo;</p> <p>In the executive summary, the evaluators concluded, &ldquo;Finally, needing to build a deep, collaborative process with four very different, geographically dispersed communities was challenging, lessened the ability to collaborate in person, and also led to a fairly rapid-paced, timeline focused process. Within these limitations, all partners gave considerably extra time, energy, and openness toward creating a respectful process and relationship. Intentions were viewed positively, and the final products have been well-received by all partners.&rdquo; (Stein and Valdez, 2016)</p> <p>The full summative evaluation reports on the public audience impacts and the professional audience impacts are posted at <a href="https://www.omsi.edu/partnerships">https://www.omsi.edu/partnerships</a> and <a href="http://www.informalscience.org/">http://www.informalscience.org/</a>.</p> <p>Both traveling exhibitions will tour nationally for eight years. We estimate that the 2,000 square foot version of <em>Roots of Wisdom</em> will reach 24 venues and two million visitors, and the graphic panel version will reach 15 venues and 120,000 visitors.</p>

Both traveling exhibitions will tour nationally for eight years. We estimate that the 2,000 square foot version of Roots of Wisdom will reach 24 venues and two million visitors, and the graphic panel version will reach 15 venues and 120,000 visitors.
