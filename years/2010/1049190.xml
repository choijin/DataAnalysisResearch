<AbstractNarration>The intellectual merits of this work involve clarification of the unique dynamics near oceanic boundaries and quantification of their effects on essential oceanic processes like boundary stress, mesoscale dissipation and diapycnal mixing followed by adiabatic isopycnal dispersion. The primary unsolved dynamical problem of physical oceanography involves the 'dissipative' closure of western boundary currents, which is the primary focus of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of Topographic Control of the Gulf Stream with particular application to its separation is being addressed. This project is built on the hypothesis that boundaries exert fundamental controls on the ocean circulation in general and the Gulf Stream in particular. These processes are poorly represented or absent from current climate models. The main focus of the proposed research is on sub-inertial excitation of inertia-gravity waves and activation of the sub-mesoscale by boundary processes, with a view towards their potential vorticity and lateral stress implications. The driving hypothesis is that these processes dominate Gulf Stream separation and downstream development. This is a critical aspect of ocean circulation that all current models struggle with, regardless of resolution. The result is the introduction of strong biases in the model North Atlantic that is likely to affect climate projection on the decadal time scale. Observations also suggest an important role for topography in promoting mixing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Preparing for climate change is the most pressing problem currently facing society. This project is addressing a significant shortcoming of the oceanic component of coupled climate models. The mesoscale and boundary currents are the dominant kinematic features of the ocean and are controlled in all existing models by  parameterizations. This project is designed to build into these parameterizations physically based models of boundary interactions, thereby enhancing the fidelity of climate prediction and eliminating a major bias found in current ocean circulation models. Since the new parameterizations will be implemented in the Community Climate System Model, they will be widely available to the general climate community.</AbstractNarration>
