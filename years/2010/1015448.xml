<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Poly(vinyl) Alcohol Cryogel as a MRI Contrast Agent Principal Investigator: Sarah Shieh EAPSI Taiwan 2010     Significance of Project  Medical imaging has become an important tool in diagnosing and curing pathologies. Imaging techniques typically require the use of contrast agents, which are used to improve the visibility of internal body structures. MRI contrast agents work by altering the relaxation time of protons in the nearby tissues and organs, thereby improving tissue discrimination. While these agents provide useful information to physicians, they can also be toxic to the patients.       Starting in 2000, a new pathology, known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, began emerging in medical literature. Patients were presented with pain, skin thickening, swelling and lesions on the hands and feet. They experienced decreased mobility of their joints as skin thickening increased and death resulted in a few cases. The development of the disease has been linked to patientsÃ† renal insufficiency and exposure to gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs). Gadolinium is a paramagnetic metal ion that interacts with the protons of surrounding water molecules and disturbs the relaxation times of these protons in a magnetic field, thereby providing an improved image of organs and tissues. The five FDA approved GBCAs were approved between 1988 and 2004.     The consequences of GBCAs have become frequent enough that in 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requested that drug manufacturers include a boxed warning label stating that "patients with severe kidney insufficiency who receive gadolinium-based agents are at risk for developing a debilitating, and a potentially fatal disease known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis" and that "patients just before or just after liver transplantation, or those with chronic liver disease, are also at risk for developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis if they are experiencing kidney insufficiency of any severity." (FDA 2007)     Due to the toxicity of GBCAs, researchers have been interested in developing new MRI contrast agents. Attributes of a contrast agent include ability to attract water and relaxivity, which accounts for the relaxation time of the nearby hydrogen atoms and the concentration of contrast agent in the tissues. Ideally, the contrast agent should also be non-toxic.     Research Proposal  A potential contrast agent is poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA), a water-soluble synthetic polymer hat has been seen under MRI. It has been found to be non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, and has good biocompatibility. Some current applications of PVA hydrogels include contact lenses, artificial heart valves, articular cartilage, denture base, and drug delivery systems. These properties of PVA suggest that it can be a potential contrast agent and therefore was the focus of this research proposal.     Research Goals  Characterize PVA as a contrast agent by determining the relaxation values for monomer PVA solution, manufacturability of PVA, and hydrophility of PVA.     Experimental Conclusion  Results obtained from these experiments show that poly(vinyl) alcohol cannot be an immediate MRI contrast agent due to slow relaxation times and difficulties in manufacturing PVA into uniform nano-particle size beads. However, it may be possible to use this biocompatible material as a MRI contrast agent if a known contrast agent, such as gadolinium, is added to PVA. Further research is necessary to understand the effects of adding gadolinium to PVA, especially to determine if PVA can mask the toxic affects of gadolinium while simultaneously act as a good MRI contrast agent.     Merits of Collaboration in Research  Research in Taiwan was an interesting and exciting experience. One of the initial barriers was language. Though I am familiar with everyday Chinese phrases, I was very unfamiliar with technical terms used within the research environment. I was very glad to quickly discover that my labmates and advisor were so carin...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
