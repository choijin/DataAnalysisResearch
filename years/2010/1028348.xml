<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Most electric drives are currently employing induction machines in variable speed drives to reduce electric energy consumption. Latest hybrid vehicles, direct-drive wind turbine-generators and ultra-high efficiency heating and air-conditioning equipment employ brushless permanent magnet (BLPM) machine-drives for higher energy efficiency. Wider penetration of this technology requires an in-depth understanding of the fault mechanisms for developing fault prognostics and mitigation methods and robust fault tolerant designs.&lt;br/&gt;Both ac BLPM synchronous and induction machines, referred to as ac machines, will be studied in this project. The objectives of this research are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Develop novel fault diagnostic methods in ac machine-drives,&lt;br/&gt;2. Discover novel nonlinear-estimation methods for prognosis of the useful life of ac machine-drives,&lt;br/&gt;3. Discover techniques for fault mitigation in ac machine-drives to include a combination of adaptive control algorithms and novel fault-tolerant system topologies.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The main benefits of this research are the development of fault prognostics and mitigation technologies for high efficiency ac machine-drives that the industrial partner, which is one of the largest electric machine manufacturers in North America, is well positioned to introduce into the market through a multitude of Original Equipment Manufacturers that it serves. The liaison between University and Industry will be enhanced by including reciprocal long term working visits and internships of faculty, students and engineers. The research results will be integrated into the graduate and undergraduate curricula. Under-represented groups will be targeted for participation. The results will be disseminated to the wider engineering community through professional journals and conferences.</AbstractNarration>
