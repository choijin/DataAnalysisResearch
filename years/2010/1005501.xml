<AbstractNarration>The goal of the project supported by this award is to create new computer programs to calculate the interactions and properties of systems of three nucleons (atomic number A=3) using the most general form of interactions allowed by the physical laws of nature.  These new computer programs will be made publicly available, thereby allowing other researchers to explore different parameters of the interaction or different interactions without the need to write the intricate computer programs needed to explore a three-nucleon system.  A main motivation for this study is to understand the complex interactions between protons and neutrons in the nucleus; however the computational techniques used can also be applied to other areas of physics where three-body interactions are present, such as atomic physics (research with cold atoms) and particle physics (quark interactions inside the proton).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method of predicting the behavior of three or more interacting bodies is a long-standing problem in theoretical physics. While the interactions of two particles are fairly easy to calculate, the so-called three-body problem is much more difficult to solve.  A method attributed to Faddeev is now widely used, but the implementation of the Faddeev equations requires long and involved calculations that are best suited for powerful computers. The traditional approach to calculating the Faddeev equations uses a mathematical technique called partial-wave expansion.  However, as the energy increases in the three-body system, this mathematical technique becomes inefficient.  The current project utilizes a novel mathematical approach of taking spin traces, which allows the three-body problem to be solved at much higher energies, and generally increases the flexibility of implementing a wider class of inter-particle forces.  Hence, this project will provide a better theoretical framework for the investigation of the three-body problem than is presently feasible.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project is to produce a computer program to solve the quantum mechanical three-body problem for a variety of different physical systems.  The three-body problem is the simplest problem where it is possible to perform quantitative studies of nuclear, sub-nuclear and atomic reactions and structure. Three-body systems are sufficiently simple that it is possible to make experimental measurements of all of their properties and at the same time perform calculations that give exact predictions of a given quantum mechanical model to within the uncertainties of the experimental measurements.   The solution of the quantum mechanical three-body problem for realistic mathematical models is computationally intensive and requires specialized techniques.  The effort needed to produce a working program is significant and often beyond the expertise of groups that could benefit from having access to such a program. Having a flexible program will provide these groups with access to a three-body program without having to duplicate the significant effort needed to create such a program.  What is new about our program is that it uses computational methods that allow us to compute solutions that are sensitive to physics on much shorter distance scales than can be realized in other available three-body programs.  Outcomes:  1) We reformulated the most cited force (the Argonne V18 interaction) between nucleons in a form that is compatible with the computational methods used in our three-body programs.  2) We made the program for this interaction freely available to the public on the web.  This form of the interaction, expressed in terms of momentum variables, is needed for many other applications.  3) We produced a program to solve the three body-bound state problem, including the effects of special relativity, in a form that can be generalized to treat high-energy collisions.  4) We produced the first plots of relativistic three-body wave functions as functions of momentum variables.  5) We identified four types of relativistic effects in the three-body bound-state problem and showed that while some of these effects are large, significant cancellations result when they are combined.  This provides important feedback on how to properly include relativistic corrections in calculations of more complex systems.  6) Work is continuing on including the effects of relativity on the addition of intrinsic angular momentum in the three-body systems as well as on the treatment of collisions in three-body systems.  7) The research performed by the post doc who wrote the three-body program has led to a successful job search, which will allow him to continue working in this field and impact the next generation of students.  8) The results of this work were disseminated in two publications in the Physical Review and were presented at a number of conferences, workshops and seminars.
