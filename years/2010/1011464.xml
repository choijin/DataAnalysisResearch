<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Environmental Resources Engineering Professional Master?s of Science (PERE-MS) at Humboldt State University (HSU) will address the nation?s critical need for professional engineers technically trained in the areas of renewable energy and water resources.  The PERE-MS program goals are to provide graduates who are qualified to enter professional practice in engineering in the green jobs sector.  More specifically, graduates will meet workforce demands for engineers with expertise in energy efficiency, renewable energy technologies, water and wastewater treatment systems, and water resources management.  In addition to technical training in engineering science, graduates will have training in economics, environmental policy analysis, and professional skills development. They will be prepared to work effectively with community members and policymakers to implement solutions to environmental resource problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To broaden its impact, the HSU program includes activities associated with recruiting and supporting underrepresented students, with a particular emphasis on Native American and Hispanic populations. PERE-MS projects will continue the ERE tradition of serving regional underserved tribal and rural communities. The PERE-MS program will strengthen ties among project partners (industry, governmental agencies and non-profit organizations) and the university to better identify and meet partners? needs.  Graduate students and community partners will collaborate on projects that mutually benefit both groups.  Graduates will be professionally qualified to design, analyze and manage critical energy and water resources.</AbstractNarration>
