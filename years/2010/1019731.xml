<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: The FASEB Conference on ?Posttranscriptional control of gene expression: mechanisms of mRNA decay? will be held in Carefree, AZ on July 11-16, 2010.  Messenger RNA turnover is a critical regulator of gene expression. The stability of an mRNA significantly dictates its steady-state accumulation and can be modulated by both intracellular and extracellular environmental factors to provide a rapid response mechanism to regulatory signals. Programmed stability or instability of mRNAs can enhance or repress gene expression, respectively.  Moreover, multiple surveillance pathways utilize mRNA turnover to maintain mRNA quality and ensure only properly processed transcripts exit the nucleus and are utilized as substrates by the translation machinery.  In addition, noncoding RNAs and RNA interference have recently attracting considerable interest from all areas of the life sciences, since they rely on selective mRNA turnover for their biological consequence on gene silencing. This meeting has developed into a unique conference that brings together the leading mRNA turnover experts in eukaryotic, archaebacteria and prokaryotic systems into one arena and provides an opportunity for researchers in the broad discipline of mRNA turnover to interact, exchange ideas and spawn new areas of future research. We anticipate this conference will provide an outstanding overview of the current and future direction of this exciting field for established investigators and trainees as they help propel the field to the next level of its development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impact of the conference includes the opportunity to foster the development of junior investigators.  The format of the conference is designed to promote maximal scientific interactions among all the participants and ensure students and postdoctoral associates will be able to meet and discuss their research and future plans with leaders in the mRNA turnover field.  All participants have an opportunity to present posters on their research.  In addition, each platform session will contain at least one oral presentation by junior scientists selected from the submitted poster abstracts to provide maximal exposure for young scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Normal development of an organism is dependant on the exquisite control by which its network of genes are activated and suppressed.  Regulation of gene expression occurs at multiple levels with one of the critical steps being the post-transcriptional control of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) stability. The stability of an mRNA significantly dictates its accumulation and can be modulated by both intracellular and extracellular environmental factors to provide a rapid response mechanism to specific regulatory signals. Importantly, studies into the basic mechanistic understanding of mRNA turnover have enabled the development of novel pharmaceuticals that target mRNA decay pathways for therapeutic intervention.  Financial support from the National Science Foundation helped make possible an international meeting on mRNA turnover at the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB)-sponsored "Posttranscriptional control of gene expression: mechanisms of mRNA decay" conference held in Carefree, Arizona on July 11-16, 2010.  Over 100 participants ranging from leading scientists in the mRNA turnover field to new graduate students assembled in the Arizona Desert and shared their latest findings in formal oral and poster presentations as well as informal discussions throughout the meeting. The conference included a diverse array of participants from graduate students, postdoctoral associates and both junior and senior scientists.  The sessions were chaired by internationally-recognized leaders within the respective session topics. The talks consisted of forty invited speakers and speakers picked from abstracts to ensure incorporation of the latest developments into the meeting and provide platform presentations from future leaders, graduate students and postdoctoral associates. In addition, a poster session also provided opportunities for all participants to present their research in a highly interactive environment. Three posters were selected by a panel of judges as the most meritorious posters among graduate students and were awarded cash prizes for their high level of research and presentation.  Two of these awards were supported by funds from the NSF support. On behalf of all the participants of the conference, we would like to express our gratitude to the National Science Foundation for their generous financial support of this outstanding and successful conference.
