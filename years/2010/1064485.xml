<AbstractNarration>The program proposed by Karl Schwede aims to study relations between higher dimensional algebraic geometry and positive characteristic commutative algebra.  Over the past 30 years, a dictionary has been developed linking, by reduction to characteristic p, seemingly unrelated concepts coming from these two distinct areas of mathematics.  However, the dictionary as it exists seems incomplete.  For example, while there is a good positive characteristic analog of ``log terminal singularities'', there is no known analog of ``terminal singularities''.  Schwede will attempt to fill in these gaps.  Furthermore, inspired by this dictionary, Schwede will explore both the local and global geometry of varieties in positive characteristic and characteristic zero.  One problem that Schwede plans to explore is how the test ideal (a positive characteristic analog of the multiplier ideal) behaves under birational maps.  Another problem that Schwede plans to study is whether Du Bois singularities deform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry is a centrally important and very active field of mathematics with strong ties to many other areas including fields as disparate as string theory and coding theory.  Explicitly, algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) made up of the solutions to polynomial equations (such as y = x^2).  At the most basic level, Schwede plans to study relations between the geometry of these algebraic varieties, with algebraic properties of the equations themselves.  In the past, this interplay has led to new insights in both the geometric and algebraic theories.  In algebraic geometry, one of the major areas of research in the last 30 years has been the classification of algebraic varieties -- the "minimal model program".  In order to accomplish this, one must study singular varieties (an example of a singular variety is the solution set to the quadric cone, z^2 = x^2 + y^2).  The particular questions that Schwede proposes to study will hopefully lead to a deeper understanding of the varieties and the singularities that appear in this classification.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Algebraic geometry is a well developed field of mathematics which studies the geometry of polynomial equations (such as y = x^2, the parabola).  Such geometric objects are called algebraic varieties and in this classical setting, this type of geometry has had many applications to physics and more recently statistics and related fields.  This project is basic research focused on a number of topics within algebraic geometry and commutative algebra (the study of the equations used to define the geometric objects such as the parabola).    In particular, the PI studied how algebraic varieties deform or change as parameters change, with a particular focus on singularities (imagine a cusp appearing on a deformation of the parabola).  For instance, he showed that certain "nice'' singularities called Du Bois singularities can only be deformed to other Du Bois singularities.    The largest goal of this research related to algebraic geometry in more exotic contexts.  One type of algebra and geometry ubiquitously used in cryptography and coding theory is positive characteristic commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  For instance, when adding numbers on a clock, we have that 10 hours after 5:00 is 3:00, so that 10 + 5 = 3.  A great deal of this project was devoted to studying the geometry of equations (again, such as y = x^2) under these types of arithmetic rules.    For instance, the PI proved that two objects the multiplier ideal and test ideal defined in the classical and positive characteristic worlds respectively, are actually aspects of the same underlying concept.  In particular, this shows how to use intuition from classical algebraic geometry in the positive characteristic setting.    Of course, in the positive characteristic setting, not everything works like one might expect.  A key theorem from classical algebraic geometry that fails in positive characteristic is the Kodaira vanishing theorem.  One of the other main accomplishments of this project is the development of a framework for circumventing exactly this failure.   Beyond simply research, the PI also co-organized several conferences and workshops within Mathematics.  These conferences included participation of undergraduate and graduate students all the way up to senior researchers and distinguished professors. He has also helped organize seminars and has begun advising Ph.D. students.       Last Modified: 10/23/2013       Submitted by: Karl E Schwede]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
