<AbstractNarration>This research project will expand our understanding of the causes and consequences of an unusual form of inheritance in plants, the transmission of organelles through pollen. A defining feature of cells with nuclei is the existence of organelles that have separate genomes. The nuclear genome is generally inherited from two parents. By contrast, the genomes of organelles, such as those in mitochondria, are nearly always inherited from the mother only. However, we know little about the frequency and cause of deviations from this general rule. Understanding the inheritance of organelle genomes is therefore important for understanding evolutionary processes. Using the plant Silene vulgaris as a model system, this project will explore the relationship between the geographic origins of the nuclear genome and paternal mitochondrial transmission, and the relationship between the physical structure of the mitochondrial genome and the propensity for mitochondrial genes to recombine. This requires 1) sequencing several S. vulgaris mitochondrial genomes to document genome structure and identify genetic markers used to study recombination, 2) genotyping individuals from natural populations in order to estimate recombination, 3) conducting experimental crosses between individuals of varying nuclear and mitochondrial genotypes, and 4) genotyping their offspring to identify incidences of mitochondrial paternal inheritance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to furthering fundamental knowledge of plant mitochondrial genome biology, the results should be of applied significance. Plant breeders are concerned with developing CMS (cytoplasmic male sterility) resources because utilization of male-sterile individuals in breeding programs increases efficiency, and CMS genes usually reside in the mitochondrial genome. Studies of the inheritance of organellar genomes are also valuable because of concerns about gene escape from genetically modified organisms.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project investigated the rate of transmission of the typically maternally inherited plant mitochondrial genome via pollen, and the consequences of that paternal inheritance for the population biology and evolution of the mitochondrial genome. Studies were made of the weedy plant, <em>Silene vulgaris</em>, by genotyping individuals obtained from either natural populations or from experimental crosses between individuals differing at a diagnostic mitochondrial genetic marker. Experimental crosses demonstrated transmission of the mitochondrial genome via pollen to approximately 3% of offspring and that parental population of origin was a significant predictor of these rare events. Most of these cases represented instances of bi-parental inheritance in which offspring mitochondrial genotypes were derived from both the maternal and paternal source, resulting in a phenomenon known as heteroplasmy. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in the DNA sequences of nine mitochondrial genes obtained from 75 individuals sampled from natural populations indicated that inter-genic recombination in the presence of heteroplasmy greatly enhances mitochondrial genetic diversity. However, recombination rates varied across the genome. Comparison of whole mitochondrial genome sequences of four individuals showed that even though the DNA sequence of individual genes is fairly well conserved across individuals, gene order varies considerably. The results obtained from this project have implications for larger questions concerned with mitochondrial genome evolution in plants, gene flow of plant mitochondrial genomes, and the evolution of gynodioecy (co-occurrence of female and hermaphroditic individuals) in those plant species in which male sterility is a consequence of cyto-nuclear sex determination. The results may also be of applied value in that plant agricultural geneticists often use mitochondrial cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) genes as a tool in crop breeding.
