<AbstractNarration>This award will provide $250,000 to the Florida State University for the acquisition of a sector magnet inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (SM-ICP-MS). This instrument will replace a 14-year-old ELEMENT1 in a common facility used by several earth science researchers. The manufacturer does not support service on that instrument anymore and spare parts are scarce. The instrument over the last few years has seen significant downtime due to more and more frequent breakdown of components. FSU will match the NSF contribution at the amount of $250,000 for a total budget of $500,000. FSU also supports this ICP-MS facility with a state-funded technical position. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new instrument will support a variety of funded projects.   Several ongoing research programs at FSU are critically dependent upon the availability of in-house state-of-the-art ICP-MS capability, especially:  (1) studies of iron cycling in the ocean in relation to global carbon cycling; (2) studies of aerosolized trace metal deposition in the sea; (3) studies of the global mercury cycle; and geochemical dynamics of the Earth's mantle and crust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The Geochemistry Program of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory supports graduate students (12 present) and post-docs (3) that will use this instrument in their research. The instrument is essential for projects that are part of larger scale research programs such as CLIVAR and GEOTRACES. Apart from the research of the primary PIs and their students and post-docs, the instrument will contribute to the research of other faculty in the Department of Earth Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, as well as faculty of the Department of Chemistry, the NHMFL and users outside FSU.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was used to help purchase a new analytical instrument in the Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Florida State University. We received 50% of the necessary funding from our FSU Vice President for Research, and requested the other 50% from NSF, to purchase a high-resolution magnetic sector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS). This instrument is used to measure ultra-trace amounts of many elements in a variety of samples ranging from seawater to individual cells to rocks, and has supported research on at least six other NSF grants.  We have started a collaboration with the "Future Fuels Institute" at FSU and  developed a technique to analyze sulfur concentrations in volatile organic compounds.  We have started a collaboration with FSU biologists on a study of nutrient ratios and phosphorus concentrations in biological samples.  What is the impact on the development of human resources?  The new instrument is being used in their research by more than 15 graduate students and post-doctoral research associates. Teaching them how to use state-of-the-art analytical equipment prepares them for successful careers in environmental science, chemistry, and engineering. These instruments can by found at many universities, and at private companies such as GE, chip manufacturers, the pharmaceutical industry, and government labs.
