<AbstractNarration>The The Virtual Zooarchaeology of the Arctic Project (VZAP) is a web-based osteological reference collection in 3D. The intent of the project is to provide a comprehensive aid to the analysis of osteological remains from northern archaeological (and palaeontological) sites. The goal of the project is to replicate the characteristics of a traditional osteological reference collection, while providing functionality only possible in a digitally\based environment. The VZAP builds on a pilot project that tested the potential of a web-based virtual zooarchaeological collection of Arctic species. In VZAP Phase 2, a full complement of Arctic species will be added to the web-based collection and accessible to researchers and educators. VZAP Phase 2, incorporates the feedback from a user survey; completes the scanning of the full suite of taxa intended for the project; refines and streamlines the database, user interface, and 3D rendering capabilities; and develops a means for allowing user\generated content for the website, to insure its continued growth and applicability beyond the scope of the funding cycle.</AbstractNarration>
