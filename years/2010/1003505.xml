<AbstractNarration>This project explores dust deposition during the African Humid Period (~8,000-5,000 years before present) in North Africa. This region is a significant source region for desert dust today and data suggest that the area was much wetter during the Humid Period and, as a consequence, less of a source of dust. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team aims to examine the role of dust during this time period as follows: i) compile available desert dust deposition records for this time period; ii) simulate desert dust in the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) and match the available data; and iii) evaluate the impact of dust radiative forcing on climate during this time period. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impacts involve supporting undergraduate and graduate students as well as helping improve the characterization of aerosols in the CCSM.  Improving aerosols for the CCSM has a wide appeal to a broad spectrum of atmospheric scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Every year over a billion tons of mineral aerosols are emitted into the atmosphere, as strong winds scour the surface of desert and arid regions around the globe. In fact the lives of millions of people living nearby "dusty" areas are heavily affected by dust in North Africa and the Middle East, in Australia and China just to name a few. Negative effects of dust include disruption of transportation, crop failure, impacts on human health (asthma, spreading of meningitis), or the deterioration of coral reefs. The effects of dust on peopleÆs lives can be literarily far-reaching; for instance dust blown from the Sahara desert in North Africa can be transported across seas (e.g. to Southern Europe across the Mediterranean) as well as oceans, contributing to deteriorate air quality in the Caribbean and Southern Florida - yes, desert dust significantly contribute to the feared PM10 there!  Natural and human-induced climate change, as well as land use practices, can influence the land surface (for example the "dust bowl" in the 1930s) that affects the amounts of dust emitted into the atmosphere along with its potentially harmful effects. But thatÆs not all. In fact dust bears the capacity to affect climate change itself in different ways, and could either reinforce or offset global warming. Small dust particles 1/1000th of millimeter in size, which are suspended in the atmosphere, reflect sunlight back to space, which is a process that acts to cool the atmosphere. Also, they can help the condensation of water droplets and contribute to the formation of clouds. On the other hand when dust is deposited on snow and glaciers it causes its darkening and speeds up melting. It is also known that dust might have contributed in the past to help remove the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, by promoting biological activity in the surface waters of the oceans. It follows that understanding the complex dynamics of dust and its relations to climate is crucial for predicting in which ways dust variability in the future is going to affect human societies. On this matter, science can inform policymakers so that they can better shape climate and land use policies to the benefit of the well being of current and future generations.  Geological evidence shows large variations in the deposits that windblown dust from the Sahara left on the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, with low dust levels associated with the green Sahara; in fact increased vegetation and moisture caused a reduction in dust emissions. In our project we worked to collect all the relevant data of this kind from that time period. We then screened the data that were retrieved worldwide retaining the ones with adequate quality, and organized them for the first time in a consistent way. This new way of looking at the data highlighted some inconsistencies that were not deducible from the analysis of individual works.  This dust database constitutes a new tool to support and inform future research for many colleagues, as shown in the following figure extracted from Albani et al., 2015.  The data collection also proved to be a rich source of information regarding several aspects of importance to the dust cycle, that is the chain of events that control dust erosion from the land surface, specifically its transport in the atmosphere by the winds, and subsequent deposition back to the surface. In particular the collected information was used to improve the representation of dust in the Community Earth System Model (CESM), developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. The CESM is an Earth System Model (ESM) that is a mathematical representation of the Earth and its climate system. It is composed by over a million lines of programming code that constitute a simplified but complex representation of the real world in terms of equations, which are solved by powerful supercomputers, in a fashion similar to the models used to provide weather forecast...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
