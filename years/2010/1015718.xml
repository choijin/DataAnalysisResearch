<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA["How many years can a mountain exist, before it is washed to the sea?"       -Bob Dylan, 1963   Specifically, my research focuses on the intricate relationship between regional climate patterns and changes to the earthÆs surface over geologic time. However, this quote from BlowinÆ in the Wind, captures the spirit of my research much more elegantly.   Recently, my work took me to the Southern Alps of New Zealand, funded through the NSF East Asia Pacific Summer Institute program, for an excellent opportunity to study this relationship in an active mountain belt. In fact, the Southern Alps are a fantastic natural laboratory, providing the rare chance to quantify the influence of climate patterns on the surface erosion and uplift history of the mountains.   Moving from west to east across the central Southern Alps, the precipitation rate drops nearly ten fold. Correspondingly, erosion of the western slopes is significantly increased. This eroded rock mass here must be accommodated by movement along large active faults bounding the range. Previous work in this region suggests that if such directed erosion is maintained over geologic time, the mountain topography as well as the deeper geologic structure will adjust accordingly; in effect, making the stunning alpine scenery as much a product of preferential rainfall as tectonic uplift.   I am working with Dr. P.J.J. Kamp from the University of Waikato to document the uplift history of these very active (as evidenced by the 7.1 magnitude earthquake striking the edge of our study area 2 weeks after I left) and, geologically speaking, quite young mountains. We take a slightly unconventional approach, turning away from the mountains directly to study the adjacent Canterbury Basin. Here, the significant erosion concurrent with mountain uplift has produced a complete sedimentary archive, recording the evolution of these mountains since they began to rise over 8 million years ago. From these sedimentary rocks we can reinterpret the complete geologic history of the Southern Alps&hellip; and weÆre just beginning. Fortunately for me, this archive is easily accessible with only a hammer, compass and a willingness to wade around in cold Kiwi streams.
