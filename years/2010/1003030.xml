<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  This university-industry research project pioneers nanoscale magnetometry measurement techniques for advanced energy-related ceramics.  The work is predicated by the fact that markedly different magnetic responses will be elicited for ceramics in different materials states, allowing an investigation of nanoscale physical phenomena that have been previously inaccessible.  The main scientific objective is to correlate the different magnetic response of ceramic materials with nanoscale-structure features.  The results will have broad implication across many technical energy applications where challenges exist in understanding and controlling nanoscale phenomena, but are also expected to impact the ceramics community by helping to advance the metrology of magnetic based measurements.  The industrial partner, Quantum Design, is a leader in the magnetic equipment industry and will engage students during the project.  The students will also organize and run an annual on-campus conference in ceramics with participation from industry, faculty and members of the local community.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: A systematic experimental research program is designed to correlate the magnetic behavior of doped ceramic oxides with nanoscale features that will be independently measured with a suite of materials characterization tools and interpreted with kinetics and thermodynamics theory.  The research is based on the fact that the magnetic response of doped ceramics is highly sensitive to different internal material states: (1) the undoped ceramic; (2) metallic ions in solution within the doped ceramic; (3) metallic ions as an oxide; and (4) metal particles.  Two host ceramics, one based on ZrO2 and one based on the perovskite structure, are doped with various transition metals (Ni, Co, and Fe) to create a variety of structures that exhibit different magnetic responses.  The research lays the foundation to advance the state of nanoscale metrology for magnetometry.  Students will be engaged and trained in the potentially transformative magnetometry characterization tools developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A combined university-industry research project was performed to pioneer nanoscale magnetometry measurement techniques for advanced energy related ceramics.  The research was predicated by the fact that markedly different magnetic responses are elicited for ceramics in different materials states, allowing an investigation of nanoscale physical phenomena that have been previously inaccessible.  Correlations were made between different magnetic response of ceramic materials and their nano-structure features.  The results have broad implication across many technical energy applications where challenges have existed in understanding and controlling nanoscale phenomena.  The results also impact the ceramics community by helping to advance the metrology of magnetic based measurements.  The industrial partner, Quantum Design, is a leader in the magnetic equipment industry.  As part of the project, graduate students organized and ran an annual on-campus conference in ceramics with participation from industry, faculty and members of the local community.   The materials that were studied as part of the project are ceramics used for solid oxide fuel cells, proton exchange membranes (e.g., for separation of gas streams), and catalysis.  By understanding their behavior during their fabrication and under service conditions (the materials evolve over time which can lead to degradation), large improvements in performance may be possible.  In this project, several aspects of materials behavior were discovered.  (1) It was shown that transition metal oxide dopants (used to improve properties of the host) segregate to a greater amount than previously thought in nickel-oxide doped zirconia.  (2) The details of making a nanocomposite with a process called internal reduction were uncovered for the nickel-oxide doped zirconia system.  (3) A cyclic reduction-oxidation processing scheme may be used to create novel nanostructures in doped oxides.  (4) A mechanism to prevent barium loss in barium zirconates (barium loss leads to a chemical breakdown of the ceramic) was discovered for the caes when nickel doping is used.
