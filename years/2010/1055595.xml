<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will implement e-portfolios for graduate student as a mechanism to research how reflective practice helps students develop their identities in their dual roles as teachers and researchers.  The research study uses a mixed-methods approach at four different sites to answer questions on how reflective practice influences identity development.  The research will be integrated with the educational activities of the PI and is informed by a strong evaluation plan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to improve the future professoriate, who will in turn increase of the success of engineering students from all groups.  One of the research sites includes a significant fraction of under-represented students.  The results of the project will be disseminated through both workshops and education and electronic resources that will be freely distributed to other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
