<AbstractNarration>This STEP Type 1B project is increasing the number and diversity of STEM graduates in the College of Science (COS) through retention strategies emphasizing academic success and engagement with the scientific process and community. The project is adopting and building on successful practices employed by the institution's College of Engineering (COE) through its earlier STEP award, DUE-0431646. Features include: 1) a summer bridge program that is providing academic enrichment and advising to prepare incoming freshman and transfer students for the rigors of their degree programs in science and 2) establishment of a freshman residential learning community for physical and quantitative science majors that complements existing engineering and life science learning communities (Hypatia, Galileo, and the Biological Sciences Learning Community). In particular, the PI team is working with engineering colleagues to integrate COS and COE students in both STEP efforts as part of a university-wide agenda to develop interdisciplinary undergraduate training in "scieneering." In addition to building upon the success of COE's STEP award, the COS is enhancing its first-year experience program for transfer students to better serve the physical and quantitative science majors. The program centers on a one-semester, two-credit active-learning seminar and is available to COE transfer students as well. The intellectual merit of this project rests not just in the quality of its strategies and activities, but also in the rigorous assessment of the role its particular implementation of a first-year experience for traditional first-year students and transfer students plays in promoting academic retention and success. The project is exercising broader impacts through its ambitious goal of increasing the number of graduates in the physical and quantitative sciences by twenty-five percent annually. Moreover, vigorous efforts are in place to recruit students who thus far remain underrepresented in STEM fields (e.g. low-income, first-generation, women, and underrepresented minorities), therefore offering an important opportunity to increase the diversity of the population of STEM graduates.</AbstractNarration>

Curie, a residential living learning community, enrolled 330 students over six years. The community is structured around scaffolded and progressive student development in problem solving and leadership. The students who continue as leaders in the second and third years are diverse and emerge as some of the most well-spoken and sought-after undergraduates, who serve on university-level committees and represent Virginia Tech at national conferences. The Curie LLC has continued to enroll students after the grant ended with university support.  The intellectual merit of this project includes a) the development of strategies to improve mathematical reasoning among entering college students, b) a comparison of two popular ?high-impact practices?, a summer bridge program and a living-learning community (LLC), with the conclusion that the LLC was more effective and less costly, and c) the creation of a model student led, highly successful LLC with approaches that can be adopted by others.  The broader impacts include a) the recruitment of a diverse population of students to these programs from fields that are especially low in women and underrepresented minorities and b) equipping these students to be workforce-ready through activities that build skills in communication, problem solving, teamwork and quantitative reasoning.
