<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for a consortium of eleven universities (Brandeis, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Ohio State, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Stony Brock, UC-Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz, and Washington) to construct a new pixel layer (called the Insertable B Layer or IBL) to go inside the present ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) thereby making a major and notable impact in this international program.  The goal of this detector enhancement is to extend significantly the physics reach of ATLAS.  In particular, it will improve the identification of b-quark jets for ATLAS, a capability that is crucial for many of the most interesting physics studies at the LHC such as the search for the Higgs and supersymmetry. This IBL will be composed of parts built and tested at U.S. universities, in collaboration with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL) and a number of European research institutions, and finally assembled and installed in the ATLAS particle physics detector. The novel pixel device is not only crucial for the ATLAS experiment, advancing the physics program of over 500 scientists in the U.S., including over 170 graduate students, but will also promote innovations in detector technology. The construction, testing, and installation of the IBL will provide training for a number of students in areas crucial for the IBL: new electronics, detectors, lightweight mechanical structures, and data transmission systems. This opportunity would likely not be available in some of the smaller groups if the opportunity for this consortium were not established. For four of the eleven universities involved, the lead scientist on the IBL project is female, fostering diversity in the field. Five of the universities in the proposal are located in EPSCoR states.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Title: MRI Consortium: Developments for a Novel Pixel Tracking Layer for the ATLAS Detector     Project Outcomes Report                                   Date November 12, 2015     The goal of our MRI project was to contribute along with collaborators at U.S. National Laboratories and foreign institutions to the construction of a novel tracking layer to be placed very close to the beam line within the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.  The MRI project, which took four years to complete, was a collaborative effort involving 11 U.S. Universities, listed below, along with the responsible scientific leader for each institution:  Jim Bensinger,  Brandeis University;   K.K. Gan,   Ohio State University      B. Heinemann, University of California at Berkeley; H. Lubatti, University of Washington; U. Mallik, University of Iowa; S. Parker, University of Hawaii                   S. Seidel, University of New Mexico;  A. Seiden, University of California at Santa Cruz     P. Skubic, University of Oklahoma; D. Tsybychev, SUNY Stony Brook;               F. Rizatdinova, Oklahoma State University.    The pixel tracking layer (called the IBL) was completed in the Spring of 2014.  It was installed at the center of the ATLAS detector in May 2014.  First tests of a powered IBL started in June 2014.  Commissioning was accomplished with cosmic rays.   The IBL sits at a radius of about 3.27 cm from the collision region.  It has 12 million pixels, each with area of  50 microns x 250 microns.  Data taking began in the Spring of 2015, at the highest energy ever at a colliding beam accelerator (13 TeV energy in the center-of-mass).    Two technical innovations first used in the IBL are 3D silicon sensors, where charge is collected by columns embedded in the silicon, and the frontend pixel chip, called FE-I4.  One third of the sensors in the IBL are 3D sensors, the remainder are the more standard planar sensors.  The 3D sensors are deployed at the most forward and backward locations relative to the collision region where they have to handle tracks passing through at steep angles.  The FE-I4 chip is the largest chip produced for particle physics (about 2cmx1.9cm) and has been designed to handle very large rates.    These innovative parts of the project pave the way for improvements in charged particle tracking detectors for the future.  Other areas where the U.S. groups have contributed heavily are in the high-tech cabling, opto-boxes and opto-boards, the detector control system, the grounding and shielding scheme, and the mechanical support tube for the IBL.  The IBL has been included in the tracking software of ATLAS.  The improvement in b-quark jet tagging is about a factor of  5 higher rejection of light quark jets for a 70% b- quark jet tagging efficiency.  Under further study are the cluster size of signals for closely spaced tracks and the resolution that can be achieved in such cases.  These issues are particularly important for tracks in very dense jets as occur at the very high transverse momentum that can be probed at the LHC.   A further impact of the MRI project has been in the training of students.  Each year a number of students received training in the challenging technical projects of the IBL. This past year the number of students involved was eight.  The ATLAS experiment, along with a complementary experiment called CMS, discovered the Higgs boson in 2012.  Going forward, with the startup of the accelerator at a much higher energy, we have an opportunity to study much more deeply the production and decay patterns of the Higgs boson.  The new IBL will be an important tool in this study.       Last Modified: 11/23/2015       Submitted by: Abraham Seiden]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
