<AbstractNarration>The rise of Web 2.0 and large-scale distributed contributor systems is generating opportunities for a new interdisciplinary field on the topic of collective intelligence. Like cognitive science did beginning in the 1970's, this new field may help share perspectives and results from a variety of different fields. In the case of collective intelligence, potentially relevant disciplines include computer science, organization theory, social psychology, economics, and others. This workshop will frame a research agenda covering important aspects of collective intelligence such as: how to define and measure collective intelligence, how to motivate participants to form part of an intelligent collective, what is the effect of different patterns of connection among the participants (i.e., network science), what problems are well-suited to be attacked by a collective intelligence approach, and what are common design patterns among successful systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop on collective intelligence will facilitate broader impacts in:  (a) coalescing a community of people from different disciplines and perspectives, (b) initiating consensus on how to define collective intelligence as a field and the topics that should be central within it, (c) establish a preliminary research agenda for the field, and (d) catalyze publications about the prospects for this field in one or more high quality journals.</AbstractNarration>

The first workshop (Collective Intelligence 2012) was held in April 2012, and the second one (Collective Intelligence 2014) was held in June 2014, both at MIT.  The first conference included: (a) invited plenary talks from 20 leading researchers from a wide variety of fields related to collective intelligence, (b) 18 refereed papers, and (c) 16 refereed posters.  The second conference included: (a) 19 plenary talks from leading researchers, (b) 1 plenary panel, (c) 18 refereed oral paper presentations, and (d) 105 refereed poster presentations.  Both conferences brought together researchers from a variety of fields relevant to understanding and designing collective intelligence of many types.  For instance, they included presentations and attendees from disciplines such as: network science, computer science, cognitive science, neuroscience, management / organization theory, economics, social psychology, sociology, political science, and biology (e.g., social insects).  A primary goal of the conferences was to catalyze the development of a new interdisciplinary field of 'collective intelligence,' and the number and strength of enthusiastic comments we received leads us to believe that the conference did, indeed, help in advancing toward this goal.  Further evidence that a serious intelliecutal community is forming in this area is provided by the fact that the Collective Intelligence 2015 conference has been scheduled for June 2015, in Santa Clara, California.
