<AbstractNarration>There are three project objectives that will be achieved during the proposed project timeframe. Five years of anticipated program funding are essential to research the impact of project strategies on STEM student retention, graduation, and transfer rates. The project objectives are as follows: 1.) By September 2015, to increase the number of students majoring in STEM at CMN by 50%; 2.) By September 2015, to increase the retention rate of CMN¡¦s STEM cohorts by a minimum of 25%; 3.) By September 2015, to develop a two-year Multimedia Programming degree.&lt;br/&gt;Project Plans: In order to achieve this project CMN has established several strategies.&lt;br/&gt;?h&lt;br/&gt;Objective 1&lt;br/&gt;?X&lt;br/&gt;Develop and implement bridge program: Main activities include coordinating bridge activities, family math and science nights, AISES chapter development, campus exposure, and high school level math and science competitions.&lt;br/&gt;?h&lt;br/&gt;Objective 2&lt;br/&gt;?X&lt;br/&gt;Infuse culture into STEM courses: Key activities include faculty training, development, revision, piloting, and assessment of courses, and incorporation of culturally relevant projects and site visits in STEM courses.&lt;br/&gt;?X&lt;br/&gt;Develop and maintain a STEM resource room: Main activities include hiring a STEM resource demonstration coordination, purchasing equipment and supplies for resource room, coordination of workshops, hand-on tutoring, mentoring, project assistance, demonstrations and speakers.&lt;br/&gt;?X&lt;br/&gt;Develop and Implment a STEM scholars program at the Oneida campus: Major activities include setting up the program at that campus, implementing prescribed interventions, coordinating cohort activities, and providing stipends for participation.&lt;br/&gt;?X&lt;br/&gt;Coordinate STEM extracurricular activities: Major activities include chapter support, research and internship development and implementation, and student travel to major research labs and national chapter events.&lt;br/&gt;?h&lt;br/&gt;Objective 3&lt;br/&gt;?X&lt;br/&gt;Develop a Multimedia programming degree: Major activities include curriculum and course development, piloting of those courses, revising as necessary, and working on essential articulation agreements.</AbstractNarration>

CMN received a no-cost extention to a five-year project that afforded the College the opportunity to complete critical activities and expand its capacity to serve college students as well as middle and high schools in the region with a variety of hands-on STEM experiences.</p> <p>Through this project, CMN designed, developed, and delivered a Summer Bridge program in digital media to twelve student from the Menominee Indian High School.&nbsp; Through a video game design project, students gained practical experience using sophisticated software tools while learning design fundamentals, music creation, game theory and design techniques. With interactive hands-on exercises students were introduced to high level STEM topics, including computer scripting, digital imaging, 3D mesh and models, textures, sound design, animation and interpolation, 3D coordinates as well a movement by manipulating values and parametric equations.&nbsp; The progam was a remarkable success and will be offered to a broader group of high school students in the future.</p> <p>Through this project, CMN renovated its STEM Resource/Demonstration and Academic Support facility to accomodate larger scale projects and project teams.&nbsp; In the expanded facility, CMN students participated in the following extracurricular projects/activities:</p> <p><strong>First Nations Launch&nbsp; -Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium (WSGC), April-May 2016</strong></p> <p>This project involved three separate rocket-based activities to reach CMN students, middle school students, and the community.&nbsp; Twelve CMN students participated in designing, building, and launching a high-powered rocket with a scientific payload.&nbsp; CMN students brought rocket kits to 46 Menominee Tribal School middle school students to help them design, build, and launch their own rockets during their science class.&nbsp; To increase community awareness, a bus was provided to take 37 community members to the First Nations Launch site on April 23, 2016.</p> <p><strong>Tethered Aerostat Program -Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium (WSGC), April-August 2016</strong></p> <p>Thirteen CMN students participated in the Tethered Aerostat Program, an atmospheric and environmental monitoring project using tethered blimps equipped with sensors and communication hardware.&nbsp; Students presented the project at the Congress for Conservation Biology in Madison, WI in July 2016 and at the Wisconsin Space Conference in Superior, WI in August 2016.</p> <p><strong>Physics Force Camp, June 2016</strong></p> <p>A week-long camp for twelve middle school students was held on the CMN campus in partnership with Physics Force, an entertaining demonstration of physics principles housed at the U of Minnesota.&nbsp; CMN students spent the mornings learning the physics principles and demonstrations.&nbsp; They taught it to the middle school students in the afternoons.&nbsp; An evening community show was presented by the middle school students on the last day.</p> <p>The project also enabled CMN to expand its Peer Tutor Corps.&nbsp; Twelve CMN students worked as part-time peer tutors in the STEM fields.&nbsp; Over fall, summer and spring semesters, they averaged 85 student contacts per week at the drop-in academic center.&nbsp; Peer tutors were also embedded into nine STEM classes.</p> <p>In addition, project funds supported workshops for faculty to assist them in incorporating culturally-relevant materials and problems into their courses;&nbsp;
