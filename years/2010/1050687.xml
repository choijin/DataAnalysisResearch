<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Bacteria have an amazing diversity of pathways for generating the energy they need to live and function. This diversity contributes to their ability to thrive in and impact different environments. Despite this importance, our knowledge of how the metabolic potential of bacteria influences ocean ecosystem function is far from complete. The main research goal of this project is to understand how the function of alternative oxidase (AOX) physiologically benefits microorganisms. AOX is a component of energy generation pathways of certain marine bacteria which are numerically dominant and/or important for chemical cycling in ocean environments. Due to the fundamental connection between energy generation and bacterial growth and survival, AOX could ultimately be linked to the contribution of these bacteria to the functioning of the ocean ecosystem.Towards this research goal, the genetically manipulable marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri will be used as a model organism in genetic, molecular, and biochemical assays. These assays will test hypotheses that AOX functions to reduce oxidative stress and DNA damage, maintain metabolic balance, and/or reduce oxygen tensions under various growth conditions. The results of these studies will provide important new information related to the benefit of AOX function in bacteria, and lay the foundation for exploration of the role of AOX in the physiology of other marine bacteria and the influence of bacterial AOX on marine ecosystem function. In addition, these studies may contribute to understanding the evolutionary history of this interesting protein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This research project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning by providing opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and a postdoctoralresearcher to actively participate in the research activities. These students and researcher will be encouraged to interact with the scientific community by attending and presenting at regional, national, and international meetings. In addition, outreach seminars discussing the research will be presented at regional colleges and universities with the goal of developing relationships with faculty and students at non-PhD granting institutions to encourage talented undergraduates to consider graduate studies. Finally, scientific outreach to the general public will be accomplished through participation in the Norman Science Caf√©, a venue that promotes informal and conversational interactions between scientists and people without formal scientific training.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[          Alternative oxidase (AOX) is a respiratory oxidase present in the respiratory pathways of all plants, as well as certain fungi, protists, and animals.  This protein is intriguing because unlike many other characterized oxidases, it does not directly contribute to energy conservation.  Therefore, the energy produced by the reduction of water is lost by the cells.  The role of this protein in eukaryotes is an active area of research.  Until the increase in genome and environmental DNA sequencing revealed the presence of genes encoding AOX in bacteria, it was thought that only eukaryotes expressed this protein.  Through these types of sequence analysis, it became apparent that aox-like genes are abundant in bacteria inhabiting marine surface waters.  This abundance suggests that AOX is important to the biology of certain marine bacteria.  Due to the fundamental connection between the respiratory chain and bacterial growth and survival, AOX could ultimately be linked to the contribution of these bacteria to the functioning of the ocean ecosystem.  In addition, studies of AOX in bacteria may contribute to interpreting AOX function in eukaryotes, and/or understanding the evolutionary history of this protein.          In this research, the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri was used as a model organism to decipher the physiological benefit of AOX function in bacteria.  V. fischeri has a very flexible metabolism, with aerobic respiration terminating in potentially three different respiratory oxidases.  They include two that are expressed under normal growth conditions, and AOX, which is expressed in response to the presence of nitric oxide.  Of the three oxidases, only AOX is resistant to inhibition by nitric oxide.  Using genetic and biochemical approaches, it was discovered that in the presence of nitric oxide, AOX appears to function to limit oxidative stress that is induced by inhibition of normal aerobic respiratory pathways, therefore providing an advantage for cells able to express AOX.  In addition, it appears that diverse bacteria also regulate expression of AOX similarly to V. fischeri, validating its use as a model for AOX studies.           As part of these investigations, much has been learned about the regulation and function of V. fischeri oxidases, the nitric oxide response of this bacterium, as well as about the importance of iron in V. fischeri physiology (the oxidases are iron-containing proteins, and iron uptake and use is related to their function).   These results are useful for comparative studies to other bacteria, including pathogens, as well as comparisons to the role of AOX in eukaryotes.  In addition, the results of this research provide a strong foundation for future exploration of the role of this protein in the growth and survival of marine bacteria in the environment.  These types of studies have the potential to increase our understanding of how bacteria contribute to nutrient cycling in marine environments.          During this project, two postdoctoral scientists, four graduate students, five undergraduate students, and one high school student were involved in research in the laboratory.  This group included seven from underrepresented groups.  Public outreach was performed through the "Letters to a Pre-Scientist" program, a summer course for underrepresented high school students, research fair activities at the University of Oklahoma, and the Norman, OK Science Caf&eacute;.
