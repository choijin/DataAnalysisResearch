<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program supports Professors Folami T. Ladipo and Mark Crocker, both at the University of Kentucky whose proposed research describes strategies for the design of heterogeneous catalysts incorporating tripodal Ti silsesquioxane moieties, and for fully assessing the synthetic potential of the resulting catalysts in the epoxidation of demanding substrates. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is the design and preparation of heterogeneous alkene epoxidation catalysts possessing improved activity, selectivity, and durability relative to current catalysts. These catalysts should be useful in alkene epoxidation using H2O2 and H2/O2 as the oxidant. Their research will focus on the immobilization of tripodal Ti silsequioxane complexes via physical encapsulation in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes. This also includes anchoring the Ti silsesquioxane moieties to supported Gold (Au) nanoparticles with in situ generation of H2O2 via the Au-catalyzed reaction of H2 with O2. The properties of the resulting catalysts will be explored with regard to epoxidation of demanding substrates. These will include alkenes that are electronically and/or sterically "deactivated" with respect to epoxidation, such as allylic alcohols.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professors Folami T. Ladipo and Mark Crocker will design improved catalysts for olefin epoxidation. These catalysts are anticipated to be applicable to both fine chemicals synthesis and bulk production of simple aliphatic epoxides. The project will be an active collaboration between Professor Ladipo at the Department of Chemistry and Professor Crocker at the University of Kentucky's Center for Applied Energy Research. The research will be conducted at both locations, with joint responsibility for the direction of graduate and undergraduate students. Thus, this research will provide multidisciplinary training opportunities to students that would not be typically available in a traditional chemistry based project. Another vital objective of the proposed research is using research training to mentor students from groups traditionally under-represented in science. Through collaborations with colleagues at historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) as well as regional universities, talented African American and Appalachian undergraduate students will be recruited to participate in the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>

Thus, P1-7 and c-P1-7 catalyzed 1-octene epoxidation is not diffusion-controlled. Furthermore, titanium leaching and catalyst recycling studies for P1-7 and c-P1-7 showed that the selectivity to epoxide remained excellent and highly reproducible.     We demonstrated that P1-7 and c-P1-7, as well as homogeneous complexes Ti(NMe2){(i-C4H9)7Si7O12}] (1) and Ti(NMe2){(c-C6H11)7Si7O12}] (2) are efficent catalysts for epoxidation of demanding alkenes, such as &alpha;-pinene and limonene, with TBHP. The epoxidation of &alpha;-pinene is of interest in that it is practiced commercially in the fragrance industry. Also, &alpha;-pinene epoxide is extremely susceptible to rearrangements, making a good test of the ability of a given catalyst to catalyze its formation without promoting secondary reactions, such as ring opening. Limonene offers the potential for competitive reaction between the internal and terminal alkenes, allowing the evaluation of intramolecular regioselectivity. Using 20:1 alkene:TBHP, both 1 and 2 catalyzed &alpha;-pinene epoxidation with high turnover frequency (TOF = 743 h-1) to selectively produce &alpha;-pinene oxide (91-96%)). These results are remarkable given that &alpha;-pinene oxide production is known to be difficult, due to the rearrangements of the product. Additionally, titanium catalysts generally give campholenic aldehyde as the main product, leading to low &alpha;-pinene oxide selectivity. Based on these results, tripodal titanium silsesquioxanes exhibit some of the best catalytic activity for the conversion of alkenes to epoxides observed to date.  Both 1 and 2 also exhibited excellent activity and selectivity for catalytic conversion of the internal alkene of limonene to give limonene oxide (96%). Impressively, the catalysts maintained their high activity and high epoxide selectivity in the epoxidation of cyclohexene, 1-methylcyclohexene, and limonene when 1:1 alkene:TBHP was employed although longer reaction times are required. In fact, 1 and 2 consisten...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
