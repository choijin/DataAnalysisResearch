<AbstractNarration>Assessing earthquake risk due to seismicity along the Cascadia margin from northern California to southern British Columbia is a matter of great public interest. Studies of regional seismicity recorded by arrays of seismographs are a primary tool for this purpose, but to date such studies have been largely limited to onshore arrays. In the upcoming Cascadia project, onshore instrumentation will be complemented by deployments of 60 or more Ocean Bottom Seismographs (OBS) off the Cascadia coast for several years. A modest deployment of OBSs off the Oregon coast in 2007-2009 has demonstrated the great difficulty of separating relevant seismic events in OBS data from impulsive signals of probable biological origin. This project seeks to develop computer automated methods for separating seismic signals from extraneous signals in the OBS data, particularly for instruments located in shallow water near the coast. The project has a number of broader impacts, but by far the most significant is the very high societal relevance of developing these techniques for studies of seismicity and seismic hazards in general, and for the Cascadia project in particular.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes report for NSF award 1049682 - "Detecting Local Earthquakes in a Noisy Continental Margin Environment" (PI A.M. Trehu, Oregon State University)     The objective of this project was to explore the use of several signal processing approaches to data from an ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) array that was deployed on the continental margin offshore Oregon from September 2007 to July 2009 in order to distinguish earthquakes from impulsive signals of biological origin.  The parent project was designed to observed seismic activity associated with the Cascadia subduction zone in a segment that has experienced unusual clusters of activity in the past decade.  The 2007-2009 deployment (known as COLZA for Central Oregon Locked Zone Array) was one of the first long-term deployments to include OBSs on the continental shelf.  These sites record 1000s of impulsive signals/day that are generally thought to result from biological activity.  The earthquakes of interest to this project are much less frequent.  Standard methods for detecting events, such as the ratio of the long-term to the short-term signal level, do not discriminate between these different sources.  Preliminary analysis of the signals, however, suggested that the frequency content of the signals and the signal polarization differ depending on their origin. The objective of this project was to explore this observation and develop an automated approach to classifying signals of different origin.     This project supported a graduate student for 1 year to explore this approach to signal classification.  This student supported by this grant had a significant role in original development of the proposal as well as in its implementation, thus providing a important training on his path to becoming an independent data processor and researcher.  Software developed under this grant is being shared with the research community through the GitHub web site as well as through conventional means (i.e. presentations as national meetings and publications).
