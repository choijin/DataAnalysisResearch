<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to create and test modeling methods for the design and analysis of compliant mechanisms with quantifiable accuracy. This objective will be accomplished through four research tasks: 1) the implementation of a novel kinematic approach for modeling components of compliant mechanism (flexures), 2) a computational investigation of how these components are mathematically sensitive to variations in geometry and materials properties, 3) determination of synergistic effects on motion and stiffness when the components are combined into planar and spatial mechanisms, and 4) the design, fabrication, and testing of planar and spatial Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS) that demonstrate the modeling approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of the broader impact on society this research will generate fundamental advances in compliant mechanism design and MEMS applications. The modeling approach provides designers with mathematical and visualization tools for understanding compliant mechanisms. The modeling approach will enable breakthroughs in the design of spatial compliant mechanisms. The spatial compliant mechanisms enabled by this research will find applications in medicine, optics and tactile displays. In particular, future work utilizing compliant mechanisms is planned in laparoscopy, spinal fixation and repair. Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from classroom instruction, participation in design projects, and the use of design and analysis tools at a professional level. This project contributes to the NSF goal of training and educating students in the nano and MEMS new research areas.</AbstractNarration>
