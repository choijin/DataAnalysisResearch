<AbstractNarration>In the context of the recent backlash against native American groups, the researcher seeks to investigate the changing concept of indigenous sovereignty that has been witnessed in the larger population associated with tribal status and the actions of tribal casinos. The research is theoretically situated in a synthesis of critical race theory, consideration of changing economic and political contexts, and the theoretical ideas associated with the law and society approaches critique of the concept of special rights. The research plan is multi-sited and multi-method, including archival research, interviews, and participant observation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores an apparent contradiction: as more Native Americans join mainstream society and the obvious socio-economic differences between "us" and "them" begin to dissolve, there has emerged more, not less, opposition to Native Americans and their demand that indigenous sovereignty be recognized. The results of the research will further understanding of how underrepresented communities (i.e. Native Americans) are perceived within US society, and in particular the value perceived in engaging with the dominant legal system as a strategy to furthering long-term goals and objectives.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 31 Dec 2015   Federal Award ID: 1060384  Project Outcomes Report for the General Public  Project Title: The Challenge of Indigenous Sovereignty  PI: Eve Darian-Smith  Awardee: University of California-Santa Barbara     The objective of the research was to explore the concept of indigenous sovereignty as a window onto the shifting social, political and legal relations between mainstream US society and its indigenous populations. The concept of indigenous sovereignty has become revitalized and reframed in the early decades of the 21st century, largely as a result of some tribal governments exercising enormous economic power deriving from successful casinos on their reservations. Revenues from these casinos have been used for a wide variety of purposes that have enhanced the quality of life for indigenous communities, and in particular have helped to promote educational outreach and health levels on reservations, as well as employment and economic development strategies through investment and diversification. One significant result of successful Indian owned casinos is that they have provided the means by which some tribes can now engage in mainstream political activities for the first time in US history.   Unfortunately, accompanying the rising economic and political presence of Native Americans in US society has been a backlash against tribes with successful casinos. There is a new racial politics of resentment mobilizing around the narrative of "rich Indians" having "special rights" and articulated in media attacks, political speeches, policy decision-making, anti-gaming community activism, and perhaps most devastatingly, in the mounting assault on tribal sovereignty by the US Supreme Court. The research examines this apparent contradiction: as more Native Americans join mainstream society and the obvious socio-economic differences between "us" and "them" begin to dissolve, there has emerged more, not less, opposition to Native Americans and their demand that indigenous sovereignty be recognized.   One of the central objectives of my research is to show that native legal issues, particularly as they circulate around the concept of sovereignty, present innovative ways to think about alternative modes of governance and legal subjectivity that are increasingly significant in the contemporary moment.

I also analyzed a wide range of legal, political and media documents at local, state, federal and international levels including UN Reports and findings from the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous people.   Through analysis of various modes of data, the research shows that the concept of indigenous sovereignty is a fluid concept and appears to hold different meanings for native and non-native constituencies. For many tribes the concept is used to designate respect and autonomy from federal oversight and did not necessarily correlate to possession and control of land in the way the concept is understood in...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
