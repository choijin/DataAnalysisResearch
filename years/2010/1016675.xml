<AbstractNarration>The likelihood of hidden, subtle bugs increases with growing design sizes, and reaching corner cases in large circuits and systems in order to expose such subtle bugs has become a daunting task. Verifying the correctness of the design is now a tremendous bottleneck in the overall design process. Critical to the effectiveness of stimuli generation is the quality of guidance and feedback provided during the search. The objective of this research is to elicit the swarming power to solve this very difficult problem, which has not been done in the past.  Individual knowledge acquired during the search is extracted to benefit collective effort.  This is enabled via cultivation of knowledge exchange, accumulation, and utilization.  The intelligent partitioning and grouping of the state variables allows for the construction of many effective abstract navigation tracks in large designs, benefiting the swarm platform.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of new theories and algorithms will be an original contribution that will allow for transformative understanding of semi-formal verification and state space exploration, all in a rigorous framework. The theories and practice that will result from this work will not only enable us for a deeper understanding of collective effort, this project will directly promote the education of the involved students.  In regard to outreach to under-represented students, the PI currently advises multiple women Ph.D. students (under-represented in engineering), and this project will continue to encourage aspiring female students to participate in the research endeavor.  In addition, the PI will actively recruit summer minority interns from programs within Virginia Tech to take part in this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Verification and validation of digital integrated circuits constitute a critical bottleneck in the design process of today's circuits and systems. The likelihood of hidden, subtle bugs increases with growing design sizes, and reaching corner cases in large circuits and systems in order to expose such subtle bugs has become a daunting task.  This project tackles this problem from an entirely different angle. Each vector sequence is regarded as an agent and it acquires knowledge unique to its own perspective about the circuit.  Then, the swarming of the intelligence from the collective effort by all agents is used to reach the desired corner case target.   By eliciting the swarming power to solve the very difficult problem of design validation, individual knowledge acquired during the search is extracted to benefit collective effort.  This is enabled via cultivation of knowledge exchange, accumulation, and utilization.    Throughout the course of the project, the research team has been able to:  develop a platform for our swarm-intelligence based search for gate-level circuits.  We developed a novel, initial bio-inspired framework using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for both ATPG and design  validation by collectively harnessing the power of various searches. develop a probabilistic state transition model to help formulate the state justification problem as a searching scheme of artificial ants. The amount of pheromone left by the ants is directly proportional to the quality of the search so that it can serve as an effective guidance for the search.  collect intelligence from the swarm to avoid critical dead-end states as well as attaining fast convergence to the target.  develop a formal bounded model checker, in conjunction with the swarm-intelligent test generator, to identify unreachable targets, such as branches and register values.  The identification of these unreachable targets helps the test generator steer away from these cases. begin a validation engine with swarm intelligence at the register-transfer level (RTL).  The test cases generated are fed back to the gate-level to achieve high fault coverage.   The research team consists of a diverse participation of members, including US citizens and foreign students.  This project directly promoted the education of the involved graduate students. The in-depth study, analysis, and development of the state-of-the-art tools will continue to enable them to push the current envelope, and their acquired knowledge and expertise will continue to contribute to the technical frontier beyond graduation.
