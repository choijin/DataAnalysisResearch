<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of a &lt;br/&gt;multifrequency cross-correlation phase and modulation fluorimeter at the &lt;br/&gt;University of Kentucky Center for Structural Biology.  The fluorimeter &lt;br/&gt;is used to study the structure, stability and interactions of proteins &lt;br/&gt;and other biological macromolecules.  Major experiments that will be &lt;br/&gt;performed with the fluorimeter include fluorescence resonance energy &lt;br/&gt;transfer, providing information on the distribution of distances between &lt;br/&gt;fluorophores attached to biomolecules, and anisotropy (polarization), to &lt;br/&gt;study interactions between biomolecules.  Some of the molecules of &lt;br/&gt;interest in these studies include neurolysin, neuropeptidase, and &lt;br/&gt;nitroreductase.  In addition, the instrument is available for use by &lt;br/&gt;investigators at other regional institutions and used in the annual &lt;br/&gt;Biofluorescence Symposium at the University of Kentucky.  The results of &lt;br/&gt;these research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through &lt;br/&gt;abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active &lt;br/&gt;participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
