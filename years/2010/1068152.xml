<AbstractNarration>The universe contains objects capable of accelerating particles to energies of tens or hundreds of TeV. Gamma rays are an important probe to study the extreme physics in these cosmic accelerators. High-energy gamma rays have been detected from a variety of sources such as supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies, pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants, and binary star systems. Detailed measurements of high-energy gamma rays, in conjunction with observations at other wavelengths, will greatly enhance our understanding of the acceleration and emission mechanisms in these objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RUI award will provide support for scientists at Grand Valley State University (GVSU) to conduct research with VERITAS, the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona. VERITAS is an array of four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes designed to detect very-high-energy gamma rays (100 GeV - 50 TeV) by imaging the flashes of Cherenkov light produced when these photons impact the Earth's atmosphere. The research efforts at GVSU will focus on Galactic TeV sources, in particular compact binaries, pulsars, and unidentified gamma-ray sources, and on multi-wavelength studies of these objects. Service efforts will be directed towards improving the performance of the VERITAS Pointing Monitor system and improving the pointing accuracy and optical properties of the VERITAS telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under Broader Impacts, this project will provide undergraduate students at GVSU with the opportunity to conduct focused research in high-energy astrophysics and acquire a broad range of research skills. GVSU has a diverse population of undergraduate students many of which are first-generation college students or students from traditionally underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
