<AbstractNarration>A recently-discovered connection between the constructive type theory and homotopy theory is investigated using the tools of higher- dimensional algebra.  Martin-Lof type theory extends the lambda- calculus by admitting dependent types and terms, and is at least as strong as second-order logic. It is also used as the basis of several high-level programming languages because of its combination of expressive strength and desirable proof-theoretic properties. The system is interpreted into axiomatic homotopy theory using the framework of Quillen model categories and relying on related algebraic methods involving (weak) higher-dimensional groupoids.  This permits logical methods to be combined with algebraic and topological ones, admitting theoretical and computational applications of type theory in homotopy and higher-dimensional algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research pursues a surprising connection between Geometry, Algebra, and Logic which was discovered by the PI and is now under active investigation by several researchers worldwide. In addition to its importance in foundations of mathematics, it has strong potential for direct applications in computer science.  Logical systems of the kind investigated are used extensively in programming language design and implementation.  The new geometric and algebraic interpretations are of use both in securing the correctness of applied systems and as a theoretical model of the computational paradigms implemented by such systems.  Conversely, computational applications in geometry and algebra are made likely by the well-developed computational implementations of the logical system.  The broader impact of the research is both in applications in science and technology and in graduate education.  A doctoral student in Carnegie Mellon's Pure and Applied Logic program is partially supported under this research project.  The student is being trained in the relevant areas of logic, topology, and algebra, and conducts joint research with the PI, eventually leading to the degree of PhD.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Homotopy and Type Theory  Steve Awodey  August 2013  This research investigated a new connection between Logic and Geometry.  It is based on an interpretation of a formal system for the foundations of mathematics, called constructive type theory, into homotopy theory, which is the mathematics of continuous deformations.    Constructive type theory was originally intended as a rigorous framework for constructive mathematics. It is also employed extensively as a framework for the development of high-level programming languages, in virtue of its combination of expressive strength and desirable proof-theoretic properties.  The constructive character and computational tractability has led to this system being use as the basis for powerful computer proof verification systems, which can check the correctness of proofs in everyday mathematics, and even aid in find them.  The interpretation of homotopy theory into this systems allows for formal reasoning in areas of mathematics not previously formalized, and even for computer-checked proofs in very high-level, abstract mathematics, such as calculations of the higher homotopy groups of higher-dimensional spheres, a central topic in classical homotopy theory.  The successes achieved in these areas point to the possibility of entirely new, computational foundations of mathematics.  Broader impact. The broader impact of the research is evident in graduate education, organization of large-scale research, and in broader applications in science and technology. The PI is actively involved in the supervision of doctoral research in logic and mathematics in the framework of Carnegie MellonÆs PhD program in Pure and Applied Logic. Four Carnegie Mellon doctoral students were partially supported under this research project.    Moreover, the PI co-organized a year-long research program at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, in which 38 participants from around the world worked for one year on topics related to this project, advancing its goals pursuing related ones.  This research also has direct applications in computer science. Type theories of the kind under investigation are used extensively in programing language design and implementation. Homotopical and higher-algebraic interpretations are of use both in securing the soundness of applied systems with special properties and behavious, and as a new theoretical model of the computational paradigms implemented by such systems.   Under this research grant, 5 scientific papers and one book were authored or co-authored.  In addition, two scientific websites were established, as was an on-line library of computer code for a computational proof assistant.
