<AbstractNarration>1067508&lt;br/&gt;Lim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological imaging is an indispensable tool in biological research. The contrast agents often limit image quality and utility. An optimal contrast agent would need great resolution, functional specificity, minimal sample preparation/ ability for use in-vivo versus pathological imaging, low background signal and low toxicity. Rare earth doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) are a promising alternative contrast agent that provide an equivalent resolution, tissue penetration, and low background as two-photon microscopy at the low pump power used in fluorescence imaging, while being of very low toxicity. Current UCNPs are dim, however, and current progress in increasing the efficiency of particles that can easily be taken up into tissue (diameter &lt; 100 nm) has been slow since iterative systematic optimization is often slow, and not grounded in a central hypothesis. The PIs propose to drastically enhance upconversion brightness of UCNPs by coupling them to metal nanostructures that display electromagnetic resonance (plasmons). Because of the unique 'anti-Stokes' fluorescence that utilizes infrared excitation to yield visible (green and red) emission, the enhancement could considerably exceed the ones achieved using fluorescent (Stokes) surface enhanced emission.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Biological imaging is an indispensable tool in research and diagnostics. More often than not, the costs of diagnostic imaging procedures are large, such as the $3000 in facility costs for an average NMRI. Many requirements need to be satisfied, such as resolution, functional specificity, tissue penetration, minimal sample preparation, the ability for use in-vivo versus pathological imaging, low background signal and low toxicity.  We have investigated rare earth doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) as a contrast agent for infrared-excited microscopy. UNCPs show strong visible fluorescence when excited with lowcost ir diode lasers, thus eliminating the cost of the optical system. UNCPs are non-bleaching/blinking, have zero background, low toxicity, provide tissue penetration, low background, and do not require ultra-fast lasers like as two-photon microscopy. In addition, the narrow bandwidth emission of different rare earth dopants enables multiplex detection under a single excitation, as compared to the broad and featureless spectra of organic dyes. Despite these properties, UNCPs have only been utilized as tags in in-vitro assays due to a drop in fluorescence efficiency when the particle diameter is reduced to a size that promotes tissue penetration and enables sub-cellular imaging.  We have investigated whether upconversion brightness of UCNPs is improved by coupling them to metal nanostructures that display electromagnetic resonances (plasmons). We have investigated coupling to 1) gold shells, 2) gold nanorods, and 3) gold mirrors.  In all cases we have found strong enhancement of the brightness of UCNPs, up to 10 times in some cases.  For large upconverting nanoparticles with a gold shell, we showed that the emission from particles in the range of a few 100 nm in size is enhanced in the way that concepts from diffraction theory predict.  For that, the resonant gold shell and the emissive core are well separated, and influence of the local field enhancement was compared to the increased loss due to local heating of the metal as determined from finite element calculation.  For small upconverting nanoparticles with a gold shell, we show that UNCP brightness is enhanced even as the size approaches 25 nm.  To elucidate this finding and shed light on the energy transfer processes between rate-earth atoms with particular focus on the influence of the metal coupling, we performed time-resolved spectroscopy. The central analytic tools of this investigation is single particle structural and optical correlated spectroscopy where single particle time-resolved fluorescence of the emitted radiation under pulsed illumination is analyzed.  By fitting the multi-spectral decay curves, we deduced occupation levels, radiative and non-radiative decay times, and inter-ionic transfer rates. We find evidence that the gold shell here increases the energy transfer between ions within the particle. To solidify our understanding of the interplay of gold plasmons on rare-earth doped UCNPs, we finally studied the same processes on UCNP that are placed in proximity to a gold mirror.  Time-resolved spectroscopy again showed a strong enhancement of fluorescence coincident with a profound modification of the energy transfer processes, strengthening the model that we have proposed for the brightness enhancement of plasmonic-enhanced UCNP for imaging.  The results of the study will enable the guided optimization of ultra-small UNCPs for functional biological imaging by identifying how to suppress physical pathways that lead to the drop in brightness when bulk powder are shrunk to the nanoscale.  Broader Impacts  An increase of UCNP efficiency has direct impact on their potential use in clinical diagnostics and photodynamic therapy.  Our findings will enable efficient delivery and decreased illumination intensity.  First commercialization of larger UCNPs in in-vitro assays is currently occurring. In the short term, the outcome can imp...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
