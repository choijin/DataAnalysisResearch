<AbstractNarration>Daily variation in glucocorticoids is critical for homeostatic regulation of metabolic, cardiovascular and neural processes. An adrenal clock generates glucocorticoid rhythmicity, but elements that entrain the clock are unknown. The overall hypothesis is that sympathetic neural activity (SNA) is a critical adrenal input that transmits rhythmic light-dark and feeding time signals to modulate glucocorticoid rhythms by interacting with ACTH to entrain the adrenal clock. Experiments will use mPER2:Luciferase knockin mice, in which luciferase is rhythmically expressed under the control of the Per2 clock gene. To assess SNA-mediated entrainment, the PER2Luc rhythm will be measured in adrenal explants from intact or adrenal-denervated mice on a 12:12 light:dark cycle and after light-dark phase shifts. Use of hypophysectomized mice replaced with constant ACTH will address whether ACTH rhythms entrain the adrenal clock or augment SNA-mediated entrainment. Using restricted feeding, studies will determine whether the rate of food entrainment is reduced by denervation. Using pharmacological approaches, experiments will determine whether ACTH acts through a cyclic AMP-dependent pathway. Examining responses to adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists will determine if the adrenal medulla links SNA and the adrenal clock. Broader Impacts: The use of the PER2Luc mice provides an innovative experimental model that will stimulate students to challenge current understanding of neuroendocrine function. With the College of Biological Sciences, the PI will develop an evaluation tool to measure the effectiveness of the research experience to enhance academic achievement in the College; results will be reported in annual NSF reports. The PI and his students also will participate in outreach activities, including Brain Awareness Week for elementary students, Brain Bee for secondary students, and Brain U for middle school science teachers. Finally, to promote information dissemination, the PI will share data with collaborators, like Professor Horacio de la Iglesia, University of Washington to enhance mutual lab productivity and augment student development.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project was designed to delineate how the adrenal clock is controlled by extrinsic inputs including hypothalamic-pituitary (HPA) release of ACTH and sympathetic nerve activity that transmit rhythmic light-dark (LD) signals from the brain to entrain circadian rhythms in glucocorticoids. To assess entrainment factors, experiments used mPER2::Luciferase knockin mice, in which luciferase is rhythmically expressed under the control of the mouse Per2 clock gene. A major finding is that ACTH phase shifts the adrenal mPER2luc rhythm in a monophasic fashion in vitro, arguing for ACTH as a key resetter of the adrenal clock. To determine if splanchnic (sympathetic) innervation of the adrenal controlled the adrenal clock gene rhythm, we studied mPER2Luc mice after adrenal denervation; we found no effect of adrenal denervation on the adrenal clock gene rhythm. However, we did observe that 14 days of chronic subordinate stress results in a phase shift in the mPER2Luc rhythm. Taken together, these results indicate that a novel consequence of activation of the HPA axis is alteration in entrainment of the adrenal clock gene rhythm. Since stress stimulates ACTH, it is possible that stress resets the circadian rhythm in glucocorticoids. To address this question, we developed the use of chronic subcutaneous microdialysis sampling in awake mice to detect circadian rhythms in corticosterone; the method has sufficient temporal resolution to define key rhythmic parameters like phase, period and amplitude. This method will be instrumental in defining the phenotype in a variety of transgenic mouse models. Since the role of the adrenal clock in controlling glucocorticoid rhythms remains unsettled, experiments were done to produce an adrenal cortex-specific clock knockout, by deleting the clock gene, Bmal1 in adrenal cells. This novel AS-Cre::Bmal1fl/fl mouse model will be useful for delineating the functional importance of the adrenal clock in controlling glucocorticoid rhythms. A goal of the Broader Impacts component was to implement the use of the SURE III survey to evaluate the undergraduate research experience in the College of Biological Sciences (CBS) at the University of Minnesota.
