<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this project is to explore the radio frequency (RF) signal processing and sensing properties of optomechanically-coupled systems in the context of radiation pressure driven optomechanical oscillator (OMO). Specifically, the nonlinear dynamics of a microtoroid OMO will be studied in the presence of modulated optical pump and external perturbation. We will use the outcomes of the theoretical and experimental investigation to develop OMO based RF signal processors and biochemical sensors. Additionally, to support this primary goal we will demonstrate a novel hybrid optomechanical oscillator with enhanced performance and integration techniques that for the first time enable demonstration of fully integrated and efficient OMO based systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: New aspects of the nonlinear dynamics of an OMO will be investigated that can be exploited for practical applications such as homodyne RF down conversion and molecule detection. The idea of hybrid OMO proposed here will enable low power and low phase noise optomechanical oscillation at high frequencies. Also the proposed research aims to develop a new class of sensors based on simultaneous optical and mechanical monitoring using high quality OMO.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The multidisciplinary nature of this project stimulates collaboration among different departments at University of New Mexico. The PI has developed plans for collaboration with minority serving colleges and to reach out K-12 and post-secondary teachers and students. The principles and systems explored in this project will benefit the society through improvement of future RF-photonic communication systems and development of a new class of integrated biochemical sensors.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The advent of high quality optical microresonators has enabled the exploitation of many weak nonlinear optical phenomena at relatively low optical power levels. One of these phenomena is the coupling between optical waves and mechanical vibrations in the so called <em>optomechanical</em> microresonators. Because of their special design and material properties, these micron-size devices can support optical power circulation and build-up within moving boundaries. As a result, the vibration of the structure can modulate the circulating optical power and the optical force (radiation pressure) can control the mechanical vibration. This mutual interaction can be used to amplify or damp the vibration of the corresponding boundary. Before this project very little effort was dedicated to physics and applications of radiation-pressure-based optomechanical amplification and its manifestation as optomechanical oscillation. The goal of this project was to explore the dynamics of radiation pressure driven optomechanical oscillators (OMO) and their applications in sensing and communication. During the course of the project we studied harmonic frequency generation and mixing in OMOs and developed a new method for locking the frequency and phase of an OMO to an electromechanical oscillator via acoustic waves. &nbsp;Also for the first time we demonstrated the functionality of OMO as a mass sensor, acoustic wave detector, radio frequency (RF) mixer, and refractive index sensor. Note that almost all molecule detectors rely on refractive index variations induced by the presence of molecules. As such a refractive index sensor can be used to detect and quantify molecules. While we used a glass based toroidal shape optomechanical microresonator for our demonstrations, the outcomes are applicable to all types of OMOs independent of their structure and material. In addition we have developed a new type of optical RF oscillator called thermo-optomechanical oscillator (TOMO) that its bi-frequency oscillation is sensitive to the refractive index of the surrounding medium.
