<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Identification Technology Research (CITeR)" with a focus on technologies of human measurement, identity, and intent that rest on firm pillars of trust, privacy, security, and reliability. The lead of the proposed Center will be Clarkson (CU) with site locations at the West Virginia University (WVU) and the University of Arizona (UA). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technologies to measure, monitor, identify humans and human intent are needed for a broad range of commercial and security applications. The use of technology to both improve performance (e.g. as minimizing false alarms for a given desired positive detection rate) or improving user interface (e.g. speeding lines through airports) will have a strong benefit to society. The proposed center will seek advanced theoretical and analytical techniques for developing algorithms and assessing performance of tools and systems that for human and intent identification. Such tools are needed for a variety of applications, and the current state of the art provides significant room for advancement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center builds upon the past success of an existing center that has been in operation since 2001. West Virginia University and University of Arizona have been the key players in CITeR since its inception, while others such as Michigan State have made notable contributions in areas such as image processing. In this proposal, Clarkson University as the lead institution adds complementary Center capabilities for measurements and signal processing to identity humans and human intent, and expands the center in an important way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research plan represents an appropriate set of projects for comprehensively addressing needs in this area. The investigators are well-qualified to carry out the research, and many have a significant, well-respected research track record in their fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CITeR will focus on research, education, and technology dissemination. CITeR's leadership with Clarkson to develop the Diversity 2050 Initiative program is an active program to identify and address educational needs of next-generation professionals in the identification technology arena, and is likely to lead to a broad-reaching and positive impact to higher education in these areas. The proposal lays out a clear plan for engaging the other CiTER sites in this effort. The proposed and re-organized CITeR will extend its research core while building on the solid foundation of the past. The proposed program builds on an existing center that has had great success since its inception in 2001, with more than 80 projects that have involved 22 faculty and 130 students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) is the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) focused on developing technology for providing, confirming, and determining identity.  Having a provable and verifiable Identity is a prerequisite for an individual to function in modern society; it is what allows you to have a job, maintain a bank account, and move freely around the globe.  During this project, CITeR focused on a key technology underlying identity: biometrics, which is the use of physiological or behavioral characteristics to identify an individual.  With biometrics, the use of a trusted enrolled sample provides the basis for a subsequent authentication decision. Over time, CITeR?s core research has evolved to focus on automated decisions surrounding the use of data collected from individuals, with these decisions resting on firm pillars of trust, privacy, security, and reliability.   Ubiquitous computing has allowed the effort to shift towards understanding the information content of human measurement, and this understanding has potential advantages such as increased security, establishment of trust, increased convenience, and improved distribution of benefits such as health, services, and commerce.  Over the duration of the project, the Affiliate Advisory Board selected for funding over 100 precompetitive proof-of-concept projects.  These projects were completed by faculty and students at West Virginia University, at partner sites at Clarkson University, the University at Buffalo, and the University of Arizona, and by other research partners and this project?s co-PI at Michigan State University.  The topical areas of the projects included DNA-based identification, including touch DNA and bacterial DNA; cross-modal and cross-spectral matching, with applications to passport-to-face matching, thermal-to-visible face matching, cross audio-to-visual speaker identification, and cross-age facial recognition; fusing biometric and biographic information in identification systems; cloud-based biometrics; the use of smartphones for facial recognition; and the use of video for simultaneous recognition of humans and their actions.  Over 20 faculty researchers and more than 100 students participated in these projects, creating multidisciplinary research synergies.  Research results were published in leading scientific journals, conferences, and a dozen authored and edited textbooks.  A first-of-its kind program on Biometric Systems awarded 50 bachelor?s degrees during the period of the project. Students educated through the Center activities are filling critical positions in biometrics and security industries and in the government.
