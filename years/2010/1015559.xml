<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The amazing progress of technology through modern history has been largely dependent upon the development and understanding of new materials.  New materials with desirable physical properties have revolutionized everything from stereo equipment to cellular phones to clothing and cars, drastically changing our everyday lives.  During the summer of 2010, I traveled to Keio University in Yokohama, Japan to investigate molecule-based magnets and conductors.  Specifically, Keio University's Professor Yasuaki Einaga and his lab have expertise in photo-functional magnetic nano-materials, and their specialized equipment and know-how was utilized to investigate the fundamental conductivity in Prussian blue analogue conductors (since published in Phys. Rev. B 83, 153202 (2011)) and interface effects in heterostructures of photomagnetic Prussian blue analogues (manuscript in preparation).  Measurements of the electronic conductivity in Berlin green and Prussian blue materials, which are synthesized from molecular building blocks using wet chemistry, were extended to cryogenic temperatures.  The conduction mechanism was identified as hopping of localized electrons through conducting states (Figure 1), which is relevant because such a mechanism may only be utilized at room temperature.  This finding provides guidance for researchers seeking to utilize Prussian blue analogue materials as spin-tronic devices, where not only electron charge but also electron magnetism is used to transfer information; Prussian blue analogue systems have been predicted by theorists to show spin-tronic behavior.  Photomagnetic heterostructures of Prussian blue analogue systems were reported in 2010, and are exciting because they raise the viable temperature of photomagnetic behavior in these systems from less than 20 Kelvin to near liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K).  Heterostructures are made from layers of different materials, which interact to provide novel functionalities.  To better understand what happens at the interfacial layers (Figure 2), bulk materials that consisted of mixtures of the two interface materials were prepared and studied.  It was shown that the ability for photomagnetism to be observed depends strongly on the degree of mixing, with different stability depending upon whether systems were nickel of chromium rich.  These results show incremental progress towards utilizing molecule-based materials in technological devices, and contribute to my continuing interest in designing and understanding materials with material properties that may be tuned with external stimuli.  Currently, I am still performing research towards the goal of being able to tune large changes in electronic and magnetic properties using light.  Imagine the ability to shine different colored lights on a refrigerator magnet to change whether or not it would stick to one's fridge, while this is a silly example, such technology would be ripe for exploitation in memory storage devices and detectors, and may one day be in consumer devices.
