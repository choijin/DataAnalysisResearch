<AbstractNarration>This project is to investigate the electrodynamical coupling between the magnetosphere and ionosphere using a combination of ground-based optical and radar remote sensing of the high latitude ionosphere with measurements of the inner plasma sheet acquired by the THEMIS spacecraft. This work will create empirical maps of bursts of enhanced flows, localized near the Harang discontinuity region of the ionospheric convection electric field, and assess the relationship of the flow bursts with auroral and magnetospheric activity, specifically including auroral poleward boundary intensifications, north-south auroral structuring, polar cap convection, and the timing of substorm onset.   Ground-based instrumentation to be used includes incoherent scatter radars (Sondrestrom, AMISR, and RISR), SuperDARN radars, and magnetometer and all-sky imaging arrays.  The goal of this effort is to provide empirical tests of a potential solution to the long-standing problem of substorm onset timing.</AbstractNarration>

We have performed studies that have used these new capabilities to obtain new and fundamentally important views of geospace dynamical processes.  In particular, we have found evidence that the dynamics of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system can be viewed as having meso-scale flow channels within the polar cap region and along auroral oval magnetic field lines that play a critical role in Space Weather dynamics, interacting with the more slowly changing, large-scale structure that is more directly driven by interaction with the solar wind.  The meso-scale flow channels strongly couple the magnetosphere and ionosphere and are crucial to the responses to disturbances.  We have found, for example, localized, transient polar cap flows impinging on the poleward boundary of the nightside auroral oval precede auroral poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs), which are often followed by auroral streamers, some of which propagate equatorward and appear to lead to substorm auroral onset.
