<AbstractNarration>Real-time information is a fundamental emerging issue in the creation&lt;br/&gt;and management of Web content. Increasingly, rather than consulting&lt;br/&gt;relatively static sources that are indexed on a periodic basis,&lt;br/&gt;people refer to information on news sites, blogs, social-networking&lt;br/&gt;sites, and Twitter feeds that change dynamically and spread rapidly.&lt;br/&gt;This project will study how information content varies over time, how&lt;br/&gt;it is transmitted through underlying social networks, and how its&lt;br/&gt;recipients assemble it into larger units. The project will explore&lt;br/&gt;new techniques for addressing these issues, based on novel methods&lt;br/&gt;for tracking, analyzing, and presenting information that evolves and&lt;br/&gt;spreads rapidly over time. The resulting approach aims to transform&lt;br/&gt;important aspects of the ways in which real-time information on the&lt;br/&gt;Web is handled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First the fundamental units of information that spread through the&lt;br/&gt;underlying information networks will be identified. From a set of&lt;br/&gt;nearly 1 billion news media articles and blog posts (approx. 6TB of&lt;br/&gt;data), and a collection of 500 million tweets from Twitter, small&lt;br/&gt;(generally textual) units of information will be identified that&lt;br/&gt;remain relatively stable as they spread through the Web.  The&lt;br/&gt;temporal variation within these basic units will be analyzed and&lt;br/&gt;modeled.  This modeling will include connections with biological&lt;br/&gt;models of epidemics, as well as new frameworks that exploit the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental differences between biological and social contagion.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the temporal variation will be related to network-level&lt;br/&gt;models for the diffusion of this information. Generally, the actual&lt;br/&gt;networks on which real-time information spreads cannot be directly&lt;br/&gt;observed, nor can the influence of any particular node in the network&lt;br/&gt;be directly measured.  Therefore, the project will develop machine-&lt;br/&gt;learning techniques that infer these hidden networks and unobserved&lt;br/&gt;levels of influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information see the project web site at:&lt;br/&gt;http://snap.stanford.edu/proj/mipro</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposed project provides a large&shy;-scale investigation of the propagation of on&shy;line information, focusing on the dynamics by which information is transmitted across the network, the mechanisms by which it changes as it spreads, and the structure and function of the implicit networks that serve to propagate it.  Our investigations significantly extended our understanding of how to manage real-time Web information, as well as out understanding of the evolving landscape of on&shy;line news and commentary.  One of the fundamental problems in understanding flow of information is in predicting whether a given piece of information will get "viral" and spread through the underlying social network. In particular, on many social networking web sites such as Facebook and Twitter, resharing or reposting functionality allows users to share others' content with their own friends or followers. As content is reshared from user to user, large cascades of reshares can form.
