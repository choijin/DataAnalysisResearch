<AbstractNarration>The University of Utah Cosmic Ray Physics Group has a long history of studying the spectrum, composition, and sources of the highest energy particles in the universe. The west desert of Utah, where their experiments have been located, is an excellent site for cosmic ray experiments. Their current experiment is the Telescope Array (TA), which is the largest cosmic ray experiment in the northern hemisphere. This group is the host institution of the TA experiment. The physics issues (what is the nature of the sources? and how do they accelerate particles to such high energies?) are among the most important questions in astrophysics today. Measurements of the spectrum and composition of cosmic rays are basic to answering these questions, and searching for anisotropy in their arrival directions is a direct way of identifying sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides the baseline support of the group, covering salaries, travel and data analysis. The goals of the coming three-year grant period include: measuring the cosmic ray spectrum with both surface and fluorescence detectors and making cosmic ray composition studies in stereo and hybrid modes, as well as searching for anisotropy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, the group's main outreach arm is the ASPIRE Project, which creates and maintains some of the Web's most engaging and interactive science lessons and labs. ASPIRE provides direct outreach to area teachers, runs summer workshops for students, and makes visits to rural schools. The Lon and Mary Watson Cosmic Ray Center (owned by the University of Utah) in Delta, Utah, is the center of the TA outreach work and for the field operations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Telescope Array was conceived and built by members of the High   Resolution FlyÆs Eye (HiRes) and AGASA (Akeno Giant Air Shower Array)   collaborations to study the origin and nature of the highest energy   cosmic rays.  As a part of this, one of the collaborationÆs goals was to   try to understand the differences in the measurements of ultra high   energy cosmic ray (UHECR) properties as measured by HiRes, AGASA, and   the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO).  Planning for the Telescope started   in the late 1990Æs. Construction was approved by the Japanese funding   agency in 2003 and by the US NSF in 2006.  Construction of the high   energy portion of the Telescope Array was completed in 2008 and data   collection began.   The Telescope Array is a hybrid detector   consisting of both surface detectors which sample the charge density in   the footprint of a cosmic ray induced air shower and fluorescence   telescopes which measure the longitudinal development of the shower via   the ultra-violet light generated as the shower develops in the   atmosphere.  The detector has an area of about 350 square miles and is   located in UtahÆs west desert.  It measures the origin direction,   energy, and chemical composition of UHECRs.     One of the   discrepancies under study is the end of the cosmic ray spectrum.  In   1964, Penzias and Wilson of AT&amp;T labs discovered the microwave   background.  This led to calculations by Greissen, Zatsepin, and Kuzmin   to theorize an end to the cosmic ray spectrum.  They calculated that   cosmic rays with energy greater than ~6x10^19eV would interact with the   background and lose their energy.  This GZK cutoff was observed by   HiRes, but not AGASA or other experiments.  The HiRes observation of the   cutoff is confirmed by the Telescope Array TA data indicates the   probability of the spectrum continuing without cutoff is about 2x10^-11   which is about 6.5sigma.  While the PAO also sees the suppression,  their  cutoff is at a slightly different energy; this is a subject for  further  study.   The HiRes/MIA and HiRes experiments observed a  chemical  composition that was heavy like iron around 10^17eV and became   light/protonic above ~10^18eV.  The interpretation of this was that at   10^17eV, we were observing the last remnants of the galactic cosmic  rays  and &gt;10^18eV the cosmic rays were extra-galactic.  PAO observes  a  light composition at 10^18eV, but finds the composition getting   significantly heavier starting ~4x10^18eV.   HiRes measured the   composition using the stereo technique which used telescopes at two   different locations to get a precise geometry and redundant measurement   of the shower development.  PAO used a hybrid measurement which uses   surface detectors to help the telescopes get a geometry lock and then   finds the shower profileusing their telescopes.  TA is able to utilize   both techniques.  TA finds a light/protonic composition from 10^18eV to   the highest energies.  This is an area of joint work between TA and PAO   to understand this difference.   As TA has been collecting data,  we  have noticed a grouping of the highest energy events, those with   E&gt;5.7x10^19eV.   With the 5year data-set, we attempted to quantify   the statistical significance of the spot.  We found that about 26% of   the events were in about 6% of the observable area.  We estimated the   probability of this happening by chance to be just over 3sigma.  This   provides some evidence, but is not convincing enough to call an   observation.  We published this information and declared that we would   continue to watch the region.  When we added a 6th year of   data, the signal became stronger, 4.6sigma, which is encouraging.  If   the signal continues to grow, in a year or two, we should be able to   declare an observation.   A larger detector and more data may enable us   to see structure in this spot (which is currently 20degrees) and  provide  some insight into the sources of UHEC...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
