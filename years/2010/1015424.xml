Introduction: Coral reef habitats are one of the worldÆs most diverse and valuable environments, but currently, over 50% of the worldÆs reefs are suffering from widespread coral die-offs or bleaching (1). In parts of the Indo-Pacific, 30-60% of the species diversity has been lost, while in the Caribbean, over 50% of the coral cover has been lost (1). The main drivers of this decline are anthropogenic, including worldwide changes in sea temperatures and pH and local impacts such as over-fishing, nutrient and toxin runoff, and the introduction of invasive species (1-3) .  Much of the worldÆs surviving coral has been weakened by environmental stressors, leaving it more likely to succumb to mundane natural threats, such as cuts, breaks, and abrasions that can result from storms, dredging, or fish bites (4-7). A wounded coralÆs survival depends on its ability to heal quickly. The vulnerability of weakened corals to death from physical wounds lends urgency to understanding how corals and other cnidarians heal from wounding assaults, and how their healing ability might be compromised by environmental challenges. Pocillopora damicornis is emerging as a valuable sentinel coral species due to it wide distribution and hardiness in lab culture. While in NMMBA in southern Taiwan (summer 2010), I used molecular and organismal approaches to investigate the mechanisms underlying wound-healing in Pocillopora damicornis.  II. Project Outcomes     1) Aim 1: To isolate the transcription factor Grh from the lace coral P. damicornis. A 241bp length portion of the transcription factor, Grainy head was cloned from P. damicornis and this was used to make probes for in situ hybridization.

In situ hybridization were preformed on P. damicornis larval stages. Expression of Grainy head is found in a speckled pattern in late larval stages Pictures were taken on a Zeiss microscope at 40x.  3) Aim 3: To obtain a time course of gene expression following wounding in P. damicornis in order to identify other "wound healing genes" in corals, not all of which can be predicted by homology to triploblastic animals. In order to understand the transcriptomics of wound healing in corals, I developed a time series of wound-healing in adult P. damicornis. Coral nubbins were wounded using a scalpel and than were collected at the time periods of 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours post-wounding.

The facilities at the NMMBA are amazing and so it has been a pleasure to do work there because there is such a huge wealth of resources. The other interesting thing that I learned while living here and working here has been how to communicate with minimal language skills. It has been frustrating at time, and rewarding at others, but it has been a very humbling experience, and I am very happy for it. I am used to being very independent and as an American, I find it very hard to rely on other people, so was really interesting experience to have to rely on other people for help, but it has made me realize that it is possible to do this and in return, I can learn more and trust more. So this has been great for me not only as a scientist, but also as a person.  IV.           ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
