<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding from the NSF EAPSI program allowed me to travel to the University of Canterbury in New Zealand to work with a team of researchers who study a Kenyan jumping spider that feeds on mosquitoes.  This spider is particularly interesting because in past studies, these researchers have found that this species of spider (which is found only in the Lake Victoria region of Kenya), feeds predominantly on mosquitoes in the wild (Weso?owska &amp; Jackson 2003).  Furthermore, they specifically prefer to attack Anopheles mosquitoes over other types of prey; Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are the most important vector of malaria in East Africa and so the fact that these spiders specifically choose to feed on Anopheles means that they could potentially be used as part of a biocontrol program to reduce mosquito numbers (Nelson et al. 2005; Nelson &amp; Jackson 2006).  Even more importantly, when given a choice between mosquitoes that have previously fed on blood and those that have not, these spiders prefer to feed on blood-fed mosquitoes (Jackson et al. 2005), again making them potentially important in the control of malaria.                   One of my contributions to this ongoing research was to help figure out how these spiders are able to find blood-filled mosquitoes and distinguish them from mosquitoes that had not previously fed on blood.  Previous studies showed that they could identify blood-filled mosquitoes using sight alone (Jackson et al. 2005).  After feeding on blood, a mosquitoÆs abdomen becomes bright red.  The goal of the study was to test the hypothesis that these spiders were specifically using the color red to locate blood-filled mosquitoes.  To do this, we used spectrophotometry to objectively measure the color of natural mosquito abdomens after they fed on blood.  Then we used this data to create animations of Anopheles mosquitoes that reflect light in the same way that blood-filled mosquitoes do (i.e., they are exactly the same color).  When my collaborators return to Kenya during their next field season, they will show these "virtual mosquitoes" to the spiders to determine how color affects their prey choices.  The benefit of using "virtual prey" is that we can create carefully controlled experiments and modify the colors of the mosquitoes in various ways to see how this affects the spidersÆ food choices.                        Another of my contributions to the project was to see how food choice and mate choices are related.  We know from previous studies that males and females court each other with elaborate dances (Cross et al. 2008) and that both sight and smell are important in their mating decisions (Cross et al. 2007; Cross &amp; Jackson 2009).  Males of this species have bright faces which they display to females during courtship (Cross et al. 2008).  We are in the process of testing the hypothesis that females are attracted to the maleÆs red face because it mimics the color of a blood-filled mosquito.  I worked on methods to manipulate the colors of maleÆs faces so that we can determine if a femaleÆs preference for red mosquitoes is related to her preference for red mates.  Again, the experiments using these methods will be conducted when my collaborators return to Kenya during the next field season.                   The results of these studies will help us better understand the prey choices and reproductive choices that these spiders make, both of which have implications for how they might best be used in potential biocontrol programs.  Funding from the EAPSI program gave me an opportunity to start this collaboration with these researchers and we are currently applying for additional funding to continue this collaboration for several more years.
