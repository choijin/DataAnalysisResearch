<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;Program of the Chemistry Division, Profs. Robert L. Vold and Gina Hoatson from the&lt;br/&gt;College of William and Mary and their graduate and undergraduate student colleagues&lt;br/&gt;will develop realistic models for simulating slow molecular motion, apply them to new&lt;br/&gt;types of nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, and make the modeling and data&lt;br/&gt;fitting procedures easily accessible and freely available to the general scientific&lt;br/&gt;community. On line documentation, to be developed as part of this project, will include&lt;br/&gt;tutorials on experimental procedures, illustrated by animated simulations of typical&lt;br/&gt;experiments. This will provide a generally useful teaching tool for introducing students to&lt;br/&gt;practical aspects of spectroscopy, even in situations where expensive, high field&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation is not readily available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work of Prof. Vold, Prof. Hoatson and their research colleagues and&lt;br/&gt;research students will enable scientists to study a broader range of materials, and to&lt;br/&gt;analyze some of the very slow motions that are important in determining such useful&lt;br/&gt;properties as increased sensitivity of ultrasonic detectors. In addition to the broader&lt;br/&gt;scientific impact of the proposed work, the students being trained in this project will be&lt;br/&gt;exposed to unique interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   We have performed Multinuclear Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Magic Angle Spining (MAS NMR) experiments on ferroelectric, piezoelectric and dielectric functional materials.  These are all complex perovskites (structural motif A B O3) and are inherently disordered materials. Substitution of different cations at the B-sites occurs readily and is assumed to be a random distribution.  The presence of (dis)order influences many of their technologically useful physical properties.  We seek to understand the fundamental origin of these behaviours.  Thus we determined the local structure and dynamics of the B-site cations by acquiring and analyzing single pulse and 3Q MAS NMR spectra of Niobium-93 in all these materials.  This has allowed us to determine the NMR parameters (quadrupole coupling constants, asymmetry parameters and isotropic chemicals shifts) for all inequivalent niobium sites. The different resonance frequencies in the NMR spectra are a result of changes in the electric field gradients, produced by distortion from the ideal crystal structure.  We can assign the different Niobium-93 environments to different  nearest neighbor B-site configurations.  The role of cation dynamics was investigated using Lithium-7 relaxation behavior as a function of temperature and magnetic field (7 and 17.6 Tesla).  Surprisingly, the relaxation seems to be dominated by spin diffusion to paramagnetic centers, and we are collaborating with an Electron Spin Resonance group to try to identify the defect(s).  Another major outcome of this research was the improvement of the scope, applicability and computational efficiency of our MATLAB-based simulation code, EXPRESS. Our EXPRESS software is now a user-extendable, pedagogically useful tool for quantitative investigations of molecular or ion motion.  We simulate the effects of complex ion or molecular motion on solid state NMR powder line NMR spectra and relaxation times.  Originally the program was written for static deuteron NMR, we have extended it to include MAS Spectra and spin relaxation behavior of deuterons. In addition we have extended it to calculate MAS spectral and relaxation in the the vastly more complex half integer nuclei. This was necessary to interpret our results in functional materials. We have optimized the least squares procedures for determining best-fit models, including for multicomponent spectra. Significant progress has been made by the theoretical and experimental validation of the simulations. Many of the extended capabilities of the software have been annotated, which is important since the software is available online and used by research groups around the world.
