<AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial support for young physicists to attend either of the two sequential 45th  Rencontres de Moriond conferences to be held in La Thuile, Italy: (1) Electroweak Interactions and Unified Theories (March 6-13, 2010) and (2) QCD and High Energy Hadronic Interactions (March 13-20, 2010). Moriond meetings in 2010 are transitional since increasing importance will be placed on the preparation for the LHC physics and commissioning of the detectors, in which the U.S. scientists play a major role. With both experiments being in the full commissioning mode with the first LHC beam data and vast amount of cosmics collected with the fully operational detectors in their underground experimental halls, one expects an increased number of LHC talks at the 2010 Moriond conference. Consequently, the 2010 Moriond remains a unique and excellent opportunity to both advertise the impressive US science program in particle physics and at the same time to give our most talented young scientists extra visibility by allowing them to deliver their latest results at these two major European fora. Special efforts will be made to encourage women and minorities to participate.</AbstractNarration>

Due partly to late NSF notification, many of the US participants for 2010 Moriond conferences already had their fundings arranged from other sources.

Altogether, fourteen young US HE were provided partial subsidies over a two-year period.  It has been a success in encouraging and supporting US HE physicists to continue to participate in these annual meetings. All US presentations were well received, and quoted liberally in both the theory and the experimental summary talks.

In summary, we emphaisize that this award has helped to maintain a strong US presence at these international HE physics conferences by having a continuing group of active physicists coming on an annual basis.
