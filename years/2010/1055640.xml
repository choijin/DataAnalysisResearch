<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to mitigate damage and to enhance the robustness and functionality of reinforced concrete bridges subjected to moderate-to-strong earthquakes and their aftershocks. For damage-control, the project will investigate the application of a new concrete confinement technology utilizing the shape memory alloys (SMAs) as the transverse reinforcement.  This new technology capitalizes on the concept of active confinement. The research activities planned for this project include: (1) Conducting multi-axial monotonic and cyclic tests on concrete elements confined with the new reinforcement. (2) Developing general 3-dimensional plasticity model for concrete confined with SMA reinforcement with enhanced damage prediction feature. (3) Examining the durability and long-term performance of SMA reinforcement through laboratory tests and field tests conducted on real bridges in Illinois. (4) Developing models for realistic seismic hazard scenarios comprising moderate-to-strong main shock followed by a series of aftershocks. (5) Conducting seismic damage analyses to develop fragility curves for bridges reinforced with the new technology. (6) Conducting confirmatory hybrid simulation tests on reduced-scale reinforced concrete bridge piers strengthened with the new confinement technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide the earthquake engineering community with critical, in-depth, information about the new confinement technology. It will address the modeling, durability, and design issues that are crucial for this technology to reach its full potential in delivering immediate solutions to the problems of post-earthquake functionality, down time, and repair costs of critical lifeline bridges. The results of this project will be directly disseminated to the graduate and senior level civil engineering students through two graduate level concrete design courses taught at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. To encourage and promote the involvement of K-12 students from underrepresented groups in the field of Civil Engineering, a part of this award will be directed to organize an annual summer camp for female high school students. To increase the awareness of this new technology among the practicing bridge engineers, the PI will organize a workshop to disseminate the project results to this group of engineers. The project will also promote the new hybrid simulation testing technique used in this project to the seismic research community. Finally, this project will also increase the awareness among the research and practitioner communities about the impacts of strong earthquake aftershocks on the design of civil engineering structures.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) proposal focused on mitigating post-earthquake damage and enhancing the robustness and functionality of reinforced concrete (RC) bridges during and after severe main shock-aftershock events. The project investigated in depth the application of a new concrete active confinement technology for damage-control using thermally prestressed shape memory alloy (SMA) spirals. The spirals were investigated as a retrofit and emergency repair measures for RC bridge columns designed according to old seismic provisions (lack sufficient transverse reinforcement). The project comprised of a mix of analytical, numerical, and experimental tasks. The primary outcomes of the project are: 1) Understand the behavior of concrete when confined with SMAs and compare it with other conventional confinement materials like steel and fiber reinforced polymer composites. This was accomplished through a series of small-scale material tests and large-scale column tests conducted under both quasit-static and dynamic loadings. 2) Characterize the thermomechanical behavior of NiTiNb and FeNiCoTi as two potential alloys for the new application. On one hand, the NiTiNb, which is commercially available and more well understood compared to the FeNiCoTi alloy was subjected to the unprecedented thermomechanical tests to examine the response of the already prestressed alloy under various ranges of ambient temperature that are pertinent to civil structures. On the other hand, a new thermomechanical treatment protocol was established for the new FeNiCoTi alloy to optimize its behavior for the new application. 3) Develop analytical model that can be used to describe the behavior of concrete confined with SMAs. A 3D plasticity-based model was developed and calibrated/validated using experimental test results. The model was implemented in the finite element software OpenSees and used in bridge system analysis. 4) Understand the impact of retrofitting of vulnerable bridge piers with SMAs on the overall behavior of the bridge including other components (e.g. abutments, expansion joints, etc.). This was achieved through developing a implementing a new hybrid simulation framework for analyzing bridge systems with SMA spirals. The new framework is called Material Testing Integrated (MTI) simulation. It can be used to link the physical (experimental) response of SMA confined concrete with the entire bridge system. &nbsp;5) Describe and predict the long-term behavior of the new confinement technology under harsh environmental conditions. A series of accelerated aging testing protocols were carried out followed by thermomechanical tests on SMA specimens. These tests shed the light on the level of residual prestress in the SMA after being subjected to harsh corrosive environment. 6) Develop design guidelines for the new confinement technique. This task was achieved through developing probabilistic-based demand models for RC columns retrofitted using SMA spirals. The models can be used to determine the amount of SMA needed to achieve a specific target performance level under earthquake loading. This research resulted in three Ph.D. dissertations and one MS thesis. The findings of this project were disseminated in several peer-reviewed journal papers and conference proceedings. &nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/10/2018<br>      Modified by: Bassem&nbsp;Andrawes</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
