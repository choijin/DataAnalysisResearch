<AbstractNarration>This project covers a research program of fundamental importance for our understanding of the structure of matter and the origin of mass.  The focus is on experimental investigations of hadron structure through exclusive production and detection of a single meson or photon.  Such processes allow us to gain both a quantitative description and a visualization (tomographic image) of the behavior of strongly interacting systems.  This is achieved through the language of Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), which can be measured in a regime where the hard scattering of the probe on a single quark can be factorized from the residual soft interaction that carries the information about the GPDs.  Thus, tests of factorization in the kinematics of Jefferson Lab, both today and after the 12 GeV energy upgrade, are essential for the interpretation of GPD data, and in turn for our understanding of nucleon structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participation of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students is an integral part of the project, providing young scientists with opportunities to further their training and education.  These will include learning nuclear physics concepts, getting hands-on experience in development of hardware and software, as well as participating in and contributing to cutting edge experiments at a major national laboratory, providing exposure to a broad international scientific community.  The PI has considerable experience working with minority students, and by providing a female role model, she could encourage women to pursue advanced studies in physics.</AbstractNarration>

The 12 GeV upgrade at Jefferson Lab and this project are an integral part of the efforts by the US nuclear physics community to advance this knowledge. An important aspect in this effort is probing the valence quark structure of strongly interacting systems to determine whether QCD (Quantum Chromo-Dynamics), the theory believed to describe strong interactions, gives a full and complete description of strongly interacting systems. An important goal is thus to map out the transverse spatial structure of the valence quarks and gluons through the Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). Experimentally, this relies on the asymptotic freedom of QCD, allowing the hard, short-distance interaction of the experimental probe (photon) with one parton (quark) to be unambiguously separated from the residual soft interaction of the struck parton with the rest of the hadron, containing the long distance information about nucleon structure described by the GPDs. In a kinematic regime where hard-soft factorization applies, exclusive measurements of a photon or meson originating from the struck parton can be used to create a tomographic image of the nucleon. Research carried out under this award produced customized equipment and data analysis results important for probing the transverse spatial structure of hadrons and will be essential for carrying out experiments addressing these scientific goals at the 12 GeV Jefferson Lab.
