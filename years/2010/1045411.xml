The workshop was organized jointly by the University of Colorado, Denver (CO, USA) and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU; Hong Kong) and was held in December 2010 on the HKPU campus.

The scale and the different experiments being conducted in transportation systems. The workshop participants noted that much more research was needed to measure the efficiency of urban mixed-design and mass-transit connectivity.  4.Industrial Symbiosis. Exchange of waste materials between industries was pointed out as an extremely innovative strategy for reducing energy use in the industrial sector. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
