<AbstractNarration>Simple contagion processes underlie various phenomena on complex networks, such as the spread of diseases on social-contact networks and information in communication networks; understanding their dynamics and developing control mechanisms are key issues in numerous applications. The goals of this proposal are: (i) Developing methods to construct synthetic relational networks using partial and noisy data; (ii) Understanding the structure of these networks and the contagion processes, and especially important network properties and typical patterns that have an impact on the dynamics of contagion; (iii) Developing techniques to control the spread of contagion processes, and to detect, prevent and arrest cascading failures in coupled socio-technical networks; and (iv) Understanding the co-evolution between the networks and dynamics, and using this to refine their models, and the strategies to control them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project's significant outcomes can be broken down into three major areas: 1) scientific teams, 2) virtual worlds, and 3) social media.  1) Scientific Teams  Our study of how interdisciplinary scientific research teams assemble shows that individualsÆ likelihood to collaborate on a grant proposal is higher among those with longer tenure, lower institutional tier, lower H-index, and higher levels of prior co-authorship and citation relationships. Successful proposals, however, have slightly different relational patterns. IndividualsÆ likelihood of collaboration is higher among those who are female, with a lower institutional tier, lower H-index, and higher levels of prior co-authorship, but with lower levels of prior citation relationships.  In another study we examined the influence of different types of diversity on the creation of innovative ideas in the field of oncofertility. We found that innovation benefits from both homophily and diversity in a team. Homophily in country of residence and working with prior collaborators help reduce uncertainty in the interactions associated with innovation, while diversity in knowledge enables the recombinant knowledge required for innovation.  A third study found that researchersÆ attributes (gender, seniority and experience), dyadic bibliographic information (co-authorship and citation relations), and network structures (degree distribution and network transitivity) predict team collaboration. By comparing three prediction techniques traditionally used in the literature, we evaluated the prediction power of the p* method and proposed a new way to recommend potential collaborators and teams for academic researchers.  In a fourth study, we examined the heterogeneous networks of keywords, articles, and authors of publications in PubMed. As a result, we produced better algorithms to extract the semantic similarity among the keywords and documents.  We developed a tool called My Dream Team (a recommender system for team assembly), and used it to conduct experiments in classrooms. One study of 95 students participating in a semester-long class project showed that students using the tool are less likely to team up with others whom are dissimilar in age, and are less likely to team up with people whom are disparate on intercultural sensitivity. On the other hand, gender homophily, a main factor in social relation driven team formation, was not significant.   2) Virtual Worlds  We explored the relative influence of individual and network-level effects on the emergence of online social relationships inside the virtual world Second Life. The integrated individual and network-level model of online social relationship formation showed that time spent online and the network pressure toward balance (e.g. friend-of-friend) predict the emergence of online relationship ties, while gender, age, proximity, homophily (people with similar traits), and preferential attachment are not significant predictors within the observed networks.  We constructed a comprehensive database fir six Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG), and used social network analysis to examine behavior and interactions. In EverQuest II, we tested the influence of physical distance and offline homophily. Our results show that spatial proximity, temporal proximity, and age homophily have a strong impact on players' behavior in creating online relations. Also in EverQuest II, we compared individual behaviors and network positionality using different statistical models. The results show that both individual factors and network effects predict quitting behavior.  In Dragon's Nest, the data exploration and user interviews suggest that design mechanisms of games can change the motivation of interactions and shape the patterns of team collaboration.  Our analysis of head to head competitions in Dota 2 found that relative skill measures are important to win quickly. Additionally, this research shows that friendship relat...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
