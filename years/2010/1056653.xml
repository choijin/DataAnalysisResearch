<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Understanding and controlling self-assembly is crucial for engineering advanced materials from nanoscale precursors. Magnetotactic bacteria, which navigate in the earth?s magnetic field using magnetically-coupled chains of iron oxide nanoparticles, have inspired this project. The objective of this CAREER award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program (SSMC), is to demonstrate and understand the magnetic field-driven self-assembly of magnetic and multifunctional nanoparticles into chains in bulk matrices, and to measure and understand the novel structures and magnetic, optical, mechanical, and electrical properties of these nanostructured composites. Magnetic field-driven self-assembly of nanoparticles in bulk matrices is a largely unexplored area, which has potential to arrange chains in three-dimensional arrays with tunable spacing without using a template. The concept of magnetic field-driven self-assembly is of broad significance: Chains of multifunctional nanoparticles can also be assembled if one component is magnetic. This research project and related topics will be integrated into the PI?s Introduction to Nanomaterials course and into a nanoscience and nanotechnology lab course that he is developing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;There is a great need to develop methods to fabricate macroscopic, three-dimensional composites with precisely controlled structures. The research component of this CAREER award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program (SSMC), is an investigation of how applying magnetic fields causes magnetic nanoparticles to form chains with uniform dimensions and spacing.  An understanding of the influence of the make-up of the nanoparticle and the strength of the magnetic field on the formation of these new structures will be useful for developing methods to control precisely the assembly of nanoparticles and for the fabrication of new composite materials.  Interactions among the assembled nanoparticles and with the surrounding matrix are expected to give rise to novel properties that are potentially useful for diverse applications. In the outreach component of this award, the PI will develop a Nanotechnology Outreach Program (NOP) in collaboration with a professor of education and a high school teacher. The NOP will include visits by the PI and students to surrounding high school classes to give demonstrations and lectures on nanotechnology and teacher workshops arranged through school districts that will introduce the concepts of nanotechnology and will include materials that could be used in teachers? lesson plans.</AbstractNarration>

Significant advances in the synthesis and characterization of gold nanorods include the following:  (1) A large-scale synthesis of gold nanorods was developed, wherein small gold nanorods are used for seeded growth of larger gold nanorods.  During the secondary growth step, the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance of the gold nanorods can be tuned between 700 nm and 880 nm.  (2) A large-scale method was developed for depositing silica shells onto gold nanorods with controlled thicknesses (2&ndash;20 nm).  The placement of the silica can be controlled between uniform shells and lobed structures on the ends of the nanorods.  We have obtained similar results for the morphologically controlled deposition of silica shells onto CdSe/CdS quantum dot nanorods.  (3) A study of the heating of silica-coated gold nanorods showed that the silica shells enhance the stability of the rod shape to higher temperatures than for uncoated gold nanorods.  (4) A simple approach, heteroaggregation, was developed for depositing presynthesized iron oxide nanoparticles onto the surfaces of silica-coated gold nanorods.  Adjusting the solution conditions caused iron oxide nanoparticles to attach to the surfaces of silica-coated gold nanorods.  The composite core/satellite nanoparticles retain their distinct surface plasmon resonance and respond to magnetic fields.  (5) Wavelength-selective photothermal triggering of shape recovery of shape memory polymers with embedded gold nanorods was demonstrated, where spectral overlap of the wavelength of light-emitting diodes with the surface plasmon resonance of gold nanorods determined whether heating and shape recovery would occur.  Magnetic field-directed self-assembly of magnetic nanoparticles and microparticles was investigated to better understand the process of assembly into chains in homogeneous magnetic fields and the torques generated from dipolar coupling of particles within the chains:  (1) Iron oxide nanoparticles dispersed in a liquid monomer formed chains when placed in a uniform magnetic field.  Thermal curing of the polymer preserved the chains after removal of the magnetic field.  Dipolar coupling among the chained nanoparticles generated magnetic anisotropy that caused easier magnetization parallel to the chain axis and harder magnetization perpendicular to the chain axis.  (2) Chains of iron oxide nanoparticles dispersed in elastomer thin films through solvent casting exhibited selective and directional actuation.  A model was developed to predict and understand the lifting behavior of a cantilever of the composite in an applied magnetic field.  (3) Chains of iron microparticles were solvent cast into elastomer films and formed into magnetically actuated lifters, accordions, valves, and pumps.  A figure of merit was developed, the specific torque, the torque per mass per magnetic field strength, for quantifying the performance of actuators based on magnetic torque.  A broader impact of the research is methods for synthesizing gold nanorods, silica-overcoated gold nanorods, and silica-overcoated gold nanorods with iron oxide nanoparticles deposited on their surfaces.  These materials are of interest for numerous applications, including optical materials, diagnostics, biomedical imaging, cancer therapy, catalysis, and soft robotics.  One patent and another pending patent application resulted from this grant, which have been licensed by a start-up company.  Materials containing chained magnetic particles are of interest for soft robotics, for controlling the microstructure of composite materials, and for optical materials.  This grant supported several graduate and undergraduate students, who are working in industry, at national laboratories, or conducting graduate or postdoctoral studies.  Numerous education and outreach activities were performed to engage K-12 students, teachers, and the public with nanoscience and nanotechnology.  We regularly participated in NanoDays at NC State, the NC Science Festival, Taste of Engineering at NC State, and outreach visits to Carroll Middle School.  Tracy and his students served as instructors for Materials Camp, a residential summer camp for high school students at NC State.  Tracy gave presentations on nanoscience and nanotechnology through a summer Research Experience for Teachers program and at the Professional Development Institute of the North Carolina Science Teachers Association.
