<AbstractNarration>The role of aerosols in climate forcing is significant but poorly understood. The primary goals of this project are to (1) develop unique high-time-resolution, millennial-scale records of biomass burning, dust, volcanic, industrial pollution, and sea salt aerosols for two ice core sites inside the Arctic polar dome and (2) use new and leveraged general circulation models (GCM) and other modeling to interpret these and similar ice core records from outside the polar dome to better understand source regions and transport pathways of aerosols to different regions of the Arctic and their climatic and environmental impacts. Measurements of &gt;35 elemental and chemical components of these aerosols will be made at high depth resolution (&gt;50 measurements per year) in archived ice cores from two lower elevation sites on opposite sides of the Arctic: a 430 m core collected by the University of Copenhagen in 2006 from Flade Isblink ice cap in far northeastern Greenland and a 724 m core collected by the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in 1999 to 2001 from Akademii Nauk ice cap in the Russian Arctic. The measurements build on recently published findings from similar analyses in shallower ice cores. Flade Isblink will provide a &gt;3500 year record of aerosols in the lower troposphere in the North Atlantic sector of the Arctic Ocean -- a region particularly sensitive to changes in Arctic sea ice -- while Akademii Nauk will provide a &gt; 3000 year record of past aerosols in northern Eurasia, as well as dust and pollutants from eastern Asia. By extending instrumental records to recent centuries and millennia, this new generation of ice core records, coupled with model simulations, will transform understanding of recent and late Holocene changes in hemispheric atmospheric circulation, aerosol transport across the polar front, and feedbacks between climate and aerosols.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Aerosol particles exert a net cooling effect on global climate, but their impact on the Arctic environment may be a warming effect, due the high reflectivity and vulnerability of this region to increases in solar energy absorption.  Understanding the sources and transport pathways of aerosols in the Arctic is therefore important for determining climate impacts associated with emissions of different types of aerosols from different regions.  Outcomes from this project, communicated in several publications, relate to three aspects of improved understanding of aerosols in the Arctic.   First, an effort led by a graduate student funded on this project evaluated the distributions of black carbon in snow throughout the Arctic, as simulated by more than a dozen different global aerosol models.  Black carbon is an aerosol constituent that accounts for most of the light absorption by aerosol particles, and hence it is the primary source of warming by anthropogenic aerosols.  Knowledge of the spatial distribution of model biases informs on regions where aerosol emission inventories may be biased, or where model transport processes are poorly simulated.  This study found that models generally underestimate black carbon concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating black carbon amounts elsewhere in the Arctic.  Moreover, the residence time of black carbon in the Arctic atmosphere was found to range substantially (from 4 to 23 days) across models.  This led to the conclusion that atmospheric aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance.  Finally, after applying corrections to models based on their biases with respect to measurements, this study derived a multi-model mean estimate of the Arctic radiative forcing caused by black carbon in snow of 0.17 W/m2 (Figure 1).  This estimate implies that snow-deposited black carbon is a non-negligible source of warming in the Arctic.  Second, we conducted modeling studies to help elucidate the relative climate impacts of black carbon located at different vertical levels in the Arctic atmosphere.   This is important because pollution emitted from different regions enters the Arctic through different transport pathways.  For example, emissions from East Asia are more likely to enter the Arctic at high altitude, whereas European emissions are more likely to enter at low altitude and deposit to Arctic snow and ice surfaces.  We found in this study that black carbon residing in the lower Arctic atmosphere and within snow and ice causes very strong local warming, per unit mass of black carbon, because of feedbacks associated with sea-ice coverage, atmospheric water vapor content, and low cloud amount (Figure 2a).  Black carbon residing in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere of the Arctic, however, may actually cool the surface despite enhancing solar heating of the atmosphere (Figure 2b). This occurs because high-altitude black carbon reduces surface insolation, increases atmospheric stability and low-cloud cover, and reduces the poleward heat flux into the Arctic.  This study implies that Arctic climate impacts from different black carbon sources may be very different from one another, even if they exert a similar influence on the Arctic top-of-atmosphere energy budget.  For example, local shipping sources that emit black carbon directly into the Arctic boundary layer may be expected to exert a strong warming effect per unit of emission.  Third, we have developed an algorithm to identify the location of the Arctic polar dome in global model and re-analysis data, and we have utilized this algorithm to identify how changing wind and precipitation patterns in a warming world contribute to changes in aerosol transport efficiency to the Arctic.   The polar dome is an important dynamical feature that acts as a barrier to transport between the mid-latitudes and Arctic.  We found in this study that, with climate warming, the winter positio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
