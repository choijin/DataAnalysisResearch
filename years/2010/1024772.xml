<AbstractNarration>Decadal prediction focuses on time-evolving regional climate conditions over the next ten to thirty years with the focus on understanding how quickly the climate is changing and where the key changes will occur. Numerous assessments of climate information user needs have identified this timescale as being important to infrastructure planners, water resource managers, and many others. The ultimate task of climate science is to understand climate variations from realistic mathematical models and from data of atmospheric, oceanic, and satellite observations. Ocean and atmosphere circulations -- linked by the sea surface temperature(SST) -- are integral factors affecting the evolution of climate and a multitude of climate phenomena, such as the greenhouse effect, the polar ice cap melting, and global rainfall pattern changes. These phenomena in turn have implications in forming energy and national safety policies.  The theoretical basis for such an investigation is far from complete. Our approach is to combine the information from the observations with the dynamics of coupled system in order to design an adaptive data ssimilation and initialization method that captures the complexity of Earth's climate and leads to reliable predictions. The main outcome of the proposal will be a theoretically sound basis for probabilistic climate prediction that will lead to the understanding Earth's climate system and the prediction of decadal climate variability. Our approach will be a cross-disciplinary one, spanning the spectrum from modeling and novel analytical techniques to numerical verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this grant we will foster intensive training of engineering and applied mathematics undergraduate students, developing their motivation to pursue graduate studies in this multidisciplinary area. The educational broader impacts include the cross-disciplinary collaboration and training of graduate students. An integral part of the final outcome of the roposed work will be web-based simulators to be used in senior undergraduate and graduate courses and to provide the community a predictive tool that will enhance visual understanding of the effect of noise on climate models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Climate prediction is an important and difficult question to address. Climate change, such as raising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns might have serious consequences in many aspects of human life, ranging from agriculture (crop yields) to public health (epidemic outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria). Climate models cannot rely on initial conditions, as those cannot be accessed. Instead, probability density functions that describe the initial states are available and model states must be treated as realizations of random variables.  The aim of this completed project is the generation of efficient new algorithms that estimate and present and future state of climate models, based on observations that might be partial, distorted or corrupted. Specifically, while exact determination of the state is impossible under noisy observations, the objective is to obtain probabilistic estimates of the state conditioned on the available information.  A crucial step in such an analysis is to obtain a set of measurement points that leads to the largest reduction in entropy of certain random variables that are relevant in the model. In this project, we continuously extract information along the motion of the mobile sensors and determine the steering commands of the sensor platforms (UAVs, gliders, AUVs, and remote sensing). The goal is to determine an optimal path that maximizes the information gain. We achieve this by performing a sensor management scheme in the update step of the nonlinear filtering algorithm for a multi-sensor system. Our focus is on controlling the sensor platforms such that they maneuver to make observations that reduce the uncertainty efficiently.    This project dealt with the theoretical aspect in the development of reduced-dimension nonlinear filters for multiscale systems. The purpose of this project was to formulate and develop, with mathematical rigor, efficient and robust methods to produce "data enhanced" lower - dimensional models, nonlinear filters in pattern recognition and change detection for the Earth Climate System. In these problems, the stochasticity represents either physical stochastic forcing or unresolved micro-scale effects. In addition, stochastic perturbations that take into consideration the unmodeled dynamics are efficient substitutes for the effects of fast modes of a numerically demanding large simulation model. Stochastic excitations affect these systems in a profound way, and the presence of stochastic forcing can lead to a host of undesirable effects. Stochastic forcing is therefore likely to have a significant influence on the ocean circulation.   Major project activities and findings include:   The  completion of the  analytical development of a reduced-order particle filtering method for high-dimensional, multiscale  random dynamical systems.   The  application  of the particle filtering method to a high-dimensional, multiscale, chaotic system and comparison with existing techniques.   The  numerical  simulation of a large-scale ocean circulation model.     Optimal  sensor placement.     This project also had an educational and academic outreach component. Specifically, one Ph.D student and one MS student were fully funded by this project and two more students who are involved in the research are pursuing their graduate studies. Results from the development of the reduced-order particle filtering technique for high-dimensional, multi-timescale systems have been presented at several conferences and the results have been disseminated in journal and conference publications.
