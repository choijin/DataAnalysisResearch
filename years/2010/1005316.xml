<AbstractNarration>The effects of mineral dust acting as both cloud condensation and ice nuclei within organized convective cloud systems over the tropical Atlantic basin will be investigated through a combination of observational analysis and numerical simulations.  Idealized simulations will be conducted using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) to further examine dust aerosol impacts on tropical convective clouds and precipitation are to be guided by observations collected during NAMMA, NASA's African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Activities project, conducted during the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. The lifecycle of an actual storm (Tropical Storm Debby), which was apparently influenced by ingestion of Saharan dust over the eastern Atlantic, will be simulated in detail.  The dynamical and radiative impacts of the Saharan Air Layer (SAL, which carries dust westward from Africa) will be studied, and the relative importance of direct and indirect aerosol effects as well as environmental influences of the SAL itself--including humidity, temperature and vertical wind shear--will be assessed.  Observations of aged dust reaching the far western Atlantic upon deep convective clouds in that region will be examined using additional observations from the NSF-supported PREDICT (Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud-systems in the Tropics) experiment in 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this effort centers on improved understanding of cloud processes (and in particular cloud and precipitation microphysics) in the presence of influences by dust and other aerosols originating over distant continental regions, and determination of the extent to which these influences may favor or disfavor tropical storm and hurricane formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts will come through support of two principal investigators drawn from an underrepresented group (viz. women in the atmospheric sciences), through a combination of university training and field experience for a graduate student, and ultimately through improved ability to anticipate dust-induced changes in tropical storm formation and/or intensity key to accurate forecasts of Atlantic basin hurricanes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Throughout the year, vast quantities of soil-dust particles embedded in the dry Saharan Air Layer travel from Africa westward over the tropical Atlantic Ocean. These particles can act to seed droplets and ice crystals in tropical storms that form over the Atlantic, and may develop into hurricanes.  Through these microphysical changes, particles can influence how strong and deep storms are, how much they rain, how long they last, and how they absorb heat and scatter light.

In simulations of idealized tropical convective storms, the addition of dust particles that can form both liquid and ice particles helped to invigorate the storm at low to mid-levels compared to a clean maritime environment. When dust aerosols[Sv1]  were only allowed to form ice particles, the invigoration was concentrated higher in the clouds where heterogeneous ice nucleation was most prominent. In the idealized tropical cyclone simulations it was found that dust particles caused the storm intensity to increase (stronger tangential winds, lower surface pressures) and storm size to decrease when the dust penetrated to the core of the storm. Also, in the Tropical Storm Debby simulation, the track and characteristics of the storm were better reproduced when dust particles were included. The idealized and Tropical Storm Debby simulations conducted provided training for a graduate student, and will form part of his PhD dissertation.     Clouds sampled by aircraft over the Atlantic near Africa were analyzed for dust concentrations. It was found that dust was present in liquid drops and was the most common particle type in high-level ice crystals.

This is consistent with the model results only when dust forms both liquid drops and ice crystals in simulations.     Other particle types in the atmosphere that can efficiently initiate ice formation in clouds are biological particles, such as bacteria and fungi. These particles sometimes co-exist with dust particles, but not much is known about their abundance in the atmosphere above ground-level.  New instrumentation was tested on an aircraft to sample these particle types at different altitudes and in clouds over the U.S. Central Plains. This provided important validation of the instrument, as well as hands-on training for a graduate student. Results showed that concentrations of biological particles were quite low, but non-negligible, above the atmospheric boundary layer in this region.
