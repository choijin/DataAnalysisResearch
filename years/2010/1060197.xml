<AbstractNarration>This project proposes to support transfer students from community colleges to the University of South Alabama. Their plan will stimulate enrollment, enhance retention in engineering programs at the University, and increase the technical work force in the Mobile area. The targeted community colleges have large minority populations and many first generation students.  The intellectual merit of this project addresses financial barriers of minority community college students by providing fourteen new scholarships each year to students from area community colleges.  The students will be placed in learning communities and provided with faculty and student mentors and academic support systems.  Broader impact is anticipated in that one half of the scholarships will be targeted for underrepresented minority students, assuring an increase in the number of ethnic minorities and females entering the STEM workforce.  Participants will interact with K-12 students, broadening the impact of the program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ USA-LINK is a comprehensive program for transfer students, using a community-building model. Seventy-six students were awarded $6,000 annual scholarships. An Academic Success Seminar was created to familiarize students with university resources, academic success skills, and engineering productivity tools such as Excel. Faculty/student mentor triads assisted in the transfer process, providing opportunities for direct interactions with faculty and upper-class students.   USA-LINK has significantly impacted the transfer student population:  The number of transfer students enrolling in engineering at USA has increased 15 % from 96 in Fall 2010 to 110 in Fall 2015.  Underrepresented populations were awarded 47% of scholarships 72 % of the first two LINK cohorts graduated with engineering degrees in 3 years, compared to a 38% 4-year graduation rate for all engineering transfer students.      Results  The USA-LINK program has been highly successful in recruiting transfer students, with special attention to underrepresented populations. In particular, female engineering students make up 40% of the LINK scholars. Transfer student enrollment in engineering has increased 50%, from 96 new students in 2010 to 144 new students in 2014.   USA-LINK has also been extremely successful in retaining transfer students in engineering (80% versus 50% for a comparable group of transfer students).  Table 1 compares the LINK scholars (with entering GPAs &gt; 3.2) to a comparable group of entering transfer students. The transfer GPAs are not significantly different for the two groups.  However, a difference is observed in the GPA and the hours earned in the first semester at USA.   A striking difference is the number of non USA-LINK scholars who have left the university, more than one-third, compared to 11% of the USA-LINK students.     Table 1.  LINK Scholar Performance     The average participant GPA for the first semester increased from 3.01 the first year to 3.46 in 2015, in part due to better advising for the students.  The students who remain in the program are doing very well academically.  (For fall 2015, 27 of the 36 Scholars had GPAs &gt;3.0); 25 have been invited to become members of the engineering honor society, Tau Beta Pi.  The combination of program activities &ndash; scholarships, seminar, mentor triads, advising &ndash; has been very successful, increasing the retention and graduation rate of engineering transfer students.  These successes have been addressed in conference publications.  Lessons Learned  Important lessons have been learned during the program. Transfer students often have significant financial issues; the stipend for the LINK scholars is a partial solution.   The community-building Academic Success Seminar is a major contributor to the increased retention of LINK Scholars.  Enhanced, invasive advising also contributes to higher retention of the LINK scholars.  Each engineering department has identified an advisor, who is especially knowledgeable about transfer curricula, to assist the Scholars in developing a plan to graduate in three years.  Enrolling in a reduced number of hours the first semester lessens difficulties associated with the transition process.  LINK scholars also contract to report changes in personal circumstances, so advisors can address issues that often hinder transfer student success.  USA-LINK has had a lasting affect on the culture of the college and the university.  The university has increased the number and award amount of transfer student scholarships.  The Academic Success Seminar is an elective course for transfer students.  Major changes have been made to advising procedures. The college annually meets with community college personnel to articulate the successful transition of their students to the university.
