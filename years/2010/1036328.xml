<AbstractNarration>The project builds on the synergy among creativity, self-regulated leaning, and motivation, and presents a new holistic conceptual framework of Self-Regulated Learning and Creative Problem Solving (SRL-CPS). The SRL-CPS conceptual framework is defined as learning and problem-solving processes and involves self-monitoring and self-correction of the following three common aspects: motivation, metacognition, and strategic action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will test the following hypotheses: (1) Problem-based Service Learning (PBSL) using engineering design as pedagogy could promote students' awareness of and demands for cognitive and metacognitive knowledge and strategies in self-regulated learning and creativity. (2) Scaffolding Creative Problem Solving in PBSL using question prompts could better facilitate under-served minority students' creative learning. The research will measure and compare the changes in students' academic dispositions, such as creativity, self-efficacy, problem solving skills, under the different proposed instructional scaffolding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Univ 100 Community Service Learning is required course at Jackson State University for all freshmen and will serve as the environment for the SRL-CPS study. The project will arrange student participants in Univ 100 into project teams for their service learning project. The scaffolding will be provided to students in the form of question prompts in various conditions as different intervention in the research design. The question prompts are categorized as metacognitive prompts, procedural prompts, elaboration prompts, and reflective prompts. The impact of different interventions will be determined by comparing the data from each scaffolding intervention group with the control group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to impact the creativity and problem solving skills of students from underrepresented populations. Further, this project is designed to bolster these students' perceptions of themselves as engineers and innovators. A working model for preparing students to be creative and innovation may result that is theory-driven and may be applicable in other disciplinary fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is to examine effectiveness of the proposed scaffolding for creative problem solving through community service learning on students' learning dispositions and outcomes. The participants were freshmen taking a general entry course that requires the community service at Jackson State University (JSU). As a part of course assignments, students were required to identify the problem at their community service sites and develop innovative solutions, and reflect their community service learning processes. The scaffolding was provided as additional course instructions in form of question prompts delivered through three different methods - traditional lecture, online learning, and online learning with e-mailed prompts.  All participants were randomly assigned into four-member teams and all teams were randomly assigned into four different groups. There is the control group, in which students were not provided with the scaffolding. Among three intervention groups, students received the scaffolding through three different delivery methods. The research findings are based on data collected from students' self-report surveys, learning journals and project reports, and their GPAs, as well as the follow-up interview at least one semester later.  Students' self-report surveys indicate that the intervention groups may outperform the control group in several perspectives: learning creativity in class, learning methodology and strategies for creative problem solving, interests in engineering, creativity improvement with instruction, implying that the scaffolding may have the positive impacts on fostering students' creative problem solving skills and retarding the decrease of their interest in engineering.  Comparisons among intervention groups show that the scaffolding through the online learning or the online learning with e-mailed prompts may produce better impacts on increasing students' engineer identity than the one through seminar learning. Online learning with e-mailed prompts may have better effect on increasing students' perception of "better creativity can lead to better academic performance" than online learning only.  The correlation analysis of students' learning processes and outcomes based on their learning journals and project reports consistently demonstrates that the provided question prompts are significantly correlated with major components of self-regulated learning processes, such as self-evaluation, application of relevant strategies, self-monitoring, learning motivation and interest, and time planning, and are also significantly correlated with several components of creative problem solving processes, such as creative thinking, problem identification, idea generation, and seeking help, indicating that the provided scaffolding may be effective in promoting students' self-regulated learning and creative problem solving.  Comparison of GPAs of students in different groups reveals the trend of the GPAs improvement in all intervention groups larger than that in the control group, and the scaffolding delivered though online learning with e-mailed prompts or only online learning may have better impacts on students' overall learning improvement than the scaffolding through traditional lecturer. This identified trend consists with students' self-reported perceptions.   The follow-up interview reveals that participants may have adopted some strategies of self-regulated learning and creative problem solving and deemed the benefits from applying those strategies for their subsequent STEM learning. The most used strategies reported by the interviewees are goal setting, retrieval, knowledge application, analysis, and divergent thinking. The elaboration prompts are reported as the most useful type of question prompts, outperforming reflective prompts, metacognitve prompts, and procedural prompts. The most reported activity in the students' learning and problem solving processes is that they know how to identify the effective question prompts to help them solve the problem, while the least reported activity is self-evaluation of outcomes from their learning efforts.  The most common mistake reported by students is that they are "easy to be distracted by other things", while the least mistake is reported as "not seeking help". The mostly reported metacognitive factor that may hinder students from successfully solving problems is "not plan task sequence", and the least one is "not determine how to learn best". In cognitive perspective, the most reported factors that may hinder students from success are "not know how to collect, store, retrieve information" and "not remind unknown strategy", while the least one is "not know how to process to remember information".  All interviewees feel that the creative problem-solving strategies provided in the scaffolding help their learning and facilitate them to find the solutions to their homework or exams. They all think that their problem-solving skills have been improved after participating in the community service learning with the scaffolding.  Nevertheless, the follow-up interview also reveals that the extent to which students applied these strategies is not as expected, and only lower percentage of strategies were applied by students, implying that there may still be a potential for further improving students' learning in their STEM courses through prompting students' application of these strategies through the proposed scaffolding or other novel instructional strategies.  This project also provides unique learning experience for hundreds of freshmen and training opportunities for graduates and post-doctorial researchers, and promotes the collaboration among STEM faculty members and learning scientists at JSU.
