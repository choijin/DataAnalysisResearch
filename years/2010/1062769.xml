<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras campus, that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 8 undergraduate students, during the summers of 2011-2015.  The program focuses on Tropical Ecology and Evolution -- the study of plant population biology, forest and stream community dynamics, forest ecology, and arthropod biology and coevolution in the tropical rainforest of Puerto Rico.  El Verde Field Station is the base of operations of many tropical researchers and the Luquillo LTER program.  Students can develop their own independent projects in a wide variety of fields under the advice of faculty mentors.  Students spend most of their time working in their research projects, but are also expected to attend seminars and workshops on scientific data analysis and techniques to study tropical systems; along with workshops on the graduate school application process.  An ethics component focuses on responsible conduct in research and issues commonly encountered by students during their careers, as well as discussions on the role of scientists in modern society. The program has a component that includes field trips to other forest types and historic areas in Puerto Rico.  REU students have access to a very diverse tropical rainforest to conduct their research and basic facilities at the field station are complemented with modern laboratories on campus at UPR Rio Piedras.  The program is advertised electronically in Puerto Rico and mainland US.  Students are selected based on academic record and potential for outstanding research in the biological sciences.  Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience.  Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://web.ites.upr.edu/reu/ or by contacting the PI (Dr. Ramirez at reu@ites.upr.edu).</AbstractNarration>

Examples of student research include:&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><em>Substrate selection for web construction in brown widow spiders</em> - Web construction is costly for spiders and plays an important role in the reproductive success of individuals. Students studied whether brown widow spiders exhibited substrate-preference during the web construction and whether there was evidence that the behavior was inherited. They found clear selection for smooth surfaces, which are known to be preferred by their common prey. Comparisons between adults and nymphs indicate that there are similar preferences between the two, suggesting an inherited web building behavior.&nbsp;</li> <li><em>Importance of riparian leaf litter on decapod populations in the Luquillo Experimental Forest</em>&nbsp;- Students work on understanding hurricane effects on stream ecosystem by experimentally manipulating leaf litter inputs and sunlight. Leaf-litter was excluded from one of two streams using a 36-meter net and sunlight was manipulated by removing branches from particular areas. Decapod populations were monitored and found to be more responsive to changes in leaf litter than in light. However, effects were found to be small, potentially due to the short time frame of the experiment.&nbsp;</li> <li><em>Effectiveness of fungi at cycling phosphorus after hurricane disturbance</em>&nbsp;- Summer students studied the role of fungi in cycling phosphorus on the forest floor in response to simulated hurricane disturbance. This project was conducted in collaboration with the Luquillo LTER program. The project showed no difference in phosphorus capturing ability by fungi in treatment versus the control plot, but did imply a decrease in fungal trapping capabilities due to a suggestive relationship between % leaf area bleached of litter and active fungal biomass, as well as significance between phosphorus leaching and active fungal biomass.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our summer program also included a seminar series provided by faculty mentors and other researchers that exposed students to a variety of topics in tropical ecology. &nbsp;Also, workshops were organized to train students on data analysis and presentation, scientific writing, and application to graduate school, among others. &nbsp;We also provided a workshop on responsible conduct, focused on issues likely to be encountered by students in their careers (e.g., authorship, data handling) and discussions on the role of scientists in society. &nbsp;Overall, our goal was to provide student with the tools needed to conduct scientific research in any area of science, with emphasis on Tropical Ecology and Evolution, and by stressing the impact that scientists could have in our society if they take active roles. &nbsp;</p> <p>The program trained 40 students from a diversity of backgrounds, including minorities and student at institutions with limited access to research opportunities (e.g. small community colleges). &nbsp;Most of our students are finishing their undergraduate degrees, some are attending graduate school or working on science related jobs (e.g., laboratory technicians). &nbsp;In the period covered by the grant, the program produced 12 scientific publications in pee-reviewed journals with REU students as leading authors or co-authors. &nbsp;In addition, the same period resulted in 23 student presentations at local, national and international meetings and conferences.&nbsp;</p> <p>Additional information can be found at the program&rsquo;s web site http://reu.ites.upr.edu/&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Alonso&nbsp;Ramirez</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1062769/1062769_10101207_1504042419230_2013-08-0715.55.45--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1062769/1062769_10101207_1504042419230_2013-08-0715.55.45--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2013 REU group"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1062769/1062769_10101207_1504042419230_2013-08-0715.55.45--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2013 REU group"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2013 summer REU program.</div> <div class="imageCredit">A.
