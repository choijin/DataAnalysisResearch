<AbstractNarration>As the ocean observing community moves forward into the next phase of IOOS, federal agencies remain committed to cooperating among themselves and with partners throughout the ocean community. Coordination among the federal agency partners will remain the responsibility of the (IWGOO) along with NOAA as the designated lead federal agency for IOOS. The IWGOO is a formal chartered body, and will see IOOS through this transition period. The IWGOO decided that some Ocean.US activities would continue under the leadership of the IWGOO. This proposal requests funds for partial support for the Interagency Working Group on Ocean Observations (IWGOO) Support Office hosted at the Consortium for Ocean Leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interagency collaboration is essential to achieve ocean science and technology priorities and, in particular, for planning and coordination of an ocean observation system. The IWGOO support office provides administrative assistance the federal agencies on all of the IOOS planning activities. A balanced, highly-functioning IWGOO that works through collaboration supports efforts to integrate coastal and ocean observing assets, establishes effective mechanisms for Integrated Ocean Observing System budget planning and transfer of resources, creates links with other environmental observing efforts, provides integrated coastal and ocean data, facilitates the delivery of applications and decision-support tools, advances research, incorporates new technology into operations, integrates IOOS into education and workforce training, and coordinates ocean observing priorities. An IWGOO that is able to effectively support these goals will make meaningful contributions to broader societal goals related to climate, maritime operations, natural hazards, national security, public health, ecosystems, and natural resources.</AbstractNarration>

The Post-Summit Task Team refined and clarified actions to be taken to address the IOOS Summit recommendations; identified candidate Summit recommendations for IOOC collaboration; coordinated with other expert task teams and IOOC partners to determine progress and success; and developed proposed strategies for addressing all Summit Recommendations.  Finally, the Data Management and Communications (DMAC) Steering Team governance structure was officially reformed at the July IOOC meeting.  The new structure involves appoints three-to-five DMAC liaisons that provide strategic guidance to the IOOC and recommend the formation of ad-hoc teams to address specific data management challenges.  The proposed projects will likely build on the existing management and project structure utilized by the IOOS Program Office for workflow related to the Systems Integration Test.   The IOOC was also tasked with completing numerous actions under the Implementation Plan of the National Ocean Policy. The IOOC Support Office provided coordination and project management for the completion of these actions.   IOOC staff updated materials and the format of the committeeÆs website to better communicate past and ongoing IOOC activities as well as news items related to interagency ocean and coastal observations and data...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
