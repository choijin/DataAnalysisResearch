<AbstractNarration>Prior research has focused on deception detection, interrogation techniques, and the evaluation of confessions, all of which assume that perpetrators can recall with accuracy the details of their crimes. As other eyewitnesses (notably bystanders and victims) often exhibit incomplete and inaccurate memory for crime details, this assumption with regard to perpetrators may well be misguided.  This research project considers whether perpetrators and other eyewitnesses experience crimes differently. The expected differences are defined in terms of action, motivation, and arousal. The research plan involves three separate studies using an experimental format. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current research will provide insights into perpetrator memory and the performance of perpetrators relative to other eyewitnesses.  The results will help to guide the evaluation of statements often taken from crime suspects and determine in general if the criminal justice system correctly utilizes or over-relies on perpetrator memories in its investigation and prosecution of crimes.</AbstractNarration>

A great deal of research shows eyewitnesses are often inaccurate, and their memories are highly vulnerable to modification. Yet, popular media, and even the criminal justice system, seems to take the opposite view of perpetrator memory &ndash; we expect perpetrators to be able to tell us things æonly the perpetrator could have knownÆ because they actually physically committed the crime.                 All three studies used a mock crime task. In the first two studies, active participants (perpetrators) were asked to follow a series of clues around a room similar to a scavenger hunt.

Study 3 investigated whether stress levels impacted accuracy in the test. Stress did negatively impact accuracy, but at similar rates for both perpetrators and witnesses. Across studies, participants were more accurate on the Remember/Know test than the photo recognition test, in which they performed only slightly above chance.                 Overall research findings suggest that perpetrators may not have superior memory for their crimes ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
