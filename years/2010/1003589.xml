<AbstractNarration>The targeted research project examines and identifies promising organizational practices in the adoption and institutionalization of career pathways for students who attend 2-year institutions. For the purposes of this study and in the context of the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, career pathways are intentionally structured curriculum, pedagogy, and organizational strategies that assist diverse associate degree-seeking youth and adults in gaining access to and progressing through programs that lead to technician careers.  Career pathways are designed to integrate the general and technical education needed to prepare youth and adults for employment, for earning associate degrees, and for transferring to additional postsecondary education.  The study draws on previous research in technician education conducted by the research team and literature that posits that both access to educational opportunities and successful student progress are components of equity.  Using case study methodology and a collaborative research model that includes senior researchers and ATE leaders, the targeted research project provides in-depth analyses of the opportunities and challenges associated with implementing career pathways for technician education.  Through the participation of ATE leaders, the project is practitioner-oriented and provides a platform for critically examining the opportunities and challenges involved in collaborative research for bridging the gap between research and practice. The findings from the study have the potential for improving local practices at ATE sites, informing the adoption of promising practices in other programs, and contributing to research on technician education.</AbstractNarration>

Five women from 3 universities completed dissertations focused on ATE (a sixth from another university will soon finish), offering a new cadre of emerging ATE scholars.  Fourteen articles in peer-reviewed journals have been (or are in the process of being) published.  This targeted research project demonstated intellectual merit by advancing knowledge about 1) teaching and curriculum strategies for influencing student identity through well-structured projects and moving students from well-structured to ill-structured problems; 2) faculty motivators and constraints for initiating and implementing reform of community college STEM education; 3) benefits and challenges for designing community college STEM programs for underprepared students through contextualizing developmental education; and 4) the role of ATE in meeting women's aspirations for living wage employment.    In addition, this research project offered broader impacts for pathways in which all students might enter and succeed in advanced technological education and faculty might gain the support necessary to lead these efforts.  In doing so, this research project offers a map for addressing generational poverty through technical education.
