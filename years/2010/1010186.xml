<AbstractNarration>'Be a Scientist!' is a full-scale development project that examines the impact of a scalable, STEM afterschool program which trains engineers to develop and teach inquiry-based Family Science Workshops (FSWs) in underserved communities. This project builds on three years of FSWs which demonstrate improvements in participants' science interest, knowledge, and self-efficacy and tests the model for scale, breadth, and depth. The project partners include the Viterbi School of Engineering at the University of Southern California, the Albert Nerken Engineering Department at the Cooper Union, the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History, and the New York Hall of Science. The content emphasis is physics and engineering and includes topics such as aerodynamics, animal locomotion, automotive engineering, biomechanics, computer architecture, optics, sensors, and transformers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project targets underserved youth in grades 1-5 in Los Angeles and New York, their parents, and engineering professionals.  The design is grounded in motivation theory and is intended to foster participants' intrinsic motivation and self-direction while the comprehensive design takes into account the cultural, social, and intellectual needs of diverse families. The science activities are provided in a series of Family Science Workshops which take place in afterschool programs in eight partner schools in Los Angeles and at the New York Hall of Science in New York City. The FSWs are taught by undergraduate and graduate engineering students with support from practicing engineers who serve as mentors. The primary project deliverable is a five-year longitudinal evaluation designed to assess (1) the impact of intensive training for engineering professionals who deliver family science activities in community settings and (2) families' interest in and understanding of science. Additional project deliverables include a 16-week training program for engineering professionals, 20 physics-based workshops and lesson plans, Family Science Workshops (40 in LA and 5 in NY), a Parent Leadership Program and social networking site, and 5 science training videos. This project will reach nearly one thousand students, parents, and student engineers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-method evaluation will be conducted by the Center for Children and Technology at the Education Development Center. The evaluation questions are as follows:  Are activities such as recruitment, training, and FSWs aligned with the project's goals? What is the impact on families' interest in and understanding of science? What is the impact on engineers' communication skills and perspectives about their work? Is the project scalable and able to produce effective technology tools and develop long-term partnerships with schools? Stage 1 begins with the creation of a logic model by stakeholders and the collection of baseline data on families' STEM experiences and knowledge. Stage 2 includes the collection of formative evaluation data over four years on recruitment, training, co-teaching by informal educators, curriculum development, FSWs, and Parent Leadership Program implementation. Finally, a summative evaluation addresses how well the project met the goals associated with improving families' understanding of science, family involvement, social networking, longitudinal impact, and scalability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive dissemination plan extends the project's broader impacts in the museum, engineering, evaluation, and education professional communities through publications, conference presentations, as well as web 2.0 tools such as blogs, YouTube, an online social networking forum for parents, and websites. 'Be a Scientist!' advances the field through the development and evaluation of a model for sustained STEM learning experiences that helps informal science education organizations broaden participation, foster collaborations between universities and informal science education organizations, increase STEM-based social capital in underserved communities, identify factors that develop sustained interest in STEM, and empower parents to co-invest and sustain a STEM program in their communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Be a Scientist! project was a collaboration between engineering non-profit Iridescent, local Los Angles Schools, the University of Southern California (USC) and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (NHM) that engaged students and their families in science learning and engineering practices.   For five years, families learned together by participating in hands-on engineering projects led by USC engineering students.  These Family Science sessions typically took place at school sites, but one, five-week series per year took place at the Natural History Museum on a Saturday morning.  Family Science at the NHM was designed especially to interact with museum exhibits.  We explored how dinosaurs moved and survived, and families created projects inspired by Tyrannosaurus rex and long necked sauropods.    Hosting Family Science at the Natural History Museum had several intended goals.   Looking at dinosaur fossils and skeletons, the families could be inspired by real scientific artifacts and experience them first hand.  This helped make abstract concepts more concrete and more exciting.  A second but equally important goal was to encourage families to visit the museum and engage in informal science learning together.  We offered the families free admission to the Museum after each Family Science session, as well as creating a day of programming for the families each of the five years of the grant.  This was called the "Celebration of Learning" event and it took place each year of the grant in the spring, to recognize all of the family science participants from all of the partner schools.  In 2015, our final year of the NSF grant, we included a ceremony in the event to recognize the families that participated during all five years of the grant.  Not only is this a remarkable achievement for the families, but it was the intent of the grant to engage families and follow their learning from the time their child was in first grade until fifth grade.  There were eight families recognized for this remarkable achievement.  Perhaps the most tangible final outcome of this collaboration between Iridescent and the Natural History Museum was the publication of a book of engineering activities called Making Dinos: an engineering adventure notebook. This book is available for purchase by the public and contains eight engineering design challenges inspired by the Natural History Museum's Dinosaur Hall.  The notebook is designed for children to use with the help of their parents.  Encouraging collaboration is another goal of the grant, and hopefully this book will help continue the work of Family Science at home.  http://iridescentlearning.org/books-and-apps/.  The book is also downloadable for free on the Iridescent website and will be used by the NHM in future teacher workshops.  Another related outcome are videos that highlight the paleontologists at the NHM and inspire students to attempt the engineering challenges in the Making Dinos book.  The Natural History Museum and Iridescent will continue to build on the work of Be a Scientist!, and focus especially on teacher and students resources through the Curiosity Machine.
