I was fortunate to be selected for this program for the summer of 2010, along with 215 other students from universities all over the US.

Cultural Experience     Overall, my time at Peking University has been a challenging yet rewarding experience. Adapting to new working conditions and a different approach to research was perhaps the most challenging aspect. At my home laboratory, we carry out research in a wasteful yet convenient manner: air conditioning and lights are always turned on, disposable sterile equipment is readily available, scientific supplies are rarely a limiting factor. In my host laboratory, economy and efficiency are emphasized: air conditioning and lights are on only when necessary, supplies are recycled rather than used once and discarded, security seems to be a major concern. I donÆt believe these differences affect the quality of the research; they do, however, affect how the research is carried out. In addition to the working conditions, a major surprise for me was the approach to research and training in my host versus my home laboratories. At my home laboratory students will be given a project to carry through from beginning to end, yet students here are often responsible only for a small aspect of a project.

In the US, great emphasis is placed on the "big picture" or the overarching question underlying the research. In my experience, this emphasis is missing in China.

The cultural experience, both at Peking University and in Beijing, has been the most rewarding aspect of my stay.

The realities we live in, however, are very different and greatly influence the roles we play. After my time in China, I truly believe we can work together towards common goals in science and beyond.     Project Description and Outcome     As described in my EAPSI application, the original project focused on the identification of transfer RNA (tRNA) targets by chemical cross-linking. Transfer RNAs are small, non-coding RNAs best known for their role in protein synthesis. Recent evidence suggests that stress-induced tRNA fragments, like other non-coding RNAs, may play a role in regulating gene expression under a variety of stress conditions. The proposed research project aimed to develop a novel method for the identification of potential tRNA targets. This project was an excellent match between my expertise and that of my host laboratory, as it took advantage of novel photo-crosslinking agents synthesized in the He laboratory and applied them to an emerging question in t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
