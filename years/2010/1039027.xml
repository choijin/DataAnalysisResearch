<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Jerry Jasinski from Keene State College will acquire a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector. The diffractometer would have single crystal and powder capabilities and measurements could be done at various temperatures. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as structural characterization of pharmaceutically related molecules, anticancer and anti-inflammatory compounds, therapeutic agents, model enzyme complexes, peptide mimic compounds, radiopharmaceutical chelator molecules, molecular magnetic materials and organometallic and inorganic compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research in a series of Central New England Institutions that include Keene State University, Dartmouth College, University of New Hampshire, Saint Anselm College, Middlebury College, Williams College and Clark University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The purpose of this Award was for Keene State College (KSC) to acquire a dual wavelength single crystal X-ray diffractometer with a charge coupled detector and variable low temperature capability to be used for the structural characterization of pharmaceutically active, anticancer and radiopharmaceutical chelator molecules, molecular magnetic materials and novel organometallic and inorganic compounds in an undergraduate environment.  This instrument has been and is being used in teaching and research and allows for better training at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in the chemical sciences with a modern diffractometer system and software.  The research programs of twelve faculty members at seven Central New England institutions as well as with numerous other regional, national and international collaborators, including KSC, have been impacted by this acquisition.  Regionally, access to this state-of-the-art single crystal X-ray diffractometer through a cyber-enabled network has allowed for hands-on activity with data acquisition and handling by faculty and students from these seven academic institutions, as well as with additional interested institutions worldwide and has significantly enhanced their research, training and teaching capabilities.  Over 160 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals have resulted from the collaborative activities of all parties involved in this endeavor over the past three years.  In addition, during this timeframe, presentations at local, regional and national scientific meetings have been made by faculty mentors and their students in a variety of venues including the American Chemical Society (ACS) and American Crystallographic Society (ACA) and at national and regional and international meetings as well as those at the local college venue.  A significant amount of outreach activities have also been achieved including demonstrations of the X-ray diffraction facility to KSC students from the General Chemistry classes, visiting faculty and students as well as a separate course on X-ray crystallography offered at KSC.  Additional outreach has resulted from the 2013-2014 Fulbright-Nehru Scholarship awarded to Professor Jasinski under the title "A Cultural Exchange Focused on X-ray Crystallography between Keene State College and the University of Mysore, India."  Numerous lectures and workshops were given at the Department of Science at The University of Mysore, India and additionally at some of the most prestigious science and engineering universities in India, providing a benchmark evaluation of the capabilities, interest and success of US students involved in these activities and those from the institutions visited in India. The exposure to state-of-the-art science as applied to the solid state as a result of this acquisition has been outstanding and will undoubtedly serve to encourage more students to become involved in science at both the undergraduate and graduate level and promote careers in the scientific arena.
