<AbstractNarration>Developers and researchers at Rutgers University, Boston University, Colorado State University, and the Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP) are continuing research and development work on high school instructional materials that integrate biology, computing, and mathematics. The project goal is to develop and test a one-semester high school course.  The course consists of some modules developed under a previous NSF grant as well as some new material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMAP leads the effort to develop the instructional materials and the process involves mathematicians, biologists, computer scientists, teachers, and writers.  The materials are pilot- and field-tested in a number of schools and revised after each test.  Subject matter experts review the materials for accuracy and teachers and education professionals review them for their usability. Researchers at Colorado State University collect and analyze data on student learning and interest at all stages of the pilot- and field-testing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intended deliverables include up to five new instructional modules and a coherent one-semester course suitable for the increasing state requirements for a fourth year of mathematics.  The course is supported by a book in print and electronic format and includes teacher training support tools and activities to prepare teachers to present interdisciplinary bio-mathematics material.</AbstractNarration>

Students look for      factors that help them estimate a personÆs age. Then they work with data      from the Infant Growth Study that sought connections between eating      behaviors in children and being overweight. Students grapple with      determining which factors are the best indicators that a child is      overweight.  Quorum Sensing: Organisms      Communicating and Coordinating:  Even the simplest organisms, bacteria, have a capacity      to communicate with each other by secreting specialized, small molecules      that are then received by other bacteria and interpreted accordingly.      Bacteria are mainly using this form of communication, called quorum      sensing to find out what the population density is in their neighborhood      in order to decide whether or not to act, and, if they act, in what way. Tomography: Looking Inside With Outside Tools: The module provides real-life examples of tomography (CT scans) that use skills from algebra II and geometry, including modeling using e and exponential functions, solving systems of equations, and visualization in 3-D, to understand one of the important tools available to physicians in understanding the status of the human body. Evolutionary Game Theory: The Game      of Life: This module examines the role      that behavior plays in evolutionary fitness. Through studying and playing      games, students develop an understanding of natural selection as organisms      compete for limiting resources (e.g. food, water, space, mates, safety,      etc.).  DNA Sequencing and Sorting:      Identifying Genetic Variations:  The module introduces background material for DNA,      chromosomes, mutations, and polymorphisms. Students identify where short      DNA sequences fit in a reference genome to illustrate the mapping process      used in genome sequencing and the types of genomic variations that can be      discovered as a result of mapping.    Research during the IMB project included answers to three important questions surrounding interdisciplinary work in high school:  How can resources, modules and course curricula in our case, be developed that facilitate the teaching and learning of mathematics and biology, create new understandings in students, and enhan...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
