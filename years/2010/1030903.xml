<AbstractNarration>This project brings together analytical, computational and testing capabilities of three universities for the development, validation, and software implementation of a multi-scale method for thermo-mechanical response of open-cell Aluminum foams, from linear behavior to complete crushing. The University of California Los Angeles team will develop a suite of high-fidelity simulation modules that will yield the thermo-mechanical response of open-cell Aluminum foams at the micro-scale. The Purdue University team will build the essential multiscale framework with which a complete structure (comprising not only foams) can be efficiently analyzed. The Illinois Institute of Technology team will conduct the experiments that are needed to calibrate and validate the proposed modeling approaches. These experiments will feature custom instruments and unique measurements that will enable the probing of thermo-mechanical behavior of open-cell foams with requisite detail. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The over-arching goal of this research project is to facilitate widespread use of Aluminum foams as load-bearing structural members, by providing a validated simulation tool to design engineers. The potential societal benefit of this enabling technology is to help reduce energy consumption in a multitude of transportation systems that range from automobiles and railroad cars to elevators. The project will also feature educational, outreach and training activities at participating institutions that are integrated with the proposed research program. These activities will engage and educate graduate and undergraduate students in the growing area of multiscale scale mechanics, and create awareness and stimulate interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines among young high school students, and incoming freshmen.</AbstractNarration>
