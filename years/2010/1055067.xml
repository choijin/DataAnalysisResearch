<AbstractNarration>This study is investigating the classroom factors and teacher characteristics that contribute to Latino English Language Learners' (ELL) gains in mathematics learning in the eighth grade. Researchers are collaborating with two school districts in Texas to investigate teaching practices. The project includes professional development that incorporates successful strategies found from their investigations. In addition to looking for key characteristics that influence mathematics learning, the researchers are measuring teachers' knowledge of mathematics for teaching, quality of instruction, and knowledge about English learners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research design of the five-year study is a two-level cluster design in which students are nested within teachers. The goal is to predict English Language Learners' gains in mathematics achievement on standardized tests from the resources used by teachers. Measures of teacher knowledge include the Learning Mathematics for Teaching instrument, TExES Bilingual Education Supplemental 4-8 Representative Exam, and the Quality of Mathematics Instruction instrument. Variables and their interactions are analyzed to understand their relationship with student achievement. The evaluation plan involves both formative and summative components related to conducting the research and offering the associated professional development. The educational plan includes implementing a Mathematics Bilingual Institute that offers practicing teachers a professional development focused on successful classroom practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to help educators throughout the United States understand the best practices that promote mathematical learning for Latino ELL students. It can help us understand teacher characteristics that contribute to student learning and ways to help teachers develop those characteristics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the population of Hispanics in the United States continues to grow, mathematics classrooms are becoming more linguistically diverse, some with a large percent of English language learners.  Currently, significant achievement and opportunity gaps in mathematics exist between English learners and their counterparts. The main integrated research and educational goals of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at Texas State University were to empirically estimate whether and which classroom factors contribute to mathematics gains of middle grades English learners and to develop research-based professional learning activities for teachers.  One of the main outcomes of this project was the identification of a set of pedagogical practices that have a significantly positive impact on mathematics gains of English learners and can contribute to closing the achievement and opportunity gap.  This set of pedagogical practices includes the following integrated language and mathematics elements:  Provide explicit connections of mathematics with students? life experiences and with language  Attach meaning to words by using synonyms, gestures, drawing, cognates, or use of two languages Supplement instruction with powerful visual media that enhance comprehension of mathematical concepts Display written record of essential ideas and concepts in classroom spaces were students have access and can refer to them throughout the lesson Discuss students? written work as an instructional tool and point of discussion  Other factors that predicted English learner?s mathematical gains were the amount of time teachers dedicated to professional learning opportunities, implementation of tasks that were well-sequenced, aiming to a specific goal, instruction that is focused on providing meaning of facts and procedures by exposing students to key mathematical practices such as examining multiple solutions, patterns, generalizations, and the use of mathematical language.  This project provided direct impact to middle grades mathematics teachers from school districts with large percentage of English language learners and low social economic status by facilitating six Bilingual Mathematics Institutes (average of about 27 teachers per Institute).  Research and educational activities involved 11 graduate students from different backgrounds and experiences who contributed to the development and validation of the research tool that measured to pedagogical practices utilizing video data.  Furthermore, they helped in the design and facilitation of the Bilingual Mathematics Institutes.  As a result of their direct involvement with the area of research of the project, three doctoral students earned their Ph.D. degrees and are now employed in institutions of higher education and assessment.
