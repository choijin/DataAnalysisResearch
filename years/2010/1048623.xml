<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Mark Cracolice and colleagues Bruce Bowler, Michele McGuirl, Edward Rosenberg and Valeriy Smirnov from University of Montana will acquire an X-band EPR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) the role of protein dynamics in folding and function, (b) characterization of amino acid radicals and copper binding to deseases states of prions, (c) oxidation of protein-bound amino acid residues, (d) surface-immobilized luminescent and redox-active ruthenium complexes, (e) radicals produced during metabolism of chromium(V and VI), and (f) mechamism of Ric-8A-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange at heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument will be an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>
