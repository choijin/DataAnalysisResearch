<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a commercially viable two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectrometer.  2D IR spectroscopy is an emerging research and analytical tool.  Over the last 10 years since it was first invented, about 40 academic laboratories have begun using the technique to study problems ranging from electron transfer in solar-cell materials to protein folding. The aim of this proposal is to combine advances in laser technology with advances in mid-IR pulse shaping to construct a 2D IR spectrometer that is robust, automated, and technologically more advanced than currently existing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be three-fold.  First, it will enhance scientific understanding across a wide range of disciplines because of the unique time and structure sensitivity of 2D IR spectroscopy as compared to other techniques. Second, our results will be disseminated at academic and trade conferences, which will impact the broader scientific and industrial communities.  Third, the commercial impact of this instrument in this proposal will be substantial.  Infrared spectrometers are used routinely in academic and industrial research labs throughout the world.  A commercial 2D IR spectrometer would enable higher sensitivities and more accurate analytical measurements than possible with current infrared spectrometers, thereby contributing to advances in pharmaceutical agents, energy storage materials, and many other products.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most exciting developments in laser technology in the last decade has been the invention of two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy.  Spectroscopy is a technique that uses light to analyze substances.  In 1998, a version of spectroscopy that uses infrared light was invented that analyzed the substance in two frequency dimensions.  There are now research groups across the world employing this technique in the fields of material science, chemical dynamics, electron transfer, biophysics, polymer structure, solar energy, and analytical diagnostics.  The wide range of subjects to which it is being applied speaks to its tremendous utility.  But, while it is a valuable research tool, it is also very difficult to implement.  The main difficulty is that the standard 2D IR spectrometer requires four independent laser beams that are difficult to align and there are no efficient laser sources.  As a result, many scientists and engineers cannot use this informative technology in their research.  2D IR spectroscopy would be a valuable government laboratory or industrial research and analytical tool, if it were a turn-key technology.  A few years ago, we made a breakthrough that makes possible a commercial 2D IR spectrometer viable.  We invented a device in which the 4 laser beams, that are required for this technique can be generated by a computer, rather than with complicated mirror arrangements.  Even though our invention is only about 3 years old, about half of the research groups that use 2D IR spectroscopy in their research have already or are currently converting their spectrometers into our design.  About once a month, we send drawings and lists of components to a new research group.  We have helped researchers in Europe, Japan, India, Canada and the United States to implement our pulse shaping technology into their research.  With this technology in hand, the only missing component necessary to build a turn-key 2D IR spectrometer is a robust and powerful laser source. This proposal leverages an advance in laser technology by KMLabs with the computer programmable spectrometer by Prof. Zanni, to move towards a commercially viable spectrometer.  Towards this aim, during Phase I we made several design changes necessary for commercialization into a viable instrument.  First, we designed and constructed a new type of optical parametric amplifier (OPA).  An OPA is a device that converts one laser frequency into another.  In our case, it is necessary to create the infrared light needed for 2D IR spectroscopy.  Testing of our new OPA revealed that its output scans a previously unprecedented range of frequencies.   Moreover, it is proving to be much more robust to damage, which is an important design criteria for a commercial device.  We are currently testing its efficiency, but already it appears to be a major advance for the field and an important step for commercialization.  Second, we redesigned pulse shaper (which does the manipulation of the light). It now only takes a few minutes to align the shaper, one can change frequencies with hardly any alignment, and it is designed so that it can be automated.  Thus, we are now well positioned to assemble an automated and robust 2D IR spectrometer and laser system that will be the prototype for a commercial model in Phase II.
