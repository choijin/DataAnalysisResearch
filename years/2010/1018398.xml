<AbstractNarration>Streaming video is envisioned to become the ?killer? networking application in the coming decade, and may determine whether the Internet and the current wireless technologies will live up to the explosive growth of multimedia demands of the next-generation network users. This project aims to develop coding and distribution mechanisms for transferring video over networks in a scalable and effective manner, which will be critical in meeting this challenge. In particular, the project investigates the design of a broad theoretical framework as well as specific mechanisms that would enable efficient delivery of streaming video through the use of video distribution networks (VDNs) and ?network-aware? Multiple Description Forward Error Correction (MD-FEC) coding. MD-FEC can be very effective in minimizing the overall distortion in video quality when delivering streaming video in a typical network environment that experiences time-varying bandwidth fluctuations and random packet losses. The project also explores how network coding can be integrated with MD-FEC coding to enhance live video streaming performance. This cross-disciplinary research is being done through a closely-integrated effort by an interdisciplinary team bringing together expertise in the areas of video coding and information theory; and network modeling, optimization and simulation. The results of this research project are expected to provide key insights on how streaming live video should be delivered for optimal performance over the Internet and last-hop wireless networks in the future. Proactive efforts are also being taken towards integrating the research findings into related graduate courses, and involving undergraduates in these research activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project has led to the design of efficient delivery mechanisms for streaming video in the Internet through the use of network-aware schemes based on multiple description forward error-correction coding (MD-FEC). Use of MD-FEC coding allows the necessary flexibility, easy adaptivity and distortion-rate optimality - and thereforecould be used effectively for delivering streaming video in a typical network environment that experiences time-varying bandwidth fluctuations and random packet losses.  This research has combined efforts in the areas of video coding with network modeling and optimization.  The specific research outcomes of this project include the following:  1) The project has shown that using network coding with multiple description codes can significantly improve the quality of video obtained at the receiver, or in other words, MD-FEC and practical network coding (PNC) can be effectively combined.  2) Our exploration of distributed MD/PNC points out that significant benefits may be obtainable in using local (distributed) MD/PNC (re-) optimization.  Our exploration of temporal-scalable MD/PNC suggest that even though temporal-scalable MD/PNC is helpful for high bandwidth users in terms of the PSNR, the resulting improvement in the visual quality is not that signi?cant.    3) The project has shown that the optimal grouping solution for MD-FEC coded video-stream receivers can be solved in polynomial time using a dynamic programming based procedure.  4) Our research has concluded that a combination of statistical multiplexing and MD-FEC,  which considers both the intrinsic properties of the videos and the bandwidth constraints of the users at the same time, is well suited for streaming multiple videos with different properties from the same server, to a heterogeneous set of users.  5) Our reserach on strategic capacity allocation by multicast video receivers has shown that there exist easily-computable exact or approximate distribution networks where receivers have no motivation to deviate from it unilaterally, and yet results in the set of receivers paying near-minimal cost as a group for multicast data delivery.  This project has led to several publications in internationally reputed journals and conferences, simulation code, involvement of undergraduates in research, and introduction of class projects on video-streaming in graduate and undergrdauate courses.
