<AbstractNarration>SES: 1003182&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kiyoteru Tsutsui&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Alwyn Lim&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes a country-level conception of corporate social responsibility to examine the cross-national factors that influence the diffusion and implementation of global voluntary corporate social responsibility frameworks despite the uncertain costs, benefits, and consequences. In order to test the proposed developmental, normative, and economic explanations, research for this project comprises (1) quantitative time-series analyses of cross-national data on corporate social responsibility adoption and (2) a case study of corporate social responsibility implementation in the Republic of Singapore through structured interviews. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  The broader impacts of this project are timely as international organizations, civil society, and many corporations have expressed urgency for progressive change to be on the corporate agenda. The cross-national design of this project yields findings that are applicable to diverse national contexts, especially if countries and corporations are considering commitment to corporate social responsibility principles that are prominent in global forums.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Why do countries enact corporate social responsibility frameworks and what are the consequences for corporations in those countries? This research project examines the cross-national factors that influence the diffusion and implementation of global voluntary corporate social responsibility (CSR) frameworks. Two broad puzzles confront researchers when examining CSR across countries. First, countries are increasingly adopting global voluntary CSR frameworks despite their uncertain costs and benefits. Second, adoption of CSR frameworks does not necessarily have any subsequent impact on improving CSR among corporations.  This project proposes a country-level conception of corporate social responsibility to examine the cross-national factors that influence the diffusion and implementation of global voluntary corporate social responsibility frameworks despite the uncertain costs, benefits, and consequences. In order to test the proposed institutional and economic explanations, research for this project comprises (i) quantitative time-series analyses of cross-national data on corporate social responsibility adoption and (ii) a case study of corporate social responsibility implementation in the Republic of Singapore through structured interviews. The broader impacts of this project are timely as international organizations, civil society, and many corporations have expressed urgency for progressive change to be on the corporate agenda. The cross-national design of this project yields findings that are applicable to diverse national contexts, especially if countries and corporations are considering commitment to corporate social responsibility principles that are prominent in global forums.  Findings from my quantitative analyses indicate that global institutional channels, especially through nongovernmental linkages, are strong predictors of global CSR framework adoption, including substantive commitment to those frameworks.
