<AbstractNarration>Professors Christopher Hogan, Steven Girshick, and Donald Truhlar of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities are receiving an award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program to better understand metal cluster formation and growth. The team is examining the properties of nanometer scale clusters (from as small as 6 atoms up to 1000 atoms) in the gas-phase by a combined experimental and computational approach. Specifically, the dissociation of metal clusters, Mn --&gt; Mn-1 + M (where M is a metal and n is the number of atoms in a metal cluster) is monitored experimentally using tandem differential mobility analysis. These experiments are the first ever measurements of single atom evaporation from gas phase neutral, cationic, and anionic metal clusters at atmospheric pressure. Simultaneously, the dissociation rates of metal clusters are inferred from molecular dynamics trajectory simulations allowing for direct comparison of  experimental measurements and computational predictions. Of particular interest in measurements and computations is the identification of anomalous magic number and anti-magic number clusters, which are either anomalously stable or unstable, respectively. The existence of these magic number clusters vastly alters the rate of nucleation for gas phase metal clusters. The team of researchers infers the rate of cluster formation and growth from the measured and computed rates of dissociation for metal clusters, enabling comparison of cluster growth rate predictions to experimental measurements in a newly designed turbulent mixing metal cluster growth reactor.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These experiments and simulations elucidate the behavior of metallic clusters, thus providing the basis for the design of future synthesis systems for multi component metallic materials with nanoscale features. This area of research has technological applications in environmental and materials sciences, e. g., waste incineration and coal burning exhausts. This project is interdisciplinary in nature, bridging the disciplines of physical chemistry and mechanical engineering. It is unique in that it incorporates both newly developed experimental techniques and cutting-edge molecular simulations, where overlap has thus far been sparse. Moreover, these studies are part of a vital effort to link the properties of materials at the molecular scale to properties of bulk materials. Additional broader impacts of these studies include the interdisciplinary education of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers involved in the project, including the development of new interdisciplinary courses focusing on the properties of nanometer scale clusters from both the  chemist's and engineer's perspective.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanoparticles (solid or liquid entities &lt; 100 nm in characteristic size) are encountered in a variety of systems, including the ambient environment, materials synthesis reactors, and combustion engines.  Understanding and controlling nanoparticle formation and growth is hence often of critical importance; in some circumstances nanoparticles of a particular size and shape can be produced as useful materials, while in others nanoparticles are a contaminant/pollutant.  Unfortunately, nanoparticle formation and growth processes are not well understood.  While it is known that nanoparticles in the gas phase do form from vapor phase (gaseous) precursors and subsequently grow by vapor molecule uptake, formation rates cannot be quantitatively predicted from classical approaches; when composed of tens to thousands of molecules, nanoparticles (better termed clusters at these sizes, in the 1-10 nm range) have physicochemical properties very different from bulk materials, and hence predictions of their properties based on bulk properties are not accurate.  Motivated by this issue, we have worked to develop a combination of quantum mechanical calculations, Brownian Dynamics and Molecular Dynamics calculations, and gas phase measurement techniques using ion mobility spectrometry and mass spectrometry to study the stability, reactivity, and thermodynamic properties of 1-10 nm gas phase metal, metal salt, and organic salt nanoparticles (clusters).  Through this combination of numerical and experimental techniques, we have been able to examine the properties of a variety of materials in cluster form.  Specifically, theoretically, we reported on structural stability, phases, phase changes, and thermodynamic functions of aluminum nanoparticles. We discussed using statistical sampling by Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics algorithms to calculate nanoparticle properties, nanophase properties, free energies, and nucleation rates, and we tried to understand the results in terms of energy landscapes by using exhaustive enumeration of the multiple structures of Al nanoparticles from all sizes up to the 65-mer plus selected larger calculations.  In another part of this work we used density functional theory to study the structures and energies of Mg and Ag particles, and we began on the development of a model for understanding the charge distributions in Ag particles.  Experimentally, we examined the structure and stability (both evaporation and water uptake) of gold and silver nanoparticles, metal iodide salt clusters, and organic salts implicated in new particle formation events in the ambient environment (dimethylammonium bisulfate).  Techniques to link experimentally measured cluster and nanoparticle mobilities to their atomic level structures, through gas molecule trajectory/collision cross section calculation techniques, were also developed.  Overall, the combined numerical and experimental approaches developed in this study can be used for characterization of a wide variety of cluster properties in gas phase environments.  We anticipate that these techniques will continue to be used by researchers in chemical physics, atmospheric chemistry, and nanotechnology to better understand how nanoparticles and clusters form and grow.  A combination of undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral associates were involved in research activities, spanning Chemistry and Mechanical Engineering departments.  The combination of these two disciplines, as well as the combination of experimental, theoretical, and numerical research approaches taken created a unique educational environment for all project participants.
