<AbstractNarration>1043500/Sowers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to develop a 50 yr resolution methane data set that will play a pivotal role in developing the WAIS Divide timescale as well as providing a common stratigraphic framework for comparing climate records from Greenland and West Antarctica. Even higher resolution data are proposed for key intervals to assist in precisely defining the phasing of abrupt climate change between the hemispheres. Concurrent analysis of a suit of samples from both the WAIS Divide and GISP-2 cores throughout the last 110,000 years is also proposed, to establish the interpolar methan (CH4) gradient that will be used to identify geographic areas responsible for the climate related methane emission changes. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is that it will provide chronological control needed to examine the timing of changes in climate proxies, and critical chronological ties to the Greenland ice core records via methane variations. One main objective is to understand the interpolar timing of millennial-scale climate change. This is an important scientific goal relevant to understanding climate change mechanisms in general. The proposed work will help establish a chronological framework for addressing these issues. In addition, this proposal addresses the question of what methane sources were active during the ice age, through the work on the interpolar methane gradient. This work is directed at the fundamental question of what part of the biosphere controlled past methane variations, and is important for developing more sophisticated understanding of those variations. The broader impacts of the work are that the ultra-high resolution CH4 record will directly benefit all ice core paleoclimate research and the chronological refinements will impact paleoclimate studies that rely on ice core timescales for correlation purposes. The project will support both graduate and undergraduate students and the PIs will participate in outreach to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the analysis of the history of the greenhouse gas methane from the WAIS Divide ice core for the period from 0-68,000 years ago.  The extremely detailed data that emerged from the project allowed the investigators to study three important topics.   First, they used the methane variations, known to be coincident in time with large temperature changes in Greenland, as time markers to determine if temperature in Antarctic and Greenland change at the same time, are anti-correlated, or exhibit a more complex relationship.  The outcome was the discovery that warming in Greenland precedes cooling in Antarctic by a few centuries, suggesting that ocean mechanisms are responsible for the connection between the hemispheres.   Second, the detailed measurements revealed new modes of methane change, not observed before - specifically small abrupt shifts during the last ice age during times when Greenland was cold.  The award further supported the detailed study of the spatial distribution of this change - by measuring the difference between methane in the northern and southern hemispheres.  The investigators find that it does not change much when the methane concentration changes, indicating that tropical sources dominate methane change and are sensitive to climate change.   Third, the investigators find that the total air content of the WAIS Divide ice core is not easily interpreted as a record of the ice sheet elevation.  This is important because records of changes in ice sheet elevation would help us understand the sensitivity of ice sheets to climate change.  Unfortunately the air content records are overprinted significantly by other processes, probably related to the impacts of temperature on pore volume when the air is trapped.   Finally, the award supported the development of a promising PhD student and an undergraduate worker.         Last Modified: 06/01/2016       Submitted by: Edward J Brook]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
