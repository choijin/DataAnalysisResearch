<AbstractNarration>The research objective of the award is to understand at a fundamental level the physical properties of dielectric nanoparticle/polymer matrix nanocomposites, through modeling and properties characterization, and by tuning the composition, morphology and size matching of the nanocomposite components, and further, by introducing metallic nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes. The goal is to enable synthetic methods to improve the dielectric performance of the nanocomposites, assisted by a theoretical model of the system and its components. The dielectric performance is based on several important factors including the dielectric constant, the dielectric strength (breakdown voltage), and the mechanical strength of the system. The project involves three research parts: (1) to develop a systematic self-assembly processing technique to synthesize multi-phase dielectric nanoparticle composites with consistent nanostructure and properties, (2) to characterize the nano/micro structures and properties of proposed dielectric nano-composites using various techniques (EFM, SPM, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, etc.); and (3) to develop a systematic modeling tool based on nano/micromechanics theory, which can incorporate the effects of size and microstructure, and to study the dielectric, piezoelectric; and electro-mechanical coupling behaviors of the proposed multi-phase dielectric nanocomposites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of the research will directly impact the ability to prepare high power electrostatic capacitors. Capacitors are the key device in controlling and storing electricity in a wide range electronics, and, in addition, have been hailed as a potentially transformative technology for the Smart Grid: high-power-density capacitors are a solution for storage and conversion of energy from intermittent renewable sources (e.g., wind and photovoltaic installations). The technology can also be adapted to address load leveling and power quality management for conventional power sources. New generations of capacitors with improved dielectric performance will enable circuit design of power management systems to improve energy efficiency in a wide variety of contexts, including household, industrial and commercial settings.</AbstractNarration>
