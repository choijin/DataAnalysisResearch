<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant titled "Reproductive Isolation, Speciation and Floral Evolution in Pedicularis" was awarded to Deren Eaton to support collaborative research in China during the summer of 2010.  The Hengduan Mountains of south-central China are of great interest to the study of biodiversity, exhibiting greater levels of plant species richness and endemism than expected given their temperate climate and latitude. Pedicularis is one of the most diverse lineages in this region with nearly 270 endemic species which frequently co-occur.
