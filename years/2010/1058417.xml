<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a maskless photolithography system by ensuring that the patterns it writes are free of positional error (i.e., distortion) to the sub-1 nm level.  In traditional photolithography, distortion minimization depends on the design and construction of an image-projection lens and on the fidelity of the mask. Measuring 1nm and sub-1nm geometric imperfections is intellectually challenging.  In Phase I project, a confocal-metrology-system (CMS) was developed to determine focal spot positions from the phase of periodic signals produced when a master reference grating is scanned through the focal spots. In this Phase II project, corrections will be applied in the pattern-writing software.  Errors in the X-Y position of the stage will be determined by comparing readings from a master reference grating with readings from the encoder built into the stage.  Once known, systematic errors will be corrected in software through a process known as refracturing. The CMS will enable the systems located at disparate sites to reference a common fiducial, thus achieving identical patterning fidelity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to provide a maskless photolithography tool with high fidelity for low-volume manufacturing of custom electronics and photonics, and for future nanomanufacturing. In comparison to existing electron-beam systems, this maskless photolithography tool will provide higher throughput, non-vacuum processing, large-area continuous patterning, lower cost and freedom from distortion to the sub-1nm level.</AbstractNarration>

Currently, in the semiconductor industry, the form of photolithography used to manufacture microchips requires a physical mask that is imaged via a large expensive lens to create identical chip patterns.  LumArray's system requires no mask as the information for the pattern is contained entirely in software.   LumArray's system thus provides flexibility to create a wide variety of submicron patterns directly from software. Applications include  synthetic holograms and custom electronic chips.  Under this SBIR LumArray developed technology to ensure that errors in the positions of the focal spots from the multiple microscopic lenses used in the LumArray system are measured and corrections made in software.  Focal-spot positions were measured accurately using a reference grating fabricated by interference lithography that was scanned through the focal spots.  When LumArray's system was operated in a confocal imaging mode, the multiple focal spots produced sinusoidal signals on a CCD imager.  By analzing the phases of the sinusoidal signals, the relative positions of the focal spots could be determined, in principal with nanometer-level accuracy.  Software was developed for compensating during the lithographic writing process for systematic errors in focal spot locations.
