<AbstractNarration>COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Integrated Paleoceanographic Analysis of the Late Paleozoic Midcontinent Sea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achim Herrmann, Arizona State University. EAR-1052988&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Algeo, Univ. Cincinnatti, EAR-1053449&lt;br/&gt;James Barrick, Texas Tech University, EAR-1053042&lt;br/&gt;Bernd Haupt, Penn State University, EAR-1052998&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Due to different environmental conditions and paleogeographic settings of ancient times, some past sedimentary environments have no good modern analogues. For instance, previous interpretations of environmental conditions of black shale deposition centered on applying modern analogs of coastal upwelling or ?Black-Sea type? silled basin topographies.  However, a superestuarine circulation model has been proposed recently to explain the abundant and widespread Paleozoic black shale deposits of Midcontinent North America. It is the purpose of this research project to use an interdisciplinary approach to investigate paleoceanographic conditions during the deposition of Pennsylvanian cyclothems of Midcontinent North America and to test the ?superestuarine circulation hypothesis?. This work is a comprehensive data-model synthesis study and geochemical proxies (strontium and oxygen isotopes of biogenic apatite; bulk major- and trace-element abundance data, TOC-TIC-S concentrations, and petrographic data) will be compared to biofacies distribution patterns and to results of numerical ocean circulation models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding provides research opportunities for undergraduates at several universities and will support one PhD thesis.</AbstractNarration>

Herrmann, Thomas Algeo, and James Barrick</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study of ancient marine systems is needed to understand environmental controls on the deposition and preservation of sedimentary organic matter (a precursor to fossil fuel deposits), the cycling of nutrients and trace metals, and their relationships to oceanic circulation. In this project, we analyzed the sediments, chemistry, and biotas of the Late Pennsylvanian Midcontinent Sea (LPMS), a shallow sea that spread across North American interior during periods of sea-level rise about 300 million years ago (Fig. 1A). This sea was unusual in having a deepwater connection to the global ocean at low latitudes (where oxygen deficiency is greatest), allowing oxygen-deficient deep waters to be drawn into the LPMS (Fig. 2). This process created anoxic bottomwater conditions in the LPMS that were hostile to marine life but favorable for organic matter preservation. Our analysis was based on a series of outcrop (Fig. 3) and drillcore sections that form a transect across the LPMS, allowing us to evaluate changing environmental conditions from nearshore to offshore areas (Fig. 1B). Our sampling and analysis of these sections at an ultra-high (centimeter-scale) resolution facilitated development of a detailed stratigraphic framework within which to undertake our study (Fig. 4)</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Within this stratigraphic framework, we investigated a number of scientific issues. First, our data support the "super-estuarine model" of Algeo et al. (2008), which hypothesizes large-scale estuary-type circulation throughout the LPMS. Owing to these conditions, the water column of the LPMS was vertically stratified, with an oxygenated surface layer and an anoxic deep layer (Figs. 5-6). Second, circulation and stratification patterns exerted strong influence on the distribution of life In the LPMS. This is illustrated by conodonts, a small free-swimming animal that was widely distributed in the LPMS. Different 'biofacies' (assemblages of conodont species) are found in nearshore areas subject to freshwater influx versus offshore areas that were fully marine, and in shallow, well-oxygenated waters versus deep, oxygen-deficient waters (Fig. 5). Because of their extraordinary environmental sensitivity, mapping of the distribution of conodont species across the LPMS provides considerable insight into environmental variations. &nbsp;&nbsp;Third, analysis of Mo and U isotopes (which are new tools for paleoceanographic research) provided insights into oceanographic processes in the LPMS. Both Mo and U concentration and isotopic data provide evidence for operation of a particulate shuttle within the LPMS water column (Fig. 6). Such shuttles can be an important mechanism of transport of trace metals from the water column to the sediment. Both Mo and U isotopes also showed spatial variation across the LPMS, which was surprising because of the long residence times of these metals in seawater. This observation was particularly significant with regard to evaluating the utility of Mo and U isotopes as a proxy for the level of oxygenation of the global ocean in the past--our results show that the application of these proxies is not as simple as sometimes assumed, and local redox influences may be as important as global ones. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The broader impacts of our project emphasizes education and training of students.
