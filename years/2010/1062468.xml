<AbstractNarration>Research conducted under this grant will develop and test a new system of equations for global nonhydrostatic atmospheric models.   Current global atmospheric models assume that air motions are hydrostatic, which is an appropriate assumption provided that the grid spacing of the model is tens to hundreds of kilometers.  But increases in computing power have led to interest in global "cloud resolving" atmospheric models with much higher resolutions, from 1 to 10 kilometers, so that the nonhydrostatic motions occurring on the cloud scale can be resolved.  Such models are considered appropriate tools for studying a variety of multiscale atmospheric phenomena, and resolve the problems that arise due to the parameterization of convection in hydrostatic models.  For global hydrostatic models there is a standard form of the equations of motion, generally referred to as the "primitive equations", but a standardized set of equations for nonhydrostatic global models does not presently exist.  Work in this project will develop and test models based on the Unified System (UN) of equations.  The  UN system is applicable on a global domain and allows nonhydrostatic motions of meteorological interest while filtering out sound waves, which would otherwise complicate the numerical simulation of atmospheric motions.  The goal of the work is to test the UN system and compare it against alternative equations sets for nonhydrostatic global modeling, including the anelastic system, pseudo-incompressible, and the compressible systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will have broader impacts by contributing to the development of next-generation models to be used for the simulation and prediction of weather and climate.</AbstractNarration>
