<AbstractNarration>This award supports a Doctoral Research Workshop at the 2010 ACM International Conference on Intercultural Collaboration (ICIC 2010), August 18-20, 2010, in Copenhagen, Denmark. The intellectual goals of the ICIC Doctoral Research Workshop are to guide and develop the intellectual development of junior researchers through advising and feedback from experts in the topic, provide guidance in the selection of research topics and framing of research questions in the area of culture and collaboration technology and develop diversity in this grow in research community and ICIC related topics. The workshop will achieve these goals through student presentations and feedback, a poster session for all attendees of ICIC 2010, online non-archival publication of doctoral paper submissions, and other skill-building activities. Further the workshop will facilitate networking and build a cohort of researchers who are interested in research topics related to intercultural collaboration. The workshop will benefit the selected participants who are interested in cultural dimensions of human centered computing through focused training and development. It will generally benefit society as a whole by directing greater attention toward understanding and solving problems that arise in multicultural communication and collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
