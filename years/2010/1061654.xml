<AbstractNarration>New School University doctoral student Vasiliki Touhouliotis, supervised by Dr. Ann Stoler, will undertake research on the post-conflict effects of weapon technologies. Particular technologies may challenge the classic opposition of "wartime" and "peacetime." This research is important because, by tracking the people, objects, practices, and discourses around the weapons technologies and how they affect post-conflict life, her findings will improve our understanding of what the cessation of conflict means in practice and will inform policies to help societies adjust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will carry out  twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork throughout South Lebanon where hundreds of thousands of unexploded cluster bombs dropped during the 2006 War remain a source of material danger.  The researcher will employ a combination of appropriate social science methods. She will collect observational data from de-miners, residents in affected communities, people at victim rehabilitation centers, and participants in mine-risk education programs. She will conduct semi-structured interviews with a wide range of stakeholders, including affected individuals, farmers and other residents, local officials, and aid workers. She also will do content analysis of media materials.  These data will be used to address the following overarching questions: Do the unexploded cluster bombs prolong the time of war? What forms does this prolongation take? How does the temporal persistence of war affect the meaning and practices of conflict and post-conflict civil society?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By advancing understanding of daily life amongst unexploded bombs, this research will make an original contribution to social scientific theory of war and violence that does not rely on the opposition between war and peace. Findings will help humanitarian organizations and policy makers assess and understand the effects of violent conflict, and plan for and implement strategies for peace. Supporting this research also contributes to the education of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When this project was approved for funding, the NSF changed the original title "Weapons Between Wars: Cluster Bombs, Technological Failure and the Durability of War" to "Post-Conflict Social Impacts of Technological Failure." The abstract I submitted was similarly altered to reflect the new title, suggesting that the focus of my research was on the aftermath of conflict rather than on the protraction and resilence of war. In the Project Outcome Report that follows, I make clear that the focus of my research is indeed the durability of war and that my research critically challenges rather than accepts any concept of "post-conflict."  Project Overview  This research is about the millions of cluster bombs that Israel dropped on South Lebanon in the final days of the 2006 'July War.' Six years after the official end to the war between the Israeli Defense Forces and the Lebanese Resistance, hundreds of thousands of cluster bombs, which failed to explode upon impact with the ground, litter South Lebanon. My research is an ethnographic study of how this highly controversial conventional weapon prolongs the violence of war and renders it durable&mdash;both protracted and resilient&mdash;in unconventional ways. In my year- long fieldwork, I followed the work of sociologist Bruno Latour and hypothesized that the cluster bombs can be taken as actors that make war durable by assembling and disassembling networks of people, objects, institutions, practices and discourse to form new socio-material worlds. To generate ethnographic descriptions of these worlds of prolonged war, I followed the bombs and recorded their myriad manifestations as metaphors and materialities, pursuing their prolongation of war through their metamorphosis from armed munitions in minefields into shrapnel and shards and then into sutures and prosthetics, fields of organic olive trees and cultivated thyme, NGO offices and income generating projects.  As I pursued the cluster bombs and the networks of relations they assembled, severed and perpetually re-configured, I collected evidence on the social groups, practices, institutions and forms of intervention that the bombs produce and provoke; I listened to stories about them; I attended to how they destroyed certain forms of life and obligated new ones. In the end, I found that the materialities and socialities that congealed around the bombs re-draw the borders of the battlefield, elide the distinction between the state of war and the state of peace, and, in doing so, transform structures of injury, redistribute vulnerabilities and reconstitute the violence of war.  Research Findings:  1. The attempt to pacify the South by clearing the battlefields of the 2006 War from cluster bombs participates in the further militarization of the region given that de-mining relies on military knowledge, institutions and terminology, mimics the hierarchical structure and dress of military battalions, and is financed by some of the very agencies implicated in designing contemporary wars.  2. Interventions to mitigate and redress damages and injuries caused by cluster bombs participate in the constitution of the category of æwar victim.Æ Inclusion into this category not only makes available socio-medical services otherwise difficult to access in Lebanon, but also provides the injured with a set of concepts for understanding their injury and making claims based on it. Evidence collected on the disbursement of socio-medical services sheds light on how political party affiliation serves provide access to services.  3. Evidence collected from visiting farms and interviewing farmers indicates that cluster bombs detrimentally affect agriculture, which constitutes around 50% of South LebanonÆs economy, in many ways: from physically scarring tree trunks and requiring that they be re-planted, to inhibiting irrigation and fertilization thereby rendering them less productive. This has not only brought about changes to the agricultural make-up of t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
