<AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to explore novel 2D and 3D nanoplasmonic waveguides, especially for applications in nano-optic modulators and sensors.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposal addresses four important challenges in nanoplasmonics: (1) efficient integration of conventional and nanoplasmonic components, (2) efficient mode conversion to nano scale dimension, (3) practical 3D nanoplasmonic waveguides and (4) high performance nanoplasmonic modulators and sensors. &lt;br/&gt;The research proposes a radically different approach, founded on recent promising preliminary simulation results, and based on a slot waveguide and surface plasmonic design.&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate how to understand and apply this photon-matter interaction in nanoscale metal slots for efficient light wave-guiding. Exploration of these quantum effects may lead to novel, highly performing devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will help establish the fundamental theory and techniques for high efficiency nanoplasmonic devices. Students involved in the project will benefit from this advanced field of research. The PI will promote participation of under-represented students from the Women in Engineering program at RIT. The research activities will also be incorporated in college courses. In addition students will participate in outreach efforts to K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>
