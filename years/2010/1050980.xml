<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Comparative genomics, as a field, aims to identify functional regions in the genomes of plants and animals by comparing entire genomic DNA sequences. These bioinformatic comparisons have revealed regions of genomes that are highly conserved over long evolutionary times, yet little is known regarding their function. Most of these highly conserved DNA sequences occur in non-protein coding regions of genomes. This project aims to elucidate the function and evolution of the most slowly evolving portions of the Drosophila (fruit fly) genome. Because they are so highly conserved, it is anticipated these regions of the Drosophila genome have important functions. Fruit flies will be studied because they can be experimentally manipulated using sophisticated genetic and molecular methods. This project is a collaborative effort led by computational biologist Andrew Kern, responsible for the bioinformatic aspects of the research, and by developmental biologist Daniel Barbash, responsible for the experimental studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The PI  will collaborate with Nancy Serrell, the Director of Dartmouth College?s Office of Outreach, to identify interested high school science teachers in the local area and coordinate organization of on-site hands-on workshops for high school students. The project will use a  ?cascade? approach to bring computational biological methods into the high school  classroom, whereby Dr. Kern will collaborate with local high school teachers to develop lesson plans that will be tested and refined by Dr. Kern and the high school teacher partners,and implemented in classrooms with assistance from graduate and undergraduate students in the Kern Lab. Lesson plans will provide students with significant hands-on application comparing genomes using bioinformatic programs and web-based analysis tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All free-living organisms on earth use DNA to encode the information necessary them to develop, and to pass on this information to future generations.  Because all life animals have descended from a common ancestor, one can observe similarities in the DNA sequences of all animals, but also that some sequences change, and more changes are observed between animals that evolved from a common ancestor at more distant times in the past.  It is also notable that the amount of DNA sequence change is not constant, and that some regions of the genome, the complete set of DNA within a species, change at very low rates.  Evolutionary biologists interpret DNA regions with low rates of change as being of special importance to the organism, the logic being that particularly important DNA regions will change very little because any change will alter DNA function in a way that is likely to be detrimental.     Drosophila (fruit flies) are often used for studies of DNA sequence change, because they are inexpensive and economical to work with, they have been intensively studied for over 100 years, and they have about 20-fold less than DNA than humans.  We performed a comprehensive analysis across 12 Drosophila species, to identify about 100 "ultraconserved regions" - regions of the fruitfly genome that are changing much more slowly than the rest of the genome.  We in particular focused on ultraconserved regions that are not located near genes that encode proteins, reasoning that they may have novel biological functions.  We discovered that several of these regions are transcribed into the molecule RNA, but are unlikely to be translated into proteins.  RNA molecules can have diverse functions in cells, including structural and regulatory functions.  We propose that the newly discovered, highly conserved RNAs identified are strong candidates for having novel biological functions.
