<AbstractNarration>This project proposes the development of a new type of superconducting electrical machines based on a stationary superconducting field coil and a superconducting dual armature rotor. This configuration, combined with a low heat leak construction and a method for reducing AC losses in the armature enables a fully superconducting machine that can achieve the highest power per unit mass based on well developed, cost effective, currently available superconducting materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research is transformative: it proposes (i) A novel design for low speed, high torque electrical machines with unprecedented energy density, (ii) A topology where both field and armature are superconducting, (iii) a coil configuration that enables development of rotating machinery with iron-free core (allowing a several fold increase in field density), (iv) a method of reducing heat leak and AC losses in the armature of the machine, enabling the use of  reliable, inexpensive, low temperature superconductors with reasonable refrigeration requirements. This will enable the design of next-generation electrical machinery with unparalleled power density, quench safety, reliability, and electrical performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: (i) High torque density electrical machines have the potential to become the next generation power generation systems for applications where optimal power to mass ratio is critical, and lightweight, reliable, efficient electrical machinery is required, such as wind turbine generators, marine propulsion motors, and land vehicle propulsion motors. (ii) Contribution to the state of the art: new coil and machine topologies, and new approaches for design, analysis and simulation of superconducting machines are presented.</AbstractNarration>

This project involved the design and construction of a proof of concept novel electrical machine topology (dual armature) that enables the optimal use of magnetic field flux within the machine by incorporating a secondary coaxial armature that links the flux lines from the field structure to the machine's shaft. In conventional machines, only the flux lines oriented towards the stator coils can effectively generate induced voltage. This enables the design and construction of generators of substantially higher power density (power output per unit mass), which is particularly critical in contemporary machine applications where weight is critical, such as wind turbine generators and electric vehicles.   2. In the field of wind power generation, the proposed machine provides several substantial improvements, namely:  - the proposed architecture can be used as low-speed direct drive machine, avoiding the need of an external gear reduction.  - the elimination of gear reduction represents a significant contribution to wind power generation, since gear boxes for wind generators are a significant component of the total mass and cost, besides other reliability and maintenance costs.  3. A novel hybrid modeling and simulation technique is being developed that will enable the coupled simulation of transient dynamic effects in the proposed machine using geometry-dependent parameters (such as self inductance and coenergy) obtained from finite element analysis.  Computation of geometry-dependent parameters in electrical machines is very computationally intensive, in particular when 3D models are used.
