<AbstractNarration>PI Name: Kam Leang &lt;br/&gt;Institution Name: University of Nevada Reno &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: The NSF GK-12 E-Fellowship Program: Toward Energy-Aware STEM Leaders for the 21st Century &lt;br/&gt;Proposal ID: 1045584&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ?E? in the E-Fellowship Program stands for energy, the program?s main theme (graduate research fellows are referred to as ?E-Fellows?). The goal is to prepare E-Fellows to become future STEM leaders in the field of energy and be ?energy aware?. To do so, E-Fellows will be partnered with middle and high school teachers across four schools in the Washoe County School District (WCSD) to bring their STEM energy-related research into K-12 classrooms via inquiry- and project-based activities. Research topics include energy harvesting using smart materials, nanomaterials for photovoltaics, hydrogen energy and storage, biomass and biofuels, geothermal, wind energy, and efficient power grid systems. By involving local Nevada energy industries (e.g., NV Energy and Ormat Nevada), this program will strengthen the relationship between UNR, the WCSD, and the local and regional community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to pedagogical and instructional training, E-Fellows will benefit from strengthened leadership, communication, teaching, grantsmanship, budgeting, time management, team building, and professional service skills to help prepare them for academic and/or industry duties after graduation. Teachers will benefit from participation through earning graduate professional development credits, development of exciting new curricula, and forging of strong university ties.  Field trips (including international trips) will strengthen content knowledge and help build camaraderie among the participants and will provide energy-related local connections that can be used in the classroom. A traveling energy science/technology lab, the E-Mobile, will be outfitted with energy-related demonstrations and hands-on projects (some created by fellow/teacher partners and students) to support energy demonstrations and exhibits to excite students and the community.</AbstractNarration>
