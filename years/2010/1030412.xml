<AbstractNarration>This project provides support for US students to attend the 8th IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications &lt;br/&gt;(PerCom 2010), which will be held in Mannheim, Germany between March 29th, 2010 and April 2nd, 2010. IEEE PerCom is the premier technical forum in the rapidly emerging and important area of pervasive computing and networking. Graduate student participation in a key conference like IEEE PerCom is extremely important part of graduate education and would help motivate students to engage in research in a variety of pervasive computing aspects. The European venue for the conference will further help US students to interact with European researchers. The grant primarily supports students who will not be able to a attend the conference otherwise.</AbstractNarration>
