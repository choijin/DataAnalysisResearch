<AbstractNarration>This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Jonas Peters at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to investigate (phosphinoborate)iron(I) compounds that are structurally unusual by virtue of their relatively low coordination numbers and geometry.  These complexes feature iron-nitrogen multiple bonds.  These complexes have been found to mediate C-O cleavage pathways that effect partial or complete CO extrusion or reductive C-C coupling to produce oxalate.  The synthesis of monometallic and bimetallic iron(oxo) species will also be explored particularly in terms of dihydrogen activation.  Finally, the ability to activate carbon dioxide and release iron carbonyl products opens the door to using carbon dioxide as a synthon for C-C coupling reactions that exploit CO as a carbene or carbyne precursor.  The synthesis and reactivities of iron(carbenes) and (carbynes) with hydrogen will also be investigated. In addition to the reductive degradation of carbon dioxide which may have important ramifications for the reduction of greenhouse gases and the development of new methods of carbon management, this research will encourage undergraduate and graduate students to become sensitive to energy conversion issues as they enter their chemical careers.</AbstractNarration>

Peters  Project Title: Fe-mediated C-O cleavage and C-C bond forming reactions from CO2 and CO substrates  Award No.: 1062716  Research Activities:  Our major research activities focus on the synthesis of new iron and other transition metal coordination targets due to their affinity for reacting with CO/CO2 in reactions that may lead to more valuable chemicals.  We are also exploring nickel, palladium, and platinum complexes of unusual geometries, as they might reveal new C-H bond activation reactions.  Our program will enable us to explore chemistry relevant to Fe-mediated C-O cleavage and C-C bond formation from CO2 and CO. We have discovered a host of multi-electron group transfer processes. We have found that certain tris(phosphino)borate supported iron(I) species, [PhBPR3]Fe(I), react with CO2 to mediate (i) C-O cleavage pathways for partial or complete CO extrusion, or (ii) reductive C-C coupling to produce oxalate. Such reactivity is highly unusual for later first row metals and warrants detailed exploration.  Due to its vast supply and proposed role in global warming, CO2 would be an ideal source for fine chemicals and fuels. Transfer of an oxygen atom from CO2 is thus desirable but difficult, due to the stability of CO2. Nature employs late transition metals in a [NiFe] bimetallic core that facilitates this transformation. In contrast to this, most examples of coordination complexes that deoxygenate CO2 feature early transition, lanthanide and actinide metals.  Examples of later metals displaying similar reactivity are comparatively rare.  An alternative transformation involves direct coupling of two CO2 molecules to form oxalate, but well-defined, homogeneous metal complexes that mediate this reaction remain uncommon. To our knowledge, there is only one such reported system.  Our group is interested in the small molecule chemistry triggered by unusual oxidation states and geometries of iron. Recently, we have become interested in the tris(phosphine)borane ligand (o-iPr2PC6H4)3B, or iPrTPB, developed by Borissou and coworkers. We hypothesized that we could exploit the coordinative flexibility of the boron center and stabilize geometries conducive to both high and low oxidation state intermediates.  We have found that iPrTPB does coordinate iron in the desired manner, with all three phosphines bound.

We are also investigating two routes to C-O bond cleavage: O-atom abstraction and O-atom functionalization. In the first method, we will add early transition metal complexes to a metal carbonyl species to encourage M-O bond formation and C-O bond cleavage. The second method will attempt to functionalize the oxygen atom, thereby weakening the C-O bond and allowing for easier cleavage. This method was used recently in our group to generate an iron-siloxycarbyne species where the M-O bond was formed, though C-O bond cleavage was ultimately not realized.  Furthermore, we have synthesized and studied a series of novel, Group 10 metal complexes of the tris(phosophino)silyl ligand [SiPR3]. The unique steric and electronic properties of this ligand provide access to a series of trigonal bipyramidal cations {[SiPR3]M(L)}+ that feature weakly-coordinated ligands in the apical position.  In the platinum system, the phenyl-substituted ligand enables coordination of weak donor ligands such as dichloromethane, diethyl ether, and benzene. The solid-state structure of the toluene adduct shows a close contact between the cationic metal center and an aryl C-H bond, which could be an unusual example of a directly o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
