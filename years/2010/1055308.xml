<AbstractNarration>This CAREER proposal aims at the development of a single-chip reconfigurable MEMS filter platform&lt;br/&gt;for multi-band, multi-standard radios through fusion of acoustoelectrically amplified nano-mechanical&lt;br/&gt;filters and 3D tunable components. Reconfigurable filters can greatly enhance the performance and&lt;br/&gt;reduce the size of RF front-ends, and as such have received great attention for effective and low-power&lt;br/&gt;processing of the frequency spectrum. Despite their great promise, lack of integration and narrow&lt;br/&gt;frequency coverage of current reconfigurable filters continue to hinder their use in practical applications.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, current technologies have failed to reduce the size of filters without deteriorating critical&lt;br/&gt;performance metrics such as loss, power handling and termination impedance. To-date, a versatile and&lt;br/&gt;reconfigurable filter array platform does not exist in monolithic form, an important problem that has&lt;br/&gt;remained unsolved despite major advancement in MEMS. This proposal tackles the fundamental issues&lt;br/&gt;related to reconfigurable filter arrays and proposes a novel technique that offers frequency, bandwidth and&lt;br/&gt;amplitude tunability through integration of narrow-band acoustic filters with tunable lumped filters.&lt;br/&gt;These are believed to be the most prominent steps toward the realization of a single-chip multi-band lowpower&lt;br/&gt;radio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits: The proposed work explores a new approach to developing integrated reconfigurable&lt;br/&gt;filters with wide tuning range and reduced loss. This new approach relies on the acoustoelectric effect, a&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon caused by interactions between electrons and phonons. Using this effect, which is most&lt;br/&gt;effective in nano-scale, a new class of nano-mechanical acoustic filters with potentially negative loss (i.e.&lt;br/&gt;positive gain) will be developed. This will yield new opportunities for acoustic devices and&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation. In addition, using advanced 3D micromachining techniques microscale tunable lumped&lt;br/&gt;components with unparalleled Qs exceeding 150 and wide tuning range will be developed. The high-Q&lt;br/&gt;tunable passives will be utilized to reduce parasitics of acoustic filters and assist in tuning their frequency&lt;br/&gt;response. The PI will leverage her prior work on high-Q passives and micro-fabrication techniques&lt;br/&gt;towards this proposed research. Along with the experimental work, the proposed research aims to&lt;br/&gt;advance the scientific community?s understanding of the physical phenomena that govern the&lt;br/&gt;performance of the proposed MEMS arrays and new technologies that overcome these physical limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research enables on-chip reconfigurable high-Q filtering, eliminating&lt;br/&gt;many of the redundant components in RF transceivers, which results in drastically smaller form factor and&lt;br/&gt;reduced power consumption. In a cellular phone, elimination of only one off-chip fixed-frequency filter&lt;br/&gt;as well as the associated matching network using the proposed technique reduces the transmit printed&lt;br/&gt;circuit board area by more than 75%, while lowering the bill-of-materials. As such, the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will have transformative impact on telecommunication. The reconfigurable MEMS filters developed in&lt;br/&gt;this CAREER program could have far-reaching applications beyond wireless communication ranging&lt;br/&gt;from medical ultrasonic imaging to non-contact sensing. In addition to the outlined research effort, an&lt;br/&gt;integrated educational program will be established which aims to educate students through direct&lt;br/&gt;participation in the research activities. The outreach efforts of this project are aimed at promoting&lt;br/&gt;diversity among engineers and scientists and specifically increasing the proportion of women in&lt;br/&gt;engineering to a healthy level (&gt;30%). To reach this goal and to motivate and educate students, the PI&lt;br/&gt;will pursue the following avenues: (1) Educational outreach through School of Education to high school&lt;br/&gt;teachers to observe the classroom dynamics in the 6th and 7th grades where female students start to lose&lt;br/&gt;interest in engineering as well as summer outreach programs to expose high school students to the field of&lt;br/&gt;MEMS by involving them in the proposed research activities; (2) Involvement of undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;from underrepresented groups in PI?s research and educational activities; (3) Creating a multi-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;scientific learning environment for students and training several doctoral students; (4) Introduction of a&lt;br/&gt;new graduate course on RF MEMS. Students will gain research experience and discover real world&lt;br/&gt;applications of RF MEMS through team projects in a laboratory setting; (5) Dissemination of the&lt;br/&gt;scientific results of this research.</AbstractNarration>
