<AbstractNarration>Representation theory provides concrete models to study various symmetries in nature and has been a central theme in mathematics and physics. Many research groups world wide do research related to representation theory from various perspectives using different tools. Thus it is especially important that a graduate student working in this area has exposure to some of the breadth of the area. In order to strengthen graduate education in representation theory and help our graduate students gain international working experiences, a joint US-China Summer School on Representation theory will be held at East China Normal University in Shanghai during July 12-26, 2010. The program will feature five short courses given by leading experts on quantum affine algebras and Kac-Moody algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal provides travel supports for a group of US graduate students to attend a 2-week Summer School program in East China Normal University, Shanghai, China, as well as the international workshop at the end of the summer school. In the allocation of travel funds we will give preference to women and other minorities and underrepresented groups. The summer activities will strengthen the graduate education of US students in representation theory by providing unprecedented opportunities for them to gain insights on the mathematics, and it will also provide them with a wealth of international working experiences.</AbstractNarration>
