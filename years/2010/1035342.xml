<AbstractNarration>The Tufts University Urban Mathematics and Science Teacher Collaborative is a collaboration among three Tufts University Arts and Sciences departments (Education, Mathematics, and Physics &amp; Astronomy) and three Boston public schools in the 5-12 grade range (Boston Arts Academy, Fenway High School, and Mission Hill School). A local non-profit organization, the Center for Applied Special Technologies (CAST) is providing professional development around Universal Design for Learning (UDL), a framework for designing curriculum and instruction to address barriers to learning. The Collaborative is preparing 16 new Mathematics and Science Teaching Fellows (TFs), and contributing to the development of 4 Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) over 6 years. It builds on more than 10 years of experience in the preparation of teachers for work in urban schools through the Urban Teacher Training Collaborative (UTTC), a school-based teacher residency program in which pre-service teachers work in their assigned schools full-time for a full academic year under the guidance of mentor teachers and university professors while earning a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree.  Two new courses integrating science and mathematics content with pedagogy are being developed collaboratively by education and STEM faculty in the physics and mathematics departments. Ongoing professional development is provided  through the creation of an online community (through Digital Toolboxes and blogs) to encourage communication and discussion among TFs, MTFs, University Participants, and CAST. The courses, course materials, examples of effective teaching, and teacher discussion forums are being built as free, open-source, cross-platform modules that universities and schools can use and modify under Creative Commons licensing. The project seeks to increase teachers' understanding of the challenges of teaching in urban settings; increase the numbers and retention of teachers of Mathematics and Science in urban schools; transform teachers' practices in Mathematics and Science;  increase student understanding and performance in Science and Mathematics for students taught by TF and MTFs; and develop stronger relationships with local urban schools.</AbstractNarration>

The project came out of more than ten years of experience in the preparation of teachers for work in urban schools through the Urban Teacher Training Collaborative (UTTC) at Tufts University.  The project deepened subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge of teachers of mathematics and science.  New classes in mathematics and physics were offered especially for the TFs in which science or mathematics education content was combined with subject matter content.  For example, in the mathematics course, TFs explored the mathematics behind the mathematics they would be teaching so that they would understand the material they would teach at a deeper level.  They investigated corresponding educational content for the material they would teach.  Along with CAST the Tufts team taught the underlying principles of UDL in order to eliminate barriers to learning for students who have struggled to be successful with rigorous academic courses.  The MTFs and Tufts team worked to retain teachers of mathematics and science in urban schools by providing regular mentorship, classroom visits, and informal meetings, thereby developing a community of TFs, MTFs, and Tufts colleagues.  TFs, MTFs, CAST, and the Tufts team met at least three times a semester in Saturday symposia in which the group worked together on UDL, subject matter content, challenges teaching in urban schools, and sharing teaching practices.  Participants communicated informally throughout the year.  TFs started a book group in which they read books on diversity and racism within the society and classroom with MTFs and members of the Tufts team.  They started a problem-solving club in which they shared challenging problems for their students, and they played with math and science.  TFs and MTFs worked with CAST and Tufts faculty on understanding student thinking.  This mentorship was effective and 15 of the original 16 TFs received their Master of Arts in Teaching and taught four years in high-needs schools (two middle school mathematics , four high school physics/science , nine  high school mathematics).  A sixteenth TF was excused for medical reasons.  In addition, 6 of the TFs found the program so valuable that they continued for an extra year receiving mentorship as they continued to  teach in high-needs schools. Two other TFs joined in the middle of the program, (one elementary STEM, one high school mathematics).  They added diversity of perspective to the program, and they continue to teach in urban high-needs schools.   In 2018, after 5 years, 75% of the TFs were still teaching in high-needs schools as compared to a 48% average in Massachusetts.     Our project attracted a more diverse and stronger pool of candidates to Tufts University for the teaching of mathematics and science.  Almost 30% of TFs in the project are people of color.  The project and the Noyce community that developed have produced educational leaders in their teaching communities. One math TF alumna is a leader in her middle school developing dialogue on cultural competency.  She has done cultural competency workshops, and she was featured in a KQED article about how teachers understand and address racial bias.  A math teacher alumnus been very active in education policy.
