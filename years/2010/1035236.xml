<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to improve the ability to track the orbits of space debris and thereby reduce the frequency of collisions.  The approach is based on two scientific advances: 1) optimizing the scheduling of data transmission from a future constellation of orbiting Cubesats to ground stations located worldwide, and 2) using satellite data to improve models of the ionosphere and thermosphere, which in turn are used to improve estimates of atmospheric density.  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Robust capacity-constrained scheduling depends on fundamental research on optimization algorithms for nonlinear problems involving both discrete and continuous variables.  This objective depends on advances in optimization theory and computational techniques.  Model refinement depends on adaptive control algorithms, and can lead to fundamental advances for automatic control systems.  These contributions provide new ideas and techniques that are broadly applicable to diverse areas of science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Improving the ability to predict the trajectories of space debris can render the space environment safer in both the near term---by enhancing astronaut safety and satellite reliability---and the long term---by suppressing cascading collisions that could have a devastating impact on the usage of space.  This project will impact real-world practice by developing techniques that are applicable to large-scale modeling and data collection, from weather prediction to Homeland Security. The research results will impact education through graduate and undergraduate research as well as through interdisciplinary modules developed for courses in space science, satellite engineering, optimization, and data-based modeling taught across multiple disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This project was motivated by the increasingly pressing need for models of the troposphere-ionosphere that are sufficiently accurate to provide reliable predictions of objects in low-Earth orbit. Each collision of orbiting objects creates hundreds or thousands of additional objects, each of which is a threat to other objects. This is an unstable feedback process since each piece of debris can generate yet more pieces. There is thus a real danger that the once-pristine space environment may become permanently dangerous and increasingly unusable.  The major goal of this project was thus to develop technology that is relevant to the design and implementation of a CPS system consisting of CubeSats for monitoring the near-Earth space weather environment.          The key contributions are as follows. For modeling the troposphere-ionosphere, we used the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model, which is a CFD code with atmospheric chemistry, as the basis for data assimilation, input estimation, and subsystem identification. Data assimilation was implemented by interfacing GITM with the ensemble-based Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) code developed by project collaborators at NCAR. These results were reported demonstrated the ability to assimilate satellite data was demonstrated using a highly realistic atmospheric code.      As an alternative approach to ensemble-based data assimilation, we applied retrospective-cost-based adaptive input and state estimation (RCAISE) to GITM in order to estimate unknown drivers (inputs) to the ionosphere-thermosphere.  This approach complements DART since the main goal of RCAISE is to estimate the unknown input rather than obtain estimates of all model states. Since RCAISE is not an ensemble code, it is highly computationally efficient compared to DART, but, unlike DART, it provides best estimates rather than a probability density function. A related approach was previously demonstrated in to identify a subsystem cooling model whose dynamics are inaccessible in the sense that neither the input nor the output of the cooling subsystem dynamics are measured.      Post-launch calibration techniques were developed for spacecraft that collect data for atmospheric modeling. This effort ties into the development of Cubesats at the University of Michigan, several of which are currently in orbit. New techniques were developed for calibrating on-board sensors after the spacecraft reaches its specified orbit. In particular, low-cost photoelectric and magnetic-field sensors typically lose calibration due to the launch and space environment. Through a combination of physics modeling and data analysis the accuracy of on-board sensors was enhanced through ground-based re-calibration. This re-calibration accounts for time-varying electrical and magnetic fields, the Earth's spatially varying magnetic field, and sensor degradation.      Transferring data from a constellation of satellites is challenging due to power and energy constraints, orbit trajectory, and the location, gain, and field of view of available ground-based stations. This leads to a capacity-constrained scheduling problem. These issues were addressed by developing real-time scheduling algorithms for modeling and optimizing space networks to optimize communication capacity.
