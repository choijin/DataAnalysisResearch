<AbstractNarration>SES-0961995&lt;br/&gt;Pamela M. Paxton&lt;br/&gt;Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0962034&lt;br/&gt;Melanie M. Hughes&lt;br/&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the investigators link world polity and social networks to inform the development of a new over-time measure of country-level connectedness to the world polity, labeled the "INGO Network Country Score." This measure will score countries by their centrality in the world country-INGO network. The resulting published dataset will be useful to a cross-disciplinary audience. In a second part of the project, an in-depth analysis is carried out on one domain of INGOs-Women's International Nongovernmental Organizations, or WINGOs. The investigators draw upon theories of the international women?s movement to provide testable theories about expected changes in the WINGO network structure over time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will have broad impact for academic researchers in the fastest growing areas of political sociology and political science. The dataset generated here will provide a substantial resource for researchers who study global processes, international organizations, and cross-national outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
