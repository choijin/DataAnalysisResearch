<AbstractNarration>Professor Mu-Hyun Baik of Indiana University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop a rational design for the synthesis of new organometallic catalysts for CO2 reduction. A series of integrated computational and experimental studies are proposed that aim at delineating the mechanism of CO2 activation with Tanaka's [Ru(tpy)(bpy)(CO)]2+ catalytic system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will lay the foundation for the systematic development of new catalytic systems with cheap Fe/Co centers as a viable substitute for expensive ruthenium-based catalysts for CO2 reduction to commercially-important starting materials. A Graduate students and a postdoc will be trained in integrated theoretical and experimental approaches towards the design of practical catalytic systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Utilizing CO2 for chemical sythesis is an important goal for future green technologies. Currently the most common primary product of CO2 reduction catalysis is formic acid, which is not a desirable product and must be further processed to afford technically useful products.

Our work revealed several new concepts about how to reduce CO2 and form C-C bond simulataneously suggesting a potential strategy towards designing new C-C coupling catalysts:  (1) A straightforward sequence of steps that can be envisioned for CO2 reduction catalysis coupled to C-C bond formation is shown in Figure 1.
