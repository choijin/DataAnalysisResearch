<AbstractNarration>The goal of this CAREER project from Professor Liam McAllister at Cornell University is to provide compelling theoretical models of the early universe -- in particular, models of inflation in string theory -- and to use these ideas to interpret the coming generation of cosmological observations.  Cosmology has made spectacular strides in the last decade, emerging as a precise experimental science with profound connections to fundamental physics.  Recent observations are remarkably consistent with the predictions of inflation, which describes explosive expansion before the hot Big Bang.  Inflation builds on quantum field theory and general relativity, and is sensitive to the interplay between them, i.e. to the ultraviolet completion of gravity. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of inflation requires a theory of quantum gravity, such as string theory. Moreover, by probing inflation through cosmological observations, one can examine physics at the highest energy scales, and shed light on the physical laws that governed the beginning of our universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity is also envisioned to have significant Broader Impacts.  Specifically, the PI plans to communicate some of the compelling, urgent problems at the core of modern physics to high-school students and science teachers in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in New York City. To achieve this, the PI will begin by lecturing to an audience of public school teachers from New York City; then hold a professional development workshop for interested teachers, focusing on key questions of modern physics outside the standard curriculum; and finally, visit participating teachers' classrooms. By forming and maintaining long-term relationships with teachers, the PI will be able to assess the results on an ongoing basis and recalibrate the presentations as needed.  The PI will have the assistance of a dedicated Cornell outreach coordinator for all of these activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the last century, continuing advances in technology have allowed experimental physicists to reveal natural phenomena at ever-increasing energies.  Theorists, closely guided by these experiments, have invented ever-better approximations to the fundamental laws of nature.  For this pattern of progress to continue through the twenty-first century, we must look outward, to the sky: important clues about fundamental physics lie at energies that are many orders of magnitude beyond our current colliders, and will never be accessed on Earth.  To reveal the laws underlying gravity and quantum mechanics, observations of the cosmos are our best hope.  Quantum-mechanical effects immediately after the Big Bang created a pattern of vibrations of space-time known as primordial gravitational waves.  These waves imprint the laws of quantum gravity on the sky, but the message could be too faint to be seen through the glow of our galaxy.  Experiments in the next two decades should either detect primordial gravitational waves or place strong limits on their existence.  For these experiments to have maximal scientific impact, we must ask what a detection would teach us about the laws of nature.  The principal intellectual outcome of this project is a detailed understanding of the connection between primordial gravitational waves and string theory, which is our leading theory of quantum gravity.  We invented new cosmological models in string theory, determined the patterns that they would create on the sky, and compared to the patterns seen by telescopes in space.  We then connected these results to ideas from elsewhere in physics and mathematics, including six-dimensional geometry and the statistics of matrices.  This work connects the quantum physics of the very small to the gravitational physics of the universe as a whole.  It also links string theory, which is difficult to test in terrestrial experiments, to current and planned experiments in cosmology.  The main outcome in the direction of broader impacts was a teacher training program.  We worked with a large number of public school teachers from New York City and from upstate New York, sharing some of the excitement of contemporary theory and experiment in cosmology.  Through a series of teacher training workshops, combining lectures with hands-on training on laboratory demos, we equipped these teachers to transfer an awareness of the science of the cosmos to their students.  Demos were made available through a lending library program.       Last Modified: 11/28/2016       Submitted by: Liam P Mcallister]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
