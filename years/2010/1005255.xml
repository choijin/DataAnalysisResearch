<AbstractNarration>1005255&lt;br/&gt;Herrero-Bervera&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition and upgrade of equipment in the University of Hawaii Rock and Paleomagnetism Laboratory.   An existing but no longer functional spinner magnetometer, for magnetic remanence measurements of strongly magnetized samples (e.g., recent volcanics), will be refurbished, and an aged Kappabridge, for the measurement of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility for petrofabric investigations, will be replaced.   The instruments will support a broad range of paleomagnetic and rock magnetic research that relies on magnetic remanence directional analyses and relative and absolute paleointensity measurements to study the behavior of the Earth's magnetic field and elucidate its physical origin and dynamics and for basic studies of paleogeography of relevance to understanding Earth's plate tectonic motions.   The instruments will support faculty and student research and research training and will remain an open analytical facility for visiting scientists.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

Picture showing the brand new MFK1-FA Kappabridge instrument already installed and working at the SOESTHIGP Petrofabrics and Paleomagnetics Laboratory of the University of Hawaii  After the installation and set up was completed,  we have been conducting the pertinent tests to make sure the instrument is working according to the specifications from the manufacturing company.        We have been conducting research regarding the determination of azimuths of dikes within a dike swarm in the  Koolau Volcano, Oahu Hawaii. We have sampled in great detail several dikes to decipher their flow direction and test the new MFK1-FA instrument. Figure 2 shows the sampling technique and Figure 3 shows the results of the AMS test.  In addition to the magnetic anisotropy instrument we were able to incorporate the CS3 attachment to determine Curie points of rocks by using the low-field susceptibility versus temperature (k-T) properties of the materials understudy as can be seen in Figure #4.                    We have also requested funds to rebuilt our JR5A Spinner magnetometer and the grant also included a small portion of the funds to do the much needed refurbishing of the instrument. The magnetometer was rebuilt and now is back in operation to measure the NRM of our specimens of all our projects funded by NSF, Figure 5 shows the  JR5A instrument.   Therefore,  we have upgraded our SOEST-HIGP Petrofabrics and Paleomagnetics Laboratory of the University of Hawaii by installing the "state of the art"   MFK1-FA Multi-Function Kappabridge Spinner Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) instrument, repaired the JR5A Spinner magnetometer  and attached to the Kappabridge the CS3 attachment that will allow us to determine Curie points of our rocks under study.
