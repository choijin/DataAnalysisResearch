<AbstractNarration>The National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Radio Frequencies is comprised of prominent scientists and engineers who provide studies and advice to the Academy on issues involving scientific uses of the radio spectrum. Such uses often involve techniques and applications that are outside the realm of traditional radio spectrum applications. The Committee provides advice and guidance to the FCC (through filings in appropriate FCC proceedings) and other regulatory bodies toward the adoption of spectrum rules and policies needed to protect sensitive science applications that make use of the radio spectrum, particularly in the fields of radio astronomy, meteorology, remote sensing, oceanography, and some other sciences. Because of the multi-disciplinary aspect of the Committee's goals, it is supported by both the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The full Committee, comprised of 15 members, meets regularly, twice a year, and between meetings it works on crafting comments and other written documents in response to various regulatory proceedings. Some recent publications are: Handbook of Frequency Allocations and Spectrum Protection for Scientific Uses (National Academies Press, 2007) and Spectrum Management for Science in the 21st Century (National Academies Press, 2009). The Committee also sends representatives to appropriate meetings of scientific (e.g., the International Union of Radio Scientists) and policy-setting bodies (e.g., the International Telecommunication Union) to help publicize their positions. The Committee has been in existence for many years, and the current award will continue National Science Foundation support through fiscal year 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This proposal is not for scientific research, but it constitutes fundamental support for protecting the infrastructure that allows carrying out such research. There is a need to protect the scientific uses of the spectrum, particularly in view of the ever increasing number of commercial uses, particularly wireless applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: 1) Without CORF as a watchdog, much of radio astronomy and remote sensing might become impossible within just a few years, as the radio spectrm becomres more and more crowded. 2) CORF's outreach activities to specialized audiences, such as the FCC and to the general public, about the need of scientists to have access to portions of the radio spectrum and 3) CORF's attempt to involve younger scientists in engineering and spectrum management issues are also deemed to contribute to the broader impact of the committee.  &lt;br/&gt;The Committee maintains a website, where CORF filings are available, along with presentations at the meetings and other useful information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Committee on Radio Frequencies (CORF) brings the prestige of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to the protection of the radio frequency interests of scientific users of the radio spectrum. CORF is a body of expert radio astronomers and Earth remote sensing scientists and engineers who use the same portions of the spectrum for research as communications companies (e.g. mobile phones and GPS) do for their business services.   CORF's chief task is to coordinate the needs for radio-frequency allocations and protection from radio-frequency interference for U.S. scientific research. CORF brings together representatives from such fields as space science, radio astronomy, atmospheric science, oceanography, and remote sensing. As an activity of the National Research Council (NRC), CORF provides independent, external advice that must pass NRC review before it is delivered to the federal government.  The frequency needs of the scientific and related engineering communities have become greater as radio research techniques and instruments have become more sophisticated and sensitive. For many researchers, CORF serves as a channel for presenting their needs to federal regulatory agencies and for protecting their frequencies from encroachment by commercial competition. CORF represents the interests of both nongovernmental scientists and federally supported scientists.  A major CORF activity is participation in public proceedings before the Federal Communications Commission regarding allocation and assignment of radio frequencies and other regulatory matters. CORF filings provide information on radio science frequency matters to commercial radio interests, who often become aware of the needs of the scientific community through them.  CORF has submitted 12 filings to the FCC on various matters that have potential impact on radio astronomy (RAS) and/or Earth remote sensing (EESS).  Another major CORF activity was the execution and completion of its report, "Views of the U.S. NAS and NAE on Agenda Items at the World Radiocommunication Conference 2015."  The World Radiocommunication Conference is a periodic gathering of United Nations members who set international spectrum policy usage guidelines through the Conference proceedings.  CORFÆs report presents the NAS and National Academy of EngineeringÆs views on topics that affect RAS and EESS, and includes a list of each agenda item, how each affects science, and the committee's recommendations.   Yet another major CORF activity was the initiation of the independent study committee which is currently surveying the scientific use of the radio spectrum.  CORF was responsible for circumscribing the scope of work for this new committee and provided input on membership.  CORF meets each spring at the Keck Center of the National Academies in Washington, D.C. and each fall at various locations in the western United States.   Spring meetings are used for dialogue between CORF members, agency representatives, and others. This venue is a unique opportunity for frequency managers from various agencies to meet with each other and with members of the radio science community. Such an opportunity is important to disseminate and exchange information.   Fall meetings are designed for the committee to focus on current research and to work on dissemination materials, outreach opportunities, and other items supporting the work of the committee, as well as to strategize for the upcoming year.   The direct URL for the CORF website is http://sites.nationalacademies.org/BPA/BPA_048819. CORF comments, reply comments, letters, reference material, and presentations made at its meetings are posted on the CORF website. The CORF website provides links to many other sites involved with radio frequency issues.  CORF serves a valuable role in educating the scientific community, the government, and the public concerning the impact of radio frequency interference on scientific uses of the spectrum.
