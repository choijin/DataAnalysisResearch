<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Fillmore Freeman at the University of California - Irvine.  The research projects supported in this site are in broad areas of chemistry.  Undergraduates will be recruited to this site primarily from institutions that lack infrastructure to support undergraduate research, including students from underrepresented groups.  The site will support twelve students per summer in a ten week program.  A sample of the projects that undergraduates will work on include:  (1) the development of density functional theory with Prof. Kieron Burke; (2)  the creation of inexpensive DNA array biosensors with Prof. Robert Corn; (3)  development of new electronic structure methods with Prof. Filipp Furche; (4)  the study of single molecules on solid surfaces with state-of-the-art tunneling microscopies with Prof. Wilson Ho; (5) the design and synthesis of epoxides and aziridines using organocatlaysts with Prof. Elizabeth Jarvo; and (6) the chemical biology and structural enzymology of natural product biosynthesis with Prof. Sheryl Tsai.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including ethics training, and participants will also have opportunities for presentation of research at national disciplinary meetings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide research training using state-of-the-art facilities in a broad range of topics in the chemical sciences.  Undergraduate researchers participating in this site will have significant, hands-on access to sophisticated research tools.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
