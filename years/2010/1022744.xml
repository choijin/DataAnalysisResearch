<AbstractNarration>There has been tremendous growth in Latinos across the U.S. in the last two decades. Despite this growth, our understanding of Latino youth development is relatively limited due, in part, to traditional theories of development that emphasize the role of cognitions and parenting. However, contemporary theoretical conceptualizations acknowledge the role of different systems of children's broader social ecology such as their community and culture. Moreover, in the past, models of youth development have been applied to understanding Latino youth (and other ethnic minorities) development without adequate consideration of culture-specific mechanisms of development. Thus, despite the emergence of newer conceptualizations, models and research that integrate the role of culture and ecology are few. The proposed project will use a state-of-the-art approach that treats culture as a dynamic system, specifying intervening processes and structures that impact Latino youth learning and development. One advantage of this approach is that it acknowledges the wide within-culture group variations in behavioral outcomes. As a result, potentially valuable information about different sources of variation can be obtained for use in developing comprehensive models of Latino youth development. To begin to construct developmental theories that are sensitive to culture-specific variables and processes, research is needed that employs multidisciplinary theories and methodology. The goals of the proposed research are to: (a) document the linkages between contextual and individual variables and Latino youth development; (b) investigate the intervening sociocognitive processes that mediate these linkages; and (c) examine the impact of acculturative stress, ethnic identity, and cultural values on Latino youth development. To accomplish these goals, Mexican American youth ages 13-16 years and their mothers will be interviewed. The sample will be recruited from two distinct communities (rural and urban) in an understudied region of the U.S. (Northern Great Plains) that has experienced substantial growth in the Latino population in the last decade. The interview will include questions regarding the community context, family and peer relationships, sociocognitive skills, cultural processes (e.g., ethnic identity, acculturative stress), and positive (e.g., helping behaviors, academic outcomes) and negative (e.g., aggression, depression) developmental outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will have broad impact across several areas. The findings will significantly contribute to the development of scientific theories that integrate culture and ecology in Latino youth development. Furthermore, the project will greatly enhance our understanding of Latino youth development with a sample of Latino families from an understudied region of the U.S. The research will refine and validate age- and ethnic-appropriate instruments to use with Latino youth and their families in future research. Moreover, the project will provide valuable scientific training and professional skill development for junior scientists and students, especially culturally-sensitive training to work with Latino families. Finally, the findings are expected to inform practitioners, program developers, and social policy makers on important conceptual issues relevant to human development in Latino youth and families. The findings will be widely disseminated to community and social service agencies, schools, in research publications, and at national and local professional conferences.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit  Existing models of childrenÆs development are often guided by traditional theories that emphasize the role of cognitions and parenting in childrenÆs development.

To begin to construct developmental theories that are sensitive to culture-specific variables and processes, research is needed that employs multidisciplinary theories and methodology. This research served to: document the role of family, peers, child characteristics, life events, community factors, and school connectedness in Latino youth development; investigate intervening cognitive and emotional processes that mediate these linkages; and examine the impact of acculturative stress, ethnic identity, and cultural values on Latino youth development.

The sample included 305 Latino youths (14-18 years old) from four communities in Nebraska. Youths and one of their parents were interviewed separately, usually at home.   2. Preliminary Findings  Youth outcomes included positive behaviors (e.g., helping others, academic outcomes) and negative outcomes (e.g., aggression, depression symptoms).  Data analysis continues, but preliminary findings offer support for several study hypotheses and aspects of the proposed model.   Positive Youth Outcomes  Social relationships. Consistent with prior theory, supportive relationships with parents were associated with more prosocial (helping) behaviors among Latino youth, whereas parentsÆ use of psychological control (e.g., manipulating youthÆs emotions to gain compliance) predicted less prosocial behavior. Support from parents and peers was positively related to perspective taking and sympathy, which in turn predicted higher levels of prosocial behaviors. Stronger familism values (endorsement of close family ties) and ethnic socialization also predicted more prosocial behaviors.  Stress and coping. Latino youths exposed to greater stress (e.g., economic pressure, immigration-related stress, or stress related to acculturation) generally reported less prosocial behavior. Greater stress was also associated with more depression symptoms, which predicted lower levels of some types of prosocial behaviors. Adaptive coping processes predicted more prosocial behavior, whereas maladaptive coping predicted less prosocial behavior.  Models of prosocial development. Some prosocial behaviors showed distinct relationships to other variables, suggesting that prosocial behavior is a multidimensional construct with distinct components (e.g., altruism, compliant prosocial behavior).  Negative Youth Outcomes  Social relationships. As expected, parental support was associated with less depression and aggression among Latino youth, parental monitoring predicted less delinquency, and psychological control was associated with more depression, anxiety, aggression, and substance use. Supportive peer relationships predicted less depression, whereas victimization by peers predicted greater anxiety and depression.  Stress and coping. Economic, immigration-related, and acculturation-related pressures were associated with more psychological and behavioral problems among youth. Economic and immigration-related stressors predicted greater parental depression which predicted less parental support; in turn, lower parental support predicted more anxiety, depression, and delinquency. Acculturation-related stress (from pressure to acculturate or not to acculturate) was associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and aggression.  As expected, apprais...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
