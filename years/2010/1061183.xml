<AbstractNarration>It is well-established that eyewitnesses make identification errors.  If the eyewitness is unable to make a correct identification, a criminal may escape justice and continue to present a threat to society.  If the witness makes a false identification, an innocent person may be prosecuted and convicted of a crime he did not commit.  The healthy functioning of the criminal justice system requires that such errors occur as infrequently as possible. In order to minimize eyewitness errors, we must understand why witnesses make errors. The present research seeks to understand the causes of eyewitness identification errors by developing, testing, and refining a psychological theory of the eyewitness. The theory, called the Witness model, describes the memory and decision processes that underlie eyewitness identification decisions, and makes quantitative predictions that can be compared to data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data come from eyewitness identification experiments, conducted under controlled conditions.  The participants in the experiments become witnesses to a staged crime, and are later shown either a perpetrator-present or a perpetrator-absent lineup.  The perpetrator-present lineup simulates those real-world cases in which the police suspect is guilty, whereas the perpetrator-absent lineup simulates those real world cases in which the police suspect is innocent.  The key data are the correct identification rates of the guilty and the false identification rates of the innocent.  The probative value of identification evidence is maximized when the correct identification rate is high and the false identification rate is low.  The first series of experiments examines how the probative value of identification evidence varies as a function of the way police create lineups and the decision processes that witnesses use to make identification decisions.  The second set of experiments examines how a witness?s decision processes distribute accuracy and error across the members of a lineup.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research project lead to several empirical findings and theoretical developments:  (1) A theoretical framework for eyewitness accuracy and procedural justice; (2) an evaluation of absolute and relative judgments in eyewitness identification; (3) an exploration of the effects of suspect and foil positions in identification lineups; and (4) a reassessment of the relationship between confidence and accuracy.  Theoretical framework for eyewitness accuracy and procedural justice. We developed a theoretical framework for eyewitness identification that considers both the accuracy of legal outcomes as well as the integrity and justice inherent within the legal procedures that produce those outcomes.  This two-pronged framework is necessary because of the ubiquitous correlation between correct and false identifications that we and others have reported in the eyewitness identification literature.  Identification procedures that reduce the false identification rate almost inevitably reduce the correct identification rate.  As a result, criminal justice policy requires not only a consideration of accuracy, but also a consideration of procedural justice that is independent of outcome accuracy  Absolute and relative judgments.  One of the cornerstones in eyewitness identification is the distinction between absolute and relative judgments.  An absolute judgment is an assessment of a lineup member based on that lineup member?s match to memory.  A relative judgment is an assessment of that lineup member relative to other lineup members.  We conducted a direct test of the widely-accepted view that identification decisions based on absolute judgments are more accurate than identification decisions based on relative judgments.  Our results found no support for that view; however, the results provide support for a tentative conclusion that comparisons among lineup members improves the accuracy of identification decisions.  We also developed a hybrid model for eyewitness identification based on both absolute and relative judgments.  Lineup composition.  Position of the suspect and foils.  We found that eyewitness identification decisions and overall identification accuracy vary with the relative positions of the suspect and foils.  Thus, it is not only important to consider who is in the lineup, but where the lineup members are relative to each other.  Confidence and accuracy.  Collaborating with John Wixted at UCSD and others we re-evaluated existing data, and showed that confidence is a strong predictor of eyewitness accuracy &ndash; perhaps the most reliable predictor of accuracy.  However, experimental evidence suggests one exception to that general rule:  Confidence may be a much weaker predictor of accuracy when the lineups are biased.
