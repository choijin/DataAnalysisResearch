<AbstractNarration>Catalyzed by the tremendous human and economic costs of recent major disasters including the Chi Chi Earthquake of 1999 and New Orleans Hurricane Katrina of 2005, a trans-Pacific workshop that is jointly sponsored by NSF and the National Science Council of Taiwan will be held May 6-7, 2010.  The workshop seeks to cross traditional disciplinary boundaries to develop the new knowledge needed to better manage the impact of natural hazards in major urban areas.  The potential impact of large-scale natural hazards on today?s urban agglomerations is so huge, they can be called Mega-City/Mega-Disasters (MCMD).  The workshop will explore specific strategies for rapid emergency response/recovery/rebuild during MCMD.  In addition, it will closely examine the broader questions that surround these issues, including factors that may cause long-term changes in the risk of disaster and factors that may affect and impede response by governments, agencies, and populations.  To accomplish these objectives, the workshop will assemble a diverse group of international specialists working at the forefront of their respective fields to explore and promote opportunities to develop more effective approaches for disaster mitigation in large urban areas.  In particular, specialists in emergency response and recovery, social economics, land use policy, natural hazard (e.g., wind, flood, landslide and earthquake) mitigation, and information technology will participate.  The workshop will allow researchers and practitioners from different countries to espouse a common research framework in disaster mitigation that leverages existing global research infrastructure for multinational cooperative research.  In addition to the PI, workshop organizers include Michael Goodchild, University of California, Santa Barbara; Jerome Lynch, Iniversity of Michigan; and C.H. Loh, National Taiwan University, Taiwan. The meeting is jointly funded by the Office of International Science &amp; Engineering and the Directorate for Engineering Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Catalyzed by the tremendous human and economic costs of recent major disasters including the Chi Chi Earthquake of 1999 and New Orleans Hurricane Katrina of 2005, this project was to organize a trans-Pacific workshop that was jointly sponsored by NSF and the National Science Council of Taiwan.  The workshop was held May 6-7, 2010, crossing traditional disciplinary boundaries to develop the new knowledge needed to better manage the impact of natural hazards in major urban areas. The potential impact of large-scale natural hazards on today's urban agglomerations is so huge, they can be called Mega-City/Mega-Disasters (MCMD).

In addition, the workshop examined the broader questions that surround these issues, including factors that may cause long-term changes in the risk of disaster and factors that may affect and impede response by governments, agencies, and populations. To accomplish these objectives, the workshop assembled a diverse group of international specialists working in emergency response and recovery, social economics, land use policy, natural hazard (e.g., wind, flood, landslide and earthquake) mitigation, and information technology. The workshop allowed researchers and practitioners from different countries to espouse a common research framework in disaster mitigation that leveraged existing global research infrastructure for multinational cooperative research.  The recommendations and results from this workshop were published in a CD proceedings.  Specific Recommendations from the workshop included:  NSC and NSF should give high priority budget consideration for cross-disciplinary/multidisciplinary research in MC/MD science and technology. To establish a vibrant MC/MD research community across the Asia Pacific region, both NSF and NSC should place emphasis on jointly-funded bilateral US-Taiwan cooperative research, as well as multi-lateral cooperative research with other Asia-Pacific countries which share the same interest in MC/MD science and technology. NSC and NSF are encouraged to break existing cultural and organizational barriers and budgetary constraints within its internal departmental entities so that it can develop a new framework for shared support of a cross-disciplinary approach to research. NSC is urged to use their science, engineering, and technological empowerment to coordinate relevant governmental and nongovernmental agencies at all levels in disaster preparedness, search and rescue, post-event response and recovery, particularly in enabling of real-time disaster data harvesting and sharing, and other critical emergency management issues. Efforts that can be launched on a collaborative university-government-industry platform should be particularly encouraged. Multi-dimensional team-based investigations cutting across traditional disciplinary boundaries are particularly encouraged. High-risk and high-payoff research having good potential for MC/MD science and technology innovation should be considered for funding with high priority. To address critical research needs and tackle the grand challenges in the MC/MD area, high priority should be placed on training the next generation of high quality, interdisciplinary researchers who are equally knowledgeable in the necessary fields to conduct MC/MD research. NSC and NSF are strongly urged to create a paradigm-shift in academic programs to produce future students with cross-disciplinary MC/MD knowledge and skills.
