<AbstractNarration>The overall purpose of the Jackson State University ADVANCE IT project is to enhance the work climate for women faculty in the STEM disciplines.  To that end, the project proposes to provide professional development to faculty and administrators, develop a network of research and career mentors for women STEM faculty, review university policies and practices and foster a climate of gender inclusion.  This project is particularly unique in that if focuses on women faculty at our nation?s Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  The intellectual merit and novelty of this project lies in the institution type and in the approaches to be initiated toward gender equity, particularly because there exists a dearth of information and literature that focuses on women in the STEM disciplines at historically Black institutions.  The JSU ADVANCE IT project will inform the community about institutional transformation at this institution type, as well as promote an understanding of gender issues and stereotypes as they are uniquely related to women of color.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.  The Jackson State University ADVANCE IT project will have significant impact on a cadre of women STEM faculty who have been underserved and underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.  Moreover, this project will provide a blueprint for implementing strategies on any campus for women of color.  Project findings will be disseminated largely through a project website and through other traditional means, with special emphasis on other institutions in EPSCoR states.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Implicit bias, gender stereotypes, inequity, exclusion, and other negative behaviors toward women create difficult work climates for women, hindering productivity and progress. Especially in predominantly male disciplines, women may be isolated within the workplace. Furthermore, unproductive climates for women also hinder the success of an institution and a society broadly.   JSU ADVANCE made a major impact on the climate of Jackson State University (JSU), a Historically Black College and University (HBCU), in the Deep South.  JSU ADVANCE was funded by the National Science Foundation as an Institutional Transformation project to help in faculty development for women generally and women of color specifically in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics and the Social and Behavioral Sciences disciplines (collectively referred here as STEM) at JSU.  JSU ADVANCE helped transform JSU by helping women faculty advance and by educating the campus about the climate women in STEM face.  By helping women faculty, JSU ADVANCE helped an institution, other institutions, and society broadly.  JSU ADVANCE filled several gaps. JSU ADVANCE filled a gap as to the type of institution. While gender inequity had been examined at Predominantly White Institutions, there was a shortage of literature addressing climates at HBCUs and other minority serving institutions.  JSU ADVANCE filled a gap by closely considering the experiences of women of color, especially Black women, in STEM.  Their unique experiences as women of color, in STEM, at HBCUs had not received much attention. JSU ADVANCE demonstrated how improving the climate for an overlooked group can improve an institutional climate and have a broader impact.  Women in STEM at JSU advanced through direct interventions focused on scholarly productivity, career advancement, community building, and professional development.  Women went from isolation to inclusion in a dynamic community of scholars. A significant number of women were promoted in rank, tenured, and promoted to leadership positions. JSU ADVANCE fulfilled its mission through components, including: implementing a summer writing retreat; establishing a platform to highlight women?s achievements through national symposiums and international travel; mentoring and leadership opportunities; and reviewing dated policies and recommending changes.  The most popular component was the JSU ADVANCE Summer Writing Retreat which addressed a major barrier for faculty advancement, i.e., publishing scholarly articles and obtaining grant funding.  The retreat helped women in STEM make writing a priority during the summer months, and throughout the year.  Seeing the success of the Summer Writing Retreat, men in STEM and faculty in other disciplines sought similar experiences. JSU ADVANCE spearheaded establishing the Academy for Research and Scholarly Engagement.  Like the Summer Writing Retreat, the Academy included coaching, creating a time and space for writing, establishing a diverse community of scholars, and learning to maintain a robust scholarly agenda.  While the Summer Writing Retreat included approximately a ten-week summer experience with two weeks in residence, the Academy was an eight-month experience of monthly meetings and coaching. The Academy was successful; almost a third of JSU's tenure-track and tenured faculty participated.  The JSU ADVANCE Summer Writing Retreat had a broad impact; it is the focus of three additional grant funded projects advancing scholarly engagement for underrepresented faculty at various Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs).   Improving the gender climate did not depend solely on workplace strategies. The JSU ADVANCE Academic Woman Workshop fostered understanding about STEM women?s challenges both in the workplace and in social structures, with joint sessions and sessions for single women, married/partnered women, and the spouses/partners of STEM women.  Fostering lasting change meant raising awareness from male department chairs and colleagues so they would become champions for equity.  The Office of Chief Diversity Officer was established.  From the leadership of this office, mandatory search committee bias training was instituted and male and female colleagues? understanding notably increased. JSU ADVANCE points to the impact of a Chief Diversity Officer, even at Minority Serving Institutions.  While the majority of JSU's students are Black, the faculty is diverse.  Moreover, faculty women in STEM are underrepresented especially compared to female STEM students.    In combating bias broadly, the JSU ADVANCE Implicit Bias Think Tank was established and helped attendees to understand &ndash;that even when they thought they were unbiased &ndash;-they may be implicitly biased against a person?s race, gender and other characteristics.
