<AbstractNarration>The goals of the CREST Center for the Integrated Study of Coastal Ecosystem Processes and Dynamics in the Mid-Atlantic Region are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;Understand, model and predict the effects of land use and climate change on the mid-Atlantic coastal ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;Provide research training to high school students and teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, particularly from members of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;Improve infrastructure for research and education in marine and environmental sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt;Increase public awareness of the interdependence of humans and the coastal environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will focus on five important components of the aquatic ecosystem, all of which have economic and environmental implications for people living in coastal areas:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) The effects of land use and climate change on water quality, (2) the response of microscopic algae and seaweed, including harmful species, to water quality changes (3) dynamics of zooplankton (microscopic animals floating in water) populations, which serve as food for commercially and ecologically important fish species (4) the effects of the recurring problem of low dissolved oxygen and pollution on fish populations such as Atlantic croaker, and (5) the effects of water quality changes on the infection of blue crab by the parasite Hematodinium and on blue crab distributions in Maryland?s coastal bays. These projects will contribute to our understanding of the coastal environment and the ways organisms respond to changes in their environment. Research results will be made directly available to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the National Park Service, who are collaborators on the project. The results will also be used to enhance undergraduate and graduate courses offered by the scientists who are involved in the project at UMES, Virginia Institute of Marine Science, and Morgan State University, thereby impacting more students than are directly supported by the Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The five integrated subprojects will contribute to increased understanding of processes and dynamics in coastal lagoons and estuaries. Changes in water quality associated with climate change and human modifications of boarding land will increase the understanding of how coastal communities respond to such stressors. The Center will contribute significantly to the disciplines of marine and environmental sciences and it would provide a baseline to evaluate environmental change at the ecosystem scale from both human and climatic drivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The Center will establish and strengthen partnerships with several state and federal agencies, as well as with other universities, including one HBCU (Morgan State University).  In order to ensure that the next generation of marine scientists is both well trained and reflective of America?s diversity, the CREST Center will also provide training and financial support to eight graduate students, five undergraduates, 10 high school teachers, 5 high school students and one postdoctoral fellow each year. These students will work alongside CREST faculty on all phases of research and will be well positioned for careers in Universities, federal, state and private agencies dedicated to marine research. By working with teachers to infuse marine environmental science into the high school curricula, the Center will have a positive impact on &gt;200 high school students on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of the NSF CREST-CISCEP established at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) are to: (1) Become a major research resource, and partner with institutions, state agencies, and industry for understanding, modeling and predicting the impacts of land use and climate variability in the mid-Atlantic region, (2) Integrate research and education by recruiting and training high school students and teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, particularly members of underrepresented groups, (3) Improve infrastructure for research and education in marine and environmental sciences, and (4) Improve public awareness and literacy of coastal aquatic ecosystems and impacts on them by anthropogenic activities and climate variability.  Scientists and students at the CREST-CISCEP conducted an integrated study of the Maryland Coastal Bays (MCBs) that has enhanced our knowledge of coastal lagoon ecosystems in the region.  The dynamics of the physico-chemical characteristics of the lagoons were examined in relation to variations in freshwater discharge.  Our results suggest that the bays may be a significant source of dissolved organic carbon in the coastal ocean.  We have also described temporal variations of the occurrence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus, which have served as a basis for further studies aimed at developing a model for predicting their occurrence in coastal lagoons.  This is important because the occurrence of pathogenic Vibrio species in the environment and shellfish is of human health significance.  Hematodinium, a dinoflagellate parasite, causes mortality in blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), but its life cycle and the mode of transmission are not well understood.  Studies by center scientists have revealed spatio-temporal patterns in the distribution of the parasite in crabs and MCBs environment.  Furthermore, we have evaluated the influence of freshwater discharge on the composition of phytoplankton in the MCBs.  Bloom densities of the harmful dinoflagellate, Heterocapsa rotundata, which previously had not been reported in the Bays, were observed bay-wide.  Several potentially harmful dinoflagellate species were also observed in the bays. Nutrient enrichment of the MCBs has caused an increaase in macroalgae density.  Our studies have shown that a diverse assemblage of amphipods is associated with macroalgae in the bays.  Moreover, an amphipod species (Apolochus cresti) new to science, and the life history of Dulichiella appendiculata, the most abundant amphipod species associated with macroalgae in the lagoons were described.  We have also described the mesozooplankton composition in the MCBs, and highlighted the fact that the composition of copepod species differs from that of river-dominated estuaries and coastal ocean in the region. The copepod assemblage of the Bays has a higher percentage of Centropages and a lower proportion of Eurytemora species than the assemblage in river-dominated estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay. Three species of mysids were reported in the system, including Neomysis americana, the most abundant species, and an important predator of copepods. Their abundance and life histories were described, as well as their contributions to the diet of fish species in the MCBs. The influence of environmental and climatic factors on the recruitment and essential habitats of juveniles of some of the commercially important fish species such as black sea bass (Centropristis striata) and summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) that feed on mysids in the MCBs have been examined. Research at the Center has resulted in 21 publications, 6 articles in revision or submitted to various journals for publication, and 12 manuscripts in preparation. Eighty-eight (88) presentations have been made at major national and international scientific meetings.    The Center has made significant contributions to human resource development in STEM, particularly in marine science. A total of 125 individuals were trained including 28 high school students, 49 undergraduates, 25 graduate students, one post-doctoral research associate, and 22 middle- and high school teachers. Of these numbers, 68% of graduate students, 92% of undergraduates, and 61% of high school students belonged to underrepresented minority groups. Of the 49 undergraduates trained by the Center, 20 were summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) participants recruited from 18 institutions. One of the Center graduate students received the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and two of the Center graduates received NOAA Sea Grant Knauss fellowships. Two Ph.D. recipients from the Center currently hold post-doctoral fellowships, and one Ph.D. recipient is currently a Research Assistant Professor.   The CREST-CISCEP has also made important contributions to resources for research and education at UMES. Funds from the Center were used to purchase equipment such as an Inverted microscope, Epifluorescence microscope, research grade Compound microscopes and Dissecting microscopes.  In addition, a research boat was purchased with UMES institutional funds that has been used to conduct field research and train students. Two new research laboratories - Benthic Invertebrate Ecology and Taxonomy Lab, and Zooplankton and Fish Ecology Lab, have been established.  Five scientists with expertise in marine and environmental sciences have been recruited to the Center since 2010.       Last Modified: 01/12/2018       Submitted by: Paulinus Chigbu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
