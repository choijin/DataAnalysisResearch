<AbstractNarration>1066343 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Girshick &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with the synthesis and characterization of multifunctional nanoparticles for cancer diagnosis and therapy. These nanoparticles include several layers: a superparamagnetic iron oxide core, a silica layer, a gold shell, and a coating of polyethylene glycol (PEG).The magnetic core provides enhanced contrast for magnetic resonance imaging and the ability to be heated by alternating magnetic fields, destroying tumors by hyperthemia. The gold shell facilitates optical imaging, and can be heated by near infrared radiation, providing cancer therapy by photothermal ablation. The silica layer suppresses aggregation of the magnetic nanoparticles and mediates the particle?s optical properties. The PEG coating provides a biocompatible surface that can be further biofunctionalized with targeting ligands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research lies in the fact that several project activities will, if successful, represent groundbreaking accomplishments. The project involves an interplay of nanoparticle synthesis and characterization of biological systems in which these nanoparticles are loaded. A process is being developed in which three-layer nanoparticles are produced by a sequence of vapor-phase processes that constitute a  nanoparticle manufacturing assembly line in which the dimensions and composition of each layer are controlled to nanoscale tolerances. In close interaction with these synthesis studies, studies are conducted of the uptake, properties and behavior of these nanoparticles in biological tissue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the project will constitute several breakthroughs: a new methodology for production of multilayer nanoparticles by a sequence of gas-phase processes; the first Raman imaging of gold-shell nanoparticle uptake in cells that avoids the use of molecular labels; the first measurement of laser heat generation in nanoparticle-laden biological systems to correlate optical and thermal approaches at scales ranging from sub-cellular to tissue; the first method to link heat generation to the number of nanoparticles per cell, thereby suggesting a simple optical method for determining nanoparticle uptake in cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves a collaboration that brings together expertise in nanoparticle synthesis  and processing by aerosol routes with expertise in heat and mass transfer in biological systems. This work is highly interdisciplinary, involving particulate and multiphase processes, nanomanufacturing, bioengineering, biomaterials, thermal and mass transport sciences, optics and chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has several broader impacts. This project is developing tools that may one day constitute a major advance in the treatment of cancer. More broadly, this project will lead to  greater understanding of the interactions of nanoparticles with biological systems. The nanoparticle manufacturing assembly line  could constitute a prototype for producing multifunctional nanoparticles for other types of applications, for example in energy conversion. This project involves two graduate students in a highly interdisciplinary environment. The PIs have a strong record of involving women and other under-represented groups, as well as undergraduates, in their research, and are continuing to do so in this project. Finally, the PIs have been active in several programs involving outreach to K-12 students and the broader public, and the broader public, and outreach activities of this type will be enriched by the interdisciplinary project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was concerned with the development of new technologies to synthesize, image and deploy nanoparticles for biomedical applications, particularly related to cancer treatment.  These applications include both therapeutic applications, based on heating nanoparticles by externally applied magnetic fields or laser radiation, thereby killing adjacent cancer cells by hyperthemia, and diagnostic applications, based on using nanoparticles to enhance imaging in biological and biomedical systems.  In many cases the therapeutic and diagnostic functionalities are combined in the same nanoparticle.  This dual functionality is known as "nanoparticle theranostics."  The main thrusts of the project included synthesis of multilayer magnetoplasmonic nanoparticles, and studies of nanoparticle heating and related imaging.  We developed and demonstrated the synthesis of multilayer nanoparticles that consist of a superparamagnetic iron oxide core, a thin silica shell that is decorated with gold nanoparticles, and a surface layer of polyethylene glycol (PEG).  These particles are synthesized by a continuous-flow sequence of dry gas-phase processes.  PEGylating the particles allows them to be collected into stable water-based suspension for biomedical applications.  The sequence of gas-phase processes allows for fewer impurities compared to wet chemical processes, and avoids the need for surfactants between each layer as well as the need to manage and dispose of hazardous solvents.  Total residence time is on the order of a seconds, compared to hours or even days for batch wet chemical processes.   We produced superparamagnetic iron oxide particles by a plasma method.  These particles are carried as an aerosol in inert carrier gas to a chamber where they are coated with very thin&mdash;only about a nanometer thick&mdash;silica shells, using a process that is activated by ultraviolet light.  Very small gold nanoparticles are generated by electrically heating a gold-coated platinum wire, and these gold particles are then attached onto the silica surfaces by aerosol mixing.  Finally, the nanoparticles are PEGylated in a novel two-step aerosol process.  This latter work represents the first time that nanoparticles were ever PEGylated in a gas phase process, allowing their easy transfer from a  suspension into a stable aqueous solution.  We also developed a new process for determining and quantifying the heating of superparamagnetic and ferrogmagnetic nanoparticles.  These approaches are the first that allow direct determination of nanoparticle aggregation together with correlation of the aggregation to a reduction in heating potential.  We showed that aggregation reduces nanoparticle heating by up to 50% compared to non-aggregated nanoparticles.  These techniques were complemented by new approaches to imaging and quantifying the heating of nanoparticles within biological solutions and materials.
