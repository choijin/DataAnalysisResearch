<AbstractNarration>AIR will conduct a 3-year longitudinal study of the National Science Foundation?s Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program. The proposed project builds on the accomplishments of AIR AGEP studies and expands upon previous and the current AGEP focused national evaluation work. By renewing the existing grant, AGEP-LS will draw on extant data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and the Survey of Doctoral Recipients (SDR) to track national enrollment and completion trends of underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields as well as in the social, behavioral and economic sciences (SBE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIR will also deploy a software system, the AGEP-Tracking System and Registry (AGEP-TSR), to collect individual level data on AGEP students that will track their participation in AGEP supported activities at the alliance and campus levels. Through AGEP-TSR, the longitudinal study will be able to account for individual level outcomes and longer-term workforce outcomes. Through AGEP-TSR, AIR will systematically monitor performance of the participating AGEP Alliances over time and also be able to survey student participants at regular intervals. Finally, AIR will conduct intensive case studies over time with fixed cohorts of students, faculty, and AGEP program administrators within each of nine Alliances&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The proposed study would be the first to measure AGEP impact over time on a controlled population of students and faculty and to evaluate the effects of AGEP-supported institutional transformation activities over a measured time period. AGEP-LS also will be the first effort to evaluate the influence of the AGEP SBE program in these fields with minority students. As such, the study will advance what we know and understand about how AGEP affects the educational success of STEM and SBE doctoral students and the diversification of the professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.  AGEP is explicitly designed to increase minority representation in STEM and SBE doctoral production and in the professoriate, but the field needs to know more about how program components work. Lessons learned about program efficacy over time through this study will be disseminated to the AGEP Alliances and to the broader higher education community. Through specific dissemination strategies, the study findings are intended to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in graduate education and the professoriate in key fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The key outcomes and broader impacts of these activities are:  Trend analyses. AIR produced a final report that analyzed trends (1990-2010) in STEM graduate program enrollment, Ph.D. completion, time to completion and Ph.D. holders' postdoctoral career pathways. Differences across institutions and among students with different demographic characteristics and in different STEM fields were analyzed.  Research briefs. AIR produced nine issue briefs on topics that included graduate student debt levels and institutional funding patterns, time to completion, the careers of STEM Ph.D. holders, the role of historically Black colleges and universities as institutional pathways to the STEM doctorate, and gender imbalances in STEM Ph.D. production.

AIR facilitated two expert convenings: an Evaluation Think Tank and a STEM Symposium.   Evaluation Think Tank. The aim of this two-day think tank was to reconceptualize future evaluations to support the needs of federal programs that provide funding to build institutional capacity to change practices. The think tank convened a panel of experts in the field of study design and evaluation methodologies. The experts engaged in critical diaologue on issues to consider in developing and implementing evaluations of federal grant programs at teh program and project levels. The resulting white paper provided an overview of the meeting and a summary of the panel's key observations and recommendations on common design challenges and solutions, characteristics of capacity building programs to account for in designing evaluations, and strategies for linking program and project evaluations. The white paper was circulated among NSF program officers.  STEM Symposium. In September 2013, AIR convened this two-day symposium, Using Research to Inform Policies and Practices in Science Education, to engage key stakeholders in a series of discussions on how s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
