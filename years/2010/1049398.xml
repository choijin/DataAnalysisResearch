<AbstractNarration>Systems in which people and computers work together in a socially intelligent manner represent a new form of computing that brings together the challenges of traditional computing (e.g., algorithms, information representation, information acquisition, data quality) with those of human interaction (e.g., cognition, social interaction, culture, learning) and indeed a whole host of new challenges related to the combination of humans and computers (e.g., computer reasoning about human knowledge and abilities, socially-intelligent human-computer interaction, social computing). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports meeting of SoCS Principle Investigators (PIs) (June 9-11, 2011) and will facilitate much needed interaction among researchers using the wide range of topics, methods and techniques. This PI meeting is designed to build on and leverage two other SoCS related workshops that will be temporally and physically co-located. PIs with active SoCS awards will be invited to participate in the meeting through a poster session where on-going SoCS research will be presented. The meeting also includes panels and discussions where best practices can be discussed. Many of the biggest challenges in successfully deploying computer systems in organizations come down to the difficulty of adapting technology to human organizations and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of the SoCS field will directly create new knowledge and understanding in how to more successfully manage the relationship between social (human) organizations and the computer tools they use to work together more effectively.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a small grant to support a meeting of all of the researchers who were funded by the NSF social-computational systems (SoCS) program.  These researchers use a wide variety of different research methods to study how computers facilitate the way groups of people work together.  Attendees included sociologists and social psychologists who are expert in how groups of people work together (with or without computers), economists who understand how to model motivations among working groups, organizational behavior specialists who understand how computers are used in companies, and computer scientists who build social-computational systems.  The workshop was organized as a series of panels and talks.  The first panel was on "Computational Models and Techniques for SoCS", which described ways that computer tools can be used to reason about large-scale social systems.  The second panel was on "Fundamental Social Science Methods and Tehories for SoCS", which described how social science methods that were developed for studying offline organizations can be adapted to the study of social computer systems.  The invited talk was by Ronald Burt, a professor at the University of Chicago, who spoke about decades of research on how social networks inside companies affects the performance of individuals in those companies.  Finally, the closing panel was directions for future research in SoCS.             Last Modified: 02/26/2015       Submitted by: Loren Terveen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
