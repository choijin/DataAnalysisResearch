<AbstractNarration>The goal of this initiation project is to transform STEM education at FBC by establishing an integrated pathway of learning that will strengthen instructional effectiveness and promote student success. The project will achieve this goal by: (1) initiating an intensive, six-week A?anin-Nakoda STEM Summer Academy for incoming science majors that will prepare them for the rigors of college-level STEM instruction; (2) restructuring existing science curricula to create a new Integrated Science A.S. degree program designed to foster academic excellence and prepare students for greater success in upper division STEM courses and degree programs; and (3) establishing the foundation for implementing a B.S. degree program in Holistic Environmental Science at FBC through curriculum expansion, professional development, and institutional capacity-building. Beginning with pre-college enrichment activities and culminating in a baccalaureate degree program, the project will offer students a continuous pathway of learning grounded in the A?anin and Nakoda worldview and guided by a complementary educational philosophy that encourages students to practice science through cross-disciplinary, collaborative, project-based learning activities and relevant applications. The project?s overall effectiveness will be evaluated in terms of its success in achieving a series of eight student-centered outcomes related to measurable increases in student participation, learning, and success in science courses and degree programs.</AbstractNarration>

Targeting students would allow the academy to get students "college ready", getting them to think about going to college and what classes they need to enhance their skills to be ready for college courses.  The Natural Resources department developed a Integrated Science degree during 2012/2013, in 2013/2014 faculty worked to expand and modify the degree and revised it to what we call it the Environmental Science Associate of Science Degree.  Upon completion of degree students will be knowledgeable in;  ~ using and interpreting scientific explanations (Western and Indigenous) of the natural world  ~generate and evaluate scientifc evidence and explanations  ~understand the nature and develpment of environmental scientific knowledge in Western and indigenous cultures  ~parfticipate meaningfully in environmental scientific activities and discourse.  Along with the general educatgion requirements, students in the major are required to take Environmental Science, Chemistry I, Physical Geology, General Ecology and Natural REsource Management and four electives.  Students can use four electiveds to focus on one of the following options:  ~Water/Soil Resources  ~Geospatial/Geographical Information System Option  ~Traditional Plants  ~Science/Pre-engineering.
