<AbstractNarration>Guam Community College (GCC) is partnering with the University of Guam, the Guam Department of Education, industry, and government agencies to address Guam's and Micronesia's need for green energy technicians. The goals of the Advanced Technology Developments and Opportunities (ATDAO) project are to produce alternative energy technicians in Guam by (1) generating STEM interest and knowledge among high school students, (2) developing an alternative energy technician education and outreach program at Guam Community College, and (3) promoting secondary and community college faculty participation in local and regional alternative energy workshops. The project is achieving these goals by developing a framework for new courses that will be integrated into existing electronics and civil engineering programs, developing and delivering photovoltaic and wind energy workshops for area high school and community college faculty, training photovoltaic technicians for entry into the workforce, and preparing GCC to receive additional program improvement grants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Guam Community College implemented the Advanced Technology Development And Opportunities (ATDAO) grant from the National Science Foundation - Advanced Technological Educational Grant  from July 2010 - June 2013.  This project accomplished several objectives:  Developed      an awareness of and an increased understanding of renewable energy efforts      for a sustainable environment.  The project focused on Science,      Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) high school teachers in      Guam. Provided      high school teachers with solar energy kits to be used to train their      students in photovoltaic. Developed      and trained renewable energy technicians/practitioners to install a      photovoltaic (PV) system and prepare them for the North American Board of      Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) exam to obtain photovoltaic      installer national certification. Developed      the skills for renewable energy technicians/practitioners that will assist      in increasing GuamÃ†s green workforce and building local capacity in renewable      energy design and installation. Created      interest in career paths in renewable and related energy fields through      the introduction of new experiences and knowledge in the classroom      learning environment.   This project developed and enhanced the renewable energy knowledge and skills necessary to utilize the most available energy sources in the Pacific -- the sun, and other impetus emerging energy technologies such as PV, wind, Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) and other renewable energy sources. It also created a career path for individuals interested in renewable energy, inclusive of high school students.       Last Modified: 08/30/2013       Submitted by: Terry Kuper]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
