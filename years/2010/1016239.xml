<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on organizing a 2-day international conference entitled Conference on resampling methods and high dimensional data at the Texas A &amp; M university, College Station, TX, March 25-26, 2010. The conference provides a unique platform for bringing together researchers working in two cutting edge areas of current research in statistics, namely, Resampling methods for complex data structures and Inference for high dimensional data, in order to facilitate the exchange of research ideas on the two topics and to further the development of these booming fields. The meeting is co-sponsored by the National Institute of Statistical Sciences and by the Section on Nonparametric Statistics, American Statistical Association. The conference has an international program committee chaired by Professors S.N. Lahiri (Texas A &amp; M), and an Advisory Committee, consisting of Professors R.J. Carroll (Texas A &amp; M), Bradley Efron (Stanford), and Hans R. KÂ¨unsch (ETH, Zurich, Switzerland).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-day conference Conference on resampling methods and high dimensional data brings together top and junior researchers to define and expand the research frontiers of two highly active research areas of statistics and probability that deal with complex data structures. There are a number of areas of science and engineering, such as bio-informatics, brain imaging, econometrics,electrical engineering, finance, meteorology, etc., where such data appear frequently and which directly benefit from advances in these topics. The funding provides support for selected groups of participants including graduate students, minorities, and young researchers who can not attend the conference otherwise, thereby promoting human resource development.</AbstractNarration>

About 200 researchers from around the world participated at the conference.  There were 4 plenary talks given by Professors  Peter Bickel, University of California, Berkeley; Jianqing Fan, Princeton University; Peter Hall, University of Melbourne; Bin Yu, University of California, Berkeley.  The conference talks (pdf files) are available publicly at an electronic repository at:  http://www.stat.tamu.edu/Spring-Conf-2010/Program.html Further, audio recordings of the plenary talks are available at: http://www.stat.tamu.edu/Spring-Conf-2010/index.html     Intellectual Merit  The conference provided a unique forum for exchange of ideas  and knowledge between junior and senior researchers in statistics  and related areas. There were a large number of students and  members of minority communities (mainly women scholars),   comprising  more than 50 percent of the participants, who also directly benefitted from interacting with  the leading  researchers from around the world at  the conference.   Broader impact  It is expected that  dissemination of the  state of the art results in Resampling methodology and methods of alaysis of High Dimensional data by  leading researchers will help subject matter scientists to improve the quality of their research by incorporating the latest analytical tools discussed at  the conference.
