<AbstractNarration>Abstract.  Science Master?s Program in Environmental and Natural Resource&lt;br/&gt;Sciences at the University of Idaho.  &lt;br/&gt;Stephen Mulkey, PI.  &lt;br/&gt;NSF 1011374&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;The new Science Master?s degree program at the University of Idaho provides professional training in interdisciplinary science in the environmental and natural resource sciences.  The Intermountain West has a high potential for job growth in the areas of forestry, conservation, range management, fisheries and wildlife biology, environmental mitigation, water resource management, and related fields.  Employers in these economic sectors have stated their need for professionals trained in management, scientific ethics, and professional and scientific communication skills.  The Idaho SMP curriculum includes training in these areas as part of a new core curriculum that will also be open to all science graduate students at the University of Idaho.  This foundation complements sustainability science, which is an integral part of the natural resource and environmental science curriculum in the SMP, and professional training, which includes internships with government agencies and industrial partners and team-based research experiences in existing faculty research programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Science Master?s program at the University of Idaho will contribute directly to society and economic development by creating a professional workforce for the local, regional, and national markets in areas of natural science crucial to future wellbeing.  Graduates of the program will increase the number of professional scientists in an underserved region and advance public discovery and understanding as effective science ambassadors to the broader public.  The program expands minority participation in the sciences by specifically recruiting and training Native students of the Intermountain West who will serve tribal needs for professionals in the environmental and natural resource sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This award helped to fund the creation of a Professional Science MasterÆs degree program in Natural Resources and Environmental Science at the University of Idaho.  The goals of this degree program are to (1) Contribute to the national and regional workforce; (2) Produce a workforce equipped for the environmental challenges of the 21st century; (3) Produce science ambassadors, trained in ethics and effective communication; and (4) Produce Native American professional scientists.   The program was launched with the support of this grant in the fall of 2010.  The vast majority of grant funds were awarded as fellowships to selected students in the first two years of the program (i.e., students starting in 2010 and 2011). At the conclusion of the grant, the program had produced 20 graduates equipped for the environmental challenges of the 21st century.  These graduates had been educated in ethics, science communication and the management of scientific projects and innovation, in addition to core environmental science and/or water resource concepts.  Three of these graduates were Native Americans.   In addition, at the end of the grant period the program had 21 students enrolled and making progress toward completion of their PSM degrees.  Two of these students were Native Americans.   Our graduates have taken jobs with a variety of governmental, non-governmental and business organizations.  One of our graduates has started her own environmental consulting business and two of our graduates are pursuing law degrees with a focus on environmental and water law.  In addition to providing support for many of the initial students in the program, funding from this grant has allowed the University of Idaho to develop a strong PSM program that is positioned to continue to produce graduates who are equipped to meet the environmental challenges of the 21st century and are prepared to be science ambassadors.  Our program now includes eight tracks within the environmental and water sciences, and arrangements have been created with the University of Idaho law school so that a student can pursue a joint J.D./PSM degree in any one of these tracks.  Our PSM tracks are as follows:  Environmental Contamination Sustainability Science Climate Change Water Resources Management Management of Regulated River Systems Ecohydrological Science and Management Bioenergy and Bioproducts Sustainable Food &amp; Fiber   In addition to taking graduate level science courses in the studentÆs chosen track, students are required to take four professional skills courses that were developed specifically for the PSM program with help from the grant.  All of these courses have been created in an online delivery format to serve our PSM students wherever they are located.  Those four courses are:  Bus 551 Managing Scientific Projects Bus 552 Managing Scientific Innovation Eng 522 Communication for Science Professionals Phil 504 Ethical Practice in Natural Resource &amp; Environmental Science   The grant funds have also helped us build the sustaining infrastructure needed to continue to deliver a strong PSM program into the future.  The director of UIÆs interdisciplinary Environmental Science and Water Resources programs serves as director of the PSM program.  We have Ph.D. qualified science faculty advising for each of our tracks and have an excellent environmental science and water resources program staff to support students and faculty in the program.  We have developed a high-quality website for our program that provides current students and faculty timely program information as well as helping to recruit future students (http://www.uidaho.edu/cogs/psm).  We have also developed a program handbook for students enrolled in the PSM program and have incorporated PSM information into our Environmental Science and Water Resources Facebook page.   We anticipate that our program will continue for many years to come and produce graduates who will help to address the environmental ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
