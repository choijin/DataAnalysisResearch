<AbstractNarration>The Web promises unprecedented access to the perspectives of an&lt;br/&gt;enormous number of people on a wide range of issues.  Turning that&lt;br/&gt;still untamed cacophony into meaningful insights requires dealing with&lt;br/&gt;the linguistic diversity and scale of the Web.  Most current research&lt;br/&gt;focuses on specialized tasks such as tracking consumer opinions, and&lt;br/&gt;virtually all current research treats the Web as both monolithic and&lt;br/&gt;monolingual, ignoring the variety of languages represented and the&lt;br/&gt;rich interplay between topics and issues under discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project moves the state of the art forward by focusing on two key&lt;br/&gt;challenges.  First, highly-scalable MapReduce algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;linguistic modeling within a Bayesian framework, making use of&lt;br/&gt;variational inference to achieve a high degree of parallelization on&lt;br/&gt;Web-scale datasets.  Second, novel Bayesian models that learn&lt;br/&gt;consistent interpretations of text across languages and a wide range&lt;br/&gt;of response variables of interest (for example, views on an issue,&lt;br/&gt;strength of emotion relative to an event, and focus of attention).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques developed in this project will be demonstrated on large&lt;br/&gt;crawls of Web pages and blogs.  Potential applications for these&lt;br/&gt;technologies include helping a schoolchild learn that people in&lt;br/&gt;different countries may view some issues very differently, helping a&lt;br/&gt;politician understand how constituents are reacting to proposed&lt;br/&gt;legislation, or helping an intelligence analyst understand how public&lt;br/&gt;opinion is evolving in a hostile country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project Web page:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud-computing</AbstractNarration>
