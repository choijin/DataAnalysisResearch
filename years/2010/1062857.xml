<AbstractNarration>The ongoing revolution in communication technology and cloud computing is driving demand for information security tools and specialists. Likewise the revolution in molecular and cell biology is driving a rapidly emerging demand to mathematize biology and for professionals competent in both mathematics and biology. The nature of computing and complexity are central themes for both. Important mathematical problems relevant to the concerns of information security or biology are within the intellectual grasp of talented undergraduate students. The REU Site: Complexity in Algebra, Geometry and Applications will introduce undergraduate students to research in mathematics motivated by applications to information security or genome biology. An objective of this program is to produce a cohort of young researchers whose work and vision will transcend the artificial boundary between mathematics and real world applications of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of eight weeks 8 undergraduate students alongside their faculty mentors will be engaged in mathematics-based interdisciplinary research. In addition to targeted research projects the program will provide a broad array of associated program elements designed to draw students into and prepare them for STEM careers. These include: research workshops where students will build their backgrounds for their projects, computing workshops where students will develop programming skills needed for progress on their research projects, meetings as a group where they will report their current research and  a research symposium at the end of the program where all students will present their research results. Using our cloud resources the program will implement collaborative spaces that blend face-to-face and online modes of activity for our workshops, seminars and student research teams. This technological capability is a key component of our follow-through plan to sustain the subsequent research experience of alumni of our REU program.</AbstractNarration>

Of these institutions 64% offered no undergraduate research opportunities in mathematics.  This site  is a founding member of the Alliance of Summer Undergraduate Research Programs at Boise State University, a consortium of seven programs including this REU site. This consortium organized several supplementary social networking and professional development activities, resulting in a diverse community of undergraduate researchers and faculty mentors.  spearheaded founding the Summer Undergraduate Research Conference at Boise State University. This poster conference is open for participation by undergraduate students from all disciplines, and for attendance by the public.   founded the Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium in Mathematics. It is open to undergraduate students in Mathematics, and to attendance by the public. co-founded the REU STEM interdisciplinary seminar. At this venue the REU fellows introduce their peers in STEM REUs from other disciplines to the site's research projects.   hosted 11 invited speakers with expertise in mathematics, the life sciences and information security during 2011-2013.   The site's public outreach activities under this grant included  hosting a workshop on research for high school students (Summer 2012);  hosting two cryptology workshops for the summer academy of the NASA funded Idaho Science and Aerospace Scholars Program for high schools in Idaho (Summer 2013);  engaging students from the Ada County Boys and Girls club with a mini-play on the role of cryptology in information protection (Summer 2013); engaging a fourth grade science class at Challenger Elementary School in Meridian, Idaho, with a lesson about ciliates and a mathematical model of their genome rearrangement activities (Spring 2014);  engaging retired persons through a lecture on cyber security at the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Boise State University (Spring 2014); engaging children participating in the Boise Math Circle in an exploration of finite games that exposed the participants to modular arithmetic (Spring 2015).   The siteÆs research program engaged participants in interdisciplinary mathematics-based research projects that advanced the frontiers of knowledge in fields related to information security and genome biology. Accomplishments include:  Design and analysis of generalized versions of the Data Encryption Standard, DES, over new mathematical platforms. Extending the mathematical platform of, and determining the resulting algebraic structure and fundamental security parameters of Rijndael-like ciphers and the Whirlpool hash function. Ever improving computational capabilities necessitate robust new mathematical security platforms. Reducing the problem of the existence of infinitely many elliptic primes to the classical Bunyakowski Conjecture. Discovery of elliptic cycles of length 6, contrary to expectations of experts that such objects do not exist. The discovery of a technique to generate infinitely many labeled oriented trees that are not diagrammatically irreducible. Previously a limited number of computer generated examples were known. The discovery that most quotients of knot groups are infinite. The conjecture that all such quotients are infinite emerged from this work. An algorithm that determines...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
