<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My research conducted in Japan as an NSF EAPSI fellow was an assessment of the flow alterations caused by dams and reservoirs.  I conducted this research with Futoshi Nakamura at Hokkaido University.  This location was selected because Professor Nakamura has compiled an extensive data set comprised of the hydrologic records of reservoirs from across Japan.  For this research we analyzed approximately 130 dams to quantify the hydrologic alteration resulting from reservoir operations.  Understanding how dams and reservoirs alter the physical and ecological processes downstream is an important and widely studied problem.  Dams change river systems in several ways.  Ecologically, species movement and/or migration is disrupted by the physical obstacle to passage [Moser et al., 2002; Raymond, 1979].  Hydrologically, the magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, and rate of change of flows are altered by the storage and/or extraction of water [Poff et al., 1997].  The physical processes of erosion and sediment transport are also impacted by the change in flows and by the detention of sediments in the reservoirs [Kondolf, 1997].  We have two primary research questions.  One is to know how reservoir operations have changed the magnitude of floods across Japan.  As an example, a graph showing reductions in peak flows at the Iwaoni dam is attached. The highest flow of each year flowing into the reservoir is shown in green and the highest flow of the year coming out of the reservoir is shown in red.  Any difference between the green and red lines is the result of the reservoir, and this alteration has implications for insects, fish, and vegetation downstream that are adapted to physical conditions such as floods and droughts.  The second research question is to understand how the alterations in flow and sediment change the channel downstream.  Understanding the interplay between flow alteration and sediment alteration, and how channels will respond to those alterations is an ongoing goal of this research, and results are not yet available.   The importance of understanding the impacts of dams is hard to overestimate.  An estimated $32-46 billion worldwide was spent annually in the 1990Ã†s on large dam construction [World Commission on Dams, 2000].  A more thorough understanding of channel response to alteration will provide biologists and ecologists a currently lacking tool in assessing how a variety of alterations (dam construction, urbanization, land-use changes, climate change, erosion control, water diversions, vegetation change, etc.) will impact habitat availability This research seeks to contribute towards that goal of predicting changes in the condition of physical habitat within a stream.
