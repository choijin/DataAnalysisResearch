<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Brood parasites lay eggs in nests of hosts, who often go on to raise the parasitic chicks to the detriment of their own offspring. This study was designed to begin a collaboration to investigate two similar host defense strategies that have evolved independently among two very different lineages of birds&mdash;coots and gerygones. This EAPSI program has sparked a set of long-term collaborations between labs in the U.S. and Japan. The proposed work on this current project is ongoing, with measurable progress continuing after the summer program. Current work in the two labs involve development of theoretical models that investigate the effects of hatching order on chick recognition in gerygones and dynamics of critical periods of learning on such recognition systems in American coots. The collaborative study will then combine these models into a more universal model that would be useful for comparative studies across systems. Moreover, the EAPSI program allowed me to develop connections with other researchers in the fields of ornithology and behavioral ecology in Japan. I have committed participate in aspects of organization of the International Ornithological Congress (to be held at my host institution in Japan in 2014), which will no doubt foster more international collaborations in the future. Meetings with Japanese researchers at other international meetings have also become more fruitful, with more intimate knowledge of projects in the respective contries leading to development of more concrete ideas. My project has also led to another EAPSI project by a graduate student in my current lab, who is now visiting the same host institution in Japan and strengthening the network between ornithologists in Japan and the U.S.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/15/2011<br>      Modified by: Daizaburo&nbsp;Shizuka</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
