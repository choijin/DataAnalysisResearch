<AbstractNarration>The project uses a synergistic approach to understand the biodiversity and evolution of ferns, a major component of the land flora and will focus on a group of tropical ferns within the genus Elaphoglossum. There are more than 600 species of Elaphoglossum and the vast majority of these species are characterized by simple leaves.  However, there is a group within Elapholgossum, section Squamipedia, that has 3 species with compound leaves. The project seeks to understand the genetic basis of these diverse leaf morphologies after first discovering the evolutionary relationships among these plants. All the species in Elaphoglossum section Squamipedia will be inventoried and described using field work, herbarium collections and morphological analyses, followed by analysis of DNA sequences that will develop phylogenetic hypotheses.  The genetic basis of fern leaf diversity in section Squamipedia will be examined by cloning candidate leaf genes and performing comparative expression and developmental analyses in compound and simple leaved species. These studies are integral for understanding general patterns of leaf evolution and development in land plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will initiate a collaboration between PI Moran, a systematist, and Co-PI Ambrose, a developmental biologist. This proposal will provide interdisciplinary training for a female postdoctoral associate from Latin America. In connection with the field work, the PI will teach a course on ferns and lycophytes at the Catholic University in Quito, Ecuador. The PI will also work with members of the New York Fern Society on Elaphoglossum morphology. The Co-PI participates in the NYBG summer internship program that provides research experience for high school and undergraduate students. All results of the study will be made publicly available on the Elaphoglossum Pages Web site (http://sweetgum.nybg.org/elaphoglossum/index.php) and in peer-reviewed scientific journals.</AbstractNarration>
