<AbstractNarration>This award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Oakland University.   The goal of the site in the Physics Department at Oakland University (OU) is to expose young students from universities and community colleges, as well as senior high-school students, to the excitement of rigorous scientific research.  Projects are available in physics, materials, medical physics, and biochemistry.   For ten weeks, students will participate in an intensive research program composed of one-on-one mentoring, dedicated seminars, tutorials, field trips, and social activities, culminating in a conference-style final presentation.   The multidisciplinary team assembled will provide a variety of research-centered activities (tutorials, an ethics course, research intensive field trips) in a relaxed atmosphere provided by a small University campus.   This award is funded by the Division of Physics with co-funding support from the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main outcome of the Oakland University Physics REU was its ability to confirm the existence of a vast amount of human potential in young underrepresented minorities, and, mainly, the viability of taping into it with modest investment of resources in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines.  The Physics REU at Oakland University served a total of 22 students. The majority of these students came from underprivileged backgrounds.
