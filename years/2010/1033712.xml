<AbstractNarration>The field of vector-borne diseases spans the biology and genomics of the arthropod vectors of mammalian and plant disease agents, the microbes and viruses transmitted by insects and ticks, and host responses to vectors and vector-borne diseases. Advances in molecular biology and genomics have created an unprecedented opportunity for deciphering common evolutionary adaptations of vectors and pathogens they transmit. This award will support participation of early-career scientists in the "Facing the Challenges of Vector-Borne Diseases in the 21st Century" symposium at the University of California at Riverside, March 27-28, 2010. The UCR symposium is the first to bring together researchers in the area of vector-borne disease of plants and animals. Seven  scientific sessions and two forumswill provide opportunities to discuss cross-disciplinary topics. This meeting will synergize experts from the animal and plant communities, who often do not interact, in order to bring about a greater understanding of the current themes and challenges for the future, providing a new paradigm for meetings in this research area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: It is anticipated that by bringing together scientists from the plant and animal disease-vector communities using a range of approaches from molecular genetics, genomics and social sciences, this symposium will enable synergistic interactions and stimulate research innovations and collaborations in these fields. With only 104 participants, the symposium affords researchers, including graduate students and postdoctoral associates, an opportunity for one-on-one discussions and exchanges to an extent that is not usually possible at large professional society meetings. The NSF funds will be used to support the travel of early career investigators including Assistant Professors, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Women, underrepresented minority participants, and postdocs and students from the labs of Assistant Professors will be encouraged to participate.</AbstractNarration>
