<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the development of a deep water remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to support a variety of benthic ecology and coral studies.  The primary use of this instrument is to explore and characterize the diversity and biology of deep-water coral reef habitats (&gt;30 m), also known as the Coral Reef "Twilight Zone." The ROV allows coral reef scientists to 1) explore and quantitatively record the biogeography and biodiversity of deep reef communities at depths from 10 to 750m with particular emphasis on the deep coral, sponge and microbial communities worldwide; and (2) examine the issue of connectivity between shallow and deep reefs, and between reef systems worldwide using both molecular genetics and assessments of phenotypic variation between reef systems.  The ROV also enables in situ sampling and preservation at depth to facilitate the study of deep reef physiology and taxonomy of new species on coral reefs.  In addition to the standard faculty research, summer undergraduate research project participants utilize the ROV and post their findings on the American Museum of Natural History 'Science Bulletins' website.  Science Bulletins is an innovative online and exhibition program that offers the public a window into the excitement of scientific discovery.  Additional outcomes from these research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Major Research Instrumentation award funded the development of a deep water remotely operated vehicle (ROV), "DeepReef," to support a variety of benthic ecology and coral studies.  Deep tropical corals are a region of ecological significance, unusual physiological adaptations, and untapped biodiversity that largely remains unexplored.  The goal of this NSF MRI project was to design and manufacture a small, portable and easily maneuverable ROV that can provide a range of services to marine biologists and ocean scientists as well as molecular biologists, cell biologists, microbiologists and organic chemists studying deep reef biology.  The primary use of this instrument is to explore and characterize the diversity and biology of deep-water coral reef habitats (&gt;30 m), also known as the Coral Reef "Twilight Zone." The ROV allows scientists to 1) explore and quantitatively record the biogeography and biodiversity of deep reef communities at depths from 10 to 750m with particular emphasis on the deep coral, sponge and microbial communities worldwide; and (2) examine the issue of connectivity between shallow and deep reefs, and between reef systems worldwide using both molecular genetics and assessments of phenotypic variation between reef systems.   A custom SeaEye Falcon DR serves the core backbone vehicle.  We then added a telemetry expansion system to enable multi-function capacity to the ROV.  New high-definition and low-light cameras were designed, engineered and field tested on the ROV.  This also allows for the study of the deep reef community without perturbing them with high-intensity illumination, as well as to visualize and study bioluminescence.  A fluorescence illumination and camera system was designed, engineered and field-tested to image and study biofluorescence on deep coral reefs.  The ROV also enables in situ sampling at depth to facilitate the study of deep reef physiology and taxonomy of new species on coral reefs. Robotic sampling capabilities were designed and field tested, taking into consideration pioneering genomic techniques that investigate the genome of uncharacterized species from just a single sample.  The "DeepReef" ROV was on display at the American Museum of Natural History from February 27, 2014 - March 5, 2014 as part of a public exhibition that featured "DeepReef" and a one-person atmospheric diving suit.  http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/the-exosuit/rov-and-cameras          Last Modified: 11/29/2015       Submitted by: David Gruber]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
