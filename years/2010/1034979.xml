<AbstractNarration>I/UCRC for the Ceramic, Composite and Optical Materials Center &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1034979 Clemson University; Dennis Smith &lt;br/&gt;1034978 Rutgers University; Richard Haber &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for the Ceramic, Composite and Optical Materials Center (CCOMC) will focus on providing a broader range of relevant technologies critical to materials-based companies. Clemson University and Rutgers University are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with Clemson University as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Ceramic Research (CRC) at Rutgers University, a past member of an ending NSF I/UCRC for Ceramic and Composite Materials Center (CCR), proposes to join with the Center for Optical Material Science and Engineering Technologies (COMSET) at Clemson University to form the proposed new Center (CCOMC) with new technological thrusts. COMSET has developed a strong industrial base, with three spin-off companies that, combined with Rutgers University, would provide a new and unique research program. The mission of the proposed Center (CCOMC) is to develop new innovations that enable and sustain United States competitiveness in ceramic, particulate, composite and optical material science, technology and engineering. Furthermore, the CCOMC will transfer these new innovations to its industrial members for competitive reproducible ceramic, particulate, composite and optical materials, for advanced, high performance commercial products. The proposed center's research projects are integrated into five thrust areas: powder synthesis and processing, nanoparticulates and processes, optical material synthesis and processing, materials for defense sciences, and materials for energy conversion. The proposed research program across the five thrust areas will be carried out by an interdisciplinary group of faculty and across different academic disciplines. The PIs are well-qualified and have adequate resources to conduct the proposed research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center (CCOMC) has the potential to improve sustainability and profitability of US manufacturing by developing new technologies in the ceramic, optic and composite material field. CCOMC has plans in place for involving under-represented groups, to recruit highly qualified faculty and graduate students, and to motivate undergraduate students through unique research experiences and fellowships. Results will be disseminated through semi-annual meetings, publications, and a website for information, results and accomplishments. CCOMC will continue to integrate research and education; and by providing hands-on experience to students, the Center will attempt to motivate students to go beyond common approaches towards learning by hands-on experiences in state-of-the-art facilities focusing on todays relevant materials issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the existence of the CCOMC at Clemson University center we have focused on fiber based materials that are multifunctional in nature.  Nature herself, by a long evolutionary process, has modified fibers over a tremendous timescale. In human terms the reasons for creating multifunctional textiles can be traced to the early days of chemical processing to modify natural fibers over 100 years ago.  After over one hundred years one might ask the question, what else is there to do in fibers and or textiles or composites?   Certainly many of the traditional multifunctional textile requirements have been solved. Indeed todayÆs consumers have come to expect and appreciate improvements in comfort, fashion and functionality. However, the traditional textile industry has been unable to deliver new technological innovations. This is largely due to the limited material properties of currently available polymers and in fact their physical properties and chemical capabilities on many levels are still somewhat disappointing. By using making use of multifunctional fibers and scalable manufacturing techniques a new wave of transformational textiles will be produced with enhanced fiber and fabric functionalities far beyond those available today. Moreover these new multifunctional fiber or textile substrates will find uses in everyday consumer items and in specialist industrial sectors.  These new fiber materials could potentially offer the ability to provide optical communication and sensing technologies at an apparel level, energy emissive fibers could provide efficient methods of light distribution in flexible textile systems. In other cases the fibers have self-cleaning, self-sustaining and self-replenishing properties. These are a but a few of a multitude of other applications in both a fiber or fabric format.  In terms of textile manufacturing new added functionalities offer new marketing opportunities, products and branding opportunities to enhance profit and revitalize the great history of textile manufacture in the USA.   Specifically our research has involved the chemical synthesis of polymers for high performance fiber manufacture, the synthesis of optical materials for use in polymer fibers to produce light emitting fibers, the chemical synthesis of polymers manufacture of fiber that are inherently composites or could be used in advanced flexible composite structures.  For example we have and are developing Optically active fibers and coatings which depending upon the end use environment the impacts of an industrially feasible way to produce light emitting polymer fibers which could encompass and impact - safety applications, fashion, product differentiation and authentication and novel lighting effects in many textile based substrates. In other words we would be visually changing the appearance of the environment that people work in and see in everyday life.  In another example we have developed Fibers that will possess hydrophobic/oleophobic properties for an extended period of time. Imagine a substrate that over time continues to change to keep its liquid repellent properties over time despite attempts to wear out that material. This is akin to how plants continually produce a waxy surface to maintain their function. We have essentially developed new chemical technologies that mimics this process but for in applications for human use in industrial, personal and household sectors.
