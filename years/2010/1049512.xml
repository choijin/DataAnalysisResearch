<AbstractNarration>1049512&lt;br/&gt;Khan &lt;br/&gt;This is a US-Pakistan Research project: Neotectonic studies of the Northwestern Himalayas.  The foreign collaborator is Dr. Khalid Mahmood, University of Sargodha, Sargohda, Pakistan.  They plan a detailed study of neo-tectonics at the leading edge of the India-Asia collision, in the Salt Ranges of NW Pakistan. They will combine remote sensing studies using new cutting edge products with on-the-ground studies using geophysics and ground-based lidar. The frontal zone of the Salt Ranges is relatively unstudied (compared to the more 'exciting' higher Himalayas) yet it represents the most active zone of deformation and a source of high magnitude earthquakes. By studying small areas in great detail and correlating remote sensing data with detailed field studies, it should be possible for the PI's to extrapolate their results to regions outside of their detailed study zones.  The proposed work will support research and educational activities of two undergraduate and two graduate students from the University of Houston who will work in collaboration with the team of students and faculty from three universities in Pakistan. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The overall objective is to investigate in detail the area in and around the active thrust system of Himalayas in Pakistan using GPS, remote sensing, and Ground Penetrating Radar. By integrating the new findings with published data, this study intends to understand the formation mechanism and models explaining its evolution of the Himalayan Frontal Thrust System. This study will access the current tectonic activities along the Himalayan Thrust Front and will evaluate the causes of abrupt change in the trend of frontal system. This work will also investigate one of the grand mysteries of early human civilization by looking for signs of major earthquakes in Harappa, an archaeological site of a major city in one of the world?s four greatest ancient civilizations.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The study area is located close to six megacities and hosts major portions of the world's population. Collision-related seismicity across this region has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and catastrophic economic losses in this area. The neotectonic studies on active Himalayan Thrust Front will help earthquake prediction and mitigation. Additionally, our work will further US-Pakistan cooperation in science, critical to the national interest in this region. This work will provide for support for at least one US graduate student and one US undergraduate student participating in this research, and will afford opportunities for advanced training and education of US and Pakistani students, and wide-ranging scientific and cultural exchanges.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Salt tectonics in Northern Pakistan affects the geological structures and the seismology of the area. Salt layers are important in influencing the deformation style of geological structures. The difference in deformation intensity between the Potwar Plateau-Salt Range and the Kohat Plateau-Surghar Range systems is mainly attributed to the presence of a Pre-Cambrian salt layer. Overburden will translate efficiently on the ductile salt detachment and will result in low internal deformation, which is evident in the Potwar Plateau-Salt Range system. In this system, the salt layers act as a lubricant between the overlying sedimentary layers and the basement rocks. In contrast, the Kohat Plateau-Surghar Range system has high internal deformation. This could be due to the absence or the thinning of the salt layers which causes increase friction between the overburden and the basement rocks. This study is an attempt to investigate the role of salt in the geological deformation of the Salt Range-Potwar Plateau using InSAR and 2-D seismic interpretations. InSAR results suggest that the Salt Range may still be tectonically active. Six migrated seismic reflection lines were interpreted showing basement ramps due to normal faults. These ramps are believed to act as transition zones between different roles of salt; salt layer act as a decollement to the north and salt flow is prominent to the south. Furthermore, the results also suggest that differential loading is the main driving force for the salt flowing to the south. However, buoyancy force may play a significant role in the deformation of the Salt Range due to the uplift. Moreover, both the salt layer and the geometry of the basement influence the deformation style in this region. This work suggests that the Salt Range and Potwar Plateau region is a thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belt due to the wedge shape of the plateau and the salt acting as the weak detachment layer.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/07/2013<br>      Modified by: Shuhab&nbsp;D&nbsp;Khan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1049512/1049512_10041582_1383844842327_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1049512/1049512_10041582_1383844842327_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Location"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1049512/1049512_10041582_1383844842327_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Location"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Location of the study area in Northern Pakistan.
