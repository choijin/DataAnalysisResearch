<AbstractNarration>This project is to support the participation of students in Fifth Symposium on Computational Wind Engineering in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on May 23-27, 2010.  The symposium is organized every four years and is a major event emphasizing the computational aspects of wind engineering. The student participation in this symposium will provide them an excellent opportunity to interact with and learn from a large number of established researchers and practitioners working in the area of wind engineering and wind hazard mitigation.  This will enhance their scientific knowledge base to get involved more deeply in the topic to address the engineering problems of current interest. This will also help in training the next generation of workforce who will eventually be involved in the mitigation of the wind related hazards.</AbstractNarration>

In summary, NSF supported the travel expenses and/or registration fees for 17 students, 2 postdoctoral fellows and 9 faculty to attend the conferences to present papers and/or posters.  These conferences provided an international forum for the presentation of individual and national accomplishments.  Attending these conferences afforded the US university students and faculty the opportunity to present papers and/or posters on wind engineering and computational wind engineering topics. These travel grants provided the participants, in particular students, the opportunity to expand their knowledge of wind engineering in the international community by attending these conferences and to establish collaborations with international wind engineering professionals.  In addition, participation of the US community in these conferences broadened and expanded the national knowledge base in wind engineering.  They also promoted the work of US-based scientists and engineers on the world stage.  It is hoped that these opportunities will be used to initiate long-term research collaborations among regional universities.
