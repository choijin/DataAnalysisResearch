<AbstractNarration>1036159&lt;br/&gt;Dolan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inverse techniques for application to heat transfer problems can impact, perhaps significantly, the solution of problems ranging from experimental determination of thermophysical or other properties of materials, to the specification of appropriate protocol for applying thermal-based treatments aimed at producing a desired therapeutic outcome. Mathematical-based and rigorous inverse solution methods have the potential to replace costly trial-and-error, and brute-force forward predictions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  This grant provides partial support for graduate students to attend the 2010 Inverse Problems Symposium at Michigan State University on June 6 - 8, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;Inverse problems have received increasing attention in the heat transfer and thermal transport processes community, and novel methods are needed in order to effectively utilize recent advances in, for example, computational architecture. One benefit of a rigorous inverse analysis is its ability to unveil multiple solutions for a given objective function. These otherwise-unknown, yet valid solutions may be more economical to implement, may produce less waste or consume less energy, and may provide enhanced productivity in an industrial setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. NSF funding will provide support for the attendance at the symposium by engineering and food science graduate students who are engaged in heat transfer research. The students will be provided with a unique opportunity to interact with a highly-multidisciplinary cadre of international leaders in the field of inverse problems and solution methodologies. Efforts will be made to identify and involve participants from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background: In engineering science, a physical process is typically analyzed using a mathematical model in which the actual system is represented by a set of equations containing parameters.  The classical direct problem is to find the output of the system given the input and the system parameters.  Inverse problems, on the other hand, involve determining the unknown causes of known consequences. Therefore, inverse problems involve determining either the unknown inputs or the unknown parameters.  The applications of inverse problems are very broad, including examples in heat transfer, mechanical areas, food processing, aerospace, biomedical, and chemical industries.  Summary:  Inverse Problems Symposium 2010 was successfully held on June 6-8, 2010 at Michigan State University. A total of 60 people registered and paid, including the 10 graduate students funded by NSF, and 6 foreign participants from Canada and Italy.  On Sunday afternoon (6/6/10), Dr. James Beck gave a 1.5-hr tutorial, followed by 3 other professors on an overview of parameter estimation.  A total of 31 oral and 12 poster presentations were given on a wide range of scientific and engineering topics, listed in the attached program, all having to do with inverse problems.  Keynote speakers gave talks on inverse problems in wind energy, in using Comsol, and in radiology.  Dr. Beck was honored at the Monday evening banquet for 50 years of service to the inverse problems and heat conduction area.  A CD with all presentations and Dr. BeckÆs book notes was given to all registrants.   Highlights: Because participants came from all over the U.S., much opportunity was given for networking, sharing of notes and research findings, and future collaboration.  Many of the leaders in inverse problems are retiring, so this type of conference was helpful for fostering connections between researchers and graduate students, and to mentor and encourage younger researchers. One special characteristic of this conference was that it promoted cross-discipline interaction within inverse problems.  Another item of note is that the following popular subjects were addressed:  1. MRI/PET inverse problem challenges were presented by the Monday banquet speaker.  2.  Lead speaker discussed inverse problems related to alternative energy.  3.  Some Inverse problems had application to nanotechnology.  4.  Food safety is a national priority that desperately needs inverse problems, but has very few people working in the area.  5.  Bioengineering/biology/medicine applications were given.
