<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Brodbelt and her students will develop photodissociation in conjunction with chemical derivatization methods that add chromophores and/or charge sites to molecules in order to modify ion fragmentation patterns. Mass spectrometry has become one of the most versatile methods for structural characterization of biological molecules, and enhancing the selectivity of mass spectrometric strategies remains a priority. This work will follow a theme aimed at the structural characterization of biological molecules by using ion activation methods that incorporate targeted selectivity, while also building a framework for understanding the impact of site-specific chromophores on ion activation. The primary goals include the evaluation of charge state on dissociation efficiency, the attachment of chromophores to enhance dissociation efficiencies, the incorporation of selectively cleavable bonds into molecules, and the development of photodissociation for high throughput analysis of proteins. In addition to the important scientific goals of this proposal, the education of future scientists is an equally significant outcome with long-term impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of better analytical tools, including the mass spectrometric strategies pursued in the proposed work, is needed to elucidate the structures of molecules responsible for many biological functions, such as antibodies that fight viruses and muscle contraction in the heart. The anticipated benefits arising from the proposed work include: 1) the training and education of future scientists in the area of analytical chemistry and biological mass spectrometry, and 2) the development of innovative laser-based strategies for structural characterization of biological molecules such as peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Mass spectrometry has become an indispensable analytical method for identifying and characterizing all types of biologically important molecules, ranging from peptides to lipids to proteins.  These types of molecules serve as the basic building blocks of human life, and thus it is critical to have versatile and sensitive strategies to monitor these molecules, map changes or modifications in the molecules, and profile their distribution in complex mixtirues (such as cells or tissues).  The aim of the proposed work was to develop advanced laser-based approaches to improve the characterization of peptides and proteins by generating informative fragmentation patterns which serve as fingerprints of the molecules.  This laser-based strategy, termed "photodissociation", was implemented on several high performance mass spectrometers and demonstrated for a number of applications. Goals that were accomplished included:  (1) manipulation of the charge states of peptides to investigate the change in dissociation efficiency, fragmentation patterns, and distribution of fragment ions.  (2) incorporation of selectively cleavabe bonds into molecules to allow a means to track molecules. (3) addition of chromphores into molecules to make them responsive to laser irradiation.  Accomplishment of these goals lead to numerous scientific publications, advanced research training for doctoral graduate students, and new collaborations.   Broader impacts:  The education of new scientists was a key outcome.  A number of doctoral students in chemistry were trained to undertake research, to develop innovative solutions to challenging problems, to work cooperatively on complex collaborative projects spanning multiple disciplines, to communicate their findings in a number of formats, to develop leadership skills, and to formulate career plans that would allow them to be productive scientists in many fields.
