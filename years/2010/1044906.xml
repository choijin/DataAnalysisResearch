<AbstractNarration>This workshop of indigenous scholars and others will explore the creation of a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) based on indigenous ontology. The focus of the workshop is to discuss the possibility of new ways to format Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and Remote Sensing (RS) technology for managing spatial data by drawing upon the spatial knowledge systems imbedded in the cultural principles, practices, and protocols of many indigenous groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs and CoPIs are PhD scientists from diverse indigenous groups, Alaska Native, American Indian, Maori, and Hawaiian, and the workshop attendees will include scholars from these, as well as other groups. The expertise assembled will be cartography, cultural ecology, anthropology, oral history, computer science, GIS technology, human geography, linguistics, and medical sciences.  Participants will be invited through an open call for participation that will include Indigenous academics and cultural leaders, social scientists, computer scientists, SDI specialist, and others with relevant knowledge and interest; special attention will be made to reach out to new career scientists from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pointing to other international efforts (ESRI Conservation Program, Aboriginal Mapping network, Indigenous Mapping Network, and the Integrated Approaches to Participatory Development Project) where indigenous communities are engaging with spatial technologies in order to map their territories in a way they feel reflects their own knowledge, the research team successfully argues that there is potential to explore a different way of organizing spatial data. The organizers point out that in relationship to Indigenous cultural knowledges, GIS has been critiques for its limited potential or detrimental effects because it de-emphasized, ignores, or devalues concepts that are of central importance to Indigenous cultures, including the ubiquity of relatedness, the value of non-empirical experience, the need to control access to levels of geographical knowledge, and the value of ambiguity over binary thought. This workshop will go one step further than simply comparing the differences in cultural spatial knowledge and explore what kind of system could be based on Indigenous spatial realities, practices, and protocols and what would such a system look like? Not just looking at how indigenous knowledge differs from Western knowledge systems but at how one can actually structure a spatial information system that is based on indigenous conceptualizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Workshop on Indigenous ecological knowledges and geographic information sciences (GIS) &ndash; Project Outcomes Report for the General Public     Overview of Workshop  In February 2011 a National Science Foundation&ndash;funded workshop about Indigenous ecological knowledges and geographic information sciences (GIS) was held at the K?lauea Military Camp on the island of Hawai?i in order to explore geospatial techniques and technologies that are compatible to diverse communities.

These issues were the central focus of the workshop as attendees were tasked with determining what kinds of new information and/or understandings could be gained by developing an Indigenous GIS.  The Workshop Process  Experiential learning sessions based in Native Hawaiian practices became the foundation for our themed discussions. We set out to address four main research questions:  What are the characteristics and elements of an Indigenous GIS that is based on Indigenous epistemologies? How do these characteristics differ from conventional Western-based GIS? What kind of data model and structures are best suited to the characteristics of an Indigenous GIS? What standards and protocols can be developed for an Indigenous GIS?   However, we learned fairly quickly that while we prepared our thinking for this discussion, the constraints and differences of our specific disciplines were too disparate to begin with these questions.  Following the Workshop  At the end of the workshop, it was decided that the Hi?iaka Working Group should be formed by a group of interested participants to keep the momentum of the workshop alive. The Hi?iaka Working Group is now hosted by the newly formed Indigenous Geographies Research Center (IGRC) at the University of Kansas offered providing a home for the working group.
