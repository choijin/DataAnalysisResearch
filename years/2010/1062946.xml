<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Christian Brueckner at the University of Connecticut.  The research projects supported in this site are in a wide range of areas of chemistry. Undergraduates will be recruited to this site from regional colleges and universities that lack opportunities for undergraduate research.  The site will continue a fruitful collaboration with students and faculty from Central Connecticut State University.  The site will support eight undergraduate research students per summer in a ten week program.  A sample of the projects that researchers will work on include:  (1)  the synthesis and study of  protein-based (bacteriorhodopsin and variants) photovoltaic devices; (2)  the synthesis of interesting pyrrole-modified porphyrins; (3)  the synthesis and study of shape-memory polymer materials; (4)  the development of biocatalytic nanomaterials for chemical applications; (5) the study of the many roles and mechanisms of carotenoids in photosynthetic processes; and (6) the study of the conversion of biomass into useful fuels and chemicals.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including training in scientific ethics and communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide students without significant research experience a chance to conduct cutting-edge research in the chemical sciences with dedicated faculty mentors at this major university.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for further study in the chemical sciences, and graduate school, with eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

Another highlight of our ancillary program was a guided tour of a regional industrial research facility.  A seminar series was used as a community building component and a platform for presenting technical, professional and ethical issues of long-term importance. Seminar or workshop titles were, for example, "Chemical Hygiene Training" , the "The Ethics of Research", "Responsible Conduct of Research", "Giving an Effective Research Presentation", "Graduate Studies in Chemistry" , or "Diversity Panel Discussion".  Our REU program benefited from strong interactions with the other campus REU programs (Physiology and Neurobiology, Electrical and Computer Engineering and the proposed REU programs in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Polymer Chemistry, and Molecular and Cell Biology, and the NEAGEP program).

The key intellectual merit of the proposed activity was the exposure of students that had previously no or limited research experiences to a stimulating graduate-level research program promoted their pursuit of a career in the sciences.   The broader impact of the proposed activities was to expose our participants to a broad range of state-of-the-art chemical research. They gained research experience and skills in communicating their results and obtained a foundation for making informed choices about future careers in chemistry. They also established net&shy;works with peers from a range of disciplines and experiences. We are confident that our REU program enhanced the enthusiasm of our participants for chemistry, as judged by the large fraction of our participants that evenually chose a graduate career in the sciences.
