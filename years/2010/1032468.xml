<AbstractNarration>Over the last decade, new foundational authentication and authorization tools were developed and deployed within the US research/education infrastructure. These have substantially improved campus and inter-institutional capabilities to manage identity and access controls. It is time to systemically connect virtual organizations and scientific collaborations to this bedrock.  This research will extend existing base layer components to facilitate connection of domain science applications to the new infrastructure and will connect scientific collaborative capabilities through direct and intensive work with emblematic NSF-supported Virtual Organizations (VOs) across several Directorates. Much of this bedrock is based on work developed under the NSF Middleware Initiative and resulted in two transformative cybersecurity paradigms:  federated identity and domestication of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent of this research is to build on this bedrock to enable greater use by science and research communities.  It centers on improvement and extension of base systems ? Shibboleth, Grouper, COmanage ? into an integrated VO-oriented toolkit.  The toolkit is rooted in design and delivery to important and distinctive VOs, selected to insure service to a broad variety of VOs.  The toolkit will be used to construct federated and domesticated VO applications, both collaborative (wikis, lists, ad hoc calendaring, shared calendars, audioconferencing) and domain science (federated SSH, cvs, fileshares).  It will provide integrated identity management, access controls, group management, and provisioning/de-provisioning with these services connected to the bedrock for scalable and robust collaborations.  The tools will enable three primary approaches to collaborative research environments: command line orientation, science gateway, and collaboration management platform. The research should enhance critical cross-cutting areas regarding CI software, long-term sustainability, and self-manageability, and facilitate advances in CI-based science, engineering, and education through enhanced identity authentication and authorization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intent of the SDCI proposal was to build on the bedrock of authentication and authorization tools that has been developed over the last fifteen years within the US research and education space.  The work centered on improvement and extension of base systems &ndash; Shibboleth, Grouper and COmanage &ndash; into an integrated Virtual Organization (VO)-oriented toolkit.  Over time, the work narrowed down to focus on the collaboration platform, COmanage, as the mechanism to encourage the use of federated authentication and authorization. With two important VOs involved, LIGO and iPlant, the aim was to have a collaboration platform with a variety of tools that different VOs could use to enable the authentication and access requirements that support their scientific goals.  At the end of the project, COmanage is deployed in production at VOs around the world.  As part of an extension to the original grant, the projec also created a national infrastructure in support of eduroam, the global network access roaming federation. By the conclusion of the grant, the eduroam infrastructure was incorporated within the Internet2 network, with support tools and documentation would be provided, and participation of R&amp;E institutions augmented.  COmanage deployed in production within LIGO as part of their work with KAGRA in Japan during the summer of 2013, and was deployed as part of the collaboration with the Center for Gravitation, Cosmology, and Astrophysics (CGCA) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in spring of 2014.  In addition, the COmanage project enjoyed significant international outreach and cooperation with SURFnet (the Dutch Federation), GakuNin (the Japanese Federation), and G&Eacute;ANT (the pan-European research and education network), and the US National Institute of Health (NIH). While not funded out of the SDCI grant itself, COmanage instances have been deployed within G&Eacute;ANT, the NIH, and other VOs around the world.  Project status has been tracked through a Jira ticket tracking system, and over the life of the project, 1,144 tickets have been opened and 722 tickets--over 60%--have been resolved. The categories of tickets were fairly evenly distributed between bug reports, feature requests, and feature improvements. For the tickets that remain unresolved, the project is expected to continue past the life of the grant and those tickets will be a core component of future work. All tickets considered critical to a 1.0 release candidate have been resolved as of the end of this grant.  To further the understanding around identity management and collaboration as it applies to VOs, there were several presentations at a variety of levels regarding VOs and their identity management needs, COmanage as a platform, and the field of identity management as it applies to researchers.   With deployments appearing in production, an increasing number of applications able to consume group and identity information through collaboration platforms, and a general increase in the interest expressed in COmanage as a leading effort in this space, the grant to date has been quite successful in its overall goals.   In addition to the development of COmanage, another positive outcome has been closer cooperation between Internet2 and SURFnet, the Dutch NREN, and developers of the OpenConext collaboration management platform.  OpenConext and COmanage have been developed in parallel, with each group focusing on a different component that ultimately allows a graceful integration of a smooth end-user interface (OpenConext) and a strong enrollment and identity management function (COmanage).
