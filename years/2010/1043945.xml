<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop a framework for undergraduate curriculum in security and privacy for pervasive computing environments at three levels: (1) security and privacy for emerging application-layer protocols; (2) wireless security; and (3) security for handheld and resource-constrained devices. The proposed integrated software framework for security and privacy for pervasive computing is a novel and transformative idea. The authors propose to: (1) implement an instructional service discovery protocol suite to reduce the barrier for undergraduate students; (2) develop projects and lab exercises to explore wireless LAN and wireless PAN security; (3) build a collection of lab modules and assignments for students to understand attacks and explore defense approaches for smart phones and wireless sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deliverables of this project are available in a repository to share with other institutions, as well as to allow them to contribute modules and components. The project has a potential impact on future software programmers, administrators, and users of pervasive computing devices concerned with their security and privacy. It provides realistic projects to learn about the real-world threats and defenses.</AbstractNarration>

These devices are embedded into commodities (e.g., cameras, watches, wearable/implantable medical devices, and TVs) and tightly integrated into our daily life.  Via wireless networks and recently developed protocols, these devices may easily communicate with smartphones and tablets.  Such pervasive computing environments have become the inevitable future of computer technology. The security and privacy threats to pervasive computing are overwhelming.

In addition, the PIs have been working in the cyber security education and research areas and are committed to broadening their collaboration in education with other universities to partially alleviate the shortage of skilled cyber security graduates.  Multiple female graduate students have designed and developed the learning modules and the PSP website.
