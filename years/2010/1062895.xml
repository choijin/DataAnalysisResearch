<AbstractNarration>This project creates an REU site around the theme of sustainable energy that will train future scientists and engineers with the skills and perspectives necessary to address some of the world's future energy needs based on biomass. To accomplish this, students perform research in sustainable energy, attend seminars on topics related to sustainability and personal development, and work on a team project related to sustainable energy. Students are required to present their research in a symposium at the end of the program, and are provided funds to present their research at regional or national meetings. Nine students are recruited each year for a 10-week summer program. Targeted recruitment is done to enhance the diversity of the REU participants. The program impacts the REU participants by providing them training in scientific skills and knowledge they need for research in sustainable energy, giving them a sense of the broader picture of sustainability, and helping them develop the personal skills they will need to be successful scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research produced by the REU students under the guidance of their faculty and IGERT fellow mentors will advance the state of knowledge in sustainable energy. REU student researchers will contribute to advances in the areas of conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals with an array of processing technologies based on thermal and biochemical processing. The unique integrated approach uniting social sciences, economics, and engineering as embodied in the existing IGERT greatly enhances the impact of the student researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This REU site provides a rich research experience focused on the personal and professional development of the participants integrated with the graduate work by teams of IGERT fellows and Faculty. Students gain not only the technical abilities required to conduct research in sustainable energy, but also become aware of the social and political issues associated with sustainable energy. By being involved in a team project on sustainable energy, students learn to seek outside sources of information and gain an increased capacity for self directed learning and original investigation. This REU site also enhances the participation of students from underrepresented groups in research and in graduate school through targeted personal recruiting by Faculty.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Students involved in the Summer Academy in Sustainable BioEnergy REU were provided with a research experience that afforded them an understanding of the research process while simultaneously advancing technology development for the sustainable production of biomass-derived fuels and chemicals.  Research Results and Dissemination   Research completed by the student participants advanced our understanding of the role of fertilizer on green house gas emissions, appropriate technology for producing and purifying biorefinery products, and the willingness of farmers and rural communities to participate in the biorefining economy.  Each student in the program produced a website summarizing their project. Websites are posted at cse.ksu.edu/node/105. They have been viewed several hundred times and provide easy access for the public into this research topic.   Additionally, the research completed by student participants resulted in 16 conference presentations and three peer-reviewed journal publications.   Each year, the program participants presented their research findings in a University-wide forum.  Over the course of the program, the number of presenters and audience members at these forums has grown.  In 2011, approximately 25 people viewed the nine posters from our REU program. Subsequently, we partnered with other REU and REU-type programs on campus and held joint sessions.   In 2013, a joint poster session was held that featured REU students from our program as well as students from five other programs.  A total of 48 students participated in the event.  More than 150 people attended.   Training in BioEnergy  Since few scientists or engineers have the background to easily anticipate the barriers faced by new proposed agricultural feedstocks. Various field experiences were provided to REU participants to improve their knowledge of the sustainable bioenergy process. REU participants toured the Flint Hills Discovery Center to gain an appreciation of how the Flint Hills were formed. They visited the NCRA Oil Refinery Company and an ICM corn-based ethanol facility to compare processes. They saw a demonstration of state-of-the-art harvesting equipment at AGCO and visited the farm of Lee and Margaret Scheufler, Sterling, Kansas where Lee explained harvesting and no-till techniques of his farm operation.  Recruiting Results      During the three-year program, we have received applications from more than 500 students and provided training to 28.  Analysis of the 2011 data indicated most of our applications were from engineering students with a modest pool of sociologists, economists, and agricultural scientists.  Therefore, in 2012 and 2013, we expanded our direct out-reach activities to faculty and staff in these programs and realized a significant increase in applicant numbers.  The number applications doubled over the course of the project, from 108 in 2011 to 228 in 2013.   Demographics of the REU students selected to participate in the 2011-2013 period indicates that 43% of the participants were female, 11% African American, 11% Asian, 4% were disabled, and 35% came from undergraduate-serving institutions.  Clearly, the students represent a diverse group based on gender, race, and the nature of their undergraduate institutions.  Furthermore, the 28 participants came from 24 different undergraduate institutions across the nation.  Over the three-year project, seven students (24%) were seeking degrees in sociology, sustainability, or economics, 12 (41%) were studying engineering, and 10 (34%) were studying soil science.   Participants Found the Program to be of High Quality   Assessment results compiled by the Office of Educational Innovation and Evaluation indicate that the program was highly successful in achieving each of the program goals.  Past participants were enthusiastic about their REU experience and felt that it broadened their perspective on life as a research scientist and positively impacted their ability to succeed in...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
