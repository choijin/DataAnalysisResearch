<AbstractNarration>Berliner, 1049064&lt;br/&gt;Wikle, 1049093&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The focus of this project is the development of a climate and climate-impact prediction framework by applying Bayesian reasoning.  Bayesian analysis is a theoretically grounded technique for combining information, learning from data and then forming predictions while representing uncertainties in these steps.  Modern hierarchical Bayesian modeling has proved very effective in complicated settings.  The strategy involves the specification of probability distributions, known as data models, for a variety of observational data sources.  In addition, probability distributions, known as prior process models, are formulated for unknown processes interacting with each other on various space-time scales, as well as unknown parameters.  The prior distributions for the processes are combined with the data models via Bayes' Theorem to produce a posterior probability distribution for the unknown quantities.  This distribution serves as the basis for prediction.  The reliance on probability means that uncertainty management is built-in to the approach.  The key to our approach is to incorporate climate model output, at both global and regional scales, as if they are observations.  These data are then combined with relatively simple, though physically based, prior models.  The corresponding computations needed for prediction and uncertainty quantification are orders of magnitude easier than those associated with large-scale climate system models.  Probability theory provides techniques for using the analyses to produce predictions and associated uncertainties of impacts.  These results then serve as the basis for decision support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A critical challenge in current climate research is the prediction of regional climate behavior on decadal time scales.  Reliable predictions of climate on decadal scales are the cornerstone of decision support for policy makers in their selection of adaptation strategies to address the impacts of climate change.  Substantial information regarding climate is produced by climate system models.  However, model results are subject to a variety of uncertainties.  Further, these models are very demanding computationally and produce massive datasets, so there are severe limitations on our ability to quantify the uncertainties associated with model-based predictions.  To respond to the challenge, we develop Bayesian techniques for predictive analyses that use climate model output in an efficient fashion and also deal with uncertainty.  This combined use of large-scale climate system models, regional climate models, and simple climate models creates a synergistic environment in climate science.  Next, because our strategy relies on comparatively simple calculations, we provide techniques for producing impact-specific and local or regional-specific predictive information in response to the needs of a variety of decision makers having a variety of responsibilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The environment in which we live is a complex collection of physical, biological and social processes that interact and operate on a vast range of spatial and temporal scales.  Although we have amassed quite a large body of knowledge and data about environmental systems, not all of this knowledge and data are created equal!  In addition, it seems the more we learn, the more we realize how much more there is to learn about these systems &ndash; that is, we recognize that our knowledge of processes is not certain.  Fortunately, we are in a period where there is a huge variety of new data sources becoming available &ndash; all the way from large mechanistic simulation models, satellite and radar sensors, animal geo-location sensors, and a seemingly endless amount of social interaction data, to name a few.  Given changing environmental conditions, it is important that we utilize/synthesize as much of this information as possible in a coherent fashion to help individuals and organizations to make informed decisions that realistically account for the requisite uncertainties that our present throughout the data and our understanding of the process.     Starting in the mid-1990s, the PIs started to develop a coherent framework that accounted for uncertainty in environmental systems through thinking about a hierarchy of statistical models that could be linked through a formal probability framework.  This formal probability-based linkage was important because it allowed uncertainties to propagate through the system &ndash; so, uncertainties in data and processes could be factored together.  This important framework is known as Bayesian hierarchical modeling.  One of the most beneficial things about this framework is that it can easily accommodate multiple sources of information, whether it concern different datasets, different process models, or different controlling parameters in those models.  The primary goals of our project were to develop this framework with the purpose of more efficiently accounting for multiple datasets and process mechanisms to sensibly combine information so as to predict climate processes on moderate (6 months to 1 year) time frames and, perhaps more importantly, to consider the impacts of climate variation that occurs on such time scales to important environmental phenomena. In addition, we developed methods for improving ones ability to understand potential causal relationships in complex spatio-temporal environmental processes and for decision support in such systems.     Through the publications and presentations that arose out of this grant project, we have demonstrated improved abilities to predict and understand a wide variety of climate impacts. In particular, we have considered the forecasting of settling patterns for migratory waterfowl (which impacts wildlife management and avian influenza disease risk), soil-moisture in corn-producing states, tornado occurrence, and key planktonic concentrations associated with the lower trophic ecosystem. All of these processes are related in some significant way to the variation in sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean.  Several of our projects have been concerned with improving our ability to predict these sea surface temperatures at long lead times.  We have also considered models to help understand pollutant load impacts on the Great Barrier Reef, and historical snow accumulation in Greenland, among others.
