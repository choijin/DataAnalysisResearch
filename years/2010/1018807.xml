<AbstractNarration>Network-data-plane-disrupting bugs can cause the disruption of&lt;br/&gt;critical network applications. Unfortunately, today, there exists no&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive solution for detecting data-plane-disrupting&lt;br/&gt;bugs. Consequently, the network operator has few useful leads for&lt;br/&gt;investigating bug-triggered problems. To bridge this gap, this project&lt;br/&gt;develops novel measurement-based solutions for automatic bug detection&lt;br/&gt;that are accurate and scalable. The results from this project will&lt;br/&gt;significantly improve the reliability of current and future generation&lt;br/&gt;networks. The expected results include network measurement techniques,&lt;br/&gt;data analysis methods, network-wide monitoring strategies, data&lt;br/&gt;structures and algorithms for high performance bug detection, and bug&lt;br/&gt;localization techniques. These solutions will (1) save IT personnel&lt;br/&gt;resources because network operators no longer need to troubleshoot an&lt;br/&gt;entire complex network but instead can focus on finding the best&lt;br/&gt;solution for a detected bug; (2) reduce negative impact of bugs&lt;br/&gt;because the operator can immediately take proper defensive actions;&lt;br/&gt;(3) improve assurance after software or hardware updates since&lt;br/&gt;incorrect data plane behaviors resulting from updates could be&lt;br/&gt;automatically caught; (4) improve feedback to vendors since vendors&lt;br/&gt;can receive valuable information correlating detected bugs to&lt;br/&gt;configurations, updates, configuration changes, etc., which helps&lt;br/&gt;vendors diagnose the problem's root cause and develop solutions. The&lt;br/&gt;results from this project will be broadly disseminated through&lt;br/&gt;scientific workshops, conferences and journals, as well as through a&lt;br/&gt;project web site hosted at Rice University. Software and tools that&lt;br/&gt;are produced by this project will be released to the public under open&lt;br/&gt;source licenses.</AbstractNarration>
