<AbstractNarration>The discoveries made by ground-based gamma-ray observatories over the past decade have revolutionized the field of high energy particle astrophysics. The catalog of sources emitting high energy (more than 100 GeV) gamma rays now consists of ~100 objects, and new sources, and source classes, continue to be found. Supernova remnants, pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae, blazars, radio galaxies, starburst galaxies and stellar-mass binary systems have all been shown to emit very high energy gamma-radiation, along with numerous sources whose identification is still unclear. As well as probing sites of extreme particle acceleration in the Universe with unprecedented spectral, temporal and spatial resolution, gamma-ray observations may allow us to indirectly determine the nature of the dark matter that makes up a significant fraction of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide operational support for the group's ongoing research using VERITAS, an array of four large imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes sited in Arizona. They will use gamma-ray observations to study sites of particle acceleration in the Universe, focusing on supernova remnants and gamma-ray binary systems, with both deep observations of known sources, and discovery observations of new candidates. They will search for &gt; 100 GeV gamma-ray emission from regions of excess astrophysical neutrinos (identified by IceCube), or ultra-high energy cosmic rays (identified with Auger). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Delaware group will continue its education and public outreach activities through mentoring of students at the high school and undergraduate level. Members of the group will also give public presentations to local amateur astronomers, and other interested groups, as well as supporting the overall VERITAS outreach program by providing website materials and conducting on-site tours.</AbstractNarration>
