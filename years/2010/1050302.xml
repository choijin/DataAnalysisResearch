<AbstractNarration>As the scale of data has grown from the order of megabytes to the order of petabytes, energy and power have become a key consideration in managing (i.e., analyzing, organizing, and storing) such large datasets due to the increasing cost of powering the required data processing resources and cooling equipment. It is expected that the demand for data processing resources, both in the form of servers and mobile computing devices, will continue to increase exponentially. The goal of this two-day workshop is to act as a planning meeting for the development and deployment of energy-efficient data management methods and data-intensive applications which are important from both an economic and a sustainability perspective. The workshop includes invited talks, panels and breakout sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the workshop is expected to be in terms of guiding future research which will provide a more sustainable way of managing society's increasing and rapidly growing reliance on large data management systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information on the workshop can be found at www.energy-efficient-data-management.org/workshop.</AbstractNarration>

During the discussion three things became clear:  Power and energy should be a first-order resource and system design principle across all levels, instead of an afterthought. Their importance should also be made apparent through updated curricula, starting at the undergraduate level. Energy-efficient data management can be achieved with enabling hardware and cross-layer optimizations. Thus, stronger interaction among the data management, computer architecture, and data storage communities is needed in order for significant energy-efficiency in data management to be achieved. Continuous Data analytics (data stream processing and on the-fly data mining) and data visualization techniques are fundamental in meeting the goal of a sustainable energy grid. A starting point would be the design of smart (information-aware) buildings and communities.    Finally, a shared belief among all the participants is that NSF can play an important role in advancing energy-efficient computing, by facilitating energy-related infrastructure deployment and experimentations (e.g., through a community repository for energy data, along the lines of other disciplines such as astronomy, biology, etc).
