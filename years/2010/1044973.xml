<AbstractNarration>Multicore is now the default commodity approach to processor design; and research is actively exploring aggressive scaling and complex, heterogeneous approaches such as&lt;br/&gt;GPUs and hybrid GPU/CPU architectures. It has quite rapidly become essential to integrate knowledge of Multicore Computing into the Computer Science curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is seeking funding for planning and assessing development of a course called Multicore Computing in the Computer Science Department at Portland State University. The course is targeted to advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students, and spans traditional CS areas of architecture, operating systems, programming languages, parallel programming, and performance analysis. There is a pressing need for development of course related materials that  can be widely and more generally useful.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The shift in commodity computer hardware from single to multi-core processors has impacted many "traditional" notions of computer science.  This relatively recent approach combines multiple less powerful cores to replace a single, more powerful core.  In this project we developed educational tools to convey the impact of this change on the system software.  Specifically we developed lecture slides and notes that can be used in existing introductory computer science courses in Operating Systems and Computer Organization, and an application visualization tool that allows students to see the changes when a program runs with an increasing number of processor cores, rather than the traditional single core approach.  These materials were then tested in the classroom at Portland State University.  We developed a new course called General Purpose GPU computing, that uses the Graphics processor card as an example of a multi-core approach to replace traditional types of computing.  This new course has now been offered at Portland State University.  An understanding of this architectural sea change is essential for all students of computer science for a number of reasons.  One important reason is that different skills are required to write programs that run efficiently on multi-core machines.  Different tasks are performed simultaneously across the processor cores, requiring coordination.  Another reason is the urgent need for advances in system software to adapt to multicore platforms, requiring a suitably trained workforce.
