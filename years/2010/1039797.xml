<AbstractNarration>1039797  &lt;br/&gt;Selleck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of an integrated energy dispersive X-ray (EDS), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and panchromatic cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging system for the Department of Geology at Colgate University.  The integrated package will be mated to an existing JEOL 6360LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) that was acquired by Colgate with previous NSF/MRI support (EAR-0320639).   The enhanced capabilities of the SEM will support PI and student research including rock fabric investigations of footwall mylonites from Cordilleran core complexes using EBSD to infer the kinematics and temperature of their formation,  CL-SEM analysis of lower Paleozoic quartz sandstones of the Appalachian basin to infer the diagenetic history of micron-scale cement fabrics, and studies of the biomineralization of barnacle exoskeletons.  Colgate University is a non-Ph.D. granting institution.  The instrumentation will support undergraduate student training in state-of-the-art electron microscopy  research methods with applications to structural geology and sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic petrology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

The grant funding was used to purchase detectors for a Scanning Electron (SEM) system in the Department of Geology at Colgate University.   This facility is used by faculty and students in the departments of Geology, Physics and Astronomy, Biology and Chemistry at Colgate, and faculty and student users from nearby colleges and universities.

Rebecca Metzler, of the Colgate Department of Physics and Astronomy has used the new EBSD system to examine barnacle shell microstructure. Barnacles are arthropods dating back ~400 million years. Her undergraduate research students have begun to explore the micro-structure of both fossilized and modern barnacle exoskeletons, allowing for an exploration into the structure changes that have occurred over time.   "By combining EBSD with synchrotron techniques (XANES and X-PEEM) andmicro-hardness testing, we have been able to explore the structure, composition, and materials properties of barnacle cement at an unprecedented scale, allowing us to identify two distinct regions within the cement."  Co-PI Martin Wong has integrated the EBSD into his undergraduate structural geology course through the use of a lab where students analyze shear zone rocks petrographically and then collect EBSD data on those same samples as a way to learn about slip systems and ductile deformation mechanisms.
