<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Arctic regions have become increasingly important to circumpolar nations because of vast resources of rare metals, nickel and copper, and especially oil and gas.  The Russian Federation possesses over half of the worldÃ†s Arctic landmass and has embarked on a state-sponsored program to develop them rapidly.  One of the areas of scientific and technical activity for oil, gas and other programs is the tundra of the Nenets Autonomous Region (NAO) in northwest Russia.  In June 2010, as part of NSF project 1042527 to consider "Arctic Perspectives" in the 21st century, the Principal Investigator invited several young scholars to Naryan Mar, capital of the NAO, to a meeting cosponsored by the administration of the NAO, to discuss issues of resource development, environment, and scientific research.  One of those scholars, a physics major with fluent Russian at Colby College, Waterville, Maine, coordinated the project for the PI, and has gone on to graduate school in Russian and non-proliferation studies.  The conference involved a presentations of a series of papers by young scholars from the US, Canada, Europe and Russia who were involved in social scientific and scientific studies of arctic regions.  They covered different time periods and different circumpolar regions, and they addressed a series of questions about the human and environmental costs of arctic development.  They took part in a series of field research trips as well into the tundra, to an island in the Arctic Ocean (Kolguev Island) and to a Russian meteorological station on the shore of the Arctic Ocean.  The project coordinator translated, organized activities, and contributed substantively to the project.             Last Modified: 11/07/2011       Submitted by: Paul R Josephson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
