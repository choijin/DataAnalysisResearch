<AbstractNarration>Several large groups of plant-feeding insects such as aphids (&gt;3000 species) and whiteflies (&gt;1500 species) are specialized feeders on phloem sap. Nutrients are transported throughout the plant in phloem sap, and because of its critical importance, plants protect themselves from loss of sap by redundant systems that seal off damaged sieve elements (the specific phloem cells that transport the sap). In order to successfully feed on phloem sap, these insects must circumvent these sealing mechanisms. This project's goal is to determine how they accomplish this. Phloem responses to insect feeding will be observed by various microscopy techniques. The effect of the phloem response on the insect and the insect's counter-responses will be monitored by an electrophysiological technique, somewhat similar to an EKG, that reveals in real time what plant tissues and cells the insects have penetrated with their mouthparts and their behaviors (such as salivation, ingestion, mouthpart movement) within those tissues and cells. The responses and counter-responses and their effects on both the insects and plants will be determined during normal (natural) feeding and in experiments where the phloem sealing mechanism will be manipulated. The goal of the project is to determine mechanistically how insects circumvent the phloem sealing response.  These results will be important not only for understanding the co-evolution between plants and these highly successful specialized herbivores, but also because these insects include some of the world's worst agricultural pests. The results might thus be valuable for revealing mechanisms that could be exploited for developing crop resistance to these pests.  This project also will provide a research experience for a postdoctoral student in this field which bridges the gap between plant physiology and entomology.  Results also will be incorporated into coursework in the PI's department.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nutrient-rich sap is transported in plants in phloem tissue through a system of tubes, called sieve tubes.  Phloem sieve tubes are formed by specialized elongate cells, called sieve elements, that are arranged end-to-end.  The term "sieve" refers to the large pores at the ends of sieve elements that allow sap to flow from one sieve element to the next.  Many groups of insects, including over 3,000 species of aphids and over 2,000 species of whiteflies are specialized phloem sap-feeders and have evolved to exploit phloem sap as their main source of nourishment.  Phloem sap-feeding insects are among the world's worst agricultural pests and are the vectors of the majority of plant pathogens that cause major crop diseases.  Phloem is analogous to our circulatory system, and just as we have clotting mechanisms to prevent loss of blood when our circulatory system is damaged, plants have mechanisms, referred to as phloem occlusion, that prevent loss of sap when the sieve elements are damaged.  Aphids and whiteflies feed by penetrating their long, thin, flexible, hypodermic needle-like mouthparts, called stylets, through plant tissue, and eventually the stylets penetrate a phloem sieve element and the insect then commences ingesting phloem sap.  In order to successfully feed, aphids and whiteflies have to be able to prevent or reverse phloem occlusion because if sieve elements get plugged, these insects will be cut off from their supply of sap.  This project focuses on the role of P-proteins, one of the two mechanisms of phloem occlusion, and the interactions between P-proteins and phloem sap-feeding insects, specifically aphids and whiteflies.  P-proteins occur in sieve elements and normally are in a physical state that does not interfere with the flow of sap.  However, in response to damage, they instantly (&lt; 1 sec) change their physical conformation into one that plugs the sieve element and stops the flow of sap.     It has been hypothesized for over two decades that P-proteins can function as a mechanism of resistance against phloem sap-feeding insects, but the hypothesis had never been tested experimentally in a large part due to insufficient methodology.  This project developed the necessary methodology to test this hypothesis and demonstrated for the first time that P-protein occlusion can provide an effective defense against aphids, but that depends on the specific aphid plant combination.  In a model system using faba bean, an aphid that specializes on faba bean penetrates a phloem sieve element with its stylets, salivates for about 30-60 second and then ingests phloem sap for hours.  Penetration of the sieve element does not trigger phloem occlusion.  In contrast, when a generalist aphid (one that feeds on many plant species) penetrates a faba bean sieve element, P-proteins occlude the sieve element and the aphid salivates for an extended period of time and usually then withdraws its stylets without having ingested any sap.  P-protein occlusion is triggered by an influx of calcium ions into the sieve element and when we treat phloem with a calcium channel blocker that prevents this influx, penetration of a sieve element by the generalist aphids does not trigger P-protein occlusion and the aphid is able to ingest phloem sap for hours.  This demonstrates 1) P-protein occlusion is what inhibits sap ingestion by the generalist aphids and 2) the differential response of P-proteins to the specialist and generalist aphids is not due to the P-proteins themselves but rather due to the differential response of the calcium channels to the two aphids.  The project then examined another aphid-plant system, and demonstrated that in an aphid-resistant melon cultivar, the mechanism of resistance also was P-protein occlusion.     A well publicized 2007 study reported that aphid saliva can reverse P-protein plugs and concluded that aphid salivation into sieve elements functions to reverse phloem occlusion.  This conclusion was widely acce...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
