<AbstractNarration>Extracellular recognition by plants of potential bacterial pathogens initiates rapid changes in plant responses that ultimately lead to restriction of bacterial growth and prevention of disease symptoms. Achievement of the desired outcome of host resistance, however, is a finely balanced process. If the initial host response is not sufficiently rapid or robust, the pathogen overwhelms the host before effective resistance can be achieved. If the response is too strong or lasts for too long, the stress can result in severe fitness penalties (e.g. dwarfing and/or loss of yield) or even cell death. At present, relatively little about is understood about how the initial responses are correctly regulated and integrated to promote resistance. MAP Kinase Phosphatase 1 (MKP1) has been identified as a negative regulator of both the initial phases of host responses and of resistance against pathogenic bacteria. However, unlike most plants with enhanced resistance, the mkp1 mutation prevents bacterial pathogen growth without apparent detrimental effects on the plant's fitness. Therefore, understanding the role and regulation of MKP1 in plant innate immunity will illuminate possible strategies for enhancing resistance against bacteria in crop plants without the fitness penalties normally associated with constitutively enhanced resistance.  Genetic, biochemical, and molecular approaches will be used to begin to define the basis for the enhanced resistance in the mkp1 mutant as well as to understand how MKP1 is normally regulated during pathogen infection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide advanced training for both a postdoctoral researcher and graduate student as well as for an undergraduate EXPRESS (Exposure to Research for Science Students) student already working in the laboratory, thus providing support for students from a minority group normally underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Moreover, the discovery of specific chemical signals provides the basis for developing new antimicrobial compounds as it would be hypothetically possible to interfere with the bacteriaÆs ability to perceive these chemicals, thus preventing from transitioning into its pathogenic state.  Contributing to Technical Training of Future US Scientific Workforce: This project required the integration of a broad spectrum of technical approaches including genetics, molecular biology, large scale metabolomics, pathogen assays, protein analyses, and antibody immunoassays. Future scientists need this type of interdisciplinary training to address important biological questions; and this project successfully trained two postdoctoral researchers, two graduate students, and two undergraduate researchers.
