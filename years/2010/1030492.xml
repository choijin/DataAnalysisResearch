<AbstractNarration>This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) grant provides funding for the development of a fundamental understanding of the mechanical, thermo-mechanical and electro-mechanical behavior of thermal spray fabricated structures rationalized through analysis of natural counterparts. Thermal spray materials, which are layered structures comprised of micron-thick 'bricks' and nanoscale interfaces, have been shown to display similar mechanical properties as nacre (mother of pearl), including non&amp;#8208;linear elasticity, anelasticity and enhanced toughening. Noteworthy is the discovery that these biomimetic properties are tunable via process and material manipulation, opening up opportunities for microstructural design of industrially relevant coating systems. Through process engineering of interfacial structures, relationships between microstructure and elastic properties will be determined. By coupling thermal and mechanical testing with modeling, microstructural analysis and process science, while considering natural structural principles, a fundamental understanding of how the unique thermal spray material structure influences elastic properties and toughness will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extraordinary flexibility of thermal spray with respect to materials and scalability enables its consideration as a tool for large scale synthesis of biomimetic structures. Thus, this research will enable a symbiosis between the remarkable attributes of natural systems and the desire to optimize functionality and damage tolerance of industrially important materials and coatings. The research will identify phenomena having an impact on the performance and design of essential classes of engineered materials. Appreciation of the fundamentals will provide enhanced confidence, increased applicability and accelerated insertion of new concepts in the thermal spray industry. Our innovative, industrially linked higher education and K-12 outreach efforts will provide: (a) Interactions between students and their industrial collaborators, (b) Opportunities to communicate results and receive feedback from industry, (c) Industrial internships priming students for a long-term commitment to materials science and thermal spray technologies, and (d) Inspiration for K-12 students and teachers through summer programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF sponsored multi-investigator academic-industry partnership assembled under the framework of the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) program, sought to introduce nature inspired hybrid material design concepts for optimization of industrially relevant protective and engineered functional coatings.  Natural systems, for example the nacreous layer within the abalone shell, has long been considered as a benchmark material that combines disparate attributes of strength and toughness not readily achievable in traditional synthetic materials.  The NSF project modified and enhanced a widely accepted industrial material deposition process: thermal spray, to engender the unique brick-and-mortar structure that is known to impart the novel properties in nature. Early in the program, it was realized that although thermal sprayed structures are generally considered layered structures, their organization is not optimal to satisfy the stringent requirements of the brick and mortar structure.  Furthermore, nacre incorporates polymeric mortar between the inorganic bricks.  As such the project focused on methodologies to optimize the brick-layer organization via thermal spray, coupling with infiltration schemes to introduce appropriate polymers into the loose inorganic assembly (template).      The outcome of the effort were significant.  Through innovative modifications to existing thermal spray processes templates with adequate organization similar to those seen in nature were fabricated and characterized.  Subsequently, a varierty of infiltration schemes for polymers were developed ranging from polymers dissolved in solvents, to two-part epoxies and insitu polymerization within the templates.  Persistent optimization efforts based on fundamental understanding of the process finally resulted in dramatic improvements in properties of the thermal sprayed hybrid composites with simultaneous improvements in both flexural strength and initiation fracture toughness amounting to over 600% improvement in both properties.  Careful analysis of the failure mechanisms indicated the beneficial attributes of the brick-and-mortar structure confirming the natural design principles in achieving dual capabilities in strength and toughness. Initial modeling efforts considering cohesive element concepts bridging the templates captured some of the experimental observations although further refinement is necessary.     The intellectual merit of the project were two fold:  (a) The experimental work using synthetic analogues of nacre validated some of the non-linear elastic attributes and damage tolerant characteristics of these topologically complex composite materials systems (b) the resultant nature inspired synthetic materials provided a framework for understanding industrially relevant materials systems.   The broader benefits resulting from the scientific enquiry are also significant. Thermal spray coatings are widely used in various industrial sectors from aerospace to biomedical implants.  The research has provided a framework to significantly enhance the damage tolerance of this important class of industrial materials coatings to enhance their resiliency and reliability.  It also provided industry with new design tools in engineering future materials and coatings.  The educational benefits are also significant, particularly resulting from the strong partnership between the NSF project and the Industrial Consortium for Thermal Spray Technology program directed by the principle investigator and collaborators. Graduate and undergraduate students engaged in the NSF project had the opportunity to share their findings every six months with the industrial membership during the consortium meeting resulting in an effective two-way educational platform. Several undergraduate students and even K-12 field trips facilitated a broader outreach of the scientific and technological developments.
