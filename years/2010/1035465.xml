<AbstractNarration>Four cohorts each consisting of four undergraduate STEM majors are being offered annual scholarships of $12,000 for up to three years to complete the STEM baccalaureate degree and receive secondary teacher certification.  Five cohorts of three individuals already possessing a STEM degree are receiving one year scholarships of $10,000 each to gain teaching certification via the Alternate Licensure program.  Over the five year project period a total of 77 one year scholarships are being awarded to 31 individuals.  Each year five summer internships are available to lower division undergraduates to actively participate in the organization, planning and implementation of informal science outreach activities with the aim of attracting these students into a teaching career.&lt;br/&gt;Currently the institution produces about 8 science teachers a year through the regular teacher education program and about 4 science teachers a year through the alternative licensure program. This project is having a broad impact on the number of science teachers produced who are able to teach primarily in the rural areas of New Mexico. These teachers provide high quality science education to at least 500 students annually and infuse the cadre of STEM teachers with highly trained individuals grounded in both content and pedagogical knowledge who provide junior high and high school students the opportunity to participate in inquiry-based, experiential learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of the Northern New Mexico College (NNMC) Noyce grant are to:  Recruit undergraduate junior and senior STEM majors into the Noyce program. Recruit graduates of bachelor STEM degrees into the Noyce program. Enroll Noyce students in the Alternative Licensure Program (ALP) to earn their Alternative License in Secondary Education in New Mexico. Require Noyce students to teach two years in a high-risk school district for every year of support. Provide professional development activities for Noyce students (seminars and conferences).   We received two no-cost extensions for our Noyce grant, so the grant has been active at NNMC for 7 years since October 2010.  During that time, we recruited 24 students into the Noyce program.  Of the 24 students, 4 students were STEM undergraduates and 20 were STEM graduates.   Noyce students have taught in eight high-risk school districts (Santa Fe, Penasco, Chama, Espanola, Questa, Pojoaque, Taos, and Santa Fe) and in twelve schools (Santa Fe High School, Penasco Middle and High School, Escalante High School, Aspen Magnet Community School, McCurdy Middle and High School, Questa High School, Espanola High School, Pojoaque Middle and High School, Taos Middle School, Taos Academy Charter School, Eagle Nest Middle School, and Carlos Vigil Middle School).   The NNMC Noyce program was evaluated every year since 2010 by our external evaluator, Dr. Tin-Yau Tam from Auburn University.  The external evaluation reports have been uploaded into the Research.gov Noyce reporting site or sent to the NSF Noyce Program manager.   Noyce seminars (usually 3-4 every semester) have been offered every year to Noyce students since 2010.  Speakers are often invited to speak at the Noyce seminars about teaching and STEM education.  Four Noyce students attended the annual Noyce Summit national conference over the seven years of the grant.  A Noyce PI or Co-PI attended and presented a poster at the Noyce Summit every year it was held since 2010 (in 2015 a conference was not organized).  Two oral presentations were also given at the Noyce Summit by PI David Torres, and Noyce student, Camille Ulibarri presented on the panel "Voices from the Field" in 2016.  One Noyce student and one Noyce Co-PI attended the Western Regional Noyce Conference.  Noyce students were also given the opportunity to attend other professional development activities.  Two Noyce students attended the Google Computational Thinking Workshop in 2012, three students attended the Supercomputing Challenge Summer Teacher Institute at New Mexico Tech in July 2013, and one student attended the Math Circles Workshop in July 2016.   Our greatest challenge in the grant was recruitment.  We budgeted for seven Noyce students each year in our initial proposal, but were not able to meet that quota.  A factor that has influenced our effectiveness in recruiting is the low teacher salaries in New Mexico.  Many districts start new teachers at or slightly above a salary of $32,000.  We are also finding that some students are not meeting their teaching commitment, and are initiating repayment plans for them.  The broader impacts of the grant are:  1) the recruitment of STEM graduates to become secondary teachers in many high-risk districts in Northern New Mexico and 2) the level of expertise in their field they will use in creating lesson plans and teaching.
