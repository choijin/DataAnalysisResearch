<AbstractNarration>This award is to support the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program in the Physics Department at the University of Washington. The program offers a broad selection of student projects from many sub-fields of physics, for ten weeks of summer research. It makes use of the University of Washington's strong in-house "table-top" experimental programs; its outstanding machine-shop facilities including a first-rate student shop; CENPA, a DOE center-of-excellence in nuclear physics and astrophysics; and theory opportunities ranging from the Institute for Nuclear Theory to a twenty-teraflop local cluster. Each student participant will be partnered with a UW faculty advisor. Most Physics faculty members participate as advisors, as do selected faculty from affiliated departments. Student work includes: design, construction, and commissioning of instrumentation; data collection and analysis; numerical modeling; the development of software for such modeling; and theory. A variety of social activities that allow students to see the Seattle area and to interact with other students are also planned.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The education of young scientists is of paramount importance to the  continuing success of science in the United States. The main goal of  the Physics REU program at the University of Washington is to provide an  exciting and nurturing research experience for the students, one that  will encourage them to pursue careers as research scientists.  The  program aims to accomplish this by offering a wide variety of research  projects and the opportunity to use first-rate research facilities while  also providing a strong support network.  Additionally, while selection  is competitive, the program strives to build a group of students that  is diverse.  We received more than 300 applications for the 6 positions in the summer 2011 class and nearly 400 applications for the 8 positions in the summer 2012 class.  Each student participant was partnered with a UW faculty advisor and their research group. Student research work included design, construction, and commissioning of instrumentation; data collection and analysis; numerical modeling; the development of software for such modeling; and theory.  All students proved capable of doing quality independent research.  The  concluding presentations -- written and oral reports on the results of  10 weeks of research -- were of very high quality.  These are documented  on the program's website at http://www.int.washington.edu/REU/.          Last Modified: 06/28/2013       Submitted by: Subhadeep Gupta]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
