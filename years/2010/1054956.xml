<AbstractNarration>Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, but controls on its past and future concentration in the atmosphere remain highly uncertain.  The consumption of methane by a specific group of soil bacteria (methanotrophs) is a key part of the global methane budget, with temperate grasslands contributing an important fraction.  Although current models for atmospheric methane treat this consumption as constant, there is clear evidence that its rate varies with climate, suggesting that future climate change may alter its magnitude.  The overall goal of this work is to improve understanding of methane uptake so that its response to climate change can be better predicted.  Efforts to achieve this overall goal are broken down into 3 objectives.  First, the investigators will collect field data on methane uptake and its controls from study sites that cover the climatic diversity of the North American Great Plains grasslands.  Second, the investigators will quantify the controls on methane uptake with laboratory assays on soils from these sites.  Much of the climate sensitivity of methane uptake hinges on the way that the methanotrophic bacteria respond to variation in soil temperature and moisture, and there is evidence that this environmental sensitivity differs from one methanotroph species to another.  Thus, this second objective requires measuring how the environmental sensitivity of methanotrophs varies among study sites where different methanotroph species are present.  Finally, the investigators will statistically evaluate their field and laboratory findings and use them to develop a new type of predictive model for methane uptake that incorporates the importance of methanotroph species differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will address a fundamental question about the importance of bacterial diversity in affecting the way that ecosystems work.  It is well recognized that, for example, cactus, pine trees and grasses respond differently to drought stress, but the responses of different bacterial species to environmental change are poorly understood.  Thus, even though a number of studies have now documented that soil bacterial species vary from place to place, it remains difficult to predict how these changes in diversity affect the way that ecosystems function.  This project also will contribute to workforce development by training and employing post-doctoral students, a graduate student and more than 10 undergraduate students.  The research will not only engage students from undergraduate institutions (Augustana College, SD) and R-1 research universities (Colorado State, University of Nebraska), but will enhance networking between faculty at these institutions, and will include recruitment of Hispanic-American undergraduate students from CSU-Pueblo to participate in summer research activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The main effort of our project was to understand the physical and microbiological controls over methane consumption by bacteria in grassland soils.  This process reduces concentrations of the greenhouse gas methane in the atmosphere.  Our research generated a unique database on methane consumption and the related patterns in bacterial diversity and physiology that can serve as a resource for future research.  We have already made a number of key findings using this database including: 1) identifying when physical vs. biological factors were most important for regulating methane consumption rates, 2) characterizing how different groups of methane consuming bacteria respond to their environment, 3) documenting the factors that determine which species of methane consuming bacteria are found where ("biogeography"), 4) understanding how the "lumpiness" of the soil environment alters the way that bacteria work and 5) finding better ways to describe the impact of temperature on the function of microbes and their enzymes.  We have used these findings to modify and/or create mathematical models that can be used to predict the response of ecosystems to future global changes.  We are making this database publicly available so other researchers can learn from it as well.     Broader Impacts  We have also  broadly impacted science and society through activities funded under this grant.  Most importantly, this work allowed us to train undergraduate and graduate students in the process of scientific research.  We successfully targeted women and minority (Native American) students for this experience.  Many of our alumni used this experience as a springboard for further training in science and medicine.  We trained two post doctoral scholars who have since taken positions at other prestegious institutions in the USA.    We used our research findings as a catalyst in a special session of the American Geophysical Union where we brought together sciences from the US, Europe and Australia to identify areas of needed future research.  Technologically, people in our labs developed some new techniques that can be used for future incubations of soils for trace gas analysis.  These new "soft sided" techniques permit automated resampling of soils over time without recirculating air and causing complicated patterns in contamination between incubations.  Finally, our work aids policymakers by generating improved prediction of future greenhouse gas concentrations.
