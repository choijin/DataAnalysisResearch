<AbstractNarration>Professor Michelle M. Bushey of Trinity University is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct a fundamental study of the interactions of analytes and the mobile phase with organic polymer monolith stationary phases in HPLC and capillary electrochromatography (CEC).  The objective is to derive a basic understanding of the separation mechanisms with organic polymer monolith stationary phases.  Thermodynamic properties and diffusion coefficients will be measured as a function of retention factor for different analytes, different mobile phases and different acrylate and methacrylate monolithic polymers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A thorough understanding of these interactions will impact the development of efficient stationary phases for practical chromatographic separations.  Modeling of chromatographic separations with conventional stationary phases has resulted in great improvement in separation performance. The lack of a parallel basic understanding of chromatography with polymer monolith stationary phases hampered the development and limited the broad acceptance of these unique analytical separation media.  Undergraduate students will be trained in analytical separation science and technology in an ethnically diverse undergraduate institution.</AbstractNarration>
