<AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor Thomas Gray at Case Western Reserve University to carry out fundamental studies in organometallic gold chemistry.  (Ligand)gold(I) fragments bind to carbon in place of terminal hydrogens.  Gold is grafted to organic scaffolds at controlled positions.  Sensitive functional groups survive, and harsh reagents are avoided.   The gold atom promotes population of triplet excited states upon light-excitation. These triplet states persist for microseconds or longer.  Ultrafast kinetics studies of gold(I) organometallics are revealing the absorption and decay characteristics of (phosphine)gold(I) aromatics.  A number of conjugated chromophores, with gold at the edges, are being prepared.  The structural and optical properties of these compounds are being measured.  Absorption and emission spectra, and state-to-state dynamics, are understood with time-dependent density-functional theory calculations.  The Gray group is also developing synthetic methods that form stable carbon-gold bonds.  These reactions form isolable, readily characterized, and easily handled organometallics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has relevance to such applications as catalysis, light-emitting diode construction, and film deposition, among others.  The work will also contribute to an undergraduate laboratory in organometallic synthesis and in photophysical characterization.  This activity applies gold click-chemistry, a copper-mediated cycloaddition of gold(I) alkynyls with organic azides.  The resulting triazolate complexes are characterized by static and time-resolved emission spectroscopy.  The supported research is training undergraduate and graduate students for scientific careers in industry, government, the military, and academia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Gold metal resists corrosion, and so the element is wrongly held to be "noble," or unreactive.  Happily, this is not the end of the story. Molecular gold complexes are easily made, and gold chemistry is varied and extensive.    Gold compounds are useful in fine chemicals synthesis, as luminescent ("glow-in-the-dark") materials, and as drugs for rheumatoid arthritis.  Applications have also been reported in electronics and energy storage.  Gold is the relativistic element.  Its innermost electrons move at vast speeds, and EinsteinÆs theory of relativity is needed for a full accounting of goldÆs properties.  The result is that gold compounds intrigue and surprise.  Intellectual Merit.  The chemistry of gold is growing rapidly.  Many of the most important gold-based molecules are organometallic: they contain direct bonds between gold and carbon atoms.  With NSF support, the Gray research group is pioneering the chemistry of gold-carbon bond formation.  Important too is careful characterization of the organogold compounds that ensue.   For gold chemistry to reach its full potential, gold must be chemically attachable to carbon.  With NSF support, the Gray laboratory has developed transmetalation reactions where gold expels boron and binds to carbon in its place.  Reactions have also been discovered that join gold to organic alkynes and azides.  This general reaction is called "gold click chemistry."  Many of the resulting complexes glow under ultraviolet light.  All new organogold compounds have potential utility as catalysts for fine chemicals synthesis.  Broader Impacts.  Gold is too valuable to be hoarded in vaults.  Compounds of gold are important to chemical synthesis, catalysis, energy storage, electronics, and drug design.  For many applications gold must bind to lighter elements, especially carbon.  The gold-carbon bond forming chemistry developed by the Gray group is reliable and selective.  Hazardous chemicals and environmental toxins are minimized.  Gold is now available for a range of applications that rely on the compounds of carbon.  This project supports the professional formation of dedicated and talented students.  Gray presents frequently at universities and regional and national meetings to raise awareness of gold chemistry and its benefits to society.
