<AbstractNarration>The award will support an international workshop on the mathematics at the&lt;br/&gt;intersection of convex geometry, topology, and combinatorics, or convex&lt;br/&gt;topological combinatorics, for short. This is an important topic because&lt;br/&gt;convex geometric and topological techniques have become a main tool in&lt;br/&gt;discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. In fact, convex&lt;br/&gt;topological combinatorics has had a impact in application areas such as&lt;br/&gt;algorithm design, computer graphics, mathematical programming, solid&lt;br/&gt;modeling, and computational biology. At the same time, topology and&lt;br/&gt;geometry have benefited from the study of combinatorial structures such as&lt;br/&gt;convex bodies, polyhedra, simplicial complexes, geometric graphs, etc.,&lt;br/&gt;because they appear naturally in relation to important algebraic and&lt;br/&gt;topological spaces such as Grassmanians, toric varieties, configuration&lt;br/&gt;spaces, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will be the first large international conference in&lt;br/&gt;North-America on the topic of convex topological combinatorics. The event&lt;br/&gt;intends to bring together top international researchers to discuss&lt;br/&gt;developments in these intersecting fields. Besides specific mathematical&lt;br/&gt;research, the meeting will increase the cooperation between mathematical&lt;br/&gt;schools in the USA and Mexico, both of which have many strong researchers&lt;br/&gt;in convex topological combinatorics and a good number of Ph.D students&lt;br/&gt;doing research in these topics. Both groups will benefit from the&lt;br/&gt;interaction that the conference will bring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This was an international scientific meeting in the intersection of Convexity, Combinatorics, and Topology. These three mathematical areas, which can be roughly described as the study of geometric structures with finitely many buidling blocks, have many  applications, for example one  speaker described how to design flexible robot arms and how to calculate  the maximum possible reach of it. Another speaker discussed the use of these tools to understand DNA. Multiple cellular  processes such as replication recombination and packing change the topology  of DNA. Controlling these changes is a key to  ensuring stability inside the cell (e.g., healthy cell division). The cell uses enzymes to simplify DNA topology.    This scientific event received partial support from NSF, but was mostly funded by    CONACYT, the Mexican Mathematical Society and the National University of  Mexico (UNAM).  One of the key results of the meeting was to strengthen the  relations between the communities of mathematicians working in these topics  in the USA and Mexico. For some years now, american and  mexican  mathematicians have been working on closely related projects, but have  not been united in one coherent group ready for collaboration. The  meeting  had a very powerful positive impact on the development of  these investigations and human resources training for the two communities involved.   The relationship of the USA to Mexico is important at all levels (as neighboring  countries), but the scientific and educational connections can help in several ways. Already young USA Ph.Ds are finding jobs in mexican Universities and several mexican students have gone to study in the USA. We hope a more solid relation with Mexico will also help with recruitment of more latino USA  minorities in the mathematical sciences when students here see there also  large numbers of latinos involved in science elsewhere.    We had a total of 33 presentations, a poster session. Speakers came not only from the USA and Mexico, but also Canada, Russia, France, Germany, Hungary, and Spain. A good example of international cooperation.              Last Modified: 03/28/2012       Submitted by: Jesus A De Loera]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
