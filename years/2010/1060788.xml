<AbstractNarration>The type of precipitation to reach the earth's surface is highly dependent on the lower tropospheric temperature profile.  Strong and persistent temperature inversions, a unique vertical profile over the Arctic during the cold season, pose unique challenges to the determination of precipitation type.  In other regions, surface air temperature can be used as a predictor of this condition, but this measurement cannot be used in high-latitude locales.  This collaborative research project will address some critical issues associated with precipitation type in order to better understand the spatial and temporal patterns of changes in the frequency of different precipitation types associated with increasing air temperatures over pan-Arctic land areas.  The investigators will identify the atmospheric and other environmental conditions associated with each precipitation type specifically for high-latitude regions.  They will use historical station records across Arctic land regions to compile the frequencies of each precipitation characteristic using various statistical analyses and mapping tools.  They will analyze these data in order to enhance the capabilities for climate and hydrological model simulations of snow conditions to assess potential changes in the hydrological cycle and energy budgets.  The investigators also plan to examine how much variability in precipitation type is related to short-term fluctuations in major atmospheric circulation patterns as opposed to background long-term warming trends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project results are expected to enhance basic knowledge regarding how precipitation characteristics change in response to changing atmospheric conditions.  The project should contribute to enhancement of fundamental theory regarding the determination of precipitation types based on atmospheric and environmental conditions unique to the Arctic region.  Because climate change has been most evident over the Arctic due to the high sensitivity of snow and ice to the energy budget, the project should provide valuable information that is especially critical to interdisciplinary research on the Arctic ecosystem, species dynamics, and human-nature interactions.  The project also will aid in efforts to determine the possible future nature of climatic change in the Arctic and to assess the viability of different strategies for adapting to changing conditions.  This project is jointly supported by the Geography and Spatial Sciences Program, the Arctic System Science Program, and the Climate and Large-Scale Dynamics Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has made significant contributions to:  1. Understanding the atmospheric and other environmental conditions associated with each precipitation type specifically for high-latitude regions.  This provides an important foundation for climate/hydrological models to better the partition of solid versus liquid. This will greatly improve simulations of snow conditions and thus increase our understanding of potential changes in the hydrological cycle and energy budgets.  Critical temperature is the surface air temperature at which snow transitions to rain.  We found that the critical temperature varies significantly across the Arctic region.  It seems to be dependent on local climate, elevation, relative humidity, and seasons.   We have identified critical values of surface air temperature and dew point temperature for each of the 547 station in spring and fall (see Figure1).  Using a combination of primary air temperature and dew point and two secondary air temperatures and dew points at each station, we have developed an algorithm to separate solid from liquid precipitation at 547 locations in northern Eurasia. (Ye et al. 2013).  We also verified that snowfall season length has been decreasing due to warming climate (Ye and Cohen 2013).   2. The phenomenon of rain-on-snow (ROS) events and their link to warming climate and atmospheric circulation.  Rain-on-snow is a hazardous condition for wild animals and is not well understood by the scientific community.  Our results contribute to a better scientific understanding of the climatology, variability and changes of ROS events. We compiled climatology data and analyzed ROS events using two reanalysis products.   ROS events are a relatively rare phenomenon outside of a few regional maxima including western Eurasia, the higher elevations of western North America, the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. ROS events occur at high latitudes, especially far from the continental interior and no robust trends were found in the frequency of ROS events (Figure 2).  We also explored the variability of ROS events with dominant large climate modes.  The most robust relationship was found with the Arctic Oscillation or North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO).  The most notable variability associated with the AO/NAO was a northeast/southwest dipole feature across western Eurasia. (Cohen et al 2015).  3. The role of relative humidity on precipitation efficiency and intensity. Relatively humidity was considered fairly constant and that it changes very little over a larger area.  But by using combinations of historical station records and remote sensing water vapor product we found that small changes in relative humidity have a significant influence on precipitation frequency at a local level.  We found that relative humidity and changes in relative humidity due to temperature changes play an important role in precipitation frequency at a local level (Ye et al. 2014).  4. We found that levels of precipitable water has a robust relationship with precipitation in winter but not summer.  In winter, warming temperatures resulted in higher precipitable water levels and therefore increased precipitation.  However, in summer relative humidity strongly controls precipitation so that even when the level of precipitable water is increasing with increasing temperatures, relative humidity is decreasing (Figure 3).  Higher levels of precipitable water do not necessarily result in higher precipitation efficiency during both winter and summer. (Ye et al. 2014).  5. Changes in precipitation intensity and its connections to warming climate. It was assumed that a warming climate would lead to higher precipitation intensity due to increasing atmospheric water holding capacity.  We verified this hypothesis by examining relationships between precipitation intensity and air temperature at different time scales of seasonal, interannual, and decadal at station and regional levels.  In addition, we attri...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
