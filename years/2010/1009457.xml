<AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of all the recently completed Supernova Type Ia (SN Ia) surveys and derive robust cosmological constraints from them.  The investigators will collaborate with theorists developing state-of-the-art 3-d simulations of SN Ia explosions to test the models against observational data, with the long-term goal of developing theoretically-informed SN distance estimates. In addition, the project will optimize the design of and develop new analysis tools for future large SN surveys, in particular developing methods for SN cosmology analysis without spectroscopic identification or redshifts. All these tools will be part of a flexible, public software package, SNANA, that the proposers have and will continue to develop and share with the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, incorporating supernova data into Google Sky, release of software for use by the community, and development of undergraduate astronomy labs.</AbstractNarration>
