<AbstractNarration>Salicylic acid (SA) plays an important role in plants responding to invasion by microbial pathogens. The recently identified SA-binding protein 2 (SABP2) plays a critical role in SA-mediated disease resistance signaling. SABP2 catalyzes the conversion of inactive methyl salicylate into salicylic acid, which is essential for activation of disease resistance response. Effects of high levels of SA may range from mild growth defects to cell death. Tight control over cellular levels of SA may be achieved through modulating SABP2 activity. Identification and characterization of proteins which may regulate SABP2's activity may provide insights in this area. In this project, yeast two-hybrid screen and biochemical protein-protein pull down techniques will be employed to identify SABP2-interacting partners from healthy plants and plants resisting pathogen attack. The role of putative SABP2-interacting proteins in disease resistance signaling will be determined though the use of genetics and biochemical techniques. SABP2 activity may also be regulated through changes in its subcellular localization in response to stress. Cellular location of SABP2 in plant cell will be determined using a combination of cellular fractionation, immunological and biochemical techniques.  The role of SABP2 beyond R gene mediated disease resistance will be explored. The overall aim of this project is to better understand the salicylic acid mediated disease resistance pathway in plants. Results from this project may help develop disease resistant crop, plants reducing our dependence on use of harmful pesticides in agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will benefit undergraduate and MS students who will receive training in plant biochemistry and molecular biology. The majority of students attending East Tennessee State University are from economically disadvantaged families. A number of these students are either underrepresented or first time college attendees. The majority of these students are female students. This project will provide students with a unique opportunity to learn and conduct research. Students will be encouraged to think and design their own experiments. To enhance their understanding of research, weekly meetings will be held. Some of the research methods developed during this project will be incorporated into an undergraduate laboratory course. The PI is committed and will continue to recruit students through the McNair program. Students will be encouraged to participate in regional and national meetings and weekly departmental seminars. In addition, the PI participates in "Talent in Quantitative Biology", an NSF-STEP program at ETSU through which freshman undergraduate students get the opportunity to conduct research.</AbstractNarration>
