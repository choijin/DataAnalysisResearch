<AbstractNarration>This project forms an interdisciplinary research team with integrated &lt;br/&gt;expertise of computer scientists and biomedical scientists to tackle&lt;br/&gt;the challenging issues in analyzing protein interaction data. Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;the project develops a novel approach to detecting overlapping clusters on&lt;br/&gt;emerging large volume of protein-protein interaction data and validates&lt;br/&gt;the computational approaches in yeast. The vast amount of protein-protein&lt;br/&gt;interaction data provides us with a good opportunity to systematically&lt;br/&gt;analyze the structure of a large living system and also allows us to&lt;br/&gt;understand essential principles like essentiality, genetic interactions,&lt;br/&gt;functions, functional modules, protein complexes, and cellular pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The identification of functional modules in protein interaction networks is&lt;br/&gt;of great interest because they often reveal unknown functional ties between&lt;br/&gt;proteins and hence predict functions for unknown proteins. A protein may&lt;br/&gt;be included in one or more functional groups. Therefore, overlapping clusters&lt;br/&gt;need to be identified in protein interaction data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a &lt;br/&gt;unique method to integrate domain knowledge with the protein interaction&lt;br/&gt;data so that the data will be more reliable. It also develops&lt;br/&gt;a unique method to support overlapping modularity analysis for&lt;br/&gt;protein interaction data that intelligently integrates biological&lt;br/&gt;information into the modularity analysis process. Another unique&lt;br/&gt;aspect of this project is the tight integration of computational methods &lt;br/&gt;with biological verification. By associating unknown proteins with the &lt;br/&gt;known proteins within each functional module, we can suggest that &lt;br/&gt;those proteins positively work for the corresponding functions that &lt;br/&gt;are assigned to the modules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project can also find broad applications in other areas which &lt;br/&gt;handle data with the modular network property, such as web network, &lt;br/&gt;social networks, and technological networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/DBGROUP/PPI-networks/index.html</AbstractNarration>
