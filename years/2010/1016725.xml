<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry supports two unique international meetings as part of the Chemical Sciences and Society Symposia (CS3).  The CS3 convenes eminent high-level researchers from the US, UK, Japan, China and Germany to explore frontier chemistry research on Sustainable Materials (London, September 2010) and on Chemistry for a Better Environment (China, September 2011).  Representatives from each country's science and technology funding agencies also participate in the symposia.  These meetings have been developed multilaterally through discussions of the chemical societies in each participating country.  This series has the potential to be of great value to the global chemistry enterprise and to the world at large as it will foster work in trans-national teams, across scientific disciplines, and beyond institutional boundaries.  The workshop proceedings are promoted and distributed to the global science and technology community and the general public through journal articles and reports on the web, respectively.  These results and recommendations illustrate chemistry's role in solving challenges in green energy and in pursuing economically-feasible and environmentally-benign commodity chemical production.</AbstractNarration>
