<AbstractNarration>Worcester Polytechnic Institute, together with Brown University, and Northeastern University, proposes Bootstrap, a program to excite students, particularly those from under-represented groups, about computing before they make career-limiting academic choices in high school. Under-represented students frequently have little access to computing education, much less one that bridges to other courses in computing or its supporting disciplines.  Bootstrap is a computing curriculum that engages students with animation, targets core skills in algebra and coordinate geometry, and is vertically integrated from middle-school through college-level computing.  The latter two features--deep connection to mathematics and a migration path to advanced curricula--distinguish Bootstrap from other introductory computing programs aimed at pre-college students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bootstrap's algebraic connections lie in its programming model, which differs from that of other introductory programming projects.  By tying programming to algebra, Bootstrap reinforces essential material that underlies a wide array of STEM and computing careers and has the potential to integrate into a conventional middle-school curriculum. Bootstrap is currently deployed to under-represented middle-school students through partnerships with national and regional after-school organizations (such as Citizen Schools and AfterZones) with the help of volunteer teachers from companies such as Google, IBM, Thompson Financial, and Rockstar. In the last four years, over 450 students (70% minority, 70% receiving free or reduced lunch) have taken the program; after just nine class meetings, most have used algebra to create a running computer game of their own design. This proposal has three broad goals: (1) to further deploy the middle-school program, (2) to distill, deploy, and test an advanced (high-school level) course in the extra-curricular format, and (3) to develop software infrastructure needed to both sustain the program and extend its reach to programming games for cellphones. During the proposal period, Bootstrap will be offered to 700 students and the PIs will gather valuable data on how Bootstrap impacts students' academic choices and perceptions of algebra and coordinate geometry.</AbstractNarration>

Our success with both (a) math teachers able to use the curriculum and (b) with student performance gains in algebra points a way forward for Bootstrap that promises significant ntaional impact.  Concerns about equity in computing education are widespread; many projects, districts, and thought leaders are looking for ways to make computing education accessible to all students. Bootstrap can be embedded into math classes: it has been designed for this use, and our results under this project demonstrate that this model is feasible for both teachers and students.  Embedding computing in math classes provides equitable access to computing because every student takes math.  Bootstrap's design leverages the pedagogic and content expertise of math teachers, enabling them to ease into computing without initially mastering a full semester- or year-long class.  Taken together, these factors position Bootstrap as an equitable pathway to computing for schools with limited prior computing expertise.   Project funds also supported development of Bootstrap's browser-based programming environment and expansion of our curricular materials.  Our programming environment, WeScheme, works with the older browsers and slower computers that are still used in many schools.  Building this environment required solving certain subtle technical problems in programming language design; one computer science PhD student was supported on this award to solve these problems as his primary dissertation topic.  Our curricular materials come with lecture notes, teaching notes, handouts, assignments, and various supporting activities, all linked to state and national standards for math and computer science.  All of our curricular materials and software are freely available on our website.   Overall, this project supported pilot testing of Bootstrap...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
