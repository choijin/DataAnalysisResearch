<AbstractNarration>Cloud computing provides economic advantages from shared resources, but security is a major risk for remote operations and a major barrier to the approach, with challenges for both hosts and the network. NEBULA is a potential future Internet architecture providing trustworthy networking for the emerging cloud computing model of always-available network services. NEBULA addresses many network security issues, including data availability with a new core architecture (NCore) based on redundant connections to and between NEBULA core routers, accountability and trust with a new policy-driven data plane (NDP), and extensibility with a new control plane (NVENT) that supports network virtualization, enabling results from other future Internet architectures to be incorporated in NEBULA. NEBULA?s data plane uses cryptographic tokens as demonstrable proofs that a path was both authorized and followed. The NEBULA control plane provides one or more authorized paths to NEBULA edge nodes; multiple paths provide reliability and load-balancing. The NEBULA core uses redundant high-speed paths between data centers and core routers, as well as fault-tolerant router software, for always-on core networking. The NEBULA architecture removes network (in) security as a prohibitive factor that would otherwise prevent the realization of many cloud computing applications, such as electronic health records and data from medical sensors. NEBULA will produce a working system that is deployable on core routers and is viable from both an economic and a regulatory perspective.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NEBULA effort at the University of Delaware has focused on the research and development of software systems components needed to build non-stop High-Availability (HA) router platform infrastructure.  Under this project the a High Availability (HA) registration system, System IS-IS (SIS-IS), was created and the systemÃ†s performance was contrasted with alternate implementations.  Additionally, several prototypes of a HA forwarding and routing system, HARRS (Highly Available Redundant Routing System), was completed and documented along with initial performance characterizations.  While this effort's goal of creating high availability software systems has made progress exploring the primary use case of building reliable non-stop routing and forwarding systems, it has opened several new areas of investigation.  The effort's secondary goal of self-configuring and self-organizing systems has unique application to the coming ubiquitous deployment of network-connected embedded computing devices known as the Internet of Things (IoT).  Failure to incorporate and enhance these concepts into this future environment will yield complex systems incapable of being controlled or upgraded over their product lifetime and worse, lead to aging connected computers which become ever more susceptible to attack and compromise due to unpatched software flaws.  PRODUCTS  The results of this projects have been disseminated to communities of interest various academic publications, conference proceedings, and talks.  The high-availability technology and techniques for self-organization and self-configuration researched and developed under this effort were shared with both router manufacturers and potential carrier users of this technology.  Products from this grant include a book chapter, six journal, conference papers or other publications and two thesis.
