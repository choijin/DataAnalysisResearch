<AbstractNarration>Northern Arizona University and several Arizona elementary school districts (Mesa Public Schools, Cottonwood-Oak Creek School District, and Flagstaff Unified School District) are working together to build capacity and readiness to provide research based, job-embedded professional learning for elementary teachers that develops science content knowledge, as well as effective pedagogy that meaningfully integrates science with other elementary content learning. Using the MSP-Start, the partnership is building a foundation for this transformation by planning strategies for replication and evaluation of key components of the Valle Imperial Project in Science (VIPS) in El Centro California, and Florida Atlantic University's Science IDEAS. Rather than displacing science instruction to create more time for language arts, these programs purposefully and meaningfully integrate literacy instruction with inquiry-embedded science instruction; results from studies of implementation of the two programs indicate considerable achievement gains in science and writing as well as reading and mathematics. Replication of the Valle Imperial and El Centro projects in diverse schools in Arizona thus has the potential to produce evidence that the strategies learned from these projects can have positive impact on student achievement in reading and math, while at the same time preparing students to be competent in areas of science and technology that are also important in today's global community. During this planning year, the partners are building a common vision, establishing roles and responsibilities, identifying needs, developing and finalizing the research and evaluation plans, and determining the model of implementation. A project evaluator is collecting evidence about the strength and effectiveness of partnership development and completion of planning phase goals, and providing recommendations for improvement as needed to prepare an effective full Targeted Partnership proposal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Overview  The Applied Research in Science Education (ARISE) project was a planning grant with a purpose of developing strong partnerships with school districts in order to develop and submit a competitive NSF MSP Targeted Partnership proposal. Through collaborative development the proposal was designed to meet the needs of the district partners to improve integrated science instruction and student achievement, thus contributing to science education research.  The ARISE project began in April 2011. Participants in the project included six representatives from four Arizona school districts, three rural and one urban. District representatives included an interim superintendent, two school principals, district science content specialist, elementary science content specialist, curriculum director and an elementary teacher. Northern Arizona University partners included three content faculty from the College on Engineering, Forestry and Natural Sciences and professional development staff from the Center for Science Teaching and Learning (CSTL).     CSTL professional development specialists began planning for an initial partner meeting by analyzing statewide science teacher and administrator survey results related to the current state of science education in Arizona districts as evidenced through results of the Arizona Science Education Survey for Teachers (CSTL, 2010). The survey, questioned teachers in twelve Arizona districts about how much time they spent on science instruction, level of preparedness to teach science, barriers to science teaching, and professional development needs.     Between May and August of 2011 CSTL project staff met with content faculty partners to begin development of a framework for an integrated science professional development course for in-service elementary teachers.  Between June of 2011 and March 2012, CSTL staff worked with district partners to examine existing data, identify need for additional data,  and analyze data to identify needs.  Results were then shared with partners for feedback in order to develop and submit an NSF MSP Targeted Partnership proposal.     Outcomes  To ensure the goals of the ARISE project were met, CSTL contracted with an external evaluation company, Magnolia Consulting, Inc., to conduct an evaluation of ARISE utilizing a mixed-methods approach to data collection including surveys, meeting observations, document review and key informant interviews. Evaluation findings suggest that while district partners valued the leadership of CSTL project staff, came to a common understanding of teacher needs for effective science teaching, and saw value in continuing the work of ARISE, three districts did not have the capacity or internal support to continue work into the next phase. Based on the work of ARISE, CSTL project staff identified strategies for working to build greater buy-in and capacity of partnering districts for the next phase of work.  The ARISE partnership activities resulted in the following outcomes/findings:  Open      communication is crucial. School      districts want to improve instructional practice to improve student      achievement.  Districts      understand the connection between an effective teacher in the classroom      and improved student achievement. Even if overall school      district achievement is strong enough to warrant positive school/district      labels all districts have pockets of students who are not achieving.  Discrepancy between the achievements of      various ethnic groups within districts is common. Districts with the desire      and best of intentions for improvement may not have the capacity or      culture to insure that happens.       Districts with the greatest need may have the least capacity to      participate in grant funded projects that might promote institutional      change. Inability of district      partners to attend meetings and complete tasks by deadline may be strong      indicators that they do not have ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
