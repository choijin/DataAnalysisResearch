<AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place during 3 weeks of June/July 2011 at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute's (STRI) Bocas del Toro Research Station (BRS) in Bocas del Toro, Panama.  Organized by Dr. Rachel Collin of the STRI in Panama, the PASI will address tunicate biology for advanced graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and new PhDs.  Tunicates represent the sister group to vertebrates and are therefore an important group with which to elucidate patterns and processes such as the evolution of development. The course covers traditional morphological and more recent molecular methods for the investigation of tunicate biology, ecology, phylogenetics and evolution.  The assembled group of lecturers is uniquely qualified to produce and disseminate a large amount of information on the Caribbean fauna.  The course will consist of lectures and field and laboratory exercises that cover a wide range of topics.  Participants will be drawn from the US, Brazil, Colombia, Panama, and Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The argument that systematic research has waned recently makes a compelling case for training tunicate biologists in more traditional skills like morphological identification, taxonomy, and systematics.  Expected outcomes in this PASI include 1) addressing contemporary concerns involving the tunicates; 2) training the next generation of systematists with the essential skills to study this group of organisms; and, 3) making information on tunicate identification and collection available on the internet.  The PASI results will be disseminated through electronic devices for educational purposes, updates to the Bocas Biodiversity Inventory Database, and by adding DNA barcodes to the global BOLD database.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Among the challenges to identifying, classifying, and utilizing biodiversity resources, is a shortage of systematic and taxonomic expertise. Systematics has suffered a decline in recent decades, which limits attempts to document the world's biodiversity.  This decline is perpetuated by a general lack of funding for training such individuals, and varies across groups of organisms and among countries. There is a particularly dire need for experts specializing in marine biodiversity and a particular shortage of taxonomists in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. The human resource limitation is especially acute with regard to tunicates, a group of invertebrates important both as a source of potential anti-cancer and anti-viral drugs, and due to their impacts on aquaculture.     The main activity of the NSF funded Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) was a 3-week workshop on the taxonomy and biology of tunicates including 6 instructors and 18 participants from 9 countries (primarily from the USA and Latin America).  The three weeks were broken down into three separate modules:  Identification of tunicates, hot topics in tunicate biology, and individual research projects.  This included daily snorkling field trips with either snorkeling as well as an optional SCUBA field trip, lectures and laboratory exercises.  The participants learned how to identify the local tunicates to species, to prepare dissections for identification, as well as the basics of DNA sequencing, methods to study developmental biology, cloning and self-non-self recognition, and experimental design for research in chemical ecology.  The students used the methods and techniques they learned when they designed projects for the 3rd week of the workshop.     The information shared during this workshop has been made available to the wider-scientific community via the "Caribbean Tunicate Resources" web page.  This page includes a trilingual English, Spanish, Portuguese glossary of terms used in tunicate biology, as well as videos of the lectures and a pdf field guide, prepared by the participants, for the tunicates of Bocas del Toro, Panama (the location of the PASI). The page also provides a link to the Bocas del Toro biodiversity database, which includes 110 species of tunicates. The photos and information available on these pages were produced by the PASI instructors and participants.       In the course of the PASI several previously un-reported species were discovered in Bocas del Toro and two species are currently being more closely examined to determine if they are new to science.  A follow-up survey of the participants in the workshop indicated that 100% of respondants had already used what they learned to teach other students and professionals at their home institutions.
