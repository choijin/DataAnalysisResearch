<AbstractNarration>This project will develop and implement algorithmic and scientific computing tools to numerically investigate binary black holes (BH), neutron stars (NS) or mixed BH/NS pairs with high accuracy. It will extend multi-domain numerical techniques currently used in black hole simulations to cases in which matter fields and shocks are present. It will also investigate the use of heterogeneous (in particular, GPU) computing in numerical simulations of Einstein equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will have direct impact in high accuracy simulations of binary sources in realistic times, as needed for the generation of gravitational wave templates for earth-based gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. In a broader context, the developments of this project should be of value to disciplines such as computational fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, acoustics, and electromagnetism, as well as heterogeneous computing and large-scale simulations in general.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed, implemented, and tested innovative mathematical, algorithmic and computational techniques applied to the numerical simulation and analysis of the collision of compact objects such as binary neutron stars, biack holes and mixed pairs.   The second generation of LIGO, a large experiment designed to directly detect gravitational waves for the first time in history is underway in the United States, along with other ones as part of an international consortium currenlty involving around one thousand scientists and engineers.  After decades of work, these big science experiments are expected to be able to directly observe several of these intense astrophysical events per year.   One component of this project involved the goal of being able to survey these high-dimensional processes. Simulating the collision of two black holes typically takes months of supercomputer time per configuration, for example, and one of the goals of this project was to establish the first steps of a research program that would enable replacing such expensive simulations by equivalent but real time, inexpensive ones. One area explored towards this goal was that one of heterogeneous computing, in particular the use of graphics processing units. Another one was statistical analyses of the space of solutions of simplified models, finding that they effectively live in a lower dimensional space. In more technical words, the problem is amenable to dimensional reduction through techniques of reduced order modeling for parametrized problems. New algorithms and their applications were developed in this context .  Another area for which the first steps were established was the development of new data science algorithms for fast data analysis of large volumes of data. In the context of gravitational wave detection, this is important in order to get the most astrophysical information from these upcoming measurements.  Though this project was driven by gravitational wave physics, the techniques developed are generic and, as a consequence, should be of direct interest to many areas of science, engineering and technology.
