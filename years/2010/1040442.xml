<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 10-40442&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Zhan, Justin&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Dakota State University&lt;br/&gt;Title:   MRI/Acq.: Equipment to Establish Information Assurance Infrastructure for Research and Education&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project from a non-PhD granting university in an EPSCoR state, acquiring a set of networking computing devices, aims to facilitate high-performance large-scale secure computing research and education.  The devices include high performance servers, Cisco routers, and software for large-scale secure collaborative computing. The work, requiring extensive computing, simulation, and large amounts of data mining and analysis, enables the following research projects:&lt;br/&gt;- Privacy-preserving collaborative data mining against semi-honest adversaries,&lt;br/&gt;- Privacy-preserving collaborative data mining against malicious adversaries, and&lt;br/&gt;- Privacy-preserving protocol library development.&lt;br/&gt;The projects address issues critical for the nation?s security and contribute to train graduate students in information privacy and security. Thus the instrument contributes to three main activities:&lt;br/&gt;- Algorithms to account for semi-honest participants;&lt;br/&gt;- Algorithms to account for malicious participants; and&lt;br/&gt;- Software libraries for privacy-preserving data-mining to be shared with the community.&lt;br/&gt;The work aims to unify different metrics for measuring privacy by systematically studying privacy-preserving collaborative computing and performing large-scale simulations. The group is among the first investigating privacy protection theoretically and experimentally in privacy preserving collaborative data-mining. The developed privacy-preserving protocol library is expected to dramatically benefit research in the area.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation should provide a unique research facility for faculty and graduate students to conduct research on privacy-enhancing technology and education in a primarily undergraduate institution in an EPSCoR state. Other institutions and industries within the state are expected to benefit from local and remote access to the requested information assurance instrumentation. Moreover, the project involves and/or supports K-12, distance and Internet-based education, and underrepresented students.</AbstractNarration>
