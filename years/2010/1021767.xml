<AbstractNarration>In insects, juvenile hormone (JH) is a key hormone that regulates development, metamorphosis, and reproduction. Nevertheless, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of JH action. This project will study the JH signaling pathways in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. A Drosophila genetic screen was developed and conducted in the PI's laboratory in order to isolate potential JH signaling components. This work identified four genes that encode negative regulators of the Wnt signaling pathway, a pathway important in the development of all animals. This project will determine the functional conservation of these four genes in Tribolium using RNAi. Methoprene-tolerant (MET) is considered to be a candidate for the JH receptor, but in Drosophila Met null mutants are completely viable and fertile. Research in the PI's laboratory has demonstrated that MET is functionally redundant with another protein, germ cell-expressed (GCE) and mosaic analysis of Met-gce double mutants will be employed to determine the function of JH signaling in different tissues. Overall this research project will identify more players in JH action, clarify the interaction of Wnt and JH signaling pathways, and evaluate the function of JH in different tissues. Because JH action is an important target for a group of insecticides, this project could have important implications for new insecticide design, insecticide resistance management, and environmental safety. Results of this project will also be integrated into the undergraduate and graduate courses. The proposed experiments offer educational and training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students from diverse backgrounds. They will be exposed to the process of scientific discovery through active learning in developmental biology coursework and hands-on experience in the principal investigator's laboratory. The broader impacts of this project also include international collaboration and international training program.</AbstractNarration>
