<AbstractNarration>Hydrological and geochemical studies in the seasonal tropics of Panama over the past six years have revealed runoff behaviors not seen in temperate climates.  This integrated international research program combines hydrological, geochemical, and geophysical measurements in the seasonal tropics including in situ data collection and analysis, enhanced by the use of natural and introduced tracers and modeling.  The overall objective of this collaborative research program is to understand important runoff generating processes in the seasonal tropics and the roles of seasonal transitions and land-use changes on runoff mechanism thresholds.  Hydrologic, geochemical and isotopic data collected over a range of scales will compare the virtually pristine 414 km2 old-growth Upper Rio Chagres and adjacent 330 km2 largely deforested Rio Pacora watersheds to examine land-use change effects.  Different bedrock types underlay these basins, so geochemistry and isotopes will be used to assist in identifying flow paths and residence times and in model and hypothesis testing.  The humid tropics cover 22% of the Earth's land surface and are home to 36% of humanity. The selected study area is representative of the humid tropics promoting transferability of the knowledge gained to a geographically large region. There are three very important questions that this research will help answer.  What is the effect of deforestation or reforestation on the water yields from watersheds in the seasonal tropics?   Why does runoff generation behave differently early in the rainy season than at other times of the year?  How can we better predict these effects by improved hydrologic models?  The Panama Canal watershed is extremely important for world commerce because the runoff from the watershed drives the Panama Canal, which is vitally important to the United States.  These research results will be communicated to the Panama Canal Authority, Panamanian Universities, and broadly disseminated through peer-review articles.   An international field course on tropical hydrology will be held each year of the project and will be open to qualified U.S. and Panamanian graduate and undergraduate students.   The project compliments the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) Panama Canal Watershed Experiment, and STRI is a collaborator, as are the Panama Canal Authority and the Technological University of Panama.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied land-use effects on water resources availability in the Panama Canal Watershed (PCW).  PCW water resources face two extremes. They can be scarce during the pronounced December-April dry season yet excessive during the May-November rainy season.  Panama Canal operations depend on reliable water yields from the PCW, particularly as the Panama Canal undergoes expansion that will increase water use.   Water resources management in the PCW is critical to the United States economy as 15-19% of U.S. trade with Asia traverses the Panama Canal.  Understanding land use effects on water resources availability is also important for countries in similar settings such as Caribbean island nations that depend on small watersheds sensitive to flood and drought.  We visualized flow paths in the soil using Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) while applying simulated rainwater with salt tracers.  Applied simulated rain water that infiltrated in the pasture moved vertically to a depth of about 0.5 m then spread laterally.  We observed surface runoff and flow through large decayed root channels (macropores) in the pasture.  In contrast, a similar test in a 30-year old forest showed that infiltrated rainfall moved downward about 1.5-2 m, and we observed no runoff and no macropore flow, even after applying 60 cm (23 inches) of rain in two hours.  We deployed automatic water samplers for streams that were triggered to start sampling during storms as stream levels rose.  We also manually sampled soil, soil water, canopy throughfall, shallow groundwater, springs, and flowing streams between storms. These samples allowed us to use naturally-occurring geochemical and stable water isotope tracers to help identify water sources and flow paths taken by rain water as it falls through vegetation canopies, travels in the soil, and mixes with soil water and groundwater to form stream water.  Pre-rainfall stream flow has a strong groundwater geochemical signal, while rainfall that quickly enters the stream as surface runoff exhibits a different geochemical signature similar to rainfall and the soil through which it flowed.   The ratio of the geochemical and isotopic signals of groundwater and rainfall helped us identify flow paths.  One naturally-occurring pair of geochemical tracers we used includes the novel use of two similar elements, Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge).  Both elements are present in rocks, soil, water, and plants, but at very different concentrations, and natural processes can alter their ratio. For example, as a rock weathers to form clay minerals in soils, the ratio of Ge to Si in the resulting soil is higher than the original rock. A watershed is made up of several reservoirs (e.g., fresh bedrock, shallow soil, deep soil) from which Ge and Si may chemically weather and contribute to the stream water signature, and each of these reservoirs contain a different ratio of Ge to Si. We measured Ge and Si in stream water during rain events, and using these reservoirs as sources, determined what mixture of these sources must have contributed to create the observed stream water concentrations.

During smaller rain events, we calculate &lt;10% or even 0% stream water originates in the shallow soil. This is a topic of ongoing research.  Along with the hydrologic work, we also examined the sources and sinks of Molybdenum (Mo) in this tropical forest ecosystem. Mo is a micronutrient that is coupled with the nitrogen cycle because nitrogen fixing organisms that convert atmospheric nitrogen (N) to bioavailable ammonia for plant growth also require Mo. There is great interest in "coupled biogeochemical cycles" such as these within the ecological c...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
