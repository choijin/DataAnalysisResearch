<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award will enable Dr. Kuo and his team to develop technology that will assist in the design of the POLAR array. The POLAR array will be a ground-based array that will detect and characterize the polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), one of the most reliable and powerful probes in cosmology. Many cosmological parameters have been determined through the study of this remnant of the Big Bang. The technology development components of the proposal include the design of the focal plane, the detector/feed antenna architecture, readout electronics, techniques to implement large cold optics, and large aperture infrared filtering. All of these have the goal of maximizing the scientific output of the POLAR array.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the award include the training of undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students. Data obtained by the array will serve as a legacy data set on the high-redshift mass distribution which will benefit the entire astronomical community. Dr. Kuo and his team will also work with teachers that take part in a RET program at Stanford.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since 2009, I have been advocating a next generation ground based CMB program that searches deeply for inflationary gravitational waves and maps a large portion of the sky with arcminute resolution, providing a legacy map of CMB lensing for precision cosmology. I presented a strawman configuration which I called the POLAR Array. Such effort is now widely recognized by the CMB community to be the direction for the next decade. The program, now known as CMB-S4, or CMB Stage-IV, will likely be developed and funded jointly by NSF and DOE. In some sense this NSF Faculty Early CAREER Award (2011-2016) is the earliest funded effort to study CMB-S4.  The acvtities supported by this grant include development of scalable receiver sub-systems and scientific optimization of various array configurations using Fisher-matrix forecasts. The results from the forecasts were extensively used during the Snowmass planning process and played an important role in the P5 selection. This work is summarized in (W.L.K. Wu et al., ApJ, 788, 138, 2014) , which is a widely referenced paper in the CMB-S4 community.  The technological side of the program involves developing focal plane modules, broadband antireflection coating of refractive components, and large area infrared filters. These R&amp;D efforts have made BICEP3 possible, the third generation upgrade of the BICEP program. Our group are also in charge of the cold optics and infrared filtering for SPT-3G, becuase of the expertise developed during this program.  Now adays, CMB receivers with one-meter vacuum windows are possible, thanks partly to this program. This enables a compelling mixed-aperture configuration for CMB-S4 which consists of 10-20 one-meter size receivers, some mounted on 10m telescopes (SPT-like) and the other as stand-alone compact refractors (BICEP3-like). The vast multipole range covered by this approach (10-10,000) and its tremendous technical heritage really make it very attractive when compared with other proposals, such as the widely discussed Cornell concept.
