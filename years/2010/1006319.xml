<AbstractNarration>The objective of this grant is to conduct a workshop that brings together leading researchers from around the world, specializing in mathematics, operations research, economics, computer science, engineering, cognitive sciences, psychology, and other fields, to discuss fundamental scientific issues in creating Self-Optimizing Systems (SOS). The goal of this workshop is to formulate a cross-disciplinary research agenda to develop fundamental understanding and create a knowledge base for the design and control of SOS that are robust to unexpected failures or unplanned events.  This workshop is expected enhance the fundamental knowledge base for SOS by promoting key advances in theoretical foundations and self-optimization approaches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this workshop will lead to the creation of a coherent scientific basis for research in SOS.  This workshop will result in the development of a common set of theoretical frameworks, tool and technologies that would be available to a broad range of users to design next generation of engineered systems that can self-organize and perform efficiently in uncertain environments. These common principles and tools would allow coordinated self-organization at different levels of a system. This workshop will enhance our ability to address societal issues, for example managing large-scale infrastructure systems such as energy grid and water, and predicting natural-social phenomenon such as climate change, that result from complex interactions among large number of coupled natural and human sub-systems.</AbstractNarration>

Some of the key findings of this workshop are listed below: &bull;    Although complexity and multi-agent structure may obfuscate the definition of SOS, the most general defining statements proposed were:  (1) A system that self-organizes for the purpose of self-optimization (implicitly or explicitly); (2) Systems that change (potentially optimally) in response to environments. &bull;    Metrics for assessing SOS include the quality or normal performance of the system, how well the system can re-optimize when disturbed/perturbed, as well as the rate of convergence to equilibrium, and the robustness of the self-organized system. &bull;    Common training and techniques for studying SOS include optimization, probability theory, stochastic processes, game theory, control theory, dynamical systems, evolutionary theory, and empirical methods. &bull;    Methods and approaches identified for SOS: model checking methods for formalizing abstraction, design of hierarchy in architectures, adaptation of what agents control what variables, add/remove agents, optimization algorithms that learn by searching space changes over time in response to regularity, robust, dynamic optimization with time-dependent objectives, modeling human rationality via utility elicitation, explicit vs. intrinsic rewards, evolution of preferences, and learning how to play games. By bringing together experts from various disciplines, this workshop provided a setting with which we could start to formalize a knowledge base and develop a research agenda. The identified state of the art in SOS brings together techniques and models from academic disciplines of computer science, operations research, statistics, economics, sensors and control theory. Included in those techniques and models are learning algorithms, optimization, simulation, stochastic processes, approximation methods, equilibria concepts,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
