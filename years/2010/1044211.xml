<AbstractNarration>The majority of student enrolling in introductory algebra-based physics courses are life science majors. Yet essential physics topics for biology, such as fluids, often receive little or unsuitable coverage in these classes.  An understanding of fluids is essential to the practice of many of these majors, including those who pursue careers in medicine: organisms live in fluid environments and fluids inside the body carry out many essential functions.  Our current knowledge of student understanding of fluids is sparse and so our pedagogy on this topic is relatively uninformed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research-based curricular interventions and assessment questions enable a more informed pedagogical approach to teaching fluids. The research of this award is examining students? current state of knowledge of fluids through interviews that elucidate student preconceptions about fluids and student resources (both productive and unproductive) for reasoning about fluids.  These findings are then serving to help in the design of guided inquiry labs, tutorials, quantitative questions, as well as formative and summative assessment tools. The research systematically examines assessment questions for validity and reliability with the objective of constructing a fluids concept inventory, while also assessing the curricular interventions for effectiveness in improving student understanding. The broad impact of this award is apparent, as these deliverables enable instructors at any institution with a course for life science majors to offer a tested, research-based curriculum on fluids with topics of high interest to life science students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An understanding of fluids is essential to the practice of many students in the life sciences:  organisms live in fluid environments and fluids inside the body carry out many functions essential for life.  However, at the beginning of this grant, no work in Physics Education Research had been done on studentsÃ† understanding of moving fluids (other than ideal gases). Our goal was to produce research-based curricula on moving fluids appropriate for life science students.     Intellectual Merit: We have produced three research-based tutorials on moving fluids for the college level introductory physics course for life science students.  These tutorials address the broad topics of the kinetic theory of gases, fluid flow in pipes without friction, and viscosity (or fluidic friction).  We developed these tutorials by keeping in mind what conceptual building blocks students were likely to bring (such as ideas about collisions and friction) that would help them understand fluids more deeply, and by prompting students to think mechanistically.  We assessed the effectiveness of the tutorials through pre and post conceptual assessments and analysis of classroom videos.  The classroom videos let us examine details of student conversations, in which we looked for  and found productive discussion, such as chaining together several ideas to explain phenomena, asking and answering substantive questions, and checking for consistency.  We also looked for what conceptual building blocks they used in constructing their understanding, and found that the students had much to draw on.     Broader Impacts: According to American Institute of Physics, about 200,000 students a year take the Introductory Physics Course for Life Science Students.  These tutorials on fluids can help this large cohort of student deepen their understanding of moving fluids.  These materials have been disseminated and four national conferences and a regional workshop.  The tutorials are available on the web (ipls.unh.edu) and can be modified to meet local needs (since this introductory course looks very different at each school).  Two students (one graduate and one undergraduate) have contributed significantly to this project and gained valuable experience in physics education research.
