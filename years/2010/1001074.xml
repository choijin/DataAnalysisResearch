<AbstractNarration>This project will conduct a modeling and data analysis effort to assess the extent to which acoustic waves and high frequency gravity waves influence the thermal, chemical, and dynamical states of the upper atmosphere.  Specifically, the project will: (1) observe ionospheric perturbations using digital high-frequency Doppler sounders (TIDDBIT) from two North American locations; (2) use a numerical wave propagation model to infer the underlying atmospheric perturbations that cause the observed ionospheric variations and to characterize the energy and momentum flux into the ionosphere; and (3) use group velocity and raytracing models to examine sources of acoustic waves.</AbstractNarration>
