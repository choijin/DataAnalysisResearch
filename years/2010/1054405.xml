<AbstractNarration>Biochar, also known as "biomass-derived black carbon", is a charcoal produced by the&lt;br/&gt;combustion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment (pyrolysis). Recent technological&lt;br/&gt;advances make it possible to envision the development of an innovative environmental&lt;br/&gt;sustainability strategy to convert carbon-rich agricultural residues (e.g. sugarcane bagasses,&lt;br/&gt;sugar beet residues, peanut hull, and animal waste) into engineered biochars. This&lt;br/&gt;sustainability strategy can produce multiple societal and environmental benefits: sustainable&lt;br/&gt;management of agricultural resources, water conservation and reclamation, sustainable soil&lt;br/&gt;productivity, carbon neutral energy production, and carbon sequestration. The overall objective&lt;br/&gt;of this project is to build an integrated research and education program focusing on exploring&lt;br/&gt;the environmental and societal benefits of using carbon-rich agricultural residues as feed stocks&lt;br/&gt;for engineered biochars.  The specific research objectives are to: 1) Create different types of engineered biochars&lt;br/&gt;(i.e., untreated biochar, biologically activated biochar, and surface-modified biochar) from&lt;br/&gt;representative agricultural residues; 2) Determine fundamental physicochemical properties of&lt;br/&gt;the engineered biochars; and 3) Unveil mechanisms governing the sorption of contaminants&lt;br/&gt;(i.e., nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and heavy metals) to the engineered biochars.&lt;br/&gt;The specific educational objectives are to: 1) develop a new course on the impact of&lt;br/&gt;biochar on environmental sustainability; 2) promote interest and participation of students in&lt;br/&gt;environmental sustainability through early exposure; and 3) educate the greater community&lt;br/&gt;about the environmental and societal benefits of the proposed activities.</AbstractNarration>
