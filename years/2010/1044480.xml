<AbstractNarration>This project aims to increase the commitment of freshman engineering students to the pursuit of engineering as an academic major and profession and increase the number of women and underrepresented minorities matriculating into engineering. Innovative learner-centered materials and strategies will capture the interests of students with diverse backgrounds, while encouraging higher-level thinking. Freshmen and prospective engineering students will be given an opportunity to explore topics of their choice in an engineering foundation course. Web-based lines of study, referred to as Elective Units, also offer topics, including vignettes, based on Grand Challenges.  Interviews with leading experts describing each challenge and emphasizing the important role that engineers play in solving these problems will be recorded. Students will use the vignettes and reference materials to decide which Elective Unit(s) they wish to study. Desire-to-Learn (D2L) web-sites will be created for each Elective Unit and will provide access to a variety of educational experiences that should appeal to a wide range of learning styles. Student feedback and assessment will be used to enhance and refine the Elective Units. A workshop will be conducted to educate the instructor team on the benefits of learner-centered education strategies, as well as the technology and tools that are available to enhance student learning through the Elective Units. Student performance on assignments, projects, quizzes and tests will be evaluated to assess the effectiveness of the teaching methodologies. In addition, students will be surveyed to evaluate whether their commitment to engineering is enhanced as a result of the Elective Units. Enhanced commitment to engineering should help to achieve the long-term goal to increase the recruitment and retention of students, particularly underrepresented students, in the College of Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

Students are encouraged to further investigate topics and make connections to the societal, global, environmental and economic context that frame the Grand Challenge.

When these results are filtered, so as to include only those students strongly committed to the topic of their chosen Elective Unit (Table IV), one can see that the Unit on Make Solar Energy Economical did not have the desired result on students strongly interested in the topic.     Much of the course material developed on this project has had a beneficial effect on the students enrolled in the freshmen-level introduction to engineering course at the UA. Four of the six Units clearly increased the number of students strongly interested in the topic they chose (see Table IV), which suggests reinforcement of the studentsÆ choices and this may be related to why students also report an increased commitment to engineering (Table II).     One significant consideration in offering these Elective Units as part of a general introduction to engineering course is that we provide the st...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
