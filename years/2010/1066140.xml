<AbstractNarration>This award supports a planning visit to the Control Science and Engineering Department at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in China.  Participants in the trip will include Professors Nian Zhang, Esther Ososanya, and Wagdy Mahmoud of the Electrical and Control Engineering Department at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) together with two students. The purpose of the trip is to develop a collaborative research project on nonlinear forecasting methods based on computational intelligence techniques, particularly neural networks. The theoretical strength of the Chinese partners will complement the experimental studies at UDC. Initial applications of new techniques of forecasting, particularly using neural networks and fuzzy logic, would involve renewable energy systems based on solar radiation and wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In promoting research collaboration among the participants, this planning visit will lead to new and more reliable forecasting techniques that can contribute to more efficient and economical alternative energy systems. The participation of students in an international program will broaden their personal and professional perspectives. UDC is primarily an undergraduate institution whose student population consists largely of underrepresented minorities. Opportunities for such students to engage in the international linkage should make the study of engineering more appealing to them. Also, the fact that two of the UDC faculty involved here are female engineers should have a positive impact on female students in particular.</AbstractNarration>
