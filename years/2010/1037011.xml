<AbstractNarration>The proposal is asking for travel support for US based graduate students and postdoctoral mathematicians to attend a major conference in geometric group theory. This is a great opportunity for these junior mathematicians to familiarize themselves with the frontiers of research in this very active subject and in the future contribute to it. In addition, many of the participants (e.g. two of the main speakers) are anticipated to be women. Based on initial inquiries, it is also likely that several of US based mathematicians that will be supported on this grant, if funded, will be women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric group theory is a relatively new area of mathematics whose object is study groups by first constructing a geometric object whose symmetries form the given group and then to analyze the geometry of this object. An important example of this is the group of symmetries of a free group, realized geometrically as the so called "Outer space", constructed by Culler and Vogtmann.</AbstractNarration>
