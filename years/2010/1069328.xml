<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to develop an environmentally benign vapor-phase patterning method for modifying the interfacial surface properties of three-dimensional porous materials. Metal salt inhibitors will be used to control the location of polymer growth. The fundamental mechanism behind the inhibition process and the generality of the patterning method will be studied by investigating the kinetics associated with the inhibition process as a function of substrate temperature, the flow rate of the precursors, and the time of deposition. The chemical interaction between the precursors and the inhibiting salts will be studied by examining the effects of changing the initiator and monomer molecules involved in the polymerization process. The uniformity of the inhibition through the depth of the porous materials will be studied as a function of the pore size and the mean free path. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will allow for the production of next-generation point-of-care paper-based diagnostic devices. The development of robust paper-based diagnostic devices is important for monitoring health-related issues in resource-limited environments such as personal homes and developing economies. This work will allow these devices to be patterned with a wide range of responsive and functional polymers that will greatly enhance their current analytical capabilities. This project will be used to mentor and train underrepresented high school and middle school students in downtown Los Angeles. The PI and the PI's students will work in collaboration with USC's MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement) program. The MESA program serves more than 1000 disadvantaged middle school and high school students in 23 schools in downtown Los Angeles.</AbstractNarration>
