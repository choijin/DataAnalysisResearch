<AbstractNarration>Fluid dynamics has historically been a driving force in applied mathematics and scientific computing.&lt;br/&gt;In biological settings, a level of complexity is added to traditional fluid dynamics since&lt;br/&gt;typically biological flows are unsteady, involve active and elastic interfaces, fluid-structure interactions&lt;br/&gt;and transport of chemical signals. This Research and Training project, led by faculty in the&lt;br/&gt;Departments of Mathematics and Biomedical Engineering at Tulane University, recognizes the need&lt;br/&gt;for students trained at the interface of mathematics and the biomedical sciences. Three graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, six undergraduate students and two postdoctoral fellows will be supported each year. A&lt;br/&gt;broad spectrum of research projects will be emphasized that span mathematical analysis, development&lt;br/&gt;and analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations, modeling of complex&lt;br/&gt;biological systems, three-dimensional simulations on high-performance computers, and a two-way&lt;br/&gt;coordination of modeling with experiments. Training activities will include a curriculum with core&lt;br/&gt;courses from both the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Biomedical Engineering,&lt;br/&gt;regular group meetings, a monthly Biofluids All-Hands meeting, a wet-lab and internship program&lt;br/&gt;for graduate students and postdocs, professional development seminars, an annual Carnival Focus&lt;br/&gt;Days (CFD) workshop and high-performance computing training activities. Moreover, undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students will be fully-integrated into research teams through academic year involvement and&lt;br/&gt;intensive summer research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics has had a huge impact on the engineering,  biological and physical sciences through its development&lt;br/&gt;of theoretical analyses and numerical methods. Biological fluid dynamics, in addition&lt;br/&gt;to its direct applications in physiology and oceanography, provides a rich educational and training&lt;br/&gt;platform for students in the mathematical sciences. Undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;students will work in teams, with representation from both Mathematics and Biomedical&lt;br/&gt;Engineering, and with an emphasis on the interplay between theory, computation and experiment.&lt;br/&gt;Research projects will be motivated by applications, including microorganism motility, pulmonary&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, biosensors and cellular biomechanics. All graduate and postdoctoral students will participate&lt;br/&gt;in an internship, either at Tulane University or at a partner institution, where they can&lt;br/&gt;work side-by-side with experimentalists, develop a comprehensive understanding of various aspects&lt;br/&gt;of the research project, and participate in the life of a working fluids lab. The co-PIs, all co-founders&lt;br/&gt;of Tulane's Center for Computational Science, have demonstrated commitment to this model of&lt;br/&gt;training. They are, themselves, diverse, and have been actively involved in increasing the number&lt;br/&gt;of US women and minorities in scientific research. This training program will attract diverse&lt;br/&gt;American nationals into the mathematical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Airflow in the lungs, blood flow in the heart, sperm moving in the reproductive tract and infectious bacteria penetrating tissues are all examples of systems that involve the interaction of a fluid environment with surrounding structures.  The goal of this project was to train students to develop, use and analyze computational simulations to investigate these fluid-structure systems.   Predictions of computational simulations can include optimal heart valve design, strategies for altering surfactant in the lungs for better oxygen transport and the design of engineered microrobots for drug delivery to tumors.   This research training grant brought together researchers in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics, and successfully trained five postdoctoral researchers, five graduate students (three received PhDs) and thirty one undergraduates at the interface of mathematics and the biomedical sciences.   Scientific outcomes include the development of three-dimensional models of viscoelastic flow that is applicable to respiratory mucus and sperm penetration of the egg in mammalian fertilizaion, the study of thrust production by flexible appendages in swimming organisms, the coordinated beating of respiratory cilia, and the complex dynamics of long flexible fibers in polymeric flows.  High impact research publications and presentations at professional meetings resulted from this research.  The major activities of the research training group included weekly biofluid group meetings, summer research experiences for undergraduates, annual high-perfomance computing workshops and visits of graduate students and postdocs to experimental labs outside of Tulane University.
