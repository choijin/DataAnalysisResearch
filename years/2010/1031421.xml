<AbstractNarration>GUTS y Girls is a three-year ITEST Strategies project targeting middle school girls in Santa Fe, Las Cruces, and Albuquerque, New Mexico. This project builds on a previously funded NSF Academies for Young Scientist award (06-39637) and includes partnerships between the Santa Fe Institute and MIT, University of New Mexico, New Mexico Tech, New Mexico State University, Santa Fe Complex, Girl Scouts of New Mexico Trails, the Supercomputing Challenge, regional educational organizations, and local schools. GUTS y Girls is designed to build the STEM and ICT workforce by engaging girls in exciting cyber-enabled learning experiences that prepare them for future careers, create and study a network of support using social networking tools, and develop a replicable program model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project deliverables include Monthly Saturday Workshops and two-week Summer Intensive Workshops. The 7-hour Saturday workshops expose girls to a wide variety of STEM/ICT jobs and professionals while engaging them in creative projects that build their confidence. During the two-week Summer Intensive Workshop, girls gain an understanding of complex systems concepts through hands-on activities and participatory simulations. Participants investigate topics of local relevance, view them through the lens of complex systems, and then apply agent-based modeling and network analysis tools. By fostering an understanding of complex systems and developing girls' computational thinking, computer programming, computational modeling, critical thinking, and spatial skills, GUTS y Girls prepares participants for a wide range of STEM and ICT fields including computer science, ecology, engineering, and mathematics. GUTS y Girls' secondary strategy is to develop and study a support system for girls by creating a virtual clubhouse using social networking to communicate with female STEM/ICT practitioners and student mentors. All project activities are designed to support the New Mexico state standards in science and math for grades 5-8. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target audience includes 300 low-income Hispanic and Native American youth. Project activities are hands-on, address real-world problems, and engage professionals from the field, all characteristics found in successful science and math programs that serve young women. A mixed-methods evaluation approach is planned which assesses changes in awareness of STEM and ICT fields; technical and thinking skills; understanding of complex systems and uses of computer modeling; and interest and attitudes towards STEM content and careers. This project provides insight into whether student engagement in cyber-enabled STEM learning experiences builds capacity for future endeavors in STEM and if the use of social networks and STEM mentors can sustain student interest and involvement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report, NSF-ITEST 10-31421  This report reflects the culmination of a three year "Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers" project that received a no-cost extension for a 4th year. GUTS y Girls involved several institutions including Santa Fe Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of New Mexico, New Mexico Tech, and New Mexico State University.  The project provided technology-rich STEM/ICT opportunities for middle school girls that served as the basis for a research study. Successful long-standing partnerships with school districts, community based organizations, and educational organization partners provided GUTS y Girls with avenues for recruitment while partnerships with universities and industry enabled us to recruit female professionals in STEM/ICT fields as guest speakers and workshop presenters.  GUTS y Girls designed, implemented, and evaluated summer and weekend GUTS y Girls workshops, developed a private social networking website for participants, and studied whether online social networking can help to sustain girlsÆ participation and interest in STEM/ICT.  Girls had opportunities to participate in eight 6-hour Saturday workshops during the school year and 2-week summer workshops. The social network was available for use throughout the cohort years and at an early workshop girls were introduced to the network and learned to make their own profile pages. Analysis of Saturday workshop surveys showed that girls who attended the Saturday workshops enjoyed themselves and what they learned in workshops. Themes that emerged across the open-ended questions highlighted how engaged girls were in the various activities offered, particularly those that afforded some degree of challenge that could be successfully negotiated over the course of completing a project of personal relevance. Response patterns to pre- and post- survey questions reinforced the assertion that overall, the majority of girls valued the experiences they had during the Saturday workshops ranging from meeting STEM/ICT professionals to learning and experimenting with new technologies.   Programmatic features that appeared to be most influential were the all-female environment, strong and supportive relationships at multiple levels, recruitment of female professionals who were able to connect with girls in a variety of ways, and the provision of a variety of fun and challenging STEM/ICT experiences for girls.  The all-female environment gave girls a place where they did not have to compete with boys for resources or to be heard.  In this space, girls were introduced to female professionals doing innovative work in STEM/ICT fields.  Guest speakers whom girls seemed to resonate most strongly with were approachable, talked about the challenges they themselves had experienced, and were passionate about their work.  Importantly, many of these women were early-career professionals, not so far away from the girls themselves.  Incorporation of near-peer mentors from high school girls to GUTS y Girls alumnae provided girls with role models.  In this environment, girls made new friends who shared an interest and enthusiasm for STEM/ICT, worked with others on challenging tasks, learned how to manipulate materials, and were introduced to a variety of technology-rich tools and projects.   GUTS y Girls evaluation determined that girlsÆ engagement in cyber-enabled STEM learning experiences built their capacity for future endeavors in STEM. Participating girls showed positive gains in STEM knowledge and skills during their time in the GUTS y Girls program.  Importantly, girls also showed increases in their STEM self-efficacy such as increased sense of STEM mastery, seeing others like them succeed in STEM, receiving support for STEM endeavors from parents, friends, and other trusted individuals, and reduction in negative physiological and/or psychological reactions to STEM.  At program exit, GUTS y Girls participants ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
