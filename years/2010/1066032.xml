<AbstractNarration>This project continues a multi-year sequence of observations of carbon monoxide, ozone, other trace gases, and aerosol physical properties at the Mt. Bachelor Observatory (MBO), a high elevation site in the Pacific Northwest. This site has been shown to frequently receive pollutants transported from Asia in the free troposphere. The project builds on previous work on the implications of increasing Asian and global emissions for background air quality. The observations will be used along with satellite data and computer modeling to address scientific questions concerning monthly and interannual variability of tropospheric ozone, the contribution of free tropospheric ozone to ozone levels in surface air, and the impacts of regional fires, Asian air pollutants and the stratosphere on U.S. air quality more generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MBO is the nation's only free tropospheric observatory for atmospheric composition on the West Coast. Observations from the site have been used in several recent assessments of intercontinental transport of pollution performed by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the UN Environmental Programs/Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution program. Research at MBO has also been the focus of numerous graduate and undergraduate research projects. This project will support one new graduate student and one new post-doctoral fellow, who will focus on making high quality observations, integrating the in situ observations with satellite data and using global chemical transport models.</AbstractNarration>

MBOÃ†s mission is to study and understand the local, regional and global sources of pollution in the western U.S. (WUS), with an emphasis on understanding the sources and atmospheric chemistry of ozone, aerosols and mercury.  Over the past decade we measured ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), mercury, carbon monoxide and dioxide (CO and CO2), nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, metals, volatile organic compounds and meteorological parameters. In the last 3 years we updated and improved our instrumentation for O3, CO, CO2 and black carbon (soot). The chemicals measured at MBO are important air pollutants or precursors to pollutants that harm human health and the environment.  We have collected an extensive data set since MBO began in 2004.

We established important collaborations with scientists at over 20 universities and governmental organizations, including Washington State University, UC Davis, University of Utah and Harvard University.    Some key scientific findings from this research project are:  East Asian emissions likely impact springtime air quality in the WUS. Using 10 years of springtime O3 and CO measurements, we identified a long-term increase in O3 and a decrease in CO. Transport patterns associated with these trends suggest a dominant influence of Asian long-range transport (LRT) on increasing O3. Decreasing CO appears most associated with transport from the North Pacific, where reductions in North American and European CO emissions and recent reductions in total CO output from China likely influenced atmospheric CO. Air arriving to the west coast of the U.S. is first observed in the free troposphere at MBO and subsequently influences air quality throughout the WUS. As the concentration of O3 increases in the free troposphere and air quality standards get increasingly stringent, some urban areas in the WUS will have difficulty complying with the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for maximum daily 8-hour averages of O3. On average, urban surface PM in the WUS is not greatly influenced by Asian emissions. Transported PM from Asia can be detected at urban sites a few days per year. However, its influence on air quality is much smaller than that of transported O3. Wildfires in the WUS, Alaska and Siberia make a significant contribution to PM and O3 from late spring through summer. These fires are highly variable but often generate large amounts of PM and O3. Using our observations at MBO, we improved our understanding of the variability in wildfire emissions and chemistry and the climate/radiative effects of wildfire smoke.  Wildfires can have a significant influence on O3 levels in urban areas of the WUS. Smoldering fires produce much more aerosols, per unit of carbon emitted, compared to flaming combustion. Smoldering fires also appear to generate more secondary aerosols. The nitrogen oxide&ndash;total reactive nitrogen (NOx/NOy) ratio is a good indicator of plume photochemical age and O3 production.
