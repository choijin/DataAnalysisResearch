<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for three conferences in economic history:  the 2012 and 2014 Cliometrics Conference and the 2013 World Congress of the Cliometric Society.  The research topics bring together economics with statistics, demography, political science, sociology, anthropology, and archaeology.  The goal is to use scientific methods to analyse historic data sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Papers presented at the conference are chosen in response to an open call for submission.  Particular attention in selection goes to graduate students and new scholars.  The steady mixing of newly trained and experienced researchers creates a unique intellectual environment that has worked to increase participation in this field of economics.   The result is that young scholars receive the stimulation and encouragement to build strong scientific records in this interdisciplinary field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the project was to organize annual conferences of cliometricians of all ranks and from all over the world to present their research, interact, and form networks.  The project helped to fund annual cliometric conferences in 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016 and a world congress of cliometrics in 2013.  'Cliometrics' is economics in the service of history and history in the service of economics.  The focus of cliometrics has been on the application of economic theory and quantitative analysis to a wide range of historical issues. At the simplest level, this consists of making observations of economic behavior and measuring variables relevant to the articulation of or the testing of an economic theory or model. Human experience, however, is complex, and cliometricians also seek to examine and understand the forces underlying the development of institutions and government, in order to understand the long-term patterns of development throughout the world.  Cliometric conferences follow a very specific form which has been found to promote intellectual discussion and debate.  Each paper receives its own 60-minute session at a conference and 45-minute session at a world congress.  A Conference Program Committee chose 11-12 papers for presentation at each of the annual conferences and 88 papers for presentation at the 2013 world congress. Each author(s) was limited to a maximum of 5 minutes with no formal discussants assigned. The remainder of the 55-minute session was spent in questions and answers from the floor. Each conference participant received an electronic pdf containing the conference book consisting of information about the conference, research summaries for each participant, and the 11 papers to be discussed at the conference. The attendees accepted to read the paper in advance for each of the 11 sessions, which were attended by all Conference participants.  Having the author presentation limited to five minutes and with all attendees having read the paper fosters a long and often spirited discussion of the paper among participants. This structure stimulates a ?workshop? atmosphere that encourages participants to speak freely and to build new professional relationships. All attendees also agreed to be present at each session.  There was also an attempt to balance the attendees to provide the best possible feedback on the papers presented.  Conversations and discussions extended through the break times.  The spirit is tough but respectful and lively, and the conference organizers worked to perpetuate this atmosphere by having a balance of seasoned cliometricians and participants new to the field from a wide range of schools and countries.   The 2012 Annual Cliometric Conference was hosted by the University of Arizona, May 18-20, 2012 in Tucson, Arizona. There were 60 invited participants from the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia.   The 7th World Congress of Cliometrics took place at the University of Hawaii, June 18-21, 2013 in Honolulu, Hawaii.  There were 128 participants from universities in the United States, Canada, Russia, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, China, and Japan.    The 2014 Annual Cliometric Conference was hosted by Clemson University, May 16-17, 2014 in Clemson, South Carolina. There were 42 participants from universities in the USA, UK, Germany, France, and Switzerland.    The 2015 Annual Cliometric Conference was hosted by the University of Michigan, 15-17 May 2015 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  There were 62 participants from universities and agencies in the USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, Denmark, France, Japan, and Taiwan.    The 2016 Annual Cliometric Conference took place at the University of Pittsburgh, 20-21 May 2016.  The Conference was jointly hosted by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.  There were 59 invited participants from universities and agencies in the USA, UK, Ireland, France, Sweden, Australia, South Africa, and Colombia.
