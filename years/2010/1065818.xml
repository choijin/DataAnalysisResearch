<AbstractNarration>Because climate and land use strongly affect ecosystems and the services that they provide to society, understanding of both individual factors and their interactions is integral for developing effective environmental management and policy. Cross-scale interactions, wherein a factor at one scale interacts with a factor at another scale, are of particular interest, given their complexity and lack of study. The main goal of this research is to develop tools to measure and understand how climate and land use, by themselves and as interacting factors, affect lake ecosystems across scales of time and space, even as these factors are themselves, changing. Lakes are unique study systems to address questions of cross-scale interactions; for example, agricultural land use in a surrounding lake watershed can interact with the climate of the region in which the lake is located, leading to situations where lakes in different climatic zones may respond differently to similar surrounding environmental inputs, such as nutrient inputs from agricultural land use in their watersheds. This project will identify and measure the most important cross-scale interactions that control lake nutrients and water quality and will be guided by a landscape limnology conceptual framework. A collaborative team from three universities will collect a large dataset on lakes, nutrients, and watersheds, including over 5,000 lake ecosystems in 11 U.S. states spanning up to 30 years. Several new and innovative statistical modeling approaches will be used to detect and model cross-scale interactions, including Bayesian hierarchical modeling (a statistical method for learning and modeling complex relationships in data). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identifying the conditions or the environments prone to cross-scale interactions is needed to forecast, manage, and restore ecosystems, such as lakes, responding to change operating at local to regional scales. The research framework, design, and analysis of this work provide an innovative approach that has the potential change the conduct of research on large-scale, living systems, beyond the lakes under study. Additionally, because commonly-measured lake water quality variables used in water resource policy will be used in this analysis, results from this project will directly inform state and federal agencies responsible for lake and water management. Finally, several undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral researchers will be trained as a result, helping to foster a new generation of biologists with skills in tackling broad-scaled research and policy problems.</AbstractNarration>

Predicting how lakes will respond to global changes not only requires water quality data, but also information about the ecological context of individual lakes across broad spatial and temporal scales. Because lake water quality is usually sampled in limited geographic regions and time periods, determining the environmental controls of water quality requires scientists to combine existing smaller data sets into an integrated database. Such comprehensive databases have not been available across large regions in the U.S., until now. Our NSF-funded Macrosystems Biology research team created LAGOS-NE-- a database for all 50,000 lakes in an area of 1,800,000 km2 in 17 northeast and midwestern US states. We developed the methods, data, and infrastructure for building other such databases. LAGOS-NE is one of the largest and most comprehensive databases of its type because it includes both in situ measurements and ecological context data. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Our scientific goal was to develop this database to answer fundamental research questions about the controls of lake water quality across broad geographic regions of the country. This database contains the needed information to better understand water quality in thousands of lakes and the complex relationships between climate, land use, lake characteristics, and water quality. And, because ecological context can be used to study a variety of other questions about lakes, streams, and wetlands, LAGOS-NE can be used as the foundation for other studies of freshwaters at broad spatial and ecological scales.

The factors that explain lake water quality, are known to differ when studying a single lake versus studying thousands of lakes. However, until recently, scientists have not had the data to study whole populations of lakes (e.g., thousands of lakes at once). An important knowledge gap that our study filled was to measure and understand what controls variation in thousands of lakes as compared to the understanding gleaned from decades of research conducted on individual lakes. For example, we confirmed that the factors controlling water quality in an individual lake are different from the factors that control water quality across lakes and that water quality is controlled by different factors in a highly-agricultural region as compared to a mostly-forested region. We also found little evidence that water quality has drastically changed in the last 25 years, although there is good evidence that lake nitrogen is mostly decreasing through time. Finally, we found much larger differences in lake water quality across regions than changes in individual lakes through time. The combination of these results point to the importance of monitoring many lakes across regions of different landscape contexts and including nitrogen as a sample parameter (sample sizes were much smaller for nitrogen than for other variables) to capture broad-scale variation in lake water quality and understand responses to global changes. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Our project was able to answer many complex environmental research questions through innovative research strategies such as: using big-data approaches for database development and analysis; using current team science approaches that leverage the knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines; and, using open-science approaches that make our research products available for future researchers to build off of in a way that saves federal funds. Our project approach can be a model for other multi-institution, interdisciplinary, broad-scale research projects to solve complex problems facing society. Our hope is that our database and the associated support tools and documentation will serve as a powerful resource and a foundation for future research and decision-making by a broad community of scientists, policy-makers, and natural resource managers.</span></p> <div><span><br /></span></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/22/2017<br>      Modified by: Emily&nbsp;H&nbsp;Stanley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1065818/1065818_10098903_1513954545128_WaterQualityLocations_v2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1065818/1065818_10098903_1513954545128_WaterQualityLocations_v2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Water Quality Sampling Locations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1065818/1065818_10098903_1513954545128_WaterQualityLocations_v2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Water Quality Sampling Locations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The location of all lakes in this study area (grey dots) and the lakes for which we have at least one water quality sample (red dots).</div> <div class="imageCredit">P.A.
