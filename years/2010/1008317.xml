<AbstractNarration>This large empirical study by a research team at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor is developing the theoretical foundations for mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) in three strands of work. The primary focus is on preservice and beginning teachers in the area of mathematics. The first strand includes a set of theory-building studies analyzing current understandings in the literature and current classroom practices. For this strand researchers map MKT by identifying the different aspects that constitute the construct. The second strand is an instrument-development project that began with some prior developed multiple-choice measures. The focus of this strand is developing new alternative assessment items and instruments using different formats that will be valid and reliable measures of MKT at teachers? different stages in their career. In the third strand, researchers are articulating a description of teachers' learning progressions over their careers as they develop mathematical knowledge for teaching. The project is guided by three goals:  (1) to systematically map the terrain of mathematical knowledge for teaching; (2) to develop alternative measures of MKT and analyze the data obtained; and (3) to conceptualize the trajectory of teachers? acquisition and use of MKT. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple methods are being employed to achieve the project goals. Three teams of researchers are working concurrently, each one devoted to addressing one of the three strands. All research teams are doing an extensive review of reported research and are drawing heavily from analyses of video records of mathematics lessons. Data from surveys administered nationally are being analyzed to help identify a trajectory of MKT for teachers? careers. In Years 1-3 nine beginning teachers and their classrooms are being observed and video tapped for five consecutive days at three points during the school year. Researchers are administering new assessment items and conducting cognitive interviews of 60 teachers to analyze the validity of and refine the items. Eight camps of multiple days are being conducted of multidisciplinary experts to review materials being developed (e.g., items and proposed trajectories) and to work collaboratively and independently to produce supportive materials. An external evaluator is collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to the research teams for both formative and summative purposes. The evaluator is guided by specific questions and will review products, video analyses, and the camps of scholars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main products that will be produced are a map of MKT, alternative assessments of MKT, and a professional learning trajectory for MKT. These products and findings are to be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, and multimedia content guides. As evidenced by the large dissemination and use of prior materials produced by this research team, this work will reach and influence a significant number of those in the mathematics education field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Common sense suggests that teachers who know more mathematics would be better at helping students learn math.  It turns out to be not that simple, however, for research has not corroborated that majoring in math or taking a lot of courses does in fact yield better teaching.  In the early 2000s, researchers did begin to uncover that there are specialized ways of knowing mathematics that correlate significantly with students? learning. This kind of specialized knowledge for teaching differs from mathematics typically taught in university mathematics courses. Teachers need to know the school curriculum flexibly and be able to explain it in accessible ways, and be able to hear and appreciate the mathematical thinking in children?s talk.     The Developing MKT project was designed to extend ideas about mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) by expanding both the scope of the research as well as the techniques for studying MKT. The goals were to conceptualize areas of MKT not previously explored, create new tools for identifying and measuring it, and articulate a trajectory for the mathematical education of teachers.  The Developing MKT project has refined understanding of MKT and established new lines of scholarship.  Developed a useful definition for "horizon content knowledge," a domain of MKT, which has stimulated new research by others in the field. It is also central to debates about the kinds of advanced mathematics useful in secondary teaching.  Identified key mathematical practices related to making connections and building theory, both of which arise in teaching.  This work has inspired new mathematics content courses taught at the University of Michigan as well as at several other sites.  Identified "mathematical tasks of teaching" and "pedagogical context" and their role in creating MKT instructional materials and assessments that can serve as a foundation for conceptualizing and measuring MKT not only across the United States but also internationally. Contributed to connecting the study of MKT with the nature and demands of equitable teaching, created prototype tasks for developing or assessing such knowledge, and collaborated with early career scholars concerned with equitable mathematics teaching to begin to conceptualize this important domain.  Explored the demands of "coordination" in teaching, and uncovered the special challenges in beginning teaching. We also identified "talking with a representation" (interactively using a diagram or model, together with language and gesture, to engage children?s attention and focus on key mathematical meaning) as a frequent and difficult task of teaching. Highlighted the fundamentally dynamic character of teaching, including the study of giving mathematical explanations, talking with a representation, and disrupting default deficit orientations to interpreting children?s mathematical competence, in ways that correct static interpretations of MKT.   A second contribution of the project has been the development of tools and techniques for the study of MKT and for building capacity to develop and assess it.  Adapted vignette development and analysis from the field of anthropology.  Used an argument-based framework for validity to describe the interaction between the design of measures and the development of constructs. This has helped to resolves tensions that emerge when developing measures in newly conceptualized domains (in collaboration with PIs from other NSF projects). Developed interview tasks/protocols for investigating the work of mathematical unpacking for several key elementary school topics.  Developed interview tasks/protocols for investigating less well-understood areas of the mathematical work of teaching and their MKT demands, adding to an understanding of the challenging work of developing MKT problems and providing models for advancing development.  Developed pre- and post- lesson interview protocols for beginning mathematics teaching, including video-cued recall techniques. Collected an extensive dataset of records of practice for beginning teaching (83 lessons taught by 13 teachers, grades 1-11, in urban settings) for inclusion in the Teaching and Learning Exploratory at the University of Michigan. Generated prototype tasks for developing and assessing MKT for equitable teaching and stimulated work of other scholars in this important area.  Used analyses of the design of MKT tasks and responses to produce a set of criteria supporting the development and review of MKT tasks.  Developed methodological innovations for decomposing teaching in ways that attend to ethical and practical challenges of studying instruction, reduce confounding of key variables, and lead to better alignment between theory and method.    Third, the project studied and conceptualized "beginning teaching of mathematics," identified and articulated its particular mathematical demands, and identified high-leverage mathematics topics and teaching practices crucial for beginning teaching. This included specifying mathematical-knowledge admission guidelines for teacher preparation, the mathematics teachers should know for licensure, and the mathematical foci appropriate for early career professional development. These results have been used to inform Michigan Department of Education standards for elementary school mathematics teaching.
