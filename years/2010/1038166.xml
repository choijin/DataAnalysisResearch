<AbstractNarration>The Maximizing Yield Through Integration (MYTI): Science and Math Education in the Context of a Disposing Society brings together NSF awards from the Math and Science Partnership (MSP), Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT), Center for Research and Education in Science and Technology (CREST), Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER), Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology (UMEB) and Geo-Internships via the Innovation through Institutional Integration themes of integrating research and education, broadening participation, and critical junctures.  Led by the University of Puerto Rico-RÃ­o Piedras (UPRRP), the project establishes a Center for Science and Mathematics Education (CSME) to integrate research and education by incorporating existing NSF-funded programs in the broad area of environmental sciences and science education.  The CSME will provide support to conduct research on science education and establish outreach opportunities with partnering K-12 schools, thus instituting a model for developing educational research incorporating up-to-date research from NSF-funded programs.  The Center will provide the infrastructure for the following: cooperative teaching approaches; pilot studies; internet resources; research in science education, including statistical support; and assessment tools, including a variety of surveys.  The Center will provide the infrastructure for developing cooperative teaching approaches, supporting pilot studies, support for internet resources and for research in science education, including statistics support, building survey support, and other assessment tools.  MYTI will broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities by increasing the number of Hispanic teachers and faculty that are proficient in the best teaching practices in mathematics and science education and improve the attitude of students at a critical juncture (7-12) towards STEM.  It will ultimately develop 48 master teachers, 18 during the first three years and 30 more teachers during years 4-5, who will serve in 25 partnering schools/towns throughout Puerto Rico.  In addition, it will support 12 scientists from UPRRP who will pursue science education as a scholarly activity.  By utilizing funded NSF projects that are at different points on the educational continuum, CSME will have a holistic effect on the pipeline, leading to increased numbers (yields) of students, particularly students underrepresented in STEM disciplines, entering careers in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

The CSMER produced interdisciplinary instructional units to develop high school science and math concepts in the context of one of the most pressing problems in PR &ndash;solid waste.  These units were used to provide professional development to teacher participants.  Two cohorts of teachers (master teachers (n=18) and regular teachers (n=28), respectively) were trained on these units and participated on a summer research apprenticeship.  All teacher participants showed statistically significant improvements in math and science content knowledge based on the instructional units.  All master teachers and 21 teachers from the second cohort transferred the acquired knowledge through the implementation of a project-based learning (PBL) activity into their courses.  Project topics included ?improving solid waste management?, ?creation of vegetable gardens?, and ?reuse of car tires?, among others. Evaluation of the projects using a rubric yielded mean scores of 86 % for master teachers and 89% for teachers from the second cohort.  These results suggest that teachers implemented well key elements of the PBL strategy.  In addition, teachers conducted action research to assess the effectiveness of their PBL.  The results of the teachers? research projects were disseminated at local or national meetings and published in a peer-reviewed journal (Fig. 2).   The CSMER also collaborated with 12 UPRRP faculty members to strengthen their scholarly activity and productivity on STEM education.  Most participants (12 faculty and 17 teachers) who received training and mentoring from Center staff, advanced from early stages in the development of a study to advanced stages of presentation and publication as documented using a 12-stage Research Productivity Progression.  We assessed the impact of our project in graduate students through their knowledge gain on evidence-based educational practices.  Graduate students (10), who collaborated in the creation of instructional units, showed a significant increase in knowledge of evidence-based educational practices. A second group (8), who coached teachers in the development of their PBLs, did not show significant changes in the survey scale; however, in open-ended responses reported that they learned about the educational process, and highlighted the experience of learning in a cross-disciplinary collaboration.

Broader Impacts:  As MYTI?s programmatic goals aimed to improve math and science education, the CSMER, as institutionalized, broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities by increasing the number of Hispanic teachers and faculty that are proficient in evidence-based teaching practices in math and science education.  Moreover, we have evidence that 7th -12th grade students impacted through MYTI, improve their attitude towards math and science.  Interestingly, students of master teachers and those of regular teachers showed different patterns of results in pre-post comparisons of their attitudes to math or science.  Master teachers? students showed gains in attitudes to the discipline their teachers integrated to their classes (but not to the one they teach), while those of regular teachers tended to show gains to the discipline their teachers regularly teach (Figs. 3, 4).
