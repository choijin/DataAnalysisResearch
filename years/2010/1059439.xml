<AbstractNarration>Network telescopes, which observe unsolicited Internet traffic sent to&lt;br/&gt;unassigned address space, are one of the few types of instrumentation&lt;br/&gt;that allow global visibility into a wide range of security-related events.&lt;br/&gt;CAIDA researchers are expanding their telescope instrumentation to enable&lt;br/&gt;researchers to exploit this unique global data source and improve our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of security-related events such as large-scale attacks and&lt;br/&gt;malware spread. This innovative shift in network monitoring addresses&lt;br/&gt;sevearal pervasive challenges in network traffic research: collection&lt;br/&gt;and storage, efficient curation, and privacy-protected sharing of large&lt;br/&gt;volumes of data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAIDA researchers are developing a taxonomy of observed traffic, including&lt;br/&gt;classes of DoS attacks, vulnerability scans, and malware spread.  Such&lt;br/&gt;a taxonomy facilitates real-time detection of events that merit more&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive measurement and analysis and notification of interested&lt;br/&gt;researchers. This project will also enable infrastructure for vetted&lt;br/&gt;researchers to run analysis programs approximately one hour after data&lt;br/&gt;collection. CAIDA has developed a privacy-sensitive data sharing framework&lt;br/&gt;that integrates privacy-enhancing technology with proven and standard&lt;br/&gt;privacy principles and obligations of data seekers and data providers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will contribute to developing early detection,&lt;br/&gt;reaction and mitigation strategies supporting the global fight against&lt;br/&gt;pervasive malware.  Creation of educational data kits out of telescope&lt;br/&gt;data samples will link this research to educational outcomes.  Most&lt;br/&gt;importantly, this project provides convenient remote access to a wealth&lt;br/&gt;of data, computing resources and Internet expertise aimed at supporting&lt;br/&gt;network security research.</AbstractNarration>
