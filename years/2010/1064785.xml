<AbstractNarration>This award focuses on problems in computational complexity theory, with the goal of clarifying the power and limitations of various important classes of algorithms (known as "complexity classes").  Complexity  classes provide the best tools currently available for understanding the computational complexity of real-world computational problems.  Part of the award supports a collaboration with researchers at the Czech Academy of Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kolmogorov complexity measures the amount of "information" in a finite string, and also provides a mathematical definition of what it means for a string to be "random".  Although the Kolmogorov complexity of an arbitrary string cannot be computed, there are strong connections between the (non-computable) notion of randomness and questions about the circuit size required to compute various functions.  This award will support an investigation into recent indications that computational complexity classes can be characterized in terms of efficient access to the Kolmogorov complexity function, thus possibly opening a new portal for techniques from the theory of computability and algorithmic randomness to be applied in complexity theory.  The award will also support an investigation into the limits of computation by arithmetic circuits.  (In an arithmetic circuit, data can only be manipulated by arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication; operations that directly access the individual bits of numeric data are not supported.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goals of research in computational complexity, if finally achieved, will have profound impact on the society---for instance, by providing firm mathematical underpinnings to public-key cryptography, which currently rests upon many unproven conjectures.  This research activity offers concrete plans for incremental progress toward this long-range goal.  The award also supports graduate education.  As such, it will assist with training new researchers and educators.  The research results will be broadly disseminated, not only through journal publication but also through survey articles in various venues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Some problems have fast programs, and others are so difficult to compute that they are intractable.  The task of computational complexity theory is to develop tools to identify which problems are hard to compute.  Over the decades, a rich structure of "complexity classes" has been developed, which helps classify problems according to their complexity.  There is a growing consensus among mathematicians that the underlying task of complexity theory is one of the most difficult challenges in all of mathematics.  The research supported by this grant made progress on several aspects of computational complexity theory.    Twenty-five publications acknowledge the support of this grant, including two dissertations, 13 journal articles, eight conference papers, and two book chapters.  (Two of the conference papers received "best paper" awards.)  Here we describe just a few of the main thrusts of the research.   Derandomization is the study of how to replace probabilistic algorithms by efficient deterministic algorithms.  It has been known for several years that derandomization is possible if very strong lower bounds can be proved on the complexity of certain computational problems.  The PI and his student and co-authors were able to show several settings in which derandomization follows from much weaker complexity assumptions than had been known previously.   Derandomization techniques also turned out to be quite useful in forging new links between computational complexity theory and the field of algorithmic information theory (also known as "Kolmogorov complexity").  Kolmogorov complexity provides a mathematically-rigorous notion of what it means for a bit string to be "random".  In a series of papers supported by this grant, theorems were proven that show that the computational power provided by access to this (undecidable) set of "random" strings corresponds quite closely to some important and well-studied complexity classes.  In particular, these theorems led to the formulation of the conjecture that BPP (the class of problems that can be solved efficiently by probabilistic algorithms) can be characterized in terms of access to the set of random strings.  Such a characterization would provide a surprising link between the fields of computational complexity theory and computability theory.   Derandomization techniques also were used, in order to clarify the complexity of a problem known as the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP), which has been the focus of complexity-theoretic research for four decades, and which has close connections to the study of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity.  The PI and his coauthor proved new lower bounds on the complexity of MCSP (among other things, giving the first demonstration that an efficient algorithm for MCSP would yield an efficient algorithm for the Graph Isomorphism problem).  Another paper by the PI and coauthors provides new consequences if MCSP were to be NP-complete.   Other investigations supported by the grant yielded   (a) a characterization of the complexity of context-free languages in terms of a restricted form of nondeterminism, known as "symmetric computation".  (b) a characterization of the complexity of Boolean formula satisfiability on formulae of bounded tree-width, in terms of Boolean circuits with restricted fan-in.  (c) a demonstration of the limitations of a model of arithmetic computation (known as a bounded-width algebraic branching program).  (d) new characterizations of two circuit complexity classes (ACC^1 and TC^1) in terms of arithmetic circuits with restricted fan-in of the addition gates.  (e) a new division algorithm, which can be implemented using fewer layers of threshold circuitry than previous algorithms.  This yields new upper bounds on the complexity of computing the bits of the binary representation of algebraic numbers.  (f) new bounds, showing that a randomly-chosen tautology will have no short proof in a particular proof system that had been defined a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
