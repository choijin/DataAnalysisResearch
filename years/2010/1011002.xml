<AbstractNarration>Global events such as mass extinctions have lasting impacts on biodiversity:  Actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes) are currently the most abundant and diverse group of living vertebrates; however, this situation only arose after previously dominant groups suffered major losses coincident with the Paleozoic Hangenberg mass extinction event. This project will examine whether: (1) the Hangenberg extinction event, associated with climatic changes, permanently restructured global vertebrate biodiversity; (2) actinopterygians underwent a large-scale radiation after an extinction bottleneck; (3) actinopterygian diversification occurred in response to vacated niches in post-extinction ecosystems, leading to the widespread evolution of novel functional morphologies. This project will assemble comprehensive vertebrate occurrence databases, reconstruct new phylogenies, and analyze the occupation/reoccupation of vertebrate morphospace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigation of actinopterygian evolution is vital for interpreting current vertebrate biodiversity because these fishes are a major component of modern ecosystems. Phylogenetic, morphological, and diversity data will be placed in open repositories, providing starting points for further studies of vertebrate macroevolution. The results will be valuable for designing science curricula and other accessible programs because of paleontology's broad appeal - instilling in the general public an appreciation for broader concepts including evolution, biodiversity loss and turnover, and large-scale global change.</AbstractNarration>
