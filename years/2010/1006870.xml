<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract: Despite their natural abundance and wide industrial applications, such as red blood cells and clay, disks are least studied compared to spheres and rods. This condensed matter physics project will establish the long waited model micro-disks using unique methodology, shape transformation of liquid crystal emulsions and exfoliation of layered inorganic crystals. Micro-disks will be mass-produced with unprecedented uniformity in size and shape, and unprecedented flexibility in the control of size, shape, size-polydispersity and aspect ratio. Underlining the unique flow characteristics and applications of disk materials, the discotic liquid crystal phase transitions will be investigated experimentally and theoretically regarding their dependence on inter-disk interactions, disk aspect ratio and polydispersity. The achievement of controlled organization of discotic molecules and colloids will impact industries such as pharmaceuticals, medicine, oil refining, chemical process, solar energy, nano-composite engineering and photonics. Colloidal discotics will help to unleash the educational power of complex fluids as models of atomic discotic liquid crystals and tangible elements of the macroscopic world. This project will use visualization and multimedia tools to train graduates, to build educational modules for undergraduates, and to attract k-12 students into scientific research. It will also establish collaborations around the world to enhance the global impact of its research and education program.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: This condensed matter physics project will use unique methodology (shape transformation of liquid crystal emulsions and exfoliation of layered inorganic crystals) to mass-produce micro-disks with unprecedented uniformity in size and shape, and unprecedented flexibility in the control of size, shape, size-polydispersity and aspect ratio. The discotic liquid crystal phase transitions isotropic or liquid-like to orientationally order or nematic (I-N), nematic to crystal (N-C), and nematic to ordered layer-like or smectic (N-S) will be investigated experimentally. The nematic-to-smectic (N-S) transition is one of the main unsolved problems in statistical physics. Theory will be constructed and experimentally tested regarding the dependence of phase transitions on inter-disk interactions (screened electrostatic repulsion, depletion attraction), aspect ratio and polydispersity. The achievement of controlled organization of discotic molecules and colloids will impact industries such as pharmaceuticals, medicine, oil refining, chemical process, solar energy, nano-composite engineering and photonics. Colloidal discotics will help to unleash the educational power of complex fluids as models of atomic discotic liquid crystals and tangible elements of the macroscopic world. This project will use visualization and multimedia tools to train graduates, to build educational modules for undergraduates, and to attract K-12 students into scientific research.

By unprecedented control of nanoplate morphology (shape, size, thickness and their distribution), this project created a model system to develop discotic liquid crystal research to its full fledge. The project has yielded 15 peered reviewed Journal publications, and contributed to the development of one technology "nanoplate surfactants" based on the surface modification. It has contributed to the further understanding, engineering and utilization of the soft condensed matter. The project has revealed the control role of aspect ratio (thickness over size) in the phase behavior of colloidal disks, i.e., the formation of isotropic (I) phase , Nematic (N) and other possible liquid crystal phases, including twisted nematic (N*), Twisted Grain Boundary (TGB), tilted Smectic (SC), and Smetic (SA). It has discovered that size polydispersity broadens the I-N transition.

The project has fabricated temperature responsive disk using gamma-ray initiated graft of PNIPAM on the disk surface and discovered soft disks can form liquid crystal at less-degree of anisotropy than charged disks.  The nanoplate surfactants developed (Janus and Gemini nanoplates) are ideal surface active particles, having the highest "interfacial area per atom", for making Pickering emulsions and foams, which has applications in enhanced oil recovery, fire fighting for LNG and others, nano-encapsulation for Phase changing materials, drugs and vaccines. The achievement of controlled organization of discotic molecules and colloids will impact industries such as pharmaceuticals, medicine, oil refining, chemical process, solar energy, nano-composite engineering and photonics.

All of them have the hands-on experience on scientific research for the first time. They are in close interaction with the graduate students and other group members, very good introduction to their possible graduate studies.
