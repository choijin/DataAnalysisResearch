<AbstractNarration>This NSF award by the Biosensing program supports the development of novel types of flexible and programmable nucleic acid based sensors in order to specifically detect many important RNAs at the sub-micro scale.  By amplifying complementary RNA (cRNA), a non-biological derivative of the target, contamination is avoided and high specificity and sensitivity are achieved.  The cRNA is connected to a receptor and an enhancer by Watson-Crick nucleotide base pairing to allow maximum flexibility in target selection.  To boost sensitivity of RNA detection, the investigators will use DNA linked gold nanoparticles and RNA aptamer networks as enhancers. The PIs will build a robust microfluidic system that incorporates acoustic sensors for wireless detection and differentiation of RNAs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent developments in molecular biology have revealed that RNAs not only transfer genetic information from DNA to protein making machinery, but also act to regulate other vital processes in higher organisms.  The tools the PI and his team will develop will allow investigators to selectively detect a wide range of these microRNAs in applications ranging from basic discovery sciences, to environmental engineering, and medicine. The PI will integrate research into undergraduate and graduate education, and work with K-12 teachers recruited from the surrounding community.  The project will provide excellent opportunities for interdisciplinary education and training.</AbstractNarration>

Our work produced two novel species of RNAs. One of them we call complementary RNA or, in short, cRNA.
