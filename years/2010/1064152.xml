<AbstractNarration>1064152&lt;br/&gt;Castillo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support for the workshop titled ?The World Alliance on Turbulence and Wind Energy?, to be held at the Universidad del Turabo in Puerto Rico during February of 2011. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stated objectives of the workshop are to 1) Promote international collaborations between the United States, Europe and Australia; 2) Indentify major pressing questions on turbulence and wind energy; 3) Promote technology transfer by means of collaborations with industry and via creation of an Incubator in Puerto Rico on Renewable Energy; 4) Demonstrate the connection between fundamental knowledge with applications in wind energy; 5) Promote graduate studies for underrepresented students in the area of wind energy and turbulence; and 6) Establish the ?First World Wall-Turbulence Meeting? with the purpose of building an international collaboration to address key questions in turbulence and wind energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will uniquely address the following scientific, engineering, and energy policy topics at intersection of atmospheric turbulence and wind energy:  1) Design and Optimization; 2) Grid Integration, Economics of Wind Energy, and Policy; 3) Offshore Wind Energy; 4) WE Arrays and their Effect on the Micro-climate; and 5)  Atmospheric Boundary Layer and High Reynolds Number Flows.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has the potential to promote innovation for wind energy in an international context, and is designed to inspire graduate students, particularly from under-represented groups, to pursue interdisciplinary study in science and engineering topics at the nexus of atmospheric science and wind engineering.  Towards this end, the workshop will aim to have more than 50% of student participants from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A major impact of this event was that a series of follow up symposiums on wind energy and turbulence are need it and more engagement from industry is necessary (mainly to see their major challenges and build partnerships). It was clear that there is a need for developing workforce programs on wind energy (from undergraduate to graduate level degrees), specifically in Puerto Rico. At the same time participants expressed the need to access to data from unique research facilities to understand the wake-wake interaction in wind farms. More importantly, there is great need in having access to full-scale data of wind farms for the scientific community to test, validate new wake models and training. The major challenge affecting wind farms is our lack of understanding of the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer and wake-wake interaction in large arrays. Moreover, discussions among team members in this workshop led to new collaborations that resulted in three new projects.  The major pressing questions on turbulence and wind energy identified are given as follows:   (i) How does turbulence in the wake affect the entrainment of kinetic energy into the region where the wind turbines are located, and what are the relevant flow structures that dominate such transport/entrainment?  (ii) Are there particular arrangements of wind turbines in the array that increase such entrainment and capacity factor of wind farms?  (iii) How do different wind turbine layouts affect the power output generated by the wind farm, specifically as one changes the rotor design and how does one optimize the entire power/economics of the wind farm?  (iv) How are uncertainties from a single turbine propagates over the entire wind farm system, and subsequently into the electric grid and cost of energy?
