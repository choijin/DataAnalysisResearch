<AbstractNarration>The investigator and his collaborators are organizing the 2010 IMA participating institutes graduate summer school. &lt;br/&gt;Additional support from the NSF will enable the investigators to bring in students from non-IMA affiliated &lt;br/&gt;institutions  and invite domestic and international speakers to give lectures. The 2010 summer school on computational wave propagation covers three different topics: advanced numerical methods for full wave propagation, contemporary asymptotic methods for wave equations, and applications of wave equations. The part of the advanced numerical methods for full wave propagation will be led by Jean-Claude Nedelec of Polytechnique, France. &lt;br/&gt;The part of the contemporary asymptotic methods for wave equations will be led by Robert Burridge. The part of applications of wave equations will consist of roughly twelve lectures by active researchers in wave propagation. &lt;br/&gt;This is a unique and timely synthesis of disciplines that will position future researchers for the next step in &lt;br/&gt;computational wave propagation. In turn, this will have long-term impact in applied mathematics, engineering &lt;br/&gt;and industrial applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IMA graduate summer school has a 19-year record of excellent programs that have jump-started the &lt;br/&gt;careers of many young mathematicians. Average attendance for these events in recent years has been &lt;br/&gt;58 participants, including  organizers and speakers. The 2010 graduate summer school brings students &lt;br/&gt;together with outstanding researchers in an intimate and intensive setting which will lead students to &lt;br/&gt;the frontiers of mathematical research. Students have a chance to get to know world-class mathematicians &lt;br/&gt;on a less formal basis than their interactions with the faculty at their home institutions. Feedback from &lt;br/&gt;participants of past programs has been unequivocally positive. The IMA summer schools are an important &lt;br/&gt;option for graduate students in mathematics as they reach for advanced degrees, and they are an attractive &lt;br/&gt;feature of affiliate institutions' graduate programs. The IMA and its affiliates are particularly committed to &lt;br/&gt;helping to advance the careers of mathematics students from under-represented groups. In addition, the &lt;br/&gt;focus of the 2010 graduate summer school is on computational wave propagation which has many important &lt;br/&gt;applications in nanotechnology, material sciences, and radar technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The rapid growth over the last two decades in the speed and data  handling capability of high performance computers has transformed the methodology of scientific  investigation and industrial applications in the field of computational wave propagation.  Indeed, computational wave propagation has emerged as a fundamental, vigorously growing  technology for modeling, design, and development in areas ranging from radar, sonar,  seismic imaging, medical imaging, submarine detection, stealth technology,  remote sensing and electronics to microscopy and nanotechnology. The significant  recent applications of the wave propagation technology have driven the need for more  advanced mathematical models and numerical algorithms.  The 2010 program on computational wave propagation covered three different topics:  advanced numerical methods for solving full-wave models of wave equations; contemporary  asymptotic or semi-classical methods for wave equations in the high-frequency regime;  industrial and military applications such as in nano-optics, radar, seismic imaging,  and medical imaging.  The 2010 summer program and its follow-up two-day workshop on computational wave propagation were hosted by the Michigan State University,    The part of advanced numerical methods for full wave propagation was led by Jean-Claude Nedelec of Polytechnique, France, who focused on fundamentals of variational principles for wave equations,  notions of well-posedness and regularity, and finite elements for wave equations.  The part of  contemporary asymptotic methods for wave equations was led by Prof. Robert Burridge.  The part of applications of wave equations consisted of roughly ten active researchers in wave propagation.   This was a unique and timely synthesis of disciplines that would position future researchers for the next step in computational wave propagation that will have long-term impacts in both applied mathematics, engineering and industrial applications.
