<AbstractNarration>This project involves the interaction between set theory and C*-algebras.&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal is to settle old outstanding open problems using set&lt;br/&gt;theoretic tools, which could involve proving independence results.&lt;br/&gt;Specific problems that could be addressed include the following: Naimark's problem&lt;br/&gt;about the existence of nontrivial C*-algebras with only one irreducible&lt;br/&gt;representation; Anderson's conjecture about pure states restricting to&lt;br/&gt;pure states on diagonal masas; the Kadison-Singer problem that has many&lt;br/&gt;equivalent formulations and is significant to several areas of mathematics;&lt;br/&gt;the Stone-Weierstrass problem about the existence of proper subalgebras&lt;br/&gt;that separate pure states; the problem of Brown, Douglas, and Fillmore&lt;br/&gt;about the existence of an automorphism of the Calkin algebra taking the&lt;br/&gt;image of the unilateral shift to its adjoint; and Arveson's problem about&lt;br/&gt;the existence of sufficiently many boundary representations for&lt;br/&gt;nonseparable operator systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C*-algebras, a class of mathematical structures that were originally&lt;br/&gt;studied primarily for applications in physics, have over time found&lt;br/&gt;substantial applications in a broad variety of areas of both mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and physics. Much current work in this field focuses on developing&lt;br/&gt;further connections to these other areas, but fundamental questions of&lt;br/&gt;basic theory remain open.  In the past decade a series of long-standing&lt;br/&gt;open problems in C*-algebras have been settled using, in an essential way,&lt;br/&gt;techniques from the seemingly unrelated area of set theory. This was a&lt;br/&gt;surprising connection that has enriched both fields.  Further work in&lt;br/&gt;this direction is expected to lead to a better understanding of C*-algebras &lt;br/&gt;at a fundamental level.</AbstractNarration>
