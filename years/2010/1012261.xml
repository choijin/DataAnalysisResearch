<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program at the National Science Foundation supports the work of Professor Darren Hamilton at Mount Holyoke College concerning the development and utilization of a new approach for the thermodynamically controlled assembly of molecular architectures. This research builds upon the viability of classic conjugate addition chemistry to establish, under reversible conditions, carbon frameworks of elaborate overall structure. In particular, the formation of topologically complex organic molecules-rotaxanes and catenanes-is facilitated via this approach, opening a straightforward route to materials with potentially valuable imaging and sensing properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from this award students at Mount Holyoke, an undergraduate only women's college, work on projects that span organic synthesis, structural analysis, and investigations of the properties of new materials. A premium is placed on establishing concise, inexpensive, modular methods of broad general applicability to the preparation of materials for contemporary problems such as sensing and imaging. Contributions to US competitiveness in these fields is derived from both the specific research undertaken with support from this award, and from the preparation of new generations of undergraduates trained in emerging areas of synthetic and materials chemistry. Collaborations with local high school teachers are supported with the intention of drawing illustrative components of the research into laboratory teaching.</AbstractNarration>
