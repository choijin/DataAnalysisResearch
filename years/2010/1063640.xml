<AbstractNarration>The objective of this EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to investigate the feasibility of using flexoelectric (FE) structures for a new class of strain gradient sensor (SGS) that can detect damage at a very early stage and in-situ monitor the damage initiation and progression. Advances in sensors are key enabling technologies to the realization of structure health monitoring (SHM) capability. New sensing materials and sensing concepts are in critical need for in-situ monitoring early damage that often occurs near the high strain gradient areas. Such a FE sensor enables high-sensitive sensing of strain gradient which is most sensitive measurand near the localized damage location. In particular, FE micro-composites with feature sizes ranged from mm to &lt; 10 microns will be fabricated and tested under strain, for the first time, for strain gradient sensing. Scale effect study on FE microstructures will also be performed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will lay the groundwork for a new class of strain gradient sensor (SGS) which will significantly advance scientific and engineering knowledge in the area of structure damage sensing technology and greatly enhance SHM capability of early damage detection and in-situ structural health monitoring. This research will integrate the educational activities in curricular developments by enriching a new graduate course in Smart Nanostructures and Nanofabrications and professional workshops for introducing nanofabrication for K-12 students. This effort would also carry this multidisciplinary bonus to a postdoctoral researcher, graduate and undergraduate students and into the outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>
