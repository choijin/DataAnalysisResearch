<AbstractNarration>1065545&lt;br/&gt;Fouad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports an international research experience for students in a project involving a team at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, led by Dr. Fouad H. Fouad in collaboration with a team of Egyptian scientists led by Dr. Moustafa El-Demirdash, Chairman, Housing and Building Research Center (HBRC), Cairo, Egypt.   The project will support researchers, graduate and undergraduate students from the U.S. universities for carrying research projects on sustainable green building design and construction.  The project will support 18 undergraduate and graduate students to conduct research in Egypt in coordination and with mentorship from the staff at the HBRC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The program focuses on the science and technology of sustainable green building design and construction. The urgency of this research is dictated by the rising cost of energy, the limited natural resources, and the need to protect our environment. The seven specific research projects proposed for student research will pioneer the development of new concrete materials and building systems for solving urgent environmental challenges. These projects will advance new knowledge and discoveries and will help bring about breakthroughs in the global challenge of affordable and energy-efficient construction materials and systems.  There is a pressing need to educate a cadre of engineers and scientist that are capable of performing in an international research environment. The PI has developed strong working relationships with several universities and research centers in Egypt, which will contribute to the success of the proposed program.  In addition to the international research experience, the IRES students will be able to enhance their professional network and build future international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The project directly addresses the challenging issue of environmental sustainability and carbon released into the air. The seven specific research projects proposed will contribute to the current building construction practice by introducing low-cost, energy-efficient materials and systems. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and on a dedicated program Web site.  The knowledge obtained through this research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses in UAB Civil Engineering. Future engineers will thus be made aware of the progress in the area of sustainable environment.  With 40% minority student body and active partnerships with historically black colleges and universities, UAB is in a position to attract underrepresented groups to research careers in science and engineering through the proposed project. It is anticipated that the project will lead to new research exchanges and partnerships with HBRC and universities in Egypt. This will broaden UAB's capabilities for providing global research training and education to U.S. faculty and students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ RESEARCH THEME  Through this NSF-IRES program, the UAB Sustainable Smart Cities Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, was awarded a 3-year-grant to develop an international research experience focused on the theme of Sustainable Green Building Design and Construction.  INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS  The international research experience took place during the summers of 2015, 2016 and 2017. Each year the selected students traveled for two weeks to Egypt and two additional weeks to a European country. The main international host for each of the three summers has been the Housing and Building National Research Center (HBRC) in Cairo, Egypt.  Summer 2015 -  the students traveled to The Netherlands for two weeks and the host was composed of several environmental related companies. Summer 2016 - the students stayed in the UK for two weeks and the host was our partner institution Staffordshire University. Summer 2017 - the students traveled to Germany and the main host was OTH Technical Institute-Weiden together with our industry partner, Europoles LLC.    The students continued working on the European site on the same projects they had started working at HBRC, with the objective of getting a wider perspective on their research work.  OBJECTIVES  The main objectives that we aimed to achieve through this international research experience program were the following:  Provide the students with a hands-on international education experience in the emerging area of sustainable green building design and construction; Engage the students in meaningful research under the guidance of U.S. and international mentors;  Allow students to create a network of international contacts in order to promote future collaborations; Expose U.S. students to foreign cultures, improve their communication skills, boost their confidence, and provide them with the tools necessary to adapt to and succeed in a global environment; Promote diversity by engaging students from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in science, technology, and engineering.   STUDENTS AND RESEARCH PROJECTS  Eight undergraduate and graduate students participated in each IRES program. Each year the students were assigned a research project in the area of Sustainable Green Building Design and Construction. The students were also assigned a mentor from the U.S. as well as one mentor from the international host in Egypt. The students worked in groups of two on each project. The following research projects were undertaken by the students during the respective years:  2015:  Green Wall Applications: Toshka, Egypt Building Envelope Systems around the World Strength Performance of Recycled Aggregate Concrete with Class C Fly Ash Green Building Codes in Egypt   2016:   Sustainable Affordable Housing Design Assessment of the Green Building Code Design and Construction Provisions Renewable Energy Sources and Applications Green Construction Practices and Technologies   2017:  Development of Green Utility Poles for Electric Distribution  Innovative Energy Solutions for Residential Buildings Green Building Materials  Advances in Renewable Energy Technologies   ACCOMPLISHMENTS  The students successfully completed research projects and presented their findings in professional reports and presentations to faculty, mentors, and industry partners. The students were able to incorporate educational experiences across two countries into successful projects related to sustainable building design and construction. At the end of each IRES offering, the students reported increased confidence in interacting with people from different cultures and presenting to an international audience. Among the main accomplishments, the students learned the key aspects needed to have a successful international research project, including project planning, execution, review, and revision.  Throughout the program, we have successfully recruited women and minority students. Half of all participants over the three year program have been women and a quarter have been minority students.

Additionally, we have disseminated the research results through a variety of media including:  Program website Two Final presentations events hosted by the Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering where all the students had the opportunity to talk about their experience as well as to present their research findings Two promotional videos   CONCLUSION   Overall, this international research experience for students has been a success for UAB as well as for our overseas partners. The students have gained valuable research experience in the area sustainable green building design and construction at the same time that they have acquired a global perspective, by being exposed to engineering innovations and practices in different countries and cultures, and created a network of international contacts in order to promote future collaborations.
