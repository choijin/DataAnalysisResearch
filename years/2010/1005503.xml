<AbstractNarration>Developing an understanding of, and a predictive capability for, strongly correlated electron systems (SCES), is a rapidly evolving field that relies critically on faster computation for continued progress. SCES form the basis of crucial materials capabilities, including high temperature superconductivity, nuclear fuels, new classes of thermoelectrics, and the exotic and promising behavior seen in cold atomic gases. SCES are difficult materials to model theoretically because of the highly time-dependent fluctuations of their electronic constituents.  An important emerging technology is the multicore processor, where an increasingly large number of CPUs ("cores") are juxtaposed on a single chip and thus are extremely closely coupled.  The resulting (expected) speedup in computational throughput comprises a promising path to sidestep the well publicized breakdown of Moore's law in semiconductor technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the development of advanced computational physics methods, "Quantum Monte Carlo" and "Density Functional Theory," for studying SCES properties.  The capabilities of these new approaches will be greatly enhanced by the formulation of efficient strategies for their implementation on emerging multicore processors.  This work crosses the intellectual boundary between condensed matter and atomic physics, and also between physics, applied mathematics, and computer science.   The applications will explore effects of interactions on novel quantum states of matter which arise from magnetic, metal-insulator, and superconducting transitions.  A particular project focus will be on the effect of spatial inhomogeneities ("defects") on ordered phases of quantum systems.  In addition to advancing research in computational physics and materials science, this work has broader impacts to training graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;research tools.  The Principal Investigators have also a substantial effort in involving undergraduate students and even high school students in research, which they will continue with this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Project Outcomes Report for the General Public  "Quantum Monte Carlo Using Multicore Processors:   Enabling Simulations in Inhomogeneous Environments"   Profs. Zhaojun Bai, Warren Pickett, Richard Scalettar  University of California, Davis  The properties of solids, for example whether they are magnetic, whether they conduct electricity, and the nature of their crystal structure, are determined by the laws of quantum mechanics.  These laws, although well known, are very difficult to solve for more than a few particles.  To get exact results, physicists often resort to large-scale computation.  Our project involved the development and application of numerical methods to compute the properties of materials which exhibit novel magnetic and transport properties, including, for example, solids where the electron energy has an unusual relation on momentum, and others where there are regular or irregular sites with missing atoms.  These studies are particularly challenging, and so we explored the use of multicore processors to speed up the simulations.  Our codes now can run more than ten times faster than previously, and allow us to address important new problems in the quantum properties of materials.  We achieved this speed-up through a collaborative effort of physicists and computer scientists.  Seventeen research papers were published documenting the advances in computational algorithms and their applications to solid state physics.  Codes which were developed are available for open use by the general scientific community.  Undergraduate and graduate education were also a vital part of our project.  Three advanced degrees (two in physics and one in computer science) resulted from the work undertaken in this grant. Undergraduate students were co-authors on several of the research papers, and learned important computer and materials science skills .
