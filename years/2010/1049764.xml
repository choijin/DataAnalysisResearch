<AbstractNarration>Three workshops are designed for women in cognitive science, especially women in the early stages of their academic career. Research and economic analyses suggest that the impact of the economic crisis will be more detrimental for females than for males. The workshops focus on negotiation techniques to create opportunities and optimize mechanisms to sustain research visibility and productivity. A second focus is on grant application writing for predoctoral, postdoctoral, and early career scientists. Workshops will take place at the biannual meetings of the Psychonomic Society and at the Cognitive Science Society. The workshops will take the form of a public forum with invited speaker-panelists to initiate discussion about best practices for the professional advancement of women in cognitive science at the individual and institutional level. By partnering with these established societies, the workshops will maximize the outreach potential to a group that continues to be underrepresented in senior academic positions in the cognitive sciences.</AbstractNarration>
