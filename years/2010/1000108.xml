<AbstractNarration>This award will allow for a combined experimental and theoretical study of hierarchical surfaces exhibiting the "lotus effect".  The main experimental objectives are to prepare hierarchical surfaces that exhibit superhydrophobicity, self-cleaning and drag reduction, and to optimize the durability of these surfaces to identify which fabrication techniques and materials can potentially withstand real world applications. Functional testing will be conducted on the durable surfaces coated on glass windows and solar panels to evaluate their water repellency and durability. To better understand the experimental results, the theoretical basis of how hierarchical roughness governs the wetting regime transitions, contact angle hysteresis, the length scale dependence of the contact angle, and dynamic effects will be investigated through mathematical modeling.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The insights generated from this study will further advance the use of biomimetic surfaces for various applications where both energy efficiency and mechanical reliability are crucial. Since superhydrophobic surfaces can be used in diverse applications such as windows, windshields, solar panels, textiles, ships, micro/nanochannels, among others, eliminating the need for cleaning will reduce energy usage.  Since the hydrophobicity of a surface affects the capillary force, new ways of energy conversion, such as the microscale capillary engine, will be further developed.   Identifying the processes and materials that improve the mechanical reliability of these surfaces will lead to immediate commercial applications. The nature of this research project will benefit society in general by furthering the interactions in the nanotechnology community. This research project will also enhance interest in science and engineering among high school students though seminars and lab visits.</AbstractNarration>
