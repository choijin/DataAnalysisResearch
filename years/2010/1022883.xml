<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on Learning Through Service (LTS), a pedagogical method that combines academic learning with service. Engaging investigators from five diverse institutions, the project are invoking a 4D Process (Discover, Distill, Design, Disseminate) to evaluate the impacts on faculty currently engaged in LTS efforts and to empower additional faculty to implement LTS.  Major activities that are being undertaken include surveying and interviewing engaged faculty; convening  a meeting of experts in LTS program/course designs, implementations, and assessments; conducting intensive faculty training workshops on LTS that lead to new LTS efforts at course and program levels; and sustaining faculty engagement via a continued dissemination of efforts.  Assessment research methodologies (development and use) are being integrated throughout these activities. The project engages faculty through systemic implementation and support for LTS in engineering education. The projects expands the use of LTS in engineering education and highlight LTS as a viable research endeavor and scholarly activity. The project identifies challenges and facilitators to LTS for different faculty and institution types.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ GOALS  The project focuses on Learning Through Service (LTS), a pedagogical approach integrating academic learning with service.  Involving investigators from five diverse institutions, the goals of the project are to:  (1) Evaluate the impacts on faculty engaged in LTS efforts and to empower additional faculty to implement LTS design, management, and assessment methodologies in their LTS efforts.  (2) Engage engineering faculty nationally in systemic implementation and support for LTS efforts in engineering education.  (3) Identify research-grounded benefits and challenges to LTS efforts for faculty with varying backgrounds and institutions.  MAJOR ACTIVITIES  As a collaborative effort, there are several major activities that have been accomplished:  (1) Development and administration of a faculty survey to understand the current state of LTS effort across engineering faculty, including LTS experts, LTS novices, and non-LTS users.  (2) Interviewing faculty engaged in LTS efforts to gain in-depth insights into the benefits, challenges, design, management, and assessment activities of their efforts.  (3) Conducting intensive faculty training workshops (over 150 faculty impacted) for LTS experts, LTS novices, and non-LTS users as a means of engaging to build a community of practice and share the knowledge base of LTS design, management, and assessment methods and strategies.  (4) Sustaining LTS faculty engagement via a variety and continued dissemination effort.  KEY PUBLICATIONS  Pierrakos, O., Nagel, R., Pappas, E., Nagel, J., Moran, T., Barrella, E., &amp; Panizo, M.
