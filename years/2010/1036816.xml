Williams (MIT), Carla Gomes (Cornell) and Thomas Diettrich (Oregon State) based upon the following premise:  In order to foster and perform research in the new area of Computational Sustainability, a vibrant research community must be created that crosses both international and disciplinary boundaries. The NSF Expedition called Computational Sustainability: Computational Methods for a Sustainable Environment, Economy, and Society establishes a catalyst for this, while the highly successful CompSust09 conference, held last June at Cornell University offered a crucial step towards expanding this community well beyond the participating members of the Expedition.  The 2nd International Conference on Computational Sustainability was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge MA, on June 28-30, 2010. The selection of MIT was due to its demonstrated commitment to sustainability, for example through its cross campus efforts in Energy, Transportation and the Environment. Our objectives for this conference included the establishment of a sustained community and expanded participation to major international institutions and disciplines that pertain to computation applied to problems of sustainability.  Participants included representatives from national and international research institutions, non-profit organizations, and government agencies. The conference organizers sought and received funds through this grant that supported organization and encouragement of greater participation in the conference by graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and junior researchers, including junior faculty, who otherwise lacked the financial resources to travel to Cambridge for the conference. This was administered through participation in the Doctorial Consortium. Conference Organization  The CompSust conference focused on computational methods for balancing environmental, economic, and societal needs for a sustainable future. The program included talks, discussions, and poster sessions, as well as several workshops.  The organization committee for Compsust09 last year included James Allen (University of Rochester), Thomas Dietterich (Oregon State University), Mary Lou Zeeman (Bowdoin College), and from Cornell University, Antonio Bento, Jon Conrad, Evan Cooch, Carla Gomes, John Guckenheimer,  Ashish Sabharwal, Bart Selman, and David Shmoys.  Formal presentations outlined the challenges of using global resources in a sustainable manner while improving overall quality of life, addressed the theory and computational techniques used to study and provide solutions to computational problems for balancing environmental, economic, and societal needs for a sustainable future, and presented innovative applications of these theories and techniques to decisions and technologies affecting the balance of environmental, economic, and societal needs for a sustainable existence.  More specifically, the conference investigated the major problem domains that impact global resource usage, those technologies and processes that offer the greatest opportunity to increase sustainability in these domains, and the fundamental computational methods that support these technologies and processes. Problem domains that have a significant impact on resource usage, and hence sustainability include energy management, housing and infrastructure, transportation (both personal and freight), and management of natural resources (agriculture, forests, fisheries, water, and sewage). Problems related to improving the quality of our natural environment will also be covered, including environmental monitoring, species migration and distribution, and management of reserves.  Finally, the central focus of the conference was the identification, research and a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
