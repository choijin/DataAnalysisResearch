<AbstractNarration>AST-1010033/1009908&lt;br/&gt;Primack/Klypin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of the stellar mass in the Universe lies in galactic spheroids, which also host supermassive black holes (SMBH).  The origin of these key structures can be clarified through the interplay of new multi-wavelength survey observations and improved theory, essential for guiding and interpreting the observations.  This research focuses on the growth of cosmic structure and on the two opposing effects of early, efficient star formation, and the quenching of this process in massive dark-matter halos, which together govern the formation of blue and red galaxies.  This project should discriminate between galaxy spheroid buildup by cold gas inflows and disk instabilities and the alternative of major and minor mergers.  The work should also identify the roles of nuclear activity versus virial shock heating in halos above a threshold mass, distinguish satellite from central quenching, and understand the cross-talk between the shutdown of star formation and the development of spheroidal stellar components and SMBHs.  Detailed models of early-type galaxy formation will be compared with observations of mergers and other processes out to high redshifts, and also of nearby galaxies whose properties can be studied in detail.  The work is supported by a large program of recently completed and planned follow-on computer simulations, using the most up-to-date cosmological parameters and having high mass and spatial resolution.  Additional high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations will clarify galaxy formation processes and permit the calculation of kinematics, spectra and images, including dust scattering and absorption.  It is crucial that simulations are 'observed' in ways that accurately mimic observations of real galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will involve students from underrepresented groups in astrophysical theory research, including the ability to understand the implications of the latest observations.  This work pushes the computational envelope, and all codes and outputs will be available to the astrophysical community.  Planned computer visualizations will help to understand the simulations while simultaneously making the results accessible to other researchers and to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF grant  allowed us to provide access of the general astronomical community to our newest and best supercomputersimulations. The multidark.org database  is widely usedby numerous professional astronomers: on average at any moment about 5-10 astronomers access the data and use them for their research. Thedata on multidark.org were used in 50~papers and were cited 600 times.  Our group provides images and animations for numerous requests  from mass media. These have been used by BBC, Sky and Telescope, National  Geographic. In 2011 ``The Sky and Telescope'' magazine featured our  simulation Bolshoi on its front page.  The Adler Planetarium in Chicago had a show called ``Deep Space  Adventure''.   Hundreds of thousand people see the show every year.   In ``Halo AbundanceMatching: accuracy and conditions for numerical convergence'' by Klypin etal (2014)we investigate theaccuracy of one of the leading methods of connecting the simulated dark matter haloes with observed galaxies -- the Halo AbundanceMatching (HAM) technique. We show how to choose the optimal values ofthe mass and force resolution in large-volume N-body simulations sothat they provide accurate estimates for correlation functions andcircular velocities for haloes and their subhaloes -- crucial ingredients of the HAM method.   Density profiles and haloconcentrations are extensively discussed in Klypin etal (2014)  ``MultiDark simulations: the story of darkmatter halo concentrations and density profiles'' where we alsointroduce our new suite of MultiDark simulations.  In Prada etal(2014) ``Hunting down systematics in baryon acoustic oscillations after cosmic high noon'' we study with unprecedentedaccuracy (better than 0.02% for dark matter and 0.07% for low-bias halos) small shifts of the pristine BAO wavenumbers towards larger k,and non-linear damping of BAO wiggles in the power spectrum of darkmatter and halo populations in the redshift range z=0-1.
