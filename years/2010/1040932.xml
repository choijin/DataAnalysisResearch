<AbstractNarration>This project is developing, disseminating, and maintaining an interactive website and annual print materials to enhance awareness and catalyze partnerships for the National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education (ATE) centers and program. This effort is helping to build partnerships, and bringing synergy to centers' efforts. In addition, the information compiled through this project helps make the case for the critical U.S. economic need for technician education and the important role of the community colleges in the context of the ATE program. Industry specific collaterals are being developed to demonstrate center collaboration by industry sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATE Impact 2011 is designed to address the needs and interests of three major audiences: decision makers and influencers at the federal level, to inform them of the breadth and impact of the ATE program; users of ATE resources and services such as community college and secondary school educators who seek curriculum development assistance, faculty development opportunities, model educational practices, and innovative teaching methodologies; and potential partners in the public and private sector who seek collaboration and collaborators to advance initiatives important to the nation's technological workforce and STEM education. The website and print materials reach significantly beyond the existing community of knowledge about the ATE program. The ATE Impact project is synergistic with www.ATEcentral.net and points users to the resources referenced there.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program at the National Science Foundation has encouraged AmericaÆs community college and two year technical college systems to take a lead role in the education of a trained technical workforce.  This project developed a collaborative effort to create mechanisms to broadly disseminate the resources developed by the community of ATE centers and has increased the awareness within the national and regional communities served.  All of the ATE centers have materials that are available for curriculum enhancement, faculty professional development, student outreach and recruiting, and technical career pathway promotion. The effectiveness of these resources requires mechanisms that increase awareness and impact to very broad based collection of stakeholders that include:  Key state, regional, local government authorities, National, regional and local business and industry representatives. College trustees and administrators,  K-12 teachers and program advisors,  STEM based faculty that support technical programs,  Students and the general public.    The goal of this project was to increase awareness of the materials and services developed by the ATE centers. To accomplish this goal the project developed and maintained an interactive website (www.atecenters.org), and created a 108 page brochure (http://atecenters.org/wp-content/themes/ate-centers/docs/pdf/ATE_centers_impact2011-spread_final.pdf) that highlights the program and the work of the 39 individual centers.  The website and printed brochure simultaneously highlight each ATE centerÆs activities and explain the broad impact of the centers and the entire ATE program.  Almost 14,000 copies of the brochure have been distributed across the nation and the website has had over 12,000 visits. The website is also available in a mobile version for viewing with smart phones and other devices.          Last Modified: 07/31/2012       Submitted by: Michael L Lesiecki]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
