<AbstractNarration>The objective of this planning visit is to explore and identify potential collaborations in robotics with specific emphasis on rehabilitation robotics, humanoids and medical robotics, in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and to meet with the researchers, administrators and government officials there to discuss future research collaborations.   Rehabilitation and assistive robotics are active research fields that can significantly change the lives of the elderly and individuals with physical disabilities.   A U.S. team of 4 faculty members has been assembled.  The team is well qualified to address the objective and has expertise in broad robotics areas including rehabilitation robotics, assistive technology, kinematic and dynamic synthesis, smart and intelligent systems, computer vision and sensing, robotic control, and mechanism design.  Immediate outcome of this Planning Visit will be a report summarizing the findings and recommendations for potential collaborations.  We anticipate proposal submissions (e.g. NSF PIRE) aimed toward long-term goals to continue international collaborations. Our visit is expected to be "ambassador-like" and not just purely academic.  It is a ?fact finding" mission to potentially pave the way for increased US-Gulf collaborations in areas of NSF CISE interest. This planning visit is funded jointly by IIS and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rajiv Dubey, PI, University of South Florida  Redwan Alqasemi, Co-PI, University of South Florida  George Lee, Purdue University  Ron Lumia, University of New Mexico     A group of four professors, under joint funding from CISE and OISE, made two trips and visited several universities and funding agencies to explore interest in establishing collaborative research and educational relationships between US and Middle East universities in the broad area of robotics. The objective of this planning visit was to meet with the researchers and government officials in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman to identify common interests and priorities and potential funding mechanisms for collaborative research and education in robotics.     Researchers at the universities we visited responded enthusiastically to the idea of establishing formal research relationships. Without exception, all researchers saw two issues clearly: the US has little research collaboration with the area; Human resources and infrastructure in R&amp;D are in the strategic interest of every country in the area. These encouraging results verified our assumption that R&amp;D collaboration is needed and suggest that we proceed to the next step, i.e., to organize a workshop to explore in detail the specific robotics research interests of the Middle East Universities, narrow the areas of research interest, and select potential participants in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.          Not only does the region embrace the concept of R&amp;D collaboration, the proposed relationship is consonant with President ObamaÆs speech in Egypt ((http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/us/politics/04obama.text.html) where he proposed engaging the Middle East through scientific collaboration.  In his speech he mentioned that "while America in the past has focused on oil and gas in this part of the world, we now seek a broader engagement." The proposed robotics collaboration could serve as a new model for interaction with the Middle East, one where both sides benefit not only in terms of technology but also through better understanding of the respective cultures.  These trips were very successful. Not only did we find a number of universities interested in robotics, but there was an enthusiastic response to the idea of international collaboration. The team feels that collaboration with researchers in these GCC countries will not only build mutual research and technological benefits, but it will also promote cultural understanding through engaging them with research, education and entrepreneurship. This encourages the team to put in motion the steps to move "R&amp;D collaboration" from a theoretical concept to a practical reality.       After our visits, we see technical collaboration possible in the following areas:   Assistive / Rehabilitation robots Mobile robots &ndash; navigation, SLAM, intelligent systems Underwater robots and humanoid robots Petroleum robotic applications, e.g., pipeline inspection and cleaning Construction robots Computer vision for robotic applications Robots that find mines and other unexploded ordnance Outreach activities for K-12  Student exchange program Complementary research infrastructure development         Important Issues   Security -- The physical security of students who participate in exchanges is perhaps the most important issue we need to consider when sending students overseas. While our trip showed no evidence of any problems in the countries we visited, this concern cannot be ignored. However, the issue is beyond the scope of our trip.  Intellectual property is a concern for both sides. All US universities want to protect IP. We found similar concerns in all universities that we visited. Resolution of IP is critically important, but once again, it is outside the scope of our study.  Export Control -- US laws regarding export control are strict. Unfortunately, it is the experience of the team that our univ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
