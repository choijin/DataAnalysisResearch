<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for travel support for the participation of two United States Scientists/Artists, Victoria Vesna and Leah Buechley, in the 2010 ACM Multimedia Conference Interactive Art Program Exhibition "An Interactive Renaissance of Color" to be held in Florence, Italy.  Dr. Vesna's work is characterized by her utilization of scientific practice as source material. The result is to educate the public to understand new discoveries, and provoke thought about their impact on society. Dr. Buechley describes her work as high-low tech, because it is part of the do-it-yourself movement of citizen science and engineering.  Both of these Scientists/Artists inspire to broaden participation in computing.  Vesna's impact is pronounced particularly through her collaborations with life scientists and physicists. She develops a functional model, harnessing artistic practice as a means for communicating about science, and scientific practice as grist for art. Buechley provocatively combines circuitry, fashion, and design, challenging gender stereotypes about geeks, and thus inviting the participation of a new generation of young women into STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific tracks of the ACM Multimedia conference focus on algorithmic techniques and scientific measurements, emphasizing content recognition and streaming media. The Interactive Art track develops creative and expressive innovative use contexts that stretch our imagination of what is possible for multimedia science and technology. This track serves to advance the dialog of artists and scientists in order to advance the principles and uses of computing. These connections, in the historically rich environment of Florence, Italy where art and science where strong collaborators, will be used as a springboard to catalyze new ideas that will inspire the future of multimedia computing as an example of how artistic and scientific research can be combined in the most innovative, dynamic, thought-provoking ways imaginable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Introduction As technologies and human societies co-evolve, computing grows more integrated with daily life. Science excels at developing methodologies that advance the power of computing, solving, "How?" Artistic methodologies provoke people to explore, "Why?" The arts are the disciplinary area that focuses creative methodologies. Interactive art serves as a fountain of new theoretical models and modes of research, imagining new human-centered roles for computing in society, and driving scientific innovation. Interactive art plays a crucial role in pushing our conceptualization of the human experiences that contextualize and are contextualized by the interface ecosystem of people, computing, culture, and experience. This grant supported two U.S. artists presenting their work in the premier ACM Multimedia 2010 Interactive Art exhibition, in Florence Italy. It also supported development and presentation of a participatory workshop at ACM Multimedia, Interactive Multimedia Computing for Creativity and Expression.   2010 ACM MM Interactive Art Program The 2010 ACM MM Interactive Art Program developed connections between culture and interactive multimedia computing, contextualized by FlorenceÆs history as a conceptual center of art/science integration in the renaissance.  This grant supported participation in the exhibition by two of the Uninted StatesÆ finest interactive artist-scientists: Leah Buechley of the MIT Media Lab and Victoria Vesna of UCLA. These two artist-scientists are leaders who create and demonstrate new roles for computing in society, and for women in computing. We estimate that 1100 people attended the Interactive Art Exhibition opening, including 600 registered ACM Multimedia conference participants. The museum had approximately 6500 attendees during the time period of the exhibition. The exhibition serves to educate the public about new forms of interactive multimedia, to stimulate thought about the role of computing in society, and to engage dialogue on these topics.   Leah Buechley: Living Wall [computational textiles] Dr. Buechley is a scientist, holding a Ph.D. in computer science and a B.A. degree in physics. Yet, she describes her work as high-low tech, because it is part of the do-it-yourself movement of citizen science and engineering. What is most striking about LeahÆs work is that its form is clothing: it integrates computing with fashion.    Buechley presented Living Wall, which experiments with interactive wallpaper that can be programmed to monitor its environment, control lighting and sound, and generally serve as a beautiful and unobtrusive way to enrich environments with computation. Run your hand across this wallpaper to turn on a lamp, play music, or send a message to a friend. The wallpaper is flat, constructed entirely from paper and paint, and can be paired with our paper computing kit whose pieces serve as sensors, lamps, network interfaces, and interactive decorations. Leah created the work in collaboration with graduate students Emily Lovell, David Mellis and Hannah Perner-Wilson.   Victoria Vesna: Blue Morph [nanotechnology] Dr. Vesna is is a media artist and Professor at the UCLA Department of Design | Media Arts and Director of the Art|Sci center at the School of the Arts and California Nanosystems Institute. Her work is characterized by her utilization of scientific practice as source material. It is experimental creative research that resides between disciplines and technologies. With her installations, she explores how communication technologies affect collective behavior and how perceptions of identity shift in relation to scientific innovation.   Buechley presented Blue Morph, a collaboration with bio/chemist James Gimzewski, involving nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is changing our perception of life. This is symbolic in the  optics involved in the Blue Morph butterfly. Its beautiful blue color is not pigment at all, but patterns and structure, which is what nano-photonics i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
