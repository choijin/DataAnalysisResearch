<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For this project, I researched the activities of citizen-led conservation groups in Japan that work with a species of firefly called the "hime-firefly." The overall goal of this research was to compare how location, specifically urban vs. rural, can influence conservation group activities both in Japan and in a more general sense.  There are three main reasons why I specifically chose this topic. First, although there is some knowledge about conservation groups in the United States and other countries, there is little research available about such groups in Japan and Asian in general. Second, with in the studies done on conservation group activities, subject of "location" has yet to be explored in detail. Third, in Japan, while research on fireflies themselves is not uncommon, research on the groups that work to protect them is severely lacking. Study on this subject can be useful for conservation policy, improving the effectiveness of conservation activities by citizen-led groups, as well as for other researchers.  My project took the form of six short case studies on urban and rural hime-firefly groups in central Japan. I visited various places in Japan in order to meet with and interview members of these groups. I asked questions about a variety of topics including group goals, activities, and accomplishments; the kinds of resources they use, difficulties groups may have and things they thought were important for future success.

Although all groups get together for the sake of hime-fireflies, goals and activities varied a great deal and did not center solely on firefly conservation/protection.
