<AbstractNarration>About 1 in 3 (30%) species of freshwater fishes belong to a group called cypriniforms, many of which have great economic value and are captured or raised for human consumption, the pet trade, or recreation. The top five fishes used for aquaculture worldwide are cypriniforms.  Goals of the All Cypriniformes Species Inventory are to (1) accelerate the rate of discovery and description of cypriniform fishes, (2) improve the understanding of their evolutionary and ecological relationships, (3) make information on cypriniforms readily available via websites, (4) build capacity for research in other countries through student training and long-term collaborations, and (5) make available large numbers of specimens and tissues of freshwater fishes in collections of US and foreign institutions. Given the large numbers of specimens in museums to be examined and the tropical regions to be sampled, it is anticipated that 800-1,000 new species will be described.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; All Cypriniformes will greatly improve the efficiency of species recognition by developing global collaborations, training US and foreign students, and providing images and databases on project websites. Websites will provide information on species diversity, photos of fishes,guides for identification, and links to related projects. Conservation biologists and fisheries managers depend on accurate identifications and distributional information for prioritizing areas for protection and for making informed management policies. All Cypriniformes will greatly improve taxonomy and accuracy of records through expert identification and georeferencing new and existing data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is part of a 10-year effort to digitize and mobilize the scientific information associated with biological specimens held in U.S. research collections. The images and digitized data from this project will be integrated into the online national resource as outlined in the community strategic plan available at http://digbiocol.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/digistratplanfinaldraft.pdf.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Cypriniformes is the world&rsquo;s largest group of freshwater fishes. The minnows, carps, barbs, loaches, and algae eaters occur throughout Asia, Europe, and North America in all manner of habitats. This extreme diversity coupled with a lot of difficult to assess variation has made the taxonomy of the Cypriniformes among the most difficult to establish. In addition, our understanding on how the diversity fits in with the environment is still in its infancy. At Auburn University, we were charged with three main goals in this project: 1) explore the diversity of African and North American cypriniforms, 2) examine the evolutionary ecology of cypriniforms, and establish the higher level taxonomy of cypriniforms. 1) We conducted three expeditions in Africa: the Democratic Republic of Congo (Fig. 1), Cameroon, and Guinea, and we helped bring scientists together at a meeting in Burundi. These surveys resulted in thousands of specimens of all types of fishes, including many cyprinids, and hundreds of tissues for genetic analyses. We, for the first time, established the genus identity of over two hundred species of African barbs, which is the first step in determining which species are valid and which need to be described. In addition, graduate students did several surveys across the US, exploring the diversity of a widespread minnow species that likely represents several undescribed forms.</p> <p>2) We have been using phylogenies (branching trees of relationships) to determine how minnows have diversified. By examining shape and ecology and then superimposing a phylogeny onto plots of these morphological variables, we can understand how species have converged in resource use and where competition may have pushed the species apart. In North America, we were the first to apply phylogenetic comparative analyses to studies of resource use in minnows. We found closely related species often diverge in shape but not in resource use, suggesting that they eat the same food but in different habitats. We showed that carnivorous minnows in eastern North American are smaller than herbivorous ones, which is counter to the trend shown in fishes where predators are generally larger. We determined that North American minnows represent an adaptive radiation and that the evolution of body shape dramatically increased with a switch from being benthic (living on the bottom) to being pelagic (living in the middle of the water column). In Africa, we determined that two species of barbs (<em>Enteromius aspilus</em> and <em>E. guirali</em>) were convergent in form (Fig. 2). The species school together and likely derive a benefit from having a larger school size meaning each individual is less likely to be eaten. &nbsp;We have also used the phylogeny to understand miniaturization in cypriniforms. The cypriniforms contain among the smallest vertebrate species, and we have shown these smallest species to have arisen via a slow progression towards small sizes versus a rapid change.</p> <p>3) We have published a large, phylogenomic analysis across cypriniforms (Fig. 3). Our analysis includes 260 genes and over 300,000 base pairs for 172 species, and represents one of the largest phylogenomic datasets in fishes to date. With it, we establish the higher level taxonomy for cypriniforms, and are now performing molecular clock analyses to understand how the cypriniforms have invaded into North America roughly 31 million years ago and Africa (several times from 18-3 mya). We additionally are currently analyzing phylogenomic datasets for North American minnows, North American Suckers, and African barbs.</p> <p>These studies have served to advanced the taxonomy of the Cypriniformes by understanding the phylogenetic relationships, how convergence is a prominent force compounding taxonomic error, and by establishing the higher level taxonomy across Cypriniformes and African barbs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/22/2016<br>      Modified by: Jonathan&nbsp;W&nbsp;Armbruster</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1023403/1023403_10040447_1479847423696_Convergenceplot--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1023403/1023403_10040447_1479847423696_Convergenceplot--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Convergence in Barbs from Cameroon"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1023403/1023403_10040447_1479847423696_Convergenceplot--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Convergence in Barbs from Cameroon"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fig. 2.
