<AbstractNarration>0949289 &lt;br/&gt;Shrestha &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of frequency doubling optics for an existing Optech Gemini Airborne Laser Swath Mapping System that will enable the NSF/EAR supported National Center for Airborne Laser Swath Mapping (NCALM) for the first time to map shallow bathymetry (depths of up to 5 m) underlying non turbid waters at sub-meter resolutions. The sensor head will be manufactured by Optech and integrated with their existing ALSM system to allow for operation in the visible green spectrum for water penetration. Coupled with the recent acquisition of a full waveform digitization system, NCALM will be poised to develop techniques for two-color, full-waveform light detection and ranging (LIDAR) observations, including intensity profiles. Academic Researchers interested in the subtle bottom topography of shallow rivers, lakes and the neritic marine benthos will for the first time have access to a tool for high resolution, remote bathymetric mapping together with planning support, data analysis and quality control, and student research experience enabled by NSF support of NCALM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to extend the use of airborne laser scanning (ALS) to the mapping of areas covered with shallow streams, lakes, and coastal waters. During the past decade ALS observations have revolutionized the study of the processes that continually change the surface of Earth by providing scientists with sub-meter resolution three-dimensional æbare earthÆ digital elevation models extending over hundreds to thousands of square kilometers. These digital elevation models enable scientists to æseeÆ terrain hidden below dense forests, allowing them to accurately quantify patterns and rates of erosion, delineate crustal motions associated with earthquakes, estimate the volumes of landslides, determine the damage to forests caused by wildfires, and map ancient archaeological in tropical rain forests.  To optimize the performance of terrain mapping units, commercial manufactures nearly exclusively use high pulse rate (tens to hundreds of thousands of pulses per second) lasers which produce light at a wavelength that does not penetrate water, leaving gaps in the digital elevations models in areas covered with streams, lakes, or coastal waters. This inability to map water covered terrain made it impossible for NCALM to provide observations for proposed research projects given high priorities through peer review.

And the new sensor has already been used to collect observations of an area including a shallow lake, for researchers at Laguna Atocosca in Brownsville, TX.   The initial performance of the green sensor built for NCALM has been so successful that the manufacturer has added it to their product line, and almost immediately received a "Technology Innovation" award from a manufacturing association for "&hellip;its shallow-water mapping sensor." By making a relatively modest investment to purchase a new sensor NSF, through NCALM, has succeeded not only in opening new areas for academic research, but has facilitated the development of a new sensor that will enable commercial providers of airborne laser scanning data to offer new products to their user community       Last Modified: 01/04/2012       Submitted by: Ramesh L Shrestha]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
