<AbstractNarration>Educators at all levels have begun to exploit children's attraction to games. However, until recently, especially at the K12 level, it has been assumed that learners were consumers of games and not their producers.  The goal of the Pedagogical Game project is to develop and evaluate a secondary school curriculum for learning standards-based content via collaborative game-making. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that creating computer games (game-making) can engage students in learning standards-based content and significantly impact achievement and retention and that collaborative game design can be a powerful tool for encouraging open negotiation and argumentation, a core element in promoting creativity. The interdisciplinary and project-based approach to learning will encourage art/theater and math/science students to work together in a collaborative setting and promote differentiation of learning tasks and student-centered learning. Research being undertaken includes (a) developing collaborative game making curriculum where standard based math content is effectively integrated; (b) identifying scaffolding opportunities, such as promoting student collaboration and reflection through online discussions and wiki-based journaling; (c) developing instructional assessment tools based on discourse analysis and course topic ontology that will monitor student progress over time according to the game making project goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will strengthen and evaluate a fledgling game-building curriculum that was created to address the educational needs of at-risk high school students in underperforming schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). The program has a large potential to positively impact the education and lives of our at-risk student population. The intellectual merit of the project includes a game-making curriculum with embedded standards and new ways to promote and evaluate collaboration in a game-making context. The results of the project will have broad societal impact by enhancing the ability of students from traditionally under-represented groups to participate in STEM fields of study while learning 21st century career skills. The project will also contribute to the knowledge base through careful empirical evaluation of the benefits of creative new instructional strategies (game-making, project-based learning) that support learning styles and strategies preferred by students who have had difficulty excelling in mathematics learning. With the support of LAUD teachers and staff, we are poised to develop and integrate the program into the curriculum and scale its adoption. Its success has the potential to transform learning strategies for at risk students.</AbstractNarration>

Its three main objectives were to embed STEM content into a game development curriculum and measure learning, to promote reflection and collaboration, and to create technologies to evaluate student progress.  Intellectual Merit  Pre and post curriculum testing was performed to assess the impact of game development and GameMath! on the math skills of very low performing high school students. Because producing games exposes students naturally to logic, math and computational thinking, our hypothesis was that students who employed concepts such as rates and fractions to control player movement, or who graphed and analyzed data collected during play testing sessions, would improve their math skills in a measurable way.  Studies found that in almost all cases, studentsÆ mathematical skills consistently improved, sometimes significantly. In studies where mathematics was not specifically addressed, for example, when the program was taught as part of a Media Arts course, or within a middle school STEM Academy, computational skills, including relevant mathematical skills, were shown to improve. During development of the Maze game, the highest learning gains occurred in graphing and rates concepts, as well as fractions, percentages and factors. During Scrolling Shooter game development, the highest gains occurred in average, length, percent and probability calculations.  New instructional technologies were developed to aid teachers in assessing student progress during game development and for online collaboration.
