<AbstractNarration>This project adds online ethics instruction to introductory Java and C++ programming courses.  By means of a controlled experiment, the investigators address the question:  Can ethics instruction replace some technical material while simultaneously improving students' technical learning?  An experimental group receives the ethics materials early in the course and some technical material is delayed; the control group receives the ethics materials later in the course.  Midterm and end of term assessments are used to determine whether there is a difference in learning gains, both technical and ethical, between the two groups.  A set of online materials focused on ethics for computing professionals is under development. Participating faculty are from both four-year institutions and community colleges.  The online modules allow a large, diverse population of students to be reached, consequently ensuring that the results are broadly applicable.  They will be posted online and available for adoption by other institutions at the end of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ethically aware computer professionals can be expected to broadly impact the software industry and all users by producing more reliable, safer computer systems that are more appropriate for user needs.  Furthermore, an increased emphasis on relevant social issues in computing is likely to increase participation by women and other groups underrepresented in computing.</AbstractNarration>
