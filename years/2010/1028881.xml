<AbstractNarration>This award provides student support for the Twenty-First International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium to be held August 9-11, 2010 in Austin, Texas. The meeting is comprised of plenary and parallel session technical presentations and a poster session. There is ample time allotted for informal interactions of world-class researchers and students in formal meeting settings and also at informal social events during the meeting. Approximately 120 persons will attend, with 50 of these participants being students. The two "FAME" awards will be given for the second time. The first is a senior award called the "Freeform and Additive Manufacturing Excellence" (FAME) Award. The second is an award to recognize researchers early in their career, the Award for "Outstanding Young Research in Freeform and Additive Manufacturing".  There will also be a special session on biomedical applications of additive manufacturing.  The session will bring together world experts in the area to update and extend our understanding of this import aspect of the technology.  All meeting papers will be published in a conference proceedings to be distributed to all participants including students. Approximately 50 students will be supported. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is a mechanism for transfer and dissemination of knowledge and understanding in the field of additive, freeform manufacturing. It is a model for advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning. The networking of world-class researchers with students is strong. The meeting is a pinion for research infrastructure. Through the heavily cited proceedings, information is widely disseminated to an extensive network of researchers and students around the world. The societal impact includes identification of pre-commercial technologies and sharing of information pertaining to freeform fabrication that will eventually be developed and implemented into machines and processes that will enhance domestic productivity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported student participation in the Twenty-First International Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) Symposium.  The symposium took place on August 9-11, 2010 in Austin, Texas at The University of Texas at Austin.  Funds offset student registrations which enabled students to come and participate.  There were 58 students at the meeting which represented approximately 39% of the entire meeting participation.  The meeting had 88 oral presentations and 22 poster presentations.  Eighty papers were included in the proceedings.  Authors had an option to have their papers peer reviewed prior to publication.     Intellectual Merit  The Twenty-First International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium, held at The University of Texas at Austin on August 9-11, 2010, was attended by 149 national and international researchers. The Symposium was organized in a manner to allow the multidisciplinary nature of the SFF research to be presented coherently, with various sessions emphasizing computer interfacing and modeling, machine and process development and materials and materials processing for SFF.  The three-day event was completely composed of individual oral presentations to accommodate the demand for this dissemination format.  The parallel sessions were split into three sessions to meet demand, and a poster session allowed researchers to present in this format.  We believe that documenting the changing state of SFF art as represented by the meeting proceedings serves both the people presently involved in this fruitful technical area as well as the flux of new researchers and users entering the field.     In 2010, a special plenary session was organized on government issues in additive manufacturing.  Speakers represented NAVAIR, NASA Langley, AFRL and NIST.      Information on the SFF Symposium was made available through the worldwide web at http://utwired.engr.utexas.edu.lff/.  On-line registration forms, hotel information, general information brochure, proceedings order form, maps and the previous yearÆs talk titles were all available.  The SFF Symposium mailing address is sffsymp@uts.cc.utexas.edu.     Broader Impacts  In addition to the benefits of direct meeting participation, students were able to network with the international additive manufacturing research community.  Wider dissemination was accomplished through the proceedings.  A total of 80 papers were included in the proceedings volume.  Authors contributed manuscripts both unreviewed and reviewed to allow authors the option of presenting their work in a refereed format.     The SFF Symposium serves as a primary forum for networking and dissemination of information dealing with research issues in freeform fabrication.  According to Ian Campbell, senior editor of the Rapid Prototyping Journal, "The SFF Symposium is to be regarded as the foremost international conference for rapid prototyping research."  RPJ, 9#1, 2003.  Outstanding presentations from the 2010 SFF Symposium were selected for inclusion in a special issue of the Rapid Prototyping Journal.  The special issue has appeared in 2011, Volume 17#3.     Additive Manufacturing is an extremely broad and interdisciplinary field, encompassing mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, aerospace engineering, biomedical engineering, computer science and engineering, biology, design, materials science and engineering, manufacturing science.  The topics covered at the SFF symposium impact the automotive, aerospace, orthopedics, dentistry, gaming, surgical planning, implants, marine, architecture, furniture, art, etc.  The 2010 conference served as a forum for this diverse interdisciplinary group of researchers to gather for the purpose of synergistic interaction and sharing of ideas and progress.     The SFF Symposium brings together students, faculty and research scientists to interact in areas related to freeform fabrication.  Details of student involvement are described elsewhere in this report.     The Proce...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
