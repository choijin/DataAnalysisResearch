<AbstractNarration>The highly-exposed live feed of the oil spill from underwater cameras in the Gulf of Mexico is one of many examples showcasing the importance of multimedia underwater sensor networks in fields such as underwater surveillance, undersea exploration, video-assisted navigation, and environmental monitoring. Multimedia networking, however, requires (i) much higher data rates than what has been available in the past with acoustic technology and (ii) flexible protocol design. Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is a transmission technique that may increase data rates or reduce link errors by leveraging the spatial diversity offered by the rich scattering structure of underwater acoustic propagation. To-date, little experimental data is available to the research community to assess the potential of MIMO gains in real underwater acoustic links. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an early-stage research effort to collect data and experimentally assess the potential of acoustic MIMO networking. A testbed is being built to measure and model the propagation characteristics of underwater MIMO links and understand how the fundamental MIMO multiplexing and diversity tradeoff translates into a tradeoff between achievable transmission rate and link error probability. The project identifies how the capabilities of MIMO links impact the design of higher layer networking protocols. The resulting characterization informs the design of a class of integrated medium access control and signaling techniques that optimally select the transmit power, MIMO transmission mode, and coding strength to improve data rates and reduce bit error rates. All collected data are being made available to the research community through the project website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Underwater acoustic networks could enable new commercial and military applications such as oceanographic data collection, pollution monitoring, offshore exploration, disaster prevention, and tactical surveillance. However, the design of efficient communication protocols for underwater sensor networks is still an open research problem due to the unique characteristics of the underwater acoustic communication channel such as limited bandwidth, high and variable propagation delays, and significant multipath and scattering.  In this project, we made significant contributions towards the design of a new generation of underwater networks that have much better performance than the state-of-the-art in terms of achievable data rates, reliability, integration with existing terrestrial networks, and ability to communicate securely in the presence of eavesdroppers. Specifically, we designed, among others,  new communication protocols that leverage the capabilities offered by multiple-input multiple-output techniques, analog network coding techniques, and new optimal receivers for FSK modulators.   Within this project, we also developed a set of techniques that allow underwater networks to be connected to the Internet. This new "Internet underwater", which has received significant media attention,  will allow underwater sensors and monitoring devices to be accessed from any laptop or smartphone connected to the traditional Internet, and has a potential to enable new and exciting applications for marine surveillance, oceanographic exploration, climate and pollution monitoring.   The project has contributed to the training of 4 Ph.D. students in Electrical Engineering at the University at Buffalo, 3 M.S. students, and one undergraduate student, with unique skills and expertise in the field of underwater acoustic communications and networks.
