<AbstractNarration>Research will be carried out to rigorously understand the effects of disorder on interacting many-body quantum systems. Of central interest are questions of electron transport and conductivity properties of disordered materials. Among models to be studied, particular attention will be given to random quantum spin systems. These are frequently used in statistical physics as models of interacting particle systems, but are also relevant in quantum information theory, where they describe interacting quantum bits. The research will combine methods from the theory of single-particle models such as the Anderson model with recent progress in the theory of quantum spin systems, such as improved Lieb-Robinson bounds and decay properties of ground state correlations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern nanotechnology aims at building powerful electronic devices of smaller and smaller size. As a result, quantum effects play an increasingly important role and mathematical models originally developed in theoretical physics have increasing practical relevance such as, for example, in quantum computing. The physical properties of quantum devices are strongly influenced by effects of impurities and disorder, as present in semi-conductors, alloys and amorphous materials. In particular, disorder has a strong effect on electrical conductivity. It is the goal of this research project to contribute to the understanding of the mathematical reasons for disorder effects on quantum systems. In particular, we will study the effect of disorder on large systems of interacting electrons. Work will include the training of several PhD students in this area of research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The key objective of this project was the mathematical investigation of the effects of disorder on interacting many-body quantum systems. Two central questions in the theory of such quantum systems are: (1) How do interactions between particles influence the properties of physical many-body systems, in particular their dynamics? (2) How do the properties of a quantum system change under the presence of disorder? While much progress has been made in recent decades on each one of these questions, there is still very limited understanding of the combined effects of disorder and interactions.   The findings of this project have contributed progress on this problem by identifying several physical models of disordered interacting many-body systems where a mathematically rigorous study of the combined effects of interactions and disorder is possible. In particular, quantum spin systems and systems of interacting harmonic oscillators have been investigated. Major findings are that disorder leads to the absence of quantum transport in these models (wave localization), to rapid decay of correlations between spatially separated particles, and to bounds on the entanglement entropy of ground states and thermal states.  The models investigated in this project were originally introduced by theoretical physicists (in particular in condensed matter physics) to understand the nano-scale properties of materials such as metals, alloys, semi-conductors and quasi-crystals. Closely related models recently also found increased interest in quantum information theory, where quantum spin systems serve as models for the interactions between quantum bits, the basic unit of quantum information.   Our findings provide rigorous justification of phenomena which were initially observed via numerical investigations. In some cases existing theoretical findings were improved, such as for bounds on the information transport in certain spin systems. In particular, the project outcomes have served to popularize important questions and models from theoretical physics and quantum information theory among a wider community of mathematical researchers.  Findings were widely disseminated through publications in leading peer reviewed journals (some still under review) and through lectures at national and international conferences, including in Austria, Chile, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Work on the project has also led to a wide range of international collaborations.  The project has also provided multiple training opportunities for graduate students and junior researchers.
