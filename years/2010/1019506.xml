<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a two-day long workshop proposal to be organized by the Center for Innovative Materials Research (CIMR) of Lawrence Tech University; and the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Stanford University in conjunction with the Egyptian Housing and Building Research Center (HBRC), Cairo, Egypt. The workshop/conference will be hosted by the Egyptian Housing Building Research Center (HBRC), Cairo, Egypt from March 22-24,2010. Women and underrepresented groups from the US will participate to foster networking and professional development opportunities as well as potential research collaboration between US researchers and Egyptian scholars. The primary goal is to confer on the use of innovative sustainable materials in green buildings in desert areas. It is expected that the scholars from both countries will be collaborate on potential research topics in the area of sustainable energy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ New construction materials, designs, and construction techniques have shown great potential in reaching a more sustainable built environment by virtue of their longevity, energy efficiency, and lightweight characteristics.  However, the systematic application of innovative materials in the design of sustainable buildings and infrastructure has not been undertaken, particularly in desert areas that are increasingly being developed around the globe as a result of urban sprawl.  With this in mind, a two-day long workshop was organized by Lawrence Technological University and Stanford University in conjunction with the Egyptian Housing and Building Research Center (HBRC) in Cairo, Egypt.     In March 2010, seventeen delegates from the United States, fourteen delegates from Egypt, and one delegate from Sweden met in Cairo, Egypt to form a new research agenda and discuss new research findings on the topic of sustainable building environments in desert ecosystems.  Foremost, the delegates concluded that the design of sustainable green buildings (including neighborhoods, communities, new/existing, mixed use &amp; integrated) in desert ecosystems is a holistic process that is very sensitive to all decisions considered during the development.  Second, the adaptation of multi-scale (sub-room scale, room scale, building scale, neighborhood scale, etc.) approaches (both objective and subjective) for sustainable building design needs more attention in research and application.  And finally, efforts should be made to rediscover the neo-vernacular and indigenous architecture forms in desert ecosystems and their respective passive strategies to achieve a balance with innovative, appropriate technologies.     Additionally, the delegates concluded in congress that there is a need to establish a good relationship between the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Egyptian Housing and Building Research Center (HBRC).  HBRC is the Egyptian body responsible for issuing codes and design criteria and well as green building codes.  This will provide researchers, engineers, architects, and manufacturers the opportunity to benefit from US/Egypt joint research opportunities, training, education, technology transfer, outreach, and workshops.     A number of successful outcomes were reached from this project.  First, discussions contrasting the advanced technologies being researched and implemented in the US and the passive approaches and natural materials being implemented by many of the Egyptian designers were enlightening to delegates from both countries.  Following this there is a need to get a deeper understanding of exactly how to integrate the technocratic approaches seemingly preferred by the US participants versus the passive and local approaches preferred by the Egyptian participants.     Beyond the education of the workshop participants directly, research challenges identified at the workshop will require further research and collaboration with colleagues in the fields of materials science, architecture, mechanics, structural engineering, manufacturing engineering, business analysis, environmental engineering, law, public policy, and climatology.  The identification of research challenges and the formation of a research agenda that specifically identifies such crosscutting research needs can be viewed as a contribution to these other fields as well.  In future workshops and proposals it is envisioned that researchers from these more diverse fields will be invited and compelled to participate in light of the outcomes of this workshop.     Finally, the delegates concluded that society is increasingly demanding higher performing building systems that deliver a higher quality of life.  These are in the form of high performance buildings that maintain very low impact profiles, even in challenging difficult environments like deserts.  This workshop served as a forum for leading researchers in the fields of green building design and sustainable m...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
