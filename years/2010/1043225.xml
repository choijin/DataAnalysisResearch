<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. Sediment microbial mediated processes are capable of oxidizing oil and methane in the environment. The PI's will examine the impacts of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (hereafter BP spill) on microbially mediated processes in the deep waters and sediments in the vicinity of the spill site. This is an unprecedented oil spill and it is essential to obtain a clear understanding of its impacts on microbial processes in the waters and sediments of the Gulf of Mexico. The work will complement several funded or planned geochemical and microbiological sampling programs focused on the oil spill response. They will evaluate rates of water column methane oxidation and sediment sulfate reduction and methanogenesis at multiple sites around the spill site. Additional experiments will quantify the impact of nutrients, oxygen and substrate concentrations on these important microbially mediated processes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This work will clarify the response of microbial processes in deep waters and sediments to the Deepwater Horizon spill. The project will support a post doctoral associate (female, Hispanic) and an undergraduate student (female, African American). The proposed work is leveraged by NOAA funding which will permit us to expand the number of study sites and number of sampling cruises. A web site will be developed to highlight our work and convey our results to the others in the scientific community as well as to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major findings of this project are: 1) discovery of deepwater oil and gas plumes, 2) describing the evolution of the methane cycle following the blowout, and, 3) documenting rapid sedimentation of "oil snow" to the seafloor.   During the R/V Pelican cruise, and later the NSF-funded R/V Walton Smith, we were the first researchers to document deepwater plumes enriched in oil and gas emanating from the ruptured Macondo wellhead (Diercks et al. 2010, Joye et al. 2011, Wade et al. 2012).

Concentrations of methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane were 75000 times higher than those expected from equilibrium with the atmosphere and the ratios of the low molecular weight alkanes compared to that expected from solubility equilibrium with Macondo vent gas, as well as in situ digital images of gas hydrate flakes suspended in the water column hundreds of meters above the bottom, suggests that gas hydrate formed and persisted in the deepwater layers in which the gas and oil rich plume fluids were injected (Joye et al. 2011).  Time series sampling allowed us to track the fate of the plumes over time. Methane concentration data revealed that focused gas-rich deep-water plumes were short-lived features; however, water column methane concentrations remained elevated over background throughout the study. High methane concentrations selected for a methane oxidizing bacterial population capable of extremely high oxidation rates &ndash; up to 5900 nmol L-1 d-1, the highest rates documented for the pelagic ocean &ndash; in the gas-rich deepwater plumes in late May.

Of all the young scientists influenced by this project, undergraduate student Mann was most certainly the most profoundly affected.
