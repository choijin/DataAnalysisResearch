<AbstractNarration>The largest galaxies in the universe, the so-called BCGs, are the brightest members of rich galaxy clusters, and are suspected of harboring the most massive black holes in their centers. Accurately measuring the masses of these black holes is confounded by the distances to, and the low surface brightnesses of, their host galaxies. The PI and co-PI of this project will employ laser-guide-star adaptive optics systems and integral field spectrographs on the 8-meter Gemini-North and the 10-meter Keck telescopes to obtain 2-dimensional maps of the stellar kinematic fields in 9 BCGs at unprecedented resolution. Then, using orbit superposition models, they will fit the data and constrain the masses of the putative central dark objects. The results of this study will clarify the co-evolution of galaxies and black holes by mergers at the high end of the mass scale, and will have important implications for the role of black-hole driven energy injection (feedback) in galaxy clusters. A graduate student will be trained in forefront observational techniques and stellar dynamical modeling methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Black holes are not only amongst the most fascinating astrophysical objects for scientific study, but have also long entranced the general public.  This project has demonstrated that it is feasible to measure the masses of extremely massive black holes in giant elliptical galaxies out to 350 million light years, using integral-field spectrographs on ground-based 10-meter-class telescopes with adaptive optics.  The outcome of this project represents the beginning of the post-Hubble Space Telescope (HST) era hunt for massive black holes.  While many dynamically detected black holes had been discovered in galaxies within 60 million light years with the HST, the large ground-based telescopes used in this project expanded significantly the detectable range.  The increase in volume by 1-2 orders of magnitude opened a new window for studies of black holes more massive than that in Messier 87, the record holder for over three decades of the most massive known black hole.  Our discovery of two record-breaking black holes, each weighing 10 billions times that of our Sun, lurking in our galactic neighborhood is of great interest to the public. Contemplating how these supermassive black holes consumed material over cosmic history and grew to this astonishing mass while their host galaxies formed is an absorbing story.   At the same time, this project has demonstrated just how much we have yet to understand about the formation of galaxies and about their central supermassive black holes; mysteries that continue to intrigue both the scientists and the general readers.
