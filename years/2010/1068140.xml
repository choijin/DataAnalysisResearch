<AbstractNarration>This award supports a theoretical program to examine in detail collisions of photons (light), electrons, and heavy charged particles with atoms, ions, and molecules.  Highly sophisticated numerical methods and computer programs will be developed and then applied to perform benchmark calculations, whose predictions will be compared with data from state-of-the-art experiments currently being performed in various laboratories worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interpretation of the results will lead to a deeper understanding of highly correlated processes on the submicroscopic atomic scale.  Of particular interest are processes in ultrashort intense laser fields, at a time scale that allows for the study, and ultimately the control, of electron behavior in chemical processes.  Finally, the project provides accurate atomic data, which are needed in many applications, such as modeling plasmas for the lighting industry, processes in planetary atmospheres, and the physics of stars and lasers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we concentrated on the interaction of short-pulse intense laser radiation with atoms and small molecules.  In order to compare directly with experiment, it was necessary to develop highly efficient and stable computer programs that could take advantage of modern computational resources such as the massively parallel computing platforms of supercomputers. [We have been very successful in obtaining supercomputer access through the XSEDE allocation process.] The participants significantly improved their skills in general atomic physics as well as the numerical implementation of sophisticated algorithms, including parallel computing.  We had very fruitful collaborations with experimental groups at Griffith University in Brisbane (Australia), Trieste (Italy), and Hamburg (Germany).  In many cases, our benchmark calculations were in excellent agreement with the experimental data, and we were often able to guide in the planning of future experiments.  [Beamtime at free-electron laser facilities is extremely expensive, and hence experimentalists very much appreciate ideas and suggestions about where to look next.] When discrepancies between experiment and theory remained, we always carried out a detailed analysis of the possible reasons.  Due to the complexity of the experimental setups, disagreement does not necessarily mean that theory is wrong, although we certainly noticed that even more elaborate calculations than we could perform at the time would need to be carried out to properly simulate all the important physical processes that were affecting the outcome of a particular process.  Consequently, we continued to work on further improvements of both the general algorithms and their implementation on supercomputer platforms.  We published about 60 papers and several book contributions during this project, and we also presented our results through many invited and contributed talks at international scientific conferences and colloquia at other institutions, both in the US and abroad.
