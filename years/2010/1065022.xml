<AbstractNarration>Information theory, communication theory, and statistical signal &lt;br/&gt;processing have proven spectacularly successful as innovation engines &lt;br/&gt;for communication, data compression, and information processing &lt;br/&gt;technologies. Although in principle these theories are quite general, &lt;br/&gt;in practice they are most useful for a particular family of models, &lt;br/&gt;such as discrete Markov sources and channels with additive &lt;br/&gt;Gaussian noise. Although this family is quite rich and encompasses &lt;br/&gt;many practical technologies, there are several important scenarios that&lt;br/&gt;fall outside of these models. In particular, the timing of discrete events is &lt;br/&gt;the modality of interest in many applications, such as neuroscience&lt;br/&gt;and certain problems in network security, and this modality does &lt;br/&gt;not fit neatly into the standard classes. This research involves&lt;br/&gt;extending information theory, communication theory, and statistical signal&lt;br/&gt;processing to develop a general theory of information transfer via timing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of this research involves solving several concrete&lt;br/&gt;problems involving information transfer via timing, such as the&lt;br/&gt;secrecy capacity of timing channels and how to minimize information&lt;br/&gt;transfer via timing side channels in both wireless and wireline&lt;br/&gt;networks. The second phase involves interconnecting these disparate&lt;br/&gt;problems to form a general theory of information transfer via timing.&lt;br/&gt;By elevating the role of timing in information transfer,&lt;br/&gt;this research better positions the fields of information theory,&lt;br/&gt;communication theory, and statistical signal processing to&lt;br/&gt;impact allied fields such as networking, neuroscience, and &lt;br/&gt;operations research, where timing and delay are of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;importance. This impact is facilitated through special topics &lt;br/&gt;courses and invited sessions at conferences, both of which are &lt;br/&gt;designed to attract participants from a range of areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        Timing can provide valuable information for inference specifically in complex networks. We studied value of information provided by timing in at least two context in this proposal: 1) identification of causal influence pattern among processes  and 2) understanding its power in leaking information in shared schedulers. We introduced a new type of probabilistic graphical model, directed information (DI) graphs, that succinctly summarizes causal interdependencies for stochastic causal dynamical systems under mild assumptions. We developed an exact algorithm that uses causally conditioned directed information estimates to correctly identify all of the causal influences, and to distinguish which are direct and which are indirect. Moreover, we proposed an efficient algorithm to identify the structure of directed information graphs when the in-degrees are bounded. The method uses the minimal-dimension statistics necessary to find the structure and can result in significant reduction in learning sample complexity.  We studied the type of timing side channels that arise in the side channel attacks using a shared recourse. We showed that first- come, first-served (FCFS) policy does leak significant information between the processes when the scheduler is heavily loaded. We generalized this result and demonstrated a fundamental trade-off between delay and privacy. More precisely, we proved that no scheduler can provide maximum privacy without idling or taking vacations, and, consequently, that no policy can simultaneously be delay- and privacy-optimal. This is a significant result, as it is often ascertained that a system that allocates resources randomly can thwart side channel attackers. But a surprising corollary to this result is that a private source of randomness at the scheduler does not help it, if it is forced to pick a work-conserving policy. Therefore, contrary to popular belief, if one were to design provably secure scheduling policies, they should allow for idling. Our efforts in studying timing side channels has contributed towards new definition of information theoretic metrics that quantify privacy and anonymity and introduced new bounding techniques for coding problems. While our work is based on solid theoretical grounds, we have always emphasized real-world implementation and thorough system evaluations. Analogously, our efforts in developing an information-theoretic causal inference framework and provide point process models of neural activity,, has led to a boradening scope of neuroscience researchers using causal inference to understand the dynamical aspects of brain function.
