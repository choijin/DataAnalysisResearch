<AbstractNarration>Much is known about the processes leading to forest loss, that understanding must be complemented with new knowledge regarding the socioecological factors that influence forest recovery and sustainability.  This knowledge is critical for predicting where and when second- and third-generation forests might emerge and for understanding the conditions necessary to maintain them.  Furthermore, such knowledge is urgently required to inform global climate models, climate change mitigation scenarios, and a suite of other environmental issues.  This interdisciplinary research project will focus on the human and ecological linkages that give rise to specific forest forms (including forest extent, species composition, and land-cover patterns) and functions (including benefits of the forest like timber, recreation, privacy, and wildlife habitat).  The investigators will examine the extent to which those linkages and the forests emergent from them lead to irreversible changes in socioecological systems.  They will focus their attention on Appalachian Ohio, an area whose which forests have returned and where there is sufficient time depth to examine the underlying socioecological processes that give rise to them.  A former extractive periphery devastated in the 19th and early 20th centuries, its extensive forests have emerged in surprising ways over the last century.  Project goals are (1) to compare forest composition between pre-settlement forests and contemporary forests; (2) to describe the social and ecological form and function of recovered forests; (3) to explain the emergence of the forest over time; and (4) to predict how these socioecological systems will function in the future.  The methods to be used include an agent-based model representing land-use decision-making and implementation coupled with the landscape disturbance and succession model, which simulates forest succession and regrowth.  To inform the models with empirical data, the researchers will collect field data on forest structure and composition, generate time-series classifications of remotely sensed images, and investigate political, economic, infrastructural, and cultural dynamics using archival and field-derived data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make important contributions to theory and methods for understanding dynamically coupled socioecological systems.  The project will advance basic understanding of forest transitions by focusing on forest resilience, thus treating forest recovery as an emergent property of complex socioecological systems.  The project will focus attention on differences in ecosystem attributes before and long after massive disturbance, showing that humans and ecosystems have together created unexpected ecologies.  The project will demonstrate specific ways that forest form and function respond to local forces and distant shocks that are both social and ecological.  Methodologically, the project will advance agent-based modeling science by using innovative metrics to incorporate social inequality and power dynamics and by coupling social simulation with landscape-level forest growth models.  As a collaborative project between two Ohio-based universities and the U.S. Forest Service, the project will provide practical information regarding pressing social and environmental issues in Appalachian Ohio, including rural poverty, ecological change, and management of public and private forests.  Global applications of this portable framework include enhancing the ways that scholars and policy makers understand, plan for, and help to foster ecological recovery, in particular by drawing attention to the role of social inequalities in shaping socioecological resilience.  The findings of this research can also inform climate modeling and mitigation.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project, located in the "hill country" of southern Ohio, highlights the dramatic changes in forests that have occurred since settlement by Europeans more than 200 years ago.  Original land surveys, carried out ca. 1800, used "witness trees" to mark the corners of township sections.  The surveyors recorded the species, diameter, distance, and direction of two witness trees at each survey point.  Within a five county area, we plotted the location of more than 5,000 witness trees in a Geographic Information System (GIS).  In the GIS, each tree, based on its location, was linked to environmental information such as elevation, soil type, and slope.  From these data, we created a map of the major forest types just prior to major European settlement.  The most striking feature of the pre-European forest was that more than 1 in 3 trees (37%) was a white oak (Quercus alba).  Although tree species composition was somewhat different on dry ridges than on slopes and valleys, forests were quite homogeneous across the landscape, as white oak dominated in all landscape settings.  To better understand how forests have changed since 1800, we obtained information on todayÆs forests from the US Forest ServiceÆs Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program.  FIA measures thousands of forest plots across the country to document the current status and trends in forest resources.  In our five county study area, there were 167 FIA plots.  We found that todayÆs forests have much less white oak, now only 8% of trees, than the pre-European forests.  Also, red oaks (black oak, scarlet oak, northern red oak) are much less abundant in today's forests. By contrast, species that were relatively uncommon in the pre-European forest, such as red maple, sugar maple, yellow-poplar, aspen, elm, and black cherry have all become much more abundant in todayÆs forests. While historic forests were relatively homogeneous across the landscape, today's forests are chaarterized by sharper changes in species composition from dry ridges to moist slopes and valleys.  The causes of this sharp change in species composition are being debated but it appears most likely that multiple factors have been and continue to be involved:   agricultural land use followed by forest regrowth, and changes in fire frequency, timber harvesting, wildlife populations, and climate.  While it is simply not possible to restore todayÆs forests to a state that was present before European settlement, our research provides land managers with previously lacking information on historic forests in the region.  Wildlife populations thrived in the historic oak-dominated landscape.  White oak is a long-lived species and its acorns are a valuable food resource for many species of wildlife.  Therefore, managing forests to increase the amount of white oak would restore the landscape to a more natural and stable state while also providing improved wildlife habitat and ecosystem services.
