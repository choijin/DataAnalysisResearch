<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program, Professor Stephen Kukolich of the University of Arizona will modify and use pulsed-beam, Fourier-transform microwave spectrometers to measure rotational transition frequencies in the 1 to 18 GHz region of the microwave spectrum.  The completion of a new 1-10 GHz, spectrometer provides an unusual capability for measuring lower frequency transitions of larger molecules and complexes.  A laser-photodissociation beam source will be used for measurements on organometallic radicals and their reaction products.  The overall objectives of this work include measurements of the three-dimensional gas-phase structures, quadrupole coupling strengths and magnetic interaction parameters.  These measurements are proposed for:  a) mononuclear and dinuclear transition metal complexes, b) weakly-bound complexes involving transition metals, c) hydrogen-bonded complexes and d) transition metal radicals.  The quadrupole coupling strengths and magnetic interaction parameters directly characterize the electronic charge distributions.  Quantum mechanical (DFT or mp2) calculations will be carried out for all of the complexes studied.  The coordination of experimental work with the theoretical calculations helps to make the measurements more efficient, improves our understanding of the electronic structure of molecules and provides guidelines and experimental examples for improvements in ab initio, quantum chemistry calculations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transition metal complexes are very important in the chemical industry, in biological systems and as an area of study in inorganic chemistry.  Millions of tons of chemical products are produced each year using reactions which involve transition metal catalysts.  The active sites of many enzymes and transport proteins in living systems contain transition metal complexes.  A large fraction of the research and study in inorganic chemistry is focused on transition metal complexes, and the proposed work will provide new contributions to the structural database that is used in research, industry and education.  The proposed work will often involve smaller, "model" complexes, but will provide results relevant to the larger, more complex systems.   The accurate, three-dimensional structures for transition metal complexes, are helpful in understanding reaction mechanisms.  Successful modeling of reaction mechanisms in chemistry and biology often depends on the accurate and reliable experimental structural information.  Improving calculation methods and basis sets through correlation with new experimental data is useful because the calculations are presently the only source of detailed information on short-lived radicals or high-energy reaction intermediates.  Studies of metal dihydrogen complexes may provide information which will be useful for improving hydrogen storage technology.  Graduate and undergraduate research students will learn fundamentals of chemistry, quantum mechanics and methods and techniques involved in computer work, microwave electronics and making physical measurements through direct involvement in the proposed projects.  Participation in the research by underrepresented minorities and secondary school teachers, or non-Ph.D. college students will be actively sought for the proposed projects.</AbstractNarration>

The microwave spectra for BN-naphthalene were measured providing structural and electronic structure properties. The B-N bond length of 1.47 &Aring; and the planar structure indicate aromatic character of BN-naphthalene (shown in Fig. 3a.).&nbsp; A new compound, 1,2-BN cyclohexene (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>BN), (Fig. 3b), was produced from 1,2-BN cyclohexane through the loss of H<sub>2</sub> at 60&deg;C and characterized and identified using a pulsed-beam Fourier transform microwave spectrometer.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ OUTCOMES REPORT For NSF Award 1057796  (09/01/11-8/31/17)  Microwave Measurements of Structures and Electronic Properties of Transition Metal Complexes, Hydrogen-Bonded Complexes, and Radicals            This award from the National Science Foundation, Chemistry Division has allowed Professor Kukolich, students and coworkers to make significant new discoveries and substantial progress in three areas described below;   Doubly hydrogen bonded complexes, Aromatic ring compounds with a boron nitrogen fragment (B-N) and Structures for small organic molecules  1)  Measurements of the structures and dynamics of doubly hydrogen bonded complexes  Hydrogen bonds are rather weak chemical bonds but they play very important roles in chemistry and biology by coupling molecules together. In our genetic material, DNA, genetic information is selectively replicated from one DNA strand to another, and transcribed to messenger RNA, using specific hydrogen bonds and this is decoded to make specific proteins.  The genetic code is transferred using double hydrogen bonds between adenine and thymine (A-T) (Fig 1.) or triple hydrogen bonds between cytosine and guanine (C-G). These hydrogen-bonded pairs are usually viewed as "static structures" where the atoms do not move.  However, gas-phase, microwave spectroscopy measurements on the propiolic acid-formic acid doubly hydrogen bonded pair in our lab at the University of Arizona, clearly demonstrated that this doubly hydrogen bonded pair is not simply a static structure, but that there are large amplitude concerted tunneling motions of the hydrogen atoms involved in the hydrogen bonding. (Fig. 2)  Physicist L&ouml;wdin and chemists Catal&aacute;n and Kasha have proposed that these tunneling motions in DNA could cause mutations. Accurate structure information on this dimer was obtained in our lab. This concerted proton tunneling was also observed for the homodimer of 3-fluoro-benzoic acid, the largest doubly hydrogen bonded complex observed with microwave spectroscopy.  2) Measurements of structures and charge distributions for ring compounds with a boron nitrogen fragment (B-N) substituted for a carbon-carbon (C-C) fragment  Carbon ring molecules like benzene, the prototypical aromatic molecule have equal carbon-carbon bond lengths and nearly free travel of electrons around the ring and a sharing of the &pi;-electron clouds above and below the ring.  Professors Shih-Yuan Liu (Boston College) and Arthur Ashe (University of Michigan) have substituted boron-nitrogen atom pairs (B-N) for carbon-carbon pairs (C-C) into benzene to make azaborine, and into naphthalene to make B-N naphthalene (4a,8a-azaboranaphthalene).  These BN substituted compounds show considerable aromatic stabilization, but many other properties are significantly altered, leading to new applications. The microwave spectra for BN-naphthalene were measured providing structural and electronic structure properties. The B-N bond length of 1.47 &Aring; and the planar structure indicate aromatic character of BN-naphthalene (shown in Fig. 3a.).  A new compound, 1,2-BN cyclohexene (C4H10BN), (Fig. 3b), was produced from 1,2-BN cyclohexane through the loss of H2 at 60&deg;C and characterized and identified using a pulsed-beam Fourier transform microwave spectrometer. This is the first characterization of 1,2-BN cyclohexene,  a compound closely related to BN containing hydrogen storage compounds.  Bis-BN cyclohexane, with two B-N substitutions, is a potential hydrogen (H2) storage material. H2 has been proposed as an alternative auto fuel. The first microwave spectra for azaborine, (Fig. 3c) provided an accurate structure. The nitrogen quadrupole coupling strength, the planar structure, and nearly equal heavy atom bond lengths all support the aromatic character of this molecule. The modifications of arenes with BN substitutions extends our basic knowledge in organic chemistry and provides new useful materials and molecules.  3) Structures and charge distributions for small organic molecules   During this grant period, structural parameters and properties of the charge distributions (from measured quadrupole coupling parameters) were obtained for 14 small molecules. Deuterium quadrupole coupling constants of propiolic acids (Pro-OD and Pro-CD), 1-fluorobenzene (4-d1), and 1,2-difluorobenzene (4-d1) were measured. The microwave spectrum for a higher energy conformer of cyclopropanecarboxylic acid and determination of the gas phase structure of the ground state were measured. Rotational transitions were measured and analyzed to obtain nearly complete structures and some electronic properties for a) phthalimide, b) the monoenolic tautomer of 1,2- cyclohexanedione, c) maleimide, d) perfluoropentanoic acid, and e) phthalic anhydride.  Microwave spectra of 1-fluoronaphthalene and 2-fluoronaphthalene were measured to demonstrate the capabilities of our new large cavity (4ft mirrors) spectrometer (Fig. 4) for measurements on larger molecules.       The accurate, gas-phase molecular structures and electronic properties from the microwave measurements are extremely important to test and improve theoretical calculations.  The many different theoretical methods and basis sets often yield very different results and the true test of which methods are correct is comparison of the results with the experimental data.
