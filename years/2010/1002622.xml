<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This award supports experimental condensed-matter physics research on a new class of materials that are relevant to future energy applications and advanced electronic devices.  This class of materials exhibits new physical properties that cannot be understood with traditional ideas.  Using the complementary expertise of the investigators, this project will explore the fundamental physics underlying the new emergent phenomena, both at the surface and in the bulk, utilizing the most sophisticated growth and characterization techniques.  Any device application will utilize the properties of surfaces or interfaces. The ultimate goal is to address one of the grand challenges of materials science: how do complex phenomena emerge from simple ingredients?  This research project offers an ideal training ground for undergraduate and graduate students, post docs, and visiting scholars, exposing them in frontier scientific research.  In particular, two PhD students, supported through this project, will obtain hands-on experience in state-of-the-art instrumentation, and will be well trained for future careers either in academia, national laboratories, or industries.  In addition undergraduate students, who are "Chancellor's Future Leaders in Research," will spend several years during their undergraduate tenure involved with this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This research project is designed to study the surface and bulk physical properties of newly discovered transition-metal layered compounds.  This class of materials has characteristically strong coupling between charge, spin, lattice, and orbital degrees of freedom.  The physical properties of these materials are extremely susceptible to a subtle change either internally (chemical doping), or externally such as the creation of a surface, or the application of a magnetic field or pressure.  Using the complementary expertise of the investigators, this project will explore the fundamental physics underlying the emergent phenomena seen in the bulk or in the environment of broken symmetry generated by the creation of a surface.  Research and educational training will utilize the most sophisticated techniques for growth and characterization (on at atomic scale).  The ultimate goal is to address one of the grand challenges of materials science: how do complex phenomena emerge from simple ingredients?  Two PhD students, supported through this project, will have hands-on experience in frontier scientific research, and be well trained for careers either in academia, national laboratories, or industries.  The project will also involve two or more "Chancellor's Future Leaders in Research" undergraduate students during their four years as undergraduates at LSU.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report     This award supports experimental condensed-matter physics research on new classes of materials that are relevant to future energy applications and advanced electronic devices.  These classes of materials exhibit new physical properties that cannot be understood with traditional ideas.  The complementary expertise of two scientists, one on surface (one atomic layer) and the other on bulk, allows us to explore the fundamental physics underlying the emergent phenomena seen in both surface and bulk.   During the funding period, more than 15 materials systems have been studied both on the surface and in bulk, which are either superconductors and related compounds or electronic materials with magnetism or advanced thermal properties.  As highlighted below, our research has resulted in many discoveries, either new materials or new phenomena.  With full or partial support of this grant, we have published 20 papers in prestigious international journals including 3 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and 1 in Nature Scientific Reports.  In addition to 4 manuscripts that are under review, PIs were invited to write 3 book chapters (published).  Through the combined effort of two scientists, this research project offers an ideal training ground for undergraduates (we have 2 "ChancellorÆs Future Leaders in Research" participating in this project), graduate students (4 were partially supported by this grant), post docs and visiting scholars, exposing them to frontier scientific research.  Two Ph.D. students, supported through this project, are now Engineers at Segate, Inc.  In addition, both PIs had given 32 invited talks in conferences (domestic and international), university colloquiums and seminars, and public (undergraduates, high school students, parents, and community leaders).  Our ultimate goal is to address one of the grand challenges of materials science: how do complex phenomena emerge from simple ingredients? Through the studies of a series of new and complex materials, we find many complex phenomena are the consequence of strong coupling between charge, spin, lattice and orbital.  The coupling is even stronger on the surface compared to its bulk counter part.  Such knowledge, as illustrated in Image 1, is absolutely essential when considering the development of new electronic devices: (1) the properties at a surface or interface could be very different from its counter bulk, (2) the relationship between superconductivity and magnetism could be more intimate than believed by conventional wisdom, and (3) the surface properties are more susceptible to external parameters than the bulk.  The following describes our major discoveries due to this grant.  &middot; Coupled Structural-Magnetic Antiphase Domain Walls on BaFe2As2 (see Image 2). &middot; Anomalous Surface Lattice Dynamics in the Low-Temperature Phase of Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 (see Image 1a). &middot; Dual Roles of Substituted Co in Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2. &middot; New Layered Compound Ba2Mn2Sb2O with Antiferromagnetic Ordering. &middot; New Geometrically-Frustrated (Ba,Sr)4-xLa2xCo4O15 with Spin-Glassy Behavior. &middot; Evidence for the Coexistence of Superconductivity and Antiferromagnetism at the Surface of Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2. &middot; Observations of Three Magnetic Phases in Magnetic Conductor CaFe4As3 (see Image 3).  &middot; Observation of High Anisotropy in Physical Properties of Newly Discovered Superconducting Ca10Pt4As8((Fe1-xPtx)2As2)5. &middot; Doping Induced Inhomogeneous Chemical Distribution but Homogeneous Electronic Behavior in FeTe1-xSex (see Image 4).  &middot; Interplay between Superconductivity and Magnetism in Fe1-xPdxTe (see Image 1b). &middot; Manipulating Electronic and Magnetic Properties by Doping Mn in Sr3(Ru1-xMnx)2O7 (see Image 5).
