<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the choices that US legislative candidates make in their campaigns as strategic members of a collective party organization. The central question motivating the project is: When do congressional candidates run with or away from their party at election time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addressing this question, the project aims to fill three major gaps in extant political science research. First, due to the lack of historical advertising data, we know relatively little about the kinds of issues and statements candidates typically raise in their campaigns, especially for elections prior to 2000. Second, we have only a limited understanding of the role that parties play in these elections and of change over time in that role. Finally, the most widely held view of parties in congressional organization is based on the largely untested assumption that the electoral prospects of party candidates are strongly linked to the fates of the parties? reputations in Congress. According to this view, candidates have a restricted ability to develop campaign strategies to deal with good and bad partisan election swings. Yet no systematic analysis is available to appraise this fundamental assumption or to explore the messages actually issued by candidates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the strategic statements communicated directly by candidates in their advertisements over the last forty years. The primary research task will be to code and analyze the content of the over 80,000 radio and television congressional ads housed at the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive, at the University of Oklahoma. The ads will be examined through a combination of traditional and computer-automated approaches, in order to assess the kinds of issues the candidates raise, the sorts of images and references they make about the parties and party leaders, and the frequency with which they make clear, ambiguous, or inconsistent statements over time and across districts. The research will also evaluate the level of coordination that is exhibited within parties on similar election messages as each party grows more ideologically extreme and unified. The project will also conduct survey experiments aimed at addressing the behavioral foundations of partisan candidate strategies and the ways that those strategies might be linked to the information available to voters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will make several broader contributions. The campaign data collected in the project will be of interest to scholars in multiple areas, including media and communication, social and public policy, economics, and political science. The computer-based coding method developed and used in this project could find additional application in such fields as linguistics and legal scholarship. The datasets and findings from the project will shed light on a range of important aspects of contemporary US politics, and may prove to be a resource for teachers, journalists, and policy-makers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The dissertation project funded by this Dissertation Improvement Grant seeks to understand how it is that Congress has increasingly polarized on most major issues across parties, while voters in congressional districts and states have remained essentially moderate in opinion.  If voters want more moderate policies enacted in Congress, why don't they simply defeat their out-of-step incumbents?  The argument advanced in this project is that candidates can use the campaign to influence how voters perceive their prior legislative records, winning reelection as polarized candidates by presenting themselves as much more centrist and bipartisan.  In addressing this puzzle, the project evaluates the way in which House and Senate candidates communicate to voters through their television campaign commercials at election time, and to see if these ads influence voters' attitudes and choices when deciding who to support.  The Dissertation Improvement Grant primarily funded field research to conduct on-site coding and analysis of 12,692 political advertisements from House and Senate races over forty years of elections between 1968 and 2008.  The advertisements were analyzed to see what issues the candidates raise in the campaign, how they talk about their records and positions, and how they characterize their opponents, among many other items.  The main findings suggest that House and Senate candidates are increasingly talking about policy and legislation in their 30-second ad spots, and that this policy information is growing more specific and detailed.  However, candidates are discussing only parts of their legislative records, notably those that portray them as in line with the majority of the electorate. Thus, candidates shy away from talking about parts of their record that portray them as more ideological, partisan or extreme.  Moreover, these selective advertising strategies have real effects.  Voters exposed to more moderate campaign ads give a significant boost to candidates compared to otherwise similar voters who receive more ideological or partisan messages.  This latter finding suggests that at least part of the process of polarization underway in Congress is being driven by candidates' campaign efforts that limit the ability of voters to hold them to account for their policy positions and legislative actions.  These findings are significant to the study of political campaigns and elections, Congress, and partisanship in the U.S. The electoral connection is the basic link that connects voters to their representatives.  The periodic threat of electoral defeat at the hands of a dissatisfied electorate is the most significant way in which voters can direct the policy actions of officials in Washington.  If campaign advertising weakens this connection by allowing out-of-step officials to repeatedly win in spite of their records, then this seriously recasts our understanding of the incentives that drive legislators in Congress, and that motivates their willingness to cooperate (or not) across party lines and across the other branches of government.  Also, campaigns may provide important opportunities for voters to acquire information about the policy-making process in Congress.  If candidates present skewed images of their activities, this may reduce the quality of information voters may have access to and use, perhaps leading to worse representational outcomes over time.  More broadly, the findings, data, and methods developed in this project may help journalists, students, and other researchers gain a better understanding of the kinds of issues or debates that are most relevant in particular historical elections, as well as over a significant part of America's evolving democracy.
