<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this research is to develop a single-molecule superresolution imaging technique that enables direct probing of high-resolution structures and dynamics of bacterial cytoskeletons in single living E. coli cells.  Based on the newly developed photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), this research pushes PALM imaging to its limit by developing novel strategies to accommodate high-speed, high density multicolor imaging in single living E. coli cells. If successfully developed, this technique will transform current studies of bacterial cytoskeletons and enable researchers to uncover structural and dynamic details of bacterial cytoskeletons at a spatial-temporal resolution level that is not available with current approaches. The direct outcome from this work will be: (1) optimized imaging strategies for single-, two- and three-color superresolution imaging in living E. coli cells; (2) a complete package of PALM imaging protocol and reconstruction algorithm that allow high-speed, high-density mapping of molecule positions; and (3) elucidation of time-dependent structural evolution of bacterial cytoskeletons at the nanometers resolution level during the cell cycle in single living E. coli cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The development of a live-cell, multicolor superresolution imaging technique will be far-reaching in many ways. First, the new imaging technique will be particularly powerful for bacterial cell biologists.  In the past scientists have to rely on diffraction-limited immunofluorescence or conventional FP fluorescence imaging methods to visualize cellular structures in small bacterial cells because EM are its related high resolution imaging techniques are not fruitful in identifying bacterial cellular structures. Second, although specifically tailored to E. coli cells, the basic imaging concepts and principles of the new technique can be generalized to allow its application to higher eukaryotic cells. Third, once developed, the imaging protocols and post-imaging analysis algorithms will be disseminated and distributed to a wide range of research communities. Finally, successful completion of this work requires an interdisciplinary team that has expertise in biology, chemistry, physics and engineering, providing excellent training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co funded by the Genes and Genome Systems and the Cellular Systems Clusters within the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    During the time supported by the NSF EAGER award, we published three research articles [1-3], one invited review [4], and one video protocol [5].  We currently have one research article [6], one invited review [7] submitted, and one research manuscript in preparation [8]. Below I summarize the main intellectual merit and broader impact of our work.  Intellectual Merit                The main goal of the project is to develop live-cell, multi-color superresolution imaging techniques to investigate the structure and dynamics of bacterial cytoskeletons. We have successfully achieved this goal by carefully selecting compatible photoactivatable fluorescent proteins, designing parallel imaging channels and optimizing imaging conditions [6]. We have also developed computational algorithms to analyze clustering and colocalization of protein structures in superresolution images [2, 3, 6]. We applied these methods to investigate the structure and dynamics of the E. coli cytokinesis machinery, the FtsZ-ring, and its associated proteins [1, 3, 6]. In one recent work using two-color superresolution imaging in live E. coli cells [6], we investigated the relative spatial arrangement between FtsZ and two of its associated proteins ZapA and ZapB. We found that in ~ 80% of cells ZapA and FtsZ overlapped, but in the remaining cells ZapA appeared to bridge FtsZ filaments. For ZapB and FtsZ, strikingly, we observed that ZapB structures appeared to be encompassed by FtsZ. The relative radial displacement between ZapB and FtsZ is ~ 40 nm. A coordinate-based cross-correlation analysis [9, 10] further corroborated these observations. These structural deviations would be difficult to observe in conventional fluorescence light microscopy. In summary, these results indicate that ZapA may bridge FtsZ polymers to promote FtsZ-ring assembly and that ZapB may assemble internal to the FtsZ-ring, lending support to a previously-proposed concentric ring model for FtsZ-ring stabilization[11].    Broader Impact        We have widely disseminated our research results in addition to peer-reviewed publications. Different aspects of the work were presented more than thirty times at various academic institutions and international conferences in the past four years. E. coli strains developed and data acquired during the study have been requested multiple times by other research groups sharing similar interest. The  superresolution imaging methods we developed have also enabled us to establish multiple collaborations with other research groups across world.     References     1.         Fu, G., T. Huang, J.
