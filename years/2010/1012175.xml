<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division,  Professor Philip Grandinetti of the Ohio State University will develop new nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods for elucidating structure in non-crystalline materials.   There are many unresolved questions in these materials regarding atomic structure at different levels, from short range, i.e., first coordination sphere structural distributions, to intermediate range, e.g., chain and ring size statistics.   It is possible for NMR to provide information at all these levels, either alone, or complemented by other measurements or modeling.  To do this, however, much work is needed to build up an infrastructure of methods and a full understanding of the relationships between NMR parameters and structure.   Structural distributions obtained in this project will be valuable in confirming thermodynamic models of glasses and melts, models for ionic transport, and also in refining potentials in molecular dynamics simulations of structure and dynamics in glasses. Such details can have far reaching impact.  For example, radioactive waste is commonly mixed into glass melts for long term containment, and environmental policy decisions will require accurate scientific data on the long term effectiveness of glass as a storage material, which in turn, will require a deeper understanding of transport properties that depends strongly on the atomic level structure.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new methodologies will also impact other fields such as ceramics, catalysts, biopolymers, which can utilize the same resources and methodology developed for our applications.   The long term goal of this project is to create standard NMR protocols and software for materials scientists enabling them to obtain enough atomic and molecular level structure statistics to design and synthesize new materials. Beyond materials science applications, methods developed in this project for selective NMR excitation of quadrupolar nuclei in solids can even be used for contrast in magnetic resonance imaging, and could eventually lead to improved medical diagnosis and treatment.   As such, one can expect a number of these magnetic resonance methodologies to be incorporated into commercial products.  Students trained in this project include members of various under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is one of the most powerful, yet underutilized, technique for characterizing structure and dynamics in materials science.  In this NSF funded project the Grandinetti lab at Ohio State University made a number of innovative advances in nuclear magnetic resonance methodologies that enable its usage in a greater number of materials applications.  These advances include (1) the theoretical development of graphical diagrams called symmetry pathways for greater ease in describing and designing magnetic resonance experiments, (2) a new method called phase incremented echo train acquisition that eliminates troublesome signal artifacts&ndash;this method has far-reaching impact for enhancing sensitivity and the measurement of relaxation behavior and J couplings&ndash;and (3) more sensitive and robust methods for the measuring the elusive but richer information content of the full nuclear moment interaction tensors. The Grandinetti lab demonstrated these new methodological advances in a number of non-crystalline materials, where conventional diffraction techniques often fail in structural characterization.   The Grandinetti lab first introduced the symmetry pathway concept in 2011.  In this approach two fundamental pathways called the spatial pathway and the spin transition pathway describe a magnetic resonance experiment. Given the nuclear spin system's spatial and spin transition pathways during an NMR experiment, a series of related symmetry pathways can be derived which show when and which NMR frequency contributions in the sample will refocus into spin echoes.  These symmetry pathway diagrams can reduce the need for complicated mathematical analyses and provide an intuitive and powerful new tool for designing new magnetic resonance experiments as well as providing a new pedagogical approach for understanding magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging.  One of the oldest magnetic resonance experiments used in the sciences and medicine is the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence. Applications are diverse, ranging from measuring T2 weighted images in MRI to measuring rock porosity in oil-well logging.  A well-understood problem with CPMG is that its signal contains a number of artifacts that lead to errors in measured T2 values and J couplings.  While developing magnetic resonance methods for boosting NMR sensitivity the Grandinetti lab found a solution to this long-standing problem by using an overlooked Fourier relationship between the excitation phase and p symmetry pathways. Because of the ubiquity of the echo train acquisition in magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging, the new method, dubbed phase incremented echo train acquisition (PIETA), has truly broad impact on nearly every subfield of magnetic resonance.  When a sample rotates in a magnetic field, its magnetic resonance spectrum splits into a centerband resonance flanked by spinning sidebands at integer multiples of the spinning speed. While spinning sideband resonances are often perceived as a spectral complication to be eliminated, they also contain valuable information about the full tensorsial character of the nuclear moment couplings.  The full coupling tensors between the electric and magnetic moments of the nucleus and surrounding electric and magnetic fields are rich with information about microscopic structure and dynamics.  In this project the Grandinetti lab developed a number of improved methods for measuring and extracting nuclear spin interaction tensors from spinning sidebands including increased sensitivity through the use of PIETA.     The NMR methods developed in this project and the tensors measured in silicate glass were used to identify and measure the distribution of anionic species in two magnesium silicate glasses whose conventional magic-angle spinning NMR spectra are completely unresolved. In these studies different anionic species in the magnesium silicate glass were discovered, revealing a large ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
