<AbstractNarration>Ten fifth and sixth grade science teacher specialists and their students in a high needs district in Ohio are engaged in a design-based research project within a three-year professional development effort with faculty in several departments at the University of Cincinnati to study how the engineering design process can be used effectively as a pedagogical strategy in science instruction to improve student interest, learning and skill development.  Stage 1 of the exploratory project is articulation of engineering design, science content, and scientific inquiry using teacher learning teams to identify effective curriculum structures and instructional strategies, including the development of instructional materials.  Stage 2 focuses on student outcomes on standardized tests and authentic assessments and improved student problem solving skills.  The project is embedded in a revision of the Ohio Science Standards in which science content is juxtaposed with 21st century skills and other content areas.  Dissemination is through the Cincinnati STEM Network, the Ohio State STEM Learning Network and through professional organizations and publications.  The University of Cincinnati Evaluation Services Center evaluates the processes and outcomes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research seeks to define STEM education and develop needed resources to support the teaching and learning of STEM.  The operationalization of STEM education requires teachers to infuse engineering into the usual school subjects of mathematics and science.  The research seeks to understand how STEM can be operationalized in the elementary classroom and focuses on investigating how a real-world, authentic approach articulating science and eventually mathematics with engineering does indeed increase student engagement and motivation for learning all three subjects.  The research issues address what articulation of engineering design and science inquiry looks like in the classroom and the challenges to articulating them.  The research also investigates the skills and habits of mind that can be taught this way and the impact on student achievement.  The evaluation determines how well the research adheres to the processes and timeline developed and monitors impacts on teacher and students.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Articulating engineering design with science content and scientific inquiry emphasizes the authentic investigation and real world problem solving that increases student interest in STEM content and improves student learning and achievement in science and mathematics.  The research will contribute to understanding of  how this STEM education can be operationalized in the elementary classroom.  This study takes into account the complexity of the classroom and provides a situated context that could be used to inform other school contexts.</AbstractNarration>

First, through a multi-year professional development effort and a two-year case study, we found that, in order for teachers to most effectively integrate engineering design in their classrooms, they need to be supported in order to use the engineering design process as an orienting framework for the students&rsquo; learning; make the connections between science and engineering explicit to students; and incorporate instructional support strategies of brainstorming, troubleshooting, probing questioning as well as discussions of properties of materials. Second, we recognized that there was very little developed curricula to support the integration of engineering design with novel technologies, such as 3D printing. Those curricula that did exist utilized the 3D printing technology as an &ldquo;exciting tool&rdquo; without substantially adding to student learning. Thus, we developed 2 units (Inventor&rsquo;s Showcase 3D and 3D Grand Prix) that more fully integrated 3D printing and engineering design. Third, we partnered with a community STEM education outreach arm of the University of Cincinnati (Greater Cincinnati STEM Collaborative) to implement after-school 3D Printer Clubs across the greater Cincinnati tristate region using the Inventor&rsquo;s Showcase curriculum. During &nbsp;the 2015-2016 &nbsp;school &nbsp;year, &nbsp;195 &nbsp;5th-9th &nbsp;grade &nbsp;students &nbsp;joined &nbsp;13 3D Printers Clubs at 13 different schools across&nbsp;Greater&nbsp;Cincinnati; &nbsp;embracing &nbsp;the &nbsp;outstanding &nbsp;opportunity &nbsp;to learn &nbsp;with a hot, cool, &nbsp;new &nbsp;technology. &nbsp;Over &nbsp;the course &nbsp;of the 10-week &nbsp;club, &nbsp;students &nbsp;used &nbsp;engineering &nbsp;and problem-solving processes &nbsp;to design, draw,&nbsp;and&nbsp;produce &nbsp;solutions &nbsp;to real &nbsp;problems using 3D printers. The&nbsp;after-school format, combined&nbsp;with&nbsp;a hands-on,&nbsp;project-based,&nbsp;problem-solving curriculum and&nbsp;supportive&nbsp;adults,&nbsp;created&nbsp;an environment&nbsp;for students&nbsp;to gain confidence, develop problem-solving and technical skills, and become more aware of exciting and rewarding STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) career opportunities. Significant results include: 55% increase in strong agreement about the importance of learning to design new things; 40% increase in strong agreement about usefulness of technology to solve real-world problems; 17% increase in strong agreement that STEM has a lot to do with their lives; 15% increase in strong agreement that they could better look at situations and problems in different ways; and, 12% increase in strong agreement that they understood the value of learning new technologies.
