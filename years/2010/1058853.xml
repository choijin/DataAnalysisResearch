<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the international conference "Frontiers in Complex Dynamics" that will be held from February 21-25, 2011, in Banff, Alberta, Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus primarily on topics in the theory of holomorphic dynamics in one and several variables (e.g., dynamics and parameter spaces for higher dimensional holomorphic dynamics; renormalization, local connectivity, and area of Julia sets; iterated monodromy groups and laminations) but will also include talks on related areas. The unifying theme of the conference is the impressive body of work that John Milnor has contributed to the field, helping to make it one of the richest, most beautiful, and most active research areas in analysis. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The conference Frontiers in Complex Dynamics (Celebrating John Milnor) was held at the Banff Center in Banff, Canada  from Feb 21-25, 2011.  The focus of the meeting was to foster interaction between holomorphic dynamics and allied fields such as several complex variables, Teichmueller theory, self-similar groups, hyperbolic and algebraic geometry, statistical physics, etc.  The meeting proved to be the major conference in the field of complex dynamics that year.  The goal of the project was to enable younger mathematicians (graduate students, postdocs, and early carreer mathematicians) to attend the meeting and interact with senior mathematicians.  Residual funds were used to support junior mathematicians to attend the conference Geometric and Algebraic Structures in Mathematics held at Stony Brook May 26-June 4 2011.  Intellectual merit:  The mathematical content of the meeting was at the highest level.  There were more than 25 lectures, and the meeting was attended by matematicans of the highest caliber, including several Fields medalists, winners of the Wolff prize, and so on.  The talks covered areas at the cutting edge of research in complex dynamics and allied fields, as well as several surveys.  Videos of the talks can be found at http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~jackfest/Videos/ and a volume of proceedings is expected to be published in 2012.  Broader impact: The direct impact of the NSF funding was to enable 43 young US mathematicians to attend the meeting in Banff, which otherwise would have been prohibitively expensive.  Twelve of these were women, and the supported group was geographically and ethnically diverse, coming from all parts of the US.  Attending the conference had a significant positive impact on the careers of these mathematicians.  The mix of junior and senior mathematicans at the conference, and of people from various related disciplines, led to significant cross-pollination and collaboration.
