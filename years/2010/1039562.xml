<AbstractNarration>1039562&lt;br/&gt;Wax&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop a novel quantitative phase microscope for investigating and analyzing changes in cellular structure and function due to environmental influences and pathology due to disease. To achieve this goal, a hybrid optical interferometric imaging and sensing system is proposed, combining low-coherence wide-field digital interferometry (WFDI), capable of visualizing fast cellular dynamics, with a novel optical coherence tomography (OCT) approach that uses photothermal heating of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) to achieve molecular imaging.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of the low-coherence WFDI system is to visualize cell dynamics in order to assess modulation of cell function due to external influences. This transmission-mode system will quantitatively record optical path delays of light that has been transmitted through the sample, and thus will create quantitative phase images of local refractive index changes. This information can be used to characterize dynamic cell phenomena, as well as to account for transport of intracellular materials, which can characterize various types of disease. The OCT system will be used to detect molecular species such as cell surface receptors and the location and density of intracellular proteins. Gold NPs, functionalized to bind to specific molecules, will be heated selectively using the photothermal method, with excitation tuned to the NP plasmon resonance wavelength, to enable molecularly selective sensing by OCT. The hybrid system is expected to allow a wide range of studies of cellular dynamics, while the combination of the two sub-systems (WFDI and OCT) will enable investigation of modulation of dynamic behaviors due to onset and progression of disease.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this research has been to develop a novel microscope for studying cell structure and function.  The unique aspect of this microscope is that it is based on holographic imaging, which can provide quantitative phase information.  Phase microscopy is well known in cell biology in modalities such as phase contrast microscopy for its ability to provide information on largely transparent objects such as biological cells.  Our approach records quantitative phase information with high precision and accuracy, enabling studies which investigate and analyze subtle changes in cellular features which can arise due to environmental influences and pathology due to disease. The holography approach used here is capable of visualizing fast cellular dynamics, limited only by the frame rate of the camera.  Further, we have extended this approach by bringing in two additional aspects that provide functional information on the cell images.  First, we have implemented a spectroscopic phase imaging approach that reveals the dependence of cell features on the wavelength of light.  This can provide highly useful information on cell components which absorb light such as hemoglobin content of red blood cells.  In order to assess the molecular content of cells which do not have their own unique spectroscopic feature, we have also incorporated a means of detecting gold nanoparticles which have been functionalized to adhere to molecules of interest.  The gold nanoparticles are gently heated using optical excitation to produce a subtle phase shift which can then be detected within our holography scheme.  As a major research instrumentation development project, this was a highly successful effort which generated many publications on development and application of phase microscopy, especially upon adding the unique elements of spectroscopic and molecular contrast.  Significantly, the developed instrument was highly interesting to various collaborators at our university and beyond.  The publication list includes eight researchers beyond our research group who have collaborated on this project.  Further, this project has served as an outstanding platform for training of the next generation of scientists. Two postdocs have worked on this project and now both head their own research groups (Zhu, Va. Tech, Shaked, Tel Aviv University).  Four graduate students have also contributed to this project with one recently succsefully defending his thesis on the topic of this instrument development (Rinehart, PhD Duke University BME, 2014).
