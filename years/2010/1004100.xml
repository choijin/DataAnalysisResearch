<AbstractNarration>The existence of dark matter is known from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility motivated by other considerations in elementary particle physics is that dark matter consists of undiscovered elementary particles. Axions and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are two possibilities. The thermal motion of the WIMPS comprising the dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy and the earth should result in WIMP-nuclear collisions of sufficient energy to be observable by sensitive laboratory apparatus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to develop and deploy a small liquid argon detector that has high sensitivity for direct detection of WIMP collisions. This detector, DarkSide-50, builds on past experience and introduces innovative features that will allow it to operate in a background-free mode and thereby achieve a significant science result in spite of its relatively small size. At the same time, this detector will serve as a prototype for a future multi-ton detector. The main innovations being introduced:&lt;br/&gt;- Underground argon depleted in radioactive 39Ar;&lt;br/&gt;- Low background, high-quantum-efficiency QUPID photo-detectors; and&lt;br/&gt;- A compact high-efficiency external veto for neutrons.&lt;br/&gt;These innovations, together with the powerful two-parameter background rejection features of argon will result in a detector of unprecedented background-free performance. DarkSide-50 will either detect WIMP dark matter or exclude a substantial fraction of the favored parameter space. DarkSide-50 will benefit from the facility for extraction and refinement of depleted argon, independently funded by the NSF through a grant to Princeton University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: this activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer an excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute to the success of a cutting edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; (3) it will support continued development of successful E&amp;O programs such as the Princeton-Abruzzo-South Dakota summer school for high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dark Matter was first suggested in the 1930Æs based on studying clusters of galaxies and later confirmed by studies of stars inside galaxies.  Evidence for the existence of dark matter is mown compelling, but its nature remains a fundamental mystery.  Particularly intriguing is the possibility that dark matter is made of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).  WIMPs may be directly detected by their collisions with nuclei on Earth, the but low expected rate of collisions and the low energy of the recoil requires very large detectors with extremely low background rates.   The DarkSide program uses liquid argon as the medium for WIMP detection.  In this project weÆve constructed a detector to house about 50 kg of liquid argon underground in the LNGS laboratory in Italy.  Argon was chosen because of its ability to separate nuclear recoil events from events induced by beta and gamma interactions.  There are a few elements of the DarkSide program that are novel 1) we are going to use extremely low radioactivity photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 2) we are going to use argon that was extracted from an underground well, and 3) we are going to use active shields.  PMTÆs can form a dominant background, and the collaboration is actively working with a manufacturer to produce new lower radioactive PMTs.  Argon is exceptionally good as a medium to detect WIMPs, however normal argon contains 39Ar which is a radioactive element that acts as an internal background.  The underground argon we have found has at least a factor of 150 less 39Ar. The active shielding will allow us to identify backgrounds when they interact in the shields so that we can veto events at the same time in the detector.   The DarkSide detector is currently operating with less than ideal PMTs because the lower radioactivity ones were not stable, and we are taking data with normal above ground argon.  This allows us to take a "background rich" data sample over the course of weeks or months with more background then weÆd expect in a multi-year sample. This sample can test our techniques for removing those backgrounds.  This sample also uses our active shielding and allows us to calibrate the detector with radioactive sources.  Then in fall we will redeploy the detector with the underground argon and begin taking physics quality data.   This grant has supported Augustana CollegeÆs participation in DarkSide.  It has supported many undergraduates and given them real experience working on cutting edge physics.  Augustana College students have participated in operations of the prototype detector, simulations studies, and studies of the underground argon.   The most recent work has focused on creating an on campus PMT test facility.       Last Modified: 04/02/2014       Submitted by: Andrew K Alton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
