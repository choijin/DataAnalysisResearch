<AbstractNarration>1038198&lt;br/&gt;Rodgers&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This proposal is to support a planning visit by a US team including Dr. Denise Rodgers of Geohazard International, Dr. Khalid Mosalam, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of California, Berkeley; Dr. Gregory Deierlein, Dept. of CEE, Stanford Univ.; Mr. David Mar, Principal Engineer, Tipping Mar + Associates, Berkeley, California to Nepal for meetings with: Dr. Sahibzada F. A. Rafeeqi, Dean, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture and Dr. Sarosh Hashmat Lodi, Chair, Dept. of Civil Engineering, both at NED Univ. of Engineering and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan; Dr. Jishnu Subedi, Chief, Research &amp; Training Unit, Dept. of Civil Engineering, Tribhuvan Univ. Institute of Engineering, Kathmandu, Nepal; Mr. Surya Narayan Shrestha, Deputy Exec. Dir., National Society for Earthquake Technology- Nepal, Kathmandu, Nepal.   They plan to discuss developing a joint research project for developing low-cost materials for buildings to withstand earthquake forces. Non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings with unreinforced masonry infill walls are very common in many developing countries, including Pakistan, Nepal and others with high levels of earthquake hazard. Many cities in the United States with substantial seismic hazard also contain older buildings of this type. As recent earthquakes in Italy, Algeria, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Taiwan, and China have demonstrated, these buildings are prone to substantial structural damage, up to and including collapse, during strong ground shaking. Addressing the problem requires an international, cooperative effort to develop appropriate solutions deployable in areas across the socioeconomic spectrum. The proposed collaboration will be primarily between Pakistan and the U.S., but because of the security situation there, the proposed visit will be in Nepal, which will also allow Nepalese scientists to participate. The participating countries bring different strengths to bear on a shared problem. Pakistan recently suffered a devastating earthquake, learned lessons from rebuilding efforts, and is beginning to develop experimental research capabilities. Nepal has a vibrant civil society focused on grass-roots earthquake risk mitigation. The U.S. has extensive experience in experimental research and engineering practice. The purpose of the visit will be to utilize these different strengths to define collaborative research proposals to improve the earthquake resistance of this very common type of building system, and to foster relationships that will lead to new collaborations to reduce seismic risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  During strong earthquake shaking, non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings with masonry infill walls can suffer a variety of structural failures, ranging from collapses of infill structural walls to global collapse. Through recent and ongoing research, the earthquake engineering community is making good progress on understanding the behavior of such buildings. However, only a limited number of solutions to improve their seismic performance are now available, and even fewer of the available solutions are low-cost options broadly applicable to reduce earthquake risk both in the U.S. and abroad. The planning visit will define research proposals to investigate methods to improve seismic behavior for both existing and new construction. In Pakistan and Nepal and other developing countries, new buildings of this type will continue to be built for the foreseeable future, primarily for economic reasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: It is expected that the research defined during this visit will create cost-effective seismic retrofit solutions that can be broadly applied in the developing world and the U.S.  Retrofit solutions investigated and validated through the proposed collaboration will have a greater likelihood of being applied, because they will fully consider developing-country perspectives, conditions, and socioeconomic constraints. U.S. researchers will gain valuable understanding of developing-country building conditions and constraints, which will enable them to be full participants and leaders in global earthquake risk reduction efforts.  &lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Division of Civil, Mechanical, Manufacturing Innovation Systems and the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
