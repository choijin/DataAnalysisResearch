<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the course of the NSF proposal, the PI has completed 3 works with a total of 3 coauthors.  The works are described below.    I. Critical Percolation   Here the situation under study can be thought of as a binary model on a hexagonal type lattice which tile some given ``domain'' (basically any bounded shape in 2 dimensions).  The configurations under study are formed by coloring each hexagon blue or yellow by flipping a coin (we can also address some rather complicated variants of this).   Such percolation models are useful for modeling a variety of physical and social phenomena.   One obvious object of study is the crossing probability, e.g., when the underlying shape is a rectangle, we may ask how likely it is that there is a monochrome connected cluster of hexagons connecting the left side to the right side.  Moreover, since such models are typically used to model large systems (i.e., many hexagons) it is of tremendous interest to consider the answer to this question as we tile the domain with smaller (and hence more) hexagons.  It turns out that the answer approaches a definitive quantity as the size of hexagons goes to zero.  Here the PI and coauthors provide a quantitative description as to how quickly this limiting answer is arrived at.  Many existing tools were employed and in addition, a non--trivial back and forth -- but terminating -- algorithm has been constructed in order to explore and measure the domain based on answers to crossing probability questions in subdomains.    II. Hamiltonian ODE   Hamiltonian formalism yields the position and momentum of a particle as partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian (total energy).  In this work, the PI and coauthors study the evolution of distributions of particles which evolve according to a given Hamiltonian, permitting some interactions amongst the particles.  Most importantly, the work here addresses systems which feature potentials which enable particles to reach infinity in finite time.  It is established in this work that solutions exist for these systems.  This is done by introducing an approximation where particles lose mass proportional to their speed and distance traveled and showing that this approximation is valid, i.e., converges to the original dynamics.  While the equation for such systems can be written in the form of a continuity equation describing fluids, here a Lagrangian perspective is taken where the measure is envisioned as a weighted collection of particle trajectories and various results are established by classifying the behavior of these trajectories.    III. Non--Conservative McKean--Vlasov Dynamics   Nonlinear evolution equations of the form studied here are used to model e.g., chemotaxis.  There is a ``free energy'' associated with the system and the system evolves to minimize the free energy, i.e., through ``work'' the free energy is dissipated.  In this work, the PI and coauthor study such an equation on a torus which is derived from an interacting particle model where the total mass of the system is not conserved; here it is established that there is exponential convergence to the equilibrium, independently of the size of the torus.  The equilibrium is known to be uniform in this case and the dynamics can be envisioned as an evolution of a collection of particles which are both transported and reweighed in time; alternatively, the reweighing can be understood to mean that particles appear or disappear at a location depending on how the current density there deviates from the equilibrium.   To study the convergence to equilibrium, an underlying abstract framework (which generalizes notions from Euclidean geometry) is introduced which explicitly realizes this evolution as a ``gradient flow'', i.e., at each step, the density evolves in the direction which most minimizes the free energy; this generalizes a similar framework used to study systems with mass conservation -- via connections to the optimal transportation problem.
