<AbstractNarration>This International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program in the Division of Chemistry, with supplemental funds provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) at NSF, supports collaborative work by Professor Nicholas J. Turro of Columbia University and Professor Bernhard Kraeutler of the University of Innsbruck, who is supported by the Austrian Science Foundation, to carry out fundamental studies on chlorophyll degradation.  Chlorophyll, because of its role in photosynthesis in plants, is one of the most important and best studied molecules in the life sciences. The team at the University of Innsbruck investigates "how" chlorophyll is degraded in leaves and in fruit by isolating and characterizing chlorophyll degradation products.  The principal investigator at Columbia and his international team study the important photochemistry of chlorophyll degradation products.  Investigation of the photochemistry of the degradation products of chlorophyll may provide an understanding of "why" these naturally formed degradation products are produced in enormous quantities every year. Since some of these natural products emit visible light after being excited by ultraviolet light this phenomenon provides a new means of obtaining insights into cell death processes of plants in a non-invasive manner by photoluminescence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposal are significant and range from the training of students to a fundamental understanding of the role that chlorophyll degradation products may have on a variety of biological processes.  The PI at Columbia has initiated an internet collaboration laboratory (iCollaboratory) to promote the use of audiovisual techniques to communicate with his research collaborators in the United States and abroad.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chlorophyll, because of its role in photosynthesis in plants, is one of the most important molecules in nature.  A signature of chlorophyll in plants is its characteristic green color.  This color, along with the chlorophyll molecules, is transformed in leaves in the Fall season, as evidenced by their spectacular color changes.  These color changes are triggered by metabolic processes that produce chlorophyll breakdown products, termed catabolites.      This chlorophyll catabolism also occurs in common fruits, such as bananas.  The conversion of the peel of a banana from green (unripe) to yellow (ripe) is a direct visual observation of chlorophyll catabolism.  We found that when yellow bananas are viewed under UV light, they show a blue fluorescence (see Image 1).  We identified this fluorophore as a hypermodified fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite, which is resistant against further degradation.  Brown spots on banana peals mark the beginning of cell death.  Under UV light, intensely blue glowing halos are observable around these brown spots.  We identified the structure of the fluorophore as a secondary hypermodified fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite.      Detailed photophysical investigations of hypermodified fluorescent chlorophyll catabolites showed that they generate efficiently singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of molecular oxygen.  Although singlet oxygen exists only for a short period of time, it is toxic to the plant cell.  Because the sensitizer, the persistent hypermodified fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite, which generates singlet oxygen, is predominantly located around brown spots on banana peals (dying cells), the generated singlet oxygen might function as defense against infection by pathogens.      We investigated the photophysical properties of several chlorophyll catabolites, such as the red chlorophyll catabolite (early stage of the metabolic cycle) and yellow chlorophyll catabolite (final stage of the metabolic cycle; see Image 2).  These studies enhance our knowledge on the impact and role of chlorophyll catabolites in nature.  It shows that chlorophyll catabolites are not just waste products by nature.  Chlorophyll catabolites are generated during ripening or senescence and may have important physiological roles, such as optical signaling to certain frugivors and may function as antioxitants.
