<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dr. Paulette N. Willis was awarded the Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship from the National Science Foundation from 2010-2013.  During her time as an NSF postdoctoral fellow she had 2 research papers accepted to peer reviewed journals and 2 additional research papers submitted to peer reviewed journals.  Dr. Willis also attended several national and international conferences to present her work.  This grant allowed Dr. Willis to expand her circle of collaborators nationally and internationally and travel to various locations to work with them.  In addition to Dr. Willis's research accomplishments, she also worked closely with the NSF funded National Alliance for Doctoral Studies in the Mathematical Sciences to aid in increasing the number of students from underrepresented groups who go on to pursue advanced degrees.  Her efforts have been instrumental in expanding the number of universities and mentors involved in the Alliance.  Dr. Willis has also personally mentored students which has lead to several students pursuing or planning to pursue advanced degrees in the mathematical sciences.  The prestige of this grant along with the reduced teaching load this grant provided was key in allowing Dr. Willis the freedom to pursue her personal commitment to students from underrepresented groups.  Dr. Paulette N. Willis is grateful to the NSF for providing her with this fabulous and exciting opportunity.       Last Modified: 06/10/2013       Submitted by: Paulette N Willis]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
