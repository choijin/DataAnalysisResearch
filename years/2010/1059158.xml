<AbstractNarration>Dr. Matthew Muterspaugh, Dr. Geoffrey Burks, and a postdoctoral scholar from Tennessee State University (TSU) are partnering with Dr. Jerry Edelstein and Dr. David Erskine from University of California, Berkeley to promote the pursuit of graduate studies for TSU students and to advance the astronomical application of Externally Dispersed Interferometry (EDI) at Berkeley.  Three programs support these goals.  First, new programs for engaging astronomy students will be built through curriculum development efforts.  These tools are publicly available so other universities can use them to encourage students.  Second, Berkeley's highly successful Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program (URAP) team will help TSU to implement a centralized, campus-wide system for connecting students with local, on-campus research teams, improving student access to immersive learning through real-world research experiences.  Third, TSU and Berkeley will work together to build advanced astronomy instrumentation in the form of the "EDI-Testbed".   This precision instrument, based on Berkeley-patented technology, will allow detection of new planetary systems via the highly successful radial-velocity measurement of stars.  It will operate at TSU's 2-meter Automatic Spectroscopic Telescope with nightly cadence, a unique capability that will bring new discoveries to exoplanet research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These three programs will improve astronomy instruction at TSU and continue to promote Berkeley as a leader in innovative and revolutionary technological invention.  The new centralized campus-wide repository for TSU undergraduate research opportunities will improve the educational experiences for all TSU students, not just those in astronomy.  It will streamline the process for them to find research programs in which to become involved.  The EDI-Testbed technology development will have a direct impact on the success of other Berkeley EDI instruments, including the near-infrared TEDI instrument.  TEDI will be capable of detecting earthlike planets in the habitable zones of low temperature stars.  The detection of habitable earthlike planets can impact basic philosophical questions including that of life's origins and roles in the universe.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   An EDI-Testbed has been completed and has been installed at Fairborn observatory.  This is an advanced compact spectrograph using Externally Dispersped Interferometry to combine the techniques of Fourier Transform Spectroscopy with dispersive spectroscopy.  An advance Quantum Mechanics class was developed, and several students working on the project have enrolled in astronomy graduate  programs this fall.  An entirely new physics and astronomy undergraduate curriculum has  been developed and presented to the university for consideration.  A change in university administration has delayed its implementation.  A university-wide student research portal was created and is available to faculty, staff, and students from all academic areas.  It has been designed in a manner that can be disemminated to other campuses.  A pre-physics course was created and offered for several semesters and led to improved student success in the introductory physics courses, until administrative changes at the university led to its cancellation.  A new environmentally controlled instrument building was created at Fairborn Observatory to house the EDI-Testbed and other guest instruments.  A new database and website were created to share spectroscopic data from the Automatic Spectroscopic Telescope at Fairborn Observatory with collaborators.  A postdoctoral researcher was trained and mentored in advanced optical techniques.  Two academic papers were published in refereed journals.
