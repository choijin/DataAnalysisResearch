<AbstractNarration>The Southern Ocean plays a key role in marine biogeochemistry and global climate. Along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), winter air temperatures have increased by more than 5 ÂºC over the past five decades, and sea ice duration and extent have decreased substantially, leading to dramatic ecological perturbations.  The sensitivity of primary production and climate-active gas cycling to on-going changes in the physical and chemical environment of the WAP is the key to understanding potential biogeochemical climate feedbacks in this region. The objective of this project is to characterize and understand the seasonal dynamics of primary production and climate-active gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) in the WAP. The project will examine (1) the relationships among seasonal changes in pCO2, temperature and light with respect to gross primary production, net primary production, and net community production; (2) the extent to which changes in surface water pCO2 and temperature drive ecological shifts in the dominant phytoplankton species assemblage composition, and alter key processes in the DMS cycle.  The research will employ membrane inlet mass spectrometry to monitor dissolved gases in ambient seawater at the Palmer Station LTER site and conduct physiological/biochemical assays with tracer compounds. The research will provide unprecedented information on the temporal evolution of primary production and dissolved gas concentrations in the WAP in relation to surface hydrography and sea ice cover. Field studies will be supported by laboratory experiments with model species subjected to detailed studies of carbon metabolism.  This project will contribute significantly to the understanding of seasonal biogeochemical dynamics in a region that is particularly sensitive to ongoing climate perturbations and important for the global air-sea exchange of CO2. The project will train two graduate students and will be integrated in the undergraduate teaching program at Princeton University, including new lectures and new laboratory modules. Through the PIs community activities the project will also contribute to public outreach and policy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Using autonomous gas measurements and incubations with collected water samples, we studied photosynthesis and respiration by phytoplankton in the Western Antarctic Peninsula during the Austral summer 2012-2013.  Our observations captured the development and disappearance of a massive phytoplankton bloom in early spring, following retreat of the sea ice. During this spring bloom, which accounted for more than half of the seasonal gross primary production, the phytoplankton grew extremely rapidly, despite the low ambient temperature.  The photosynthetic activity was so intense that the ambient concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in surface water declined to a small fraction of its normal value near equilibrium with the atmosphere.     Detailed oceanographic and physiological studies revealed some of the key conditions and mechanisms responsible for the rapid growth of the phytoplankton despite the very cold conditions (0-5&ordm;C) encountered in high latitude waters.  The development of the phytoplankton bloom was facilitated by low concentration of grazing organisms in early spring and long daylight hours, which allowed extended photosynthetic activity.  Key physiological adaptations of cold-water phytoplankton include low respiration rates during daylight hours and high concentrations of the cellular proteins that are responsible for photosynthetic activity and cannot be modified for rapid activity at low temperature.     These results ameliorate our understanding of the high biological productivity of high latitude oceans which sustain a highly effective food chain, from phytoplankton to krill and marine mammals. They also provide new insight into the possible effects of CO2-induced global change on polar ecosystems.       Last Modified: 08/04/2015       Submitted by: Francois M Morel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
