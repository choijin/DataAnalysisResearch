<AbstractNarration>The Regional Center for Semiconductor and Nanotechnology Education (RCSNE) fulfills the needs of nanotechnology and semiconductor manufacturing industries in New York State and Western New England through development, demonstration, and utilization of new materials, curricula, and delivery methods by utilizing the resources of academia, industry, and government. The Center represents a collaborative partnership including AMD/GlobalFoundries, IBM, General Electric, SEMATECH, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, Hudson Valley Community College, regional Boards of Cooperative Educational Services in New York State, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), the University at Albany's College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE), The State University of New York Institute of Technology (SUNYIT), Excelsior College, Mohawk Valley Community College (CC), Fulton Montgomery CC, Dutchess CC, Adirondack County CC, Schenectady County CC, Ulster County CC, and additional community colleges in NY, VT, MA, and CT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology and semiconductor manufacturing industries are already established in the region and are undergoing an explosive expansion. A prime example of this expansion is the recent groundbreaking of AMD/Global Foundries' $4 billion-plus leading edge semiconductor foundry facility in Saratoga County. When complete, this facility will be one of the most technologically advanced in the world and the most advanced semiconductor foundry in the U.S. Approximately 1,465 permanent manufacturing jobs will be created by the end of 2012 (including 390 engineers and 800 technicians). In addition, IBM has committed to investing $1.5 billion in establishing an advanced Integrated Circuit Packaging Research and Development Center in upstate New York in 2010 and will be recruiting for 475 engineers and 200 technicians. Similar expansion is occurring in the advanced energy sectors such as General Electric's advanced battery manufacturing center slated for construction in Schenectady, New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In response to these needs, the RCSNE is implementing and enabling (a) expansion of advanced semiconductor and nanotechnology related AAS/AS degree programs among its community college partners, (b) on-the-job co-op and internship-based training, (c) distance learning options, (d) just-in-time training, (e) K-12 pipeline development programs, (f) coordinated student recruitment, and (g) research into emerging workforce trends and training needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The RCSNE can improve community college student learning in science and engineering by providing a broader range of students access to the educational materials, facilities and faculty of several premier U.S. science and engineering schools. Several of the partners (HVCC, UAlbany, RPI and RIT) have successfully teamed to develop and disseminate existing nano and semiconductor manufacturing programs that have leveraged semiconductor cleanrooms at UAlbany's College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, RPI, HVCC's TEC-SMART facility, and other community colleges. A RCSNE industrial advisory board and external evaluation processes assures student learning is effectively assessed. HVCC and other partners have indicated commitment to the proposed ATE Center through their existing education programs, articulation agreements and outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The Center's industrial partners such as IBM, AMD/Global Foundries, and General Electric are providing guidelines regarding the technical skills required for highly effective employees. Regular workforce skill assessments are being performed to match the needs of the industry. The Center is adapting educational programs from other ATE Centers and the Center's regional partners and developing material where none already exists. These materials are being disseminated by a network of community colleges to educate the next generation of the technical workforce in the nanotechnology and semiconductor manufacturing industries. The project activities are being presented at technical and educational conferences and published in scientific and educational journals. The Center is educating the public through outreach activities. The Center is conducting active recruiting to increase the number of women and under-represented minorities in nanotechnology and semiconductor manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

Founded in September of 2010 the mission of the Center is summarized as follows: "The Northeast Advanced Technological Education Center (NEATEC) &ndash; an NSF ATE Center&ndash; will serve as a critical, sustainable resource to create and maintain a skilled technical workforce for the semiconductor and nanotechnology industries in New York State and Western New England."      The Center was structured around six strategic goals. A description of the goals and a summary of the achievements is as follows:     Goal 1: Industrial Workforce Skillset Analysis: Identify the relevant technical skill sets needed to develop and maintain high-tech industries in the region and advance the technical skills and education of the current and future workforce. A comprehensive comparison of skillsets was undertaken by NEATEC. The study determined the following set of skill gaps between the industries and what is taught at community colleges     Implementing Quality Principles Troubleshooting and Repairing Pneumatic Systems Troubleshooting and Repairing Hydraulic Systems Troubleshooting and Repairing Vacuum Systems Troubleshooting and Repairing RF Systems Performing Preventive and Routine Maintenance.       In response to these needs NEATEC developed several workshops in vacuum, RF technology, pneumatics, mechatronics, and others. During the period 2011-2015 these workshop were taken by more than 700 participants.    Goal 2: Curricular Development and Implementation. Enhance and expand two-year Nanoscale science/engineering and semiconductor technology curricula. To fulfill this goal NEATEC have developed a variety of courses:    With Excelsior College, a 4-year college NEATEC developed five online nanotechnology courses: (1) Introduction to Nanotechnology; (2) Basic Nanofabrication Process; (3) Nanotechnology Process Equipment; (4) Introduction to Nanofabrication Manufacturing Technology; (5) Microelectromechanical Systems       "Mathematics for Emerging Technologies": High-school math course with emphasis in emerging technology applications. More than 150 students have enrolled in this course.  "Introduction to Nanotechnology": This is a "college in high school" course. High school students are granted 2 credits at SUNY Poly that are college transferable. Several schools in New York State have incorporated this course in their programs. NEATEC expect to expand the offering to all High-Schools in New York and Western New England. NEATEC partnered with Fairfield University to offer eight nanotechnology courses to community colleges and 4-year colleges: NEATEC redeveloped the content to make them available to two-year colleges. The courses include:  Two Introductory Nanotechnology courses; Two Nanoelectronics courses; Two Nano-Biology Courses; and Two Nano-Chemistry Courses. Westchester Community College has already adopted the  two introductory courses.        Goal 3: Teacher Development. Augment and expand the skills of grades 6-12 and community college faculty to enable instruction of advanced technology curricula developed by local and/or national ATE partners.  For community college faculty NEATEC sponsored a range of professional development workshops/colloquia.  For the grades 6-12 community, NEATEC Learning Modules (NML) were developed together with the NEATEC partner high school teachers. NLMÆs included topics on Nanotechnology, Semiconductors, Photovoltaic, Alternate Energy, Mathematics, and general science and technology. These modules are being offered by over 30 schools in New York State. The modules are available to any school in the Nation.    Goal 4: Experiential Learning.
