<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator will provide travel support for undergraduate and graduate students to attend national and international solar physics meetings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key component of this community service project will be to help students attend the annual Solar Physics Division (SPD) meeting of the American Astronomical Society. About 4-5 students will be selected each year for the SPD meeting, based on an application and selection process administered by the SPD Studentship Committee. Remaining funds will allow other conference organizers to request support for students intending to participate in their targeted solar physics meetings. New Mexico State University, serving as the distributor of the awards, will host a website with the relevant reimbursement information and forms for all student attendees.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Involvement of talented students at meetings and workshops that present and discuss exciting discoveries in solar physics will benefit the research community and foster a stimulating environment for future recruitment and the development of research programs for young scientists.</AbstractNarration>
