<AbstractNarration>Discrete mechanics is a relatively recent technique to derive efficient and predictive space-time integrators that are faithful to the continuous world they are meant to simulate. As these integrators are based on mechanical principles, they inherit, at the computational level, the variational nature of most mechanical systems, from particle mechanics to continuum mechanics, with surprising efficiency and robustness, and with arbitrary accuracy. Our research goal is to further develop this technique and introduce an entirely new class of Eulerian-based variational integrators of partial differential equations. By design, our geometry-based time integrators will exhibit all of the classic hallmarks of variational integrators. Consequently our research, containing intertwined theoretical and practical components, is aimed at producing simple and predictive simulation tools for a wide range of phenomena in fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, magnetohydrodynamics, plasma physics, and reactive CFD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the idea of discretizing variational formulations of mechanics is standard for elliptic problems, only recently was it used to derive variational time-stepping algorithms for mechanical systems. We wish to leverage the large body of literature on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian principles in mechanics to develop discrete, Eulerian-based variational integrators and further extend the realm of geometric mechanical integrators developed over the past few years. The computational and mathematical foundations sought after, along with the resulting integrators, will provide fresh insight in understanding the fundamental role of discretization and numerics in Eulerian simulations. These new computational tools will consequently advance the state-of-the-art in a wide range of challenging physical problems such as magnetohydronamics, plasma physics, charged, and complex fluids. Our team, with existing strengths in multidisciplinary computational projects and academic-industry collaborations, will develop an innovative curriculum in mathematical computing to train future scientists in theoretical and computational matters. Besides providing a stepping stone for our long-term research goal of solving complex, multiscale physical phenomena, the synergetic mixture of mechanics and geometric objects in this project promises to be a rich source of fundamental and computationally important methods, as well as interdisciplinary interactions between physical sciences, mathematics, and information technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary purpose of NSF-funded research effort was to develop a new class of geometric, Eulerian-based variational integrators of differential equations.  Computational tools that are faithful to the continuous world they are meant to simulate have been a core ingredient of information technology and computational science since their inception. While many time stepping methods were developed over the years (many of which are now in off-the-shelf solvers), rare are the numerical solvers of dynamical systems that retain, at the algorithmic and computational level, the basic structure of mechanics} such as conservation laws, momentum maps, or (multi)symplecticity.  We algorithmically derived novel integrators from a principled Eulerian treatment of discrete mechanics, where discrete equations of motion were obtained through extremization of an action under constraints, typically leading to either discrete geodesic equations (e.g., for incompressible fluids) or discrete Euler-Poincar&eacute; equations (e.g., for compressible fluids). By design, the resulting geometry-based time integrators exhibit all of the classic hallmarks of variational integrators: they are typically (multi)symplectic, of arbitrary order, and exhibit exceptional energy behavior, while possessing a discrete version of Noether's theorem that guarantees exact preservation of discrete momenta arising from symmetries.  We introduced a number of new numerical methods.based on discrete geometric variational principles expressed in Eulerian form to achieve predictive simulations of phenomena including:  hydrodynamics (incompressible and compressible flows) electromagnetism.(Maxwell's equations, with or without sources) magnetohydronamics atmospherical flows (rotating stratified fluids) and molecular dynamics.   In the process, we also contributed a number of discrete geometric technical tools that include:  discrete connections on triangle meshes spectrally accurate advection of forms eigenbased model reduction for fluid simulation discretization of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms in Eulerian and Lagrangian form.
