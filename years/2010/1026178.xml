<AbstractNarration>The State University of New York (SUNY) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (SUNY LSAMP), under the leadership of SUNY-Stony Brook, will support 12 additional post-baccalaureate students duirng the 2010-2012 Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program at the University of Buffalo.  This program builds on previous program efforts that have not only significantly added to the graduate enrollment and masters and doctoral degrees to students from underreprested minority (UREP) populations but have also led to important changes in the culture and practice of STEM education in ways that not only help UREP students but all graduate STEM students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project adds to current efforts by SUNY LSAMP to build research capacity in STEM education in the area of graduate education. The lessons learned from the study of the Bridge to the Doctorate Program will be put into the context of broader issues of systemic change and disseminated to a broad national audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the lessons learned from this project, the alliance expects to continue to develop and refine strategies that will increase the recruitment and retention of graduate students and further diversify graduate education departments.  The strategy has the potenital to increase the number of UREP STEM students who successfully complete doctoral degrees in STEM disciplines and make changes in STEM departmental culture and practice.</AbstractNarration>

Program objectives that were achieved were:   Providing a comprehensive services that monitor student progress  Building a strong BD community of STEM Scholars   Developing BD studentsÆ academic and professional skills   Instilling a sense of altruism in UB BD graduate students to serve as mentors and instructors for the STEM community   Collaborating with  other  NSF  and  state  and  federal programs  to  make  the  best  use  of program resources by integrating BD students into an existing network of programs and activities  Assessing the  success  of  program  services  through external  evaluation and  developing modified activities or  interventions  based  on  the  results of  this  evaluation   Ensuring that BD students have the tools necessary to successfully gain admission to doctoral programs at the conclusion of BD  Preparing BD  students  to  apply  for  NSF  and  other  graduate fellowships   Establishing relationships with  STEM  departments , the UB Graduate School and  the  New York State Underrepresented Fellowship Program to develop plans  to  provide a formal pathway to PhD programs  Working with  STEM  departments  to  provide  academic support  where needed  to  help students through  doctoral  study     Developing an effective system for tracking students after they  leave BD  Promoting  systemic change  in  graduate STEM  policy  and  practices  in ways that  will increase  the  success  of individual  students   Using resources  from  multiple  sources  to  examine broad  issues  related  to  graduate  education for underrepresented STEM students    Results  UB BDhas been successful in establishing a community of STEM Scholars at the University at Buffalo. The presence of the BD students has also been good for the undergraduate population as well.  The undergraduates were mentored informally by the BD students and this was a mutually beneficial relationship.  The BD students were able to give back and the undergraduates got valuable advice. The program was able to establish an atmosphere where professionalism was the norm and STEM students were valued. UB BD was instrumental in helping the student cohort navigate the process to gain admission to their doctoral programs, and to help some students deal with the challenges of making the transition from masters to doctoral programs.  The project continues to work with UB STEM Departments and the UB Graduate School to fund eligible students after the BD fellowship ends. We continue to work on promoting systemic change in graduate STEM policy and practices including helping faculty consider new paradigms and new kinds of students for its doctoral programs so that they recognize talented students from diverse backgrounds and situations. We continue to increase the number of faculty members who support these efforts and in that way are promoting systemic change in STEM departments   This project has added the number of underrepresented minority (UREP)students who have received graduate degrees in STEM fields an...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
