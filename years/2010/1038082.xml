<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will host a workshop to bring the experts in the area of sustainable buildings from both United States and Turkey to discuss and recommend best practices in the field. The workshop will facilitate exchange of the latest information and state-of-the-art practices on sustainable&lt;br/&gt;buildings design and construction among researchers and professionals in the building industry.&lt;br/&gt;The discussion topics include a variety of concepts in architecture such as materials, water, and energy use in building design, construction and operation. The proposal also has a good emphasis on cultural difference in approaching sustainable design problem.&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will assemble almost 100 invited participants and more attendees from other countries. The scale of the workshop is large enough to include a great number of experts (24 keynote speakers and 24 discussion leaders) in the areas and a significant number of young diverse attendees (24 students). The poster session designed specifically for young attendees to provide a good opportunity to interact with senior attendees in the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two communities/countries (US and Turkey) with long histories of technology development and architecture design will provide a good venue for exchange ideas for researchers and practitioners from both countries. It is expected that the workshop will bring global impacts and opportunity for future research collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;Further, the workshop will offer an opportunity for the participants to discuss and recommend policies and practices that may assist governments and other interested parties in carrying out their tasks. The outcomes may help the authorities to establish codes and guidelines for sustainable&lt;br/&gt;building design and facilitate safeguarding the future of our natural environment while providing a safe and comfortable built environment for the citizens of their respective communities. The planned workshop will be jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the&lt;br/&gt;Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBÝTAK). The OISE will co fund this project in the amount of $25K.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Workshop on the Architecture and Engineering of Sustainable Buildings was held May 16-19 in Istanbul Turkey.  A follow-up workshop was held July 27-27, 2012 in Chicago Illinois.  The workshop in Istanbul consisted of six oral sessions.  Following each session there were breakout groups for discussion and identification of key topics presented.  Conference meal and social functions provided additional time for participants to network and discuss results, and contributed to keeping the group together outside of formal sessions.  The workshop included 37 talks by participants and contribution to breakout group discussions by others present.  Of the 37 talks, 16 were given by NSF-supported participants, 11 of whom were women.  Of the 21 presentations by the Turkish participants, eight were women.  The workshop included participation by representatives of research groups in Turkey, the US, Italy, Canada, and the UK.  There was a large cultural diversity in the attendees that extended beyond the specific countries represented.  Participants included a group of women from Yale University interested in sustainability and policy plans and a number of students from Ozyegin University who are enrolled in a class about IstanbulÆ2050. The follow-up workshop focused on the engineering and architecture of high performance buildings.  The Workshop identified a number of key issues that were thought to be the most important topics that can contribute to improved sustainability of buildings or to the implementation of sustainable design.  These include (1) developing educational processes and tools that promote interaction among participating disciplines, especially engineers and architects as well as teaching sustainability in buildings at both undergraduate and post-graduate levels; this should include exchange of views and opinions between international communities; (2) making better connections of buildings to their "habitat" so that buildings contribute better to the community they exist in; (3) finding better mechanisms for communication between government, educators, and those in professional practice; (4) improving methods of validating performance in sustainable buildings; (5) improving methods of valuing sustainability performance in buildings to increase motivation for building sustainable buildings; (6) increasing awareness of the need to reuse buildings rather than tearing old structures down and building new.  This should include design for deconstruction and design for renovation.  The discussion also emphasized a need for improved (7) project organization and engineering; (8) building integrated modeling tools; (9) materials selection criteria.  Out of these topics three action items emerged to contribute to continued interaction of the participants: (1) developing concrete methods for improved exchange of information among stake-holder communities; (2) developing a plan for driving sustainable design when meeting future housing needs in global communities; and (3) developing collaborative international partnerships to improve understanding among academic and professional practices.  Committees of participants were identified for each of these with one member of each being designated as convener.  It is anticipated that these will lead to generation of successful research proposals that will carry forward the development of solutions to topics identified at the workshop.     Intellectual Merit:  The workshop brought together diverse communities from around the world to discuss a topic critical to the creating a sustainable society worldwide.  It identified a number of key issues in sustainable building design as well as mechanisms for improving international cooperation in engineering and architecture.  In particular it proposed mechanisms by which the engineering and architecture communities could better communicate and work together to improve the output of both groups.  It resulted in a range of specific recommendations ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
