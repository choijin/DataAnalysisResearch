<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks support for deployment of two 8.5 kg NaI(Tl) detectors at the bottom of two IceCube deep ice holes which will be drilled near the center of IceCube/DeepCore array during the austral summer of 2010/2011. Since the forthcoming austral summer season will be the last of the IceCube MREFC project, the University of Wisconsin submitted this proposal through the NSF's RAPID funding mechanism to be able to take advantage of the last 2500-m deep ice holes and communication cables that will already be deployed for the IceCube string of Digital Optical Modules. The proposed NaI(Tl) detectors will be attached to the bottom of these last two IceCube strings and use the string's "special device" power and communication wires to send data to the surface.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the construction and deployment of two low-background 8.5 kg NaI(Tl) detectors at the bottom of two IceCube deep ice holes during the austral summer of 2010/2011. The project is a feasibility study for a future dark matter detector that will be able test the results obtained by the DAMA/Libra experiment at the deep underground Gran Sasso Laboratory in Italy and provide unambiguous evidence for the observation of dark matter.     The DAMA collaboration has observed a seasonally varying signal that is consistent with a signal expected from dark matter in the galactic halo.. However, the collaboration has not yet succeeded in convincing the international scientific community that the observed signal is not due to  environmental factors,  systematic effects associated with seasonal variations in the environmental radioactive background, or with other yet unidentified seasonal systematics. The Antarctic ice that hosts the IceCube  neutrino detector offers an ideal environment for an annual modulation dark matter  in a systematically different environment.     As part of this award two NaI(Tl) detectors were successfully deployed at the bottom of two IceCube strings, at the depth of 2457 m in the Antarctic ice at the South Pole. The two detectors have been running since January of 2011 with an average uptime of &gt; 98% in 2011.  The amount of isotopic contamination of  238U, 232Th, and natK present in the drill water was found to be 0.076&plusmn;0.046 ppb (parts per billion), 0.47&plusmn;0.14 ppb, and &lt;262 ppb respectively. Simulations show that the background rates resulting from the ice or the deployment process will be negligible for both current and future NaI detectors in the Antarctic ice.     The information gained from this feasibility study establishes the feasibility of rare event searches in a low-background environment in Antarctica with the ultimate goal of installing a full-scale NaI detector to provide a definitive test of the DAMA annual modulation signal and to probe the existence of dark matter.
