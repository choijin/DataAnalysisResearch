<AbstractNarration>1039829&lt;br/&gt;Neeman&lt;br/&gt;This award will be used to acquire, deploy and maintain an extensible petascale storage instrument, the Oklahoma PetaStore that combines disk and tape, to enable faculty, staff, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates across Oklahoma to build large and growing data collections. The focus is on equipment into which many media (tape cartridges and disk drives) can be placed, funding far more slots than media, so that research teams can purchase their own media, allowing capacity to grow with OU's and Oklahoma's evolving and emerging needs. The Petastore will be provided to OSCER's ~650 users, for most at no usage charges (just media costs), not just at OU, but at 23 other Oklahoma institutions and to ~150 out-of-state and international collaborators. Additional research projects will arise over the PetaStore's lifetime, as has happened with OSCER's compute resources.</AbstractNarration>
