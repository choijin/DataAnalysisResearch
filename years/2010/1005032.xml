<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) continues support for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Christopher R. Arumainayagam and David R. Haines at Wellesley College for three summers, commencing in 2010.  The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program.  The research projects span the sub-disciplines of chemistry, as well as interdisciplinary areas of science.  Sample projects include:  (1)  the computational analysis and design of drug molecules for rapidly-mutating targets;  (2)  the development of  novel nanoscale surface modifications;  (3)  the creation of functionalized nanoparticles as potential treatments for certain forms of cancer;  and (4) the study of electron-induced reactions in nanoscale thin films.  In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities.  In addition to research, students will work mentoring high-school students.  The REU site at Wellesley has trained a large number of mostly young women in the sciences.  The present site will actively seek to recruit students with disabilities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in chemical problems of relevance in a broad range of chemistry sub-disciplines.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Wellesley College Chemistry/Geoscience/Physics Departments REU program accepted 10 or 11 undergraduate students in each of three years, 2011-2013.  We accepted a total of 31 students, nineteen of whom were from institutions other than Wellesley College.  Although we did not restrict our applications to women, all of the students participants in the program were female. As a new part of our REU program in this iteration, we also included two Community College (CC) faculty member as participants in this program.  One of these community college faculty members participated for two consecutive years.  The role of these CC faculty was two-fold: they provided support for undergraduate students from their own institution, as the student transitioned into the research laboratory, and they participated fully in the research projects in the host laboratory.  Each of the undergraduates, who were chosen, in part based on their lack of previous research experience, had her own research project, within the context of a larger research group, under the direction of a faculty member.  The research conducted by these students has resulted in 21 presentations at national meetings and one journal article that has appeared in print thus far.  The Wellesley REU program was focused on involving the undergraduates in cutting edge research, but we also saw this as an opportunity to provide significant mentoring, role models, and training in non-laboratory aspects of being a scientist.  We drew heavily from our alumnae base of professional scientists, and invited the alumnae to come to campus to meet the participants and to talk about their research.  We also provided an ethics workshop each year, given by a Wellesley College alumna, focused on ethical considerations that she has observed in her career as a professor at research intensive universities.  The range of projects included in the REU program extended from an attempt to reproduce astrochemical reactions in the confines of an earth based laboratory, to applications of nanotechnology to delivery of therapeutic agents, to the use of synthetic organic chemistry to prepare molecules that can be applied to the understanding of biological receptor structures, and several other projects.  At least twelve of the participants in this REU program have continued their science training into graduate programs, most others, who have graduated, are working in science related fields, and several of the students who have not yet graduated, or who are working in the field, intend to pursue graduate school within a few years.
