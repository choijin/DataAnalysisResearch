<AbstractNarration>This project conducts experiments to assess the potential of a new, high-quality probability sampling method for studies such as the American National Election Study, the General Social Survey, and other face to face surveys.  It is designed to enable the survey research community to improve data collection, increase statistical power, yield high response rates, and reduce costs per completed interview.  The project builds on a NSF funded Workshop (SES-102394) that convened ten leading experts on survey methodology and sampling to discuss the future of the American National Election Study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed innovations combine a dual frame sampling technique with self-completed surveys (on a computer) in most cases.  The study consists of three experiments to assess the feasibility and success of the self completed surveys and provides two implemenentations of the dual-frame sampling design.  The first experiment assesses the difference in survey modes between face to face and self complete.  The second experiment investigates the optimal level of incentives that respondents require in order to complete surveys of varying lengths in order to observe a response rate comparable to that currently achieved by the American National Election Study.  The third experiment is a "proof of concept" roll-out of the new sampling method and self-complete mode, which will be informed by the results of the previous two experiments.  This will provide a parallel comparison to the American National Election Study pre-election face-to-face and internet surveys that will be fielded at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this project is successful, it could yield significant cost savings for face to face surveys while at the same time providing more powerful statistical results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chronicling the opinions of Americans over the decades is an important task funded by the National Science Foundation since the 1960s.  Surveys have recently become expensive -- and the funding has not kept up.  The goal of this project was to investigate whether we could shift the way we track American opinion -- away from in-person interviews done in people's living rooms -- and to something less expensive, like inviting people to take surveys on the Internet.    The project consisted of two parts:  an experiment to learn what the differences between the two modes of survey might look like; and, a trial run of a process that could invite a random sample of Americans from the whole country to take a survey on-line.   Both parts revealed interesting patterns.  There are differences between these modes of interivew, but strangely, the computer may be a better instrument than a person for getting people to reveal their opinions.  Similarly, if you offer people enough money for their time, you can get a lot of people to take a survey on-line.  We drew a nationwide sample and got a 70% response rate.  That's high!    We are pleased that the American National Election Study will try out this methodology in 2016 and look forward to helping them execute the test.  If we can save the government money and continue the valuable time series of American attitudes that we've collected for decades, we will have served science well.
