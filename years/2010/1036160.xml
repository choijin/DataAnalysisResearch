<AbstractNarration>This project is to support a workshop to bring together Alaska Native delegates from Yukon River communities, students, and interdisciplinary research scientists from the US Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council (YRITWC) and Colorado State University (CSU) to build a creative approach for researching how climate change is affecting people of the Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions.  As stated in the proposal the "objective of the workshop is to clearly assess and define synergistic relationships between Western science an Indigenous Knowledge paradigms..." and to implement the project plan through "identification of community-driven science questions, data collection and engagement between scientists and community members to facilitate the development of adaptive strategies for communities within the Yukon River Basin".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-day workshop will be held in Colorado in September 2010. The purpose of the workshop is to design a science research project built to assess the sustainability of Yukon River Basin communities under the conditions of climate change, current and anticipated, while fully incorporating the Indigenous communities of the Yukon watershed.  The potential proposal includes scientific training for participants in qualitative and quantitative data collection; mixed methodologies, including focus groups, target surveys, and interviews; geospatial database construction, and quantitative methods for gathering data on the river system - including snow, ice, water quality, ecosystem assessments, etc. The participant list includes the YRITWC Members, National Weather Service, U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, RMRS, USGS, CSU, U.S. Forest Service, and  special guest include Henry Huntington (Pew Charitable Trust Foundation) and Shari Gearheard (National Snow &amp; Ice Data Center). The wide experience, locally and internationally, make for a dynamic team with rich history in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The funded meeting brought together researchers, stakeholders and interested participants from across the country to build a project aimed to address climate issues facing Alaska Natives and the broader Arctic inhabitants as a whole.  Through a series of meetings, brainstorming and discussions the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council (Watershed Council) and participating partners developed a unique proposal that builds upon the long-term observations of Alaskan Indigenous communities and the research of Western scientist that addresses locally relevant scientific questions through targeted focus groups, snow study data collection and training, interactive database development and follow-up correspondence with local stakeholders.   The developed proposal is titled, Strategic Needs on Water in the Yukon (SNOWY).  The outlined project will provide a holistic view of climate change effects on human populations by addressing the year-round relationship between the local populations and the hydrologic cycle in the Yukon River Basin (YRB) to better understand issues related to water quality and quantity.  This research will be accomplished using a combination of facilitated dialogue through semi-directed interviews and collection of snow, ice and water data. By combining qualitative and quantitative methods this project steps outside the bounds of traditional scientific research and into a transformative Indigenous Research Paradigm based on developing a process of mutual discovery between scientists and communities.  This research is high-risk and exploratory, yet potentially transformative with a high payoff.  The existing collaborative relationship between the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Watershed Council will expand to include the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and Colorado State University (CSU). This research partnership utilizes existing resources and experience to support an investigation that promotes community participation based on locally derived questions addressing challenges facing the Indigenous Nations of the Yukon River Basin, more thoroughly defining the intersection between the social, natural and Indigenous sciences. By facilitating dialogue on key water issues related to climate change we will facilitate the development of adaptive strategies through community input and participation.  Through the execution and implementation of this project we will facilitate an Indigenous relationship between science and knowledge that will form a new, relational way of viewing the environment.

By holding scale and place as central themes we are building respect, relationship, and reciprocity between all of the elements of research. Our work focuses on place-based science as a tool to begin the process of identifying and developing adaptive management strategies for resource-dependent communities in the Yukon River Basin.
