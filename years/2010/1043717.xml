<AbstractNarration>This NSDL Targeted Research project is part of a four-way collaborative effort involving 1043638, U. Colorado (lead institution); 1043858, Utah State University; 1043660, UCAR; and 1043717, the University of Utah. The investigators seek to understand the impact, replicability, and scalability of the NSDL Curriculum Customization Service (CCS) across four different school district deployment sites. CCS is a web-based software tool that enables teachers to: (1) customize their science instruction using digital library resources, formative assessments, and district-developed materials to aid student learning and (2) share these customizations as part of an online learning community. Three major themes guiding this research are: (i) impact on students (e.g. study of learning outcomes and self-reported engagement with science content); (ii) impact on teachers (e.g. examination of teachers' attitudes, beliefs, practices, and knowledge surrounding curriculum customization, integration of digital library resources in the classroom, and teacher learning) and (iii) how differences in deployment site characteristics (districts and schools) influence student learning outcomes and teachers' knowledge. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its grounding in a successful pilot study in which the Denver Public Schools adopted the CCS system for all its earth science teachers district-wide. With respect to broader impacts the project offers a model for the dissemination of educational technology through a key "unit" of the K-12 educational enterprise, namely adoption by the local school district.</AbstractNarration>

The purpose of this research was to evaluate the educational impact of the CCS as an online digital planning tool for STEM education. Evaluation of impact was focused on student learning and teacher practice.   Research  The CCS was made available to Earth Science teachers in six major school districts in the U.S. intermountain west. Over 150 teachers received either face-to-face or online training in using the CCS to differentiate their instruction for diverse students and to integrate high-quality, interactive digital resources into their teaching.  Data were gathered via a variety of rich methods to provide a complete picture of CCS usage and the contexts (e.g., school and district factors) that influenced adoption of the technology. These methods included weblogs of tool usage (providing detailed clickstream data of every user action in the CCS), phone interviews, online surveys, student assessments, classroom observations, and collection of demographic data published for each school district. Student assessment data was collected from over 2500 students across the course of this research.  Findings  Results demonstrated that the Curriculum Customization Service embodies a very effective model for significantly increasing teachersÆ awareness and use of digital library resources in mainstream teaching. Over 90% of teachers reported that the CCS had changed their teaching practices and the ways in which they used interactive resources for science instruction. Results suggest that teachersÆ interactions with specific components of the CCS may be most beneficial for student learning: analysis of studentsÆ multiple choice and open-ended assessments demonstrates that focused interactions with interactive resources may support positive learning outcomes.  Conclusions  Overall, results from this research demonstrated that the CCS is an effective tool for meeting the goal for which it was designed: helping teachers plan and teach more efficiently and effectively, thus benefiting students. This project has informed the fieldÆs understanding of how and when cyberlearning tools can be integrated into authentic STEM learning environments. It also has identified critical factors that influence the scalability, adoption, and assessment of cyberlearning tools in classroom environments.
