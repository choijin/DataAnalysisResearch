<AbstractNarration>This project is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. The Department of Biology at Pepperdine University will train 10 students for 11 weeks during the summers of 2011-2016.  Research opportunities associated with the program range from cellular to organismal systems, and students will have access to state of the art equipment and computer systems essential for such research.  The primary goals of the program are to: 1) provide training in the application of the scientific method; 2) involve students in collaborative and interdisciplinary research; 3) expose students to the overall enterprise of science as it relates to the design and implementation of a research project; 4) develop skills in scientific communication; 5) provide students with training in ethical decision-making as it relates to science; 6) train students in various forms of scientific communication; and 7) foster an appreciation for career opportunities in the life sciences including graduate school.  In collaboration with a faculty mentor, each student will be encouraged to design a research project that interfaces with on-going research within the department.  This research will involve a mixture of lab and field-based activities and will culminate with a student symposium that includes both oral presentations and a poster session.  Student recruitment is primarily web-based but includes direct communication with undergraduate-serving institutions with high enrollment of underrepresented groups.  Several factors are considered for student selection, including academic record, letters of reference, student interest in obtaining an advanced career in science, and diversity.  Program assessment will be done using the common REU assessment tool as well as specific tools developed internally.  Follow-through of the REU program will include student presentations at regional and national meetings, tracking of past students, and student participation in a local Science Camp for middle school students.   For more information about the program, students can visit http://seaver.pepperdine.edu/naturalscience/programs/surb/default.htm, or contact the PI (Dr. Jay Brewster at jay.brewster@pepperdine.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Rodney L. Honeycutt at rodney.honeycutt@pepperdine.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Pepperdine Summer Undergraduate Research in Biology (SURB) program is an NSF-funded program that offers summer research fellowships to undergraduate students. The program supports 8-12 students each summer, providing each student a full-time, 11-week research experience. Students are closely mentored by Pepperdine faculty; provided a generous student stipend, free housing on campus at Pepperdine, and support for travel to research conference following program completion. <em>The central goal of the SURB program is to encourage the development of young scientists via engagement of undergraduates in research; partnering students with faculty mentors in the development of a novel research project. </em>Research students engage the theme of stress adaptation of biological systems. Projects within the program include ecology, cell biology, plant physiology, mathematical modeling of biological systems, and biochemistry. Students are welcomed into the scientific community, enjoying opportunities for social engagement, service, and the hosting of guest scientists from around the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The <strong>central objectives</strong> of the SURB program are to: 1) enhance the maturation of undergraduate students as young scientists via direct faculty mentoring within the context of an active research laboratory; 2) engage students in full-time biological research by experimentally testing student-generated hypotheses, resulting in publishable data sets, that are communicated effectively; 3) teach students the essentials of the scientific process which are common to a spectrum of biological sub-disciplines; 4) introduce students to collaboration and interdisciplinary research; and 5) provide research opportunities for students from traditionally under-represented groups or students from schools that lack research opportunities.</p> <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Students that have participated in the SURB program over the past 5 years of this current grant have been successful in addressing important publishable questions in biology, have engaged the broader scientific community effectively, and have been a diverse group of talented students from across the United States. SURB students have authored 17 research articles in respected, peer-reviewed scientific journals. The publication of research results generated during the SURB program in truly challenging due to the brevity of the program and the rigor required of such scholarly communications.&nbsp; These publications attest to the quality of the research projects being performed, the quality of the students participating in the program, and the extended connection between SURB students and their faculty mentor during the process of publishing in a peer-reviewed journal. In addition, SURB students have made over 150 conference presentations as they communicate their research findings to the scientific community. Examples include the Ecological Society of America and the American Society for Cell Biology, which offer important opportunities for undergraduate students to network and to prepare for graduate school application. Of all participants in the SURB program, 64% have subsequently entered into graduate level training or careers in the research biosciences. Three students have earned prestigious NSF Graduate Research Fellowships in support of their Ph.D. training, and three students have been awarded Fulbright fellowships which provide one year of research support in another country. The SURB alumni are succeeding in gaining access to graduate programs and will become important members of the U.S. STEM professionals. When requesting funds for this grant, we set a goal of enriching the SURB program with a more diverse collection of students. During the past 5 years, the SURB program, 58% of our program fellowships were offered to students from groups that are underrepresented in science. This was a significant improvement in diversity numbers for our program. With regard to tracking SURB alumni, we have maintained a database of contact information and of career outcomes.&nbsp; Alumni are invited to keep in touch with the SURB program through regular emails, and through announcements and program photographs posted to the SURB website.&nbsp; Administrative staff and faculty mentors work to keep in contact with SURB alumni to keep abreast of developments in their careers.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/22/2017<br>      Modified by: Jay&nbsp;L&nbsp;Brewster</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1062721/1062721_10074529_1498171312478_FullGroup--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1062721/1062721_10074529_1498171312478_FullGroup--rgov-800width.jpg" title="GroupSURB"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1062721/1062721_10074529_1498171312478_FullGroup--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="GroupSURB"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SURB research students and faculty</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephen Davis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jay&nbsp;L&nbsp;Brewster</div> <div class="imageTitle">GroupSURB</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1062721/1062721_10074529_1498171369415_Group--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1062721/1062721_10074529_1498171369415_Group--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pepperdine SURB Students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1062721/1062721_10074529_1498171369415_Group--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pepperdine SURB Students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Pepperdine SURB students</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephen Davis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jay&nbsp;L&nbsp;Brewster</div> <div class="imageTitle">Pepperdine SURB Students</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1062721/1062721_10074529_1498171443705_CellCulture--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1062721/1062721_10074529_1498171443705_CellCulture--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SURB student"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1062721/1062721_10074529_1498171443705_CellCulture--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SURB student"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Pepperdine SURB student at work performing cell culture.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephen Davis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jay&nbsp;L&nbsp;Brewster</div> <div class="imageTitle">SURB student</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
