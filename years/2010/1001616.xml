<AbstractNarration>In this project the principal investigator intends to carry out a rigorous investigation of the existence and nonlinear stability (or instability) of certain important multidimensional structures arising in the mathematical study of compressible fluids. These structures include boundary layers, shock waves, detonation fronts, and vortex sheets. There is a vast applied literature on these topics, but until relatively recently they have resisted careful mathematical analysis, particularly in the multidimensional case. In recent work by the principal investigator, his collaborators, and others, new tools have become available, coming from PDE, harmonic analysis, and dynamical systems, that permit a rigorous study of the highly singular perturbation problems that arise in investigating the stability of such structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the earlier work done by physicists and engineers on problems of the type under consideration in this project has been of a formal or heuristic nature. Approaching the same problems from a mathematically rigorous point of view not only puts previous work on a firm foundation but can also deepen understanding, uncover new phenomena, and bring errors to light. The proposed work on boundary layers is related to problems in engineering concerned with the stabilization of high speed aircraft and may be of interest to engineers working on such problems. The results of the research would be disseminated by publication in high quality journals and by lectures given at conferences and other universities. The grant will also foster international research collaboration of the principal investigator with colleagues in France and China.  The research carried out under this grant is expected to have an impact on the work of other mathematicians, on graduate course preparation and seminars, and on the training of graduate students and postdocs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In the research performed under this grant we have developed new tools for the study of wave phenomena, and we have applied those tools to problems in fluid mechanics, optics, and nonlinear elasticity.  A general feature of the work has been the introduction of rigorous analysis into the study of problems where formerly only approximate and formal methods were available.  Such analysis is aimed not just at clarification and verification of earlier results, but also sometimes leads to the discovery of new phenomena.  For example, in our studies of pulses and Mach stems, we have uncovered several phenomena that contradict conventional wisdom about the behavior of these objects.     The main objects studied have been shock and detonation waves, vortex sheets,  mach stems, viscous boundary layers, and reflecting wavetrains and pulses.  Many of the problems involve the interaction of waves or pulses with boundaries.  A striking phenomenon for which we have provided the first rigorous explanation is the dramatic amplification of wavetrains and pulses that occurs upon reflection in certain weakly stable problems.   This amplification is connected with the formation of instabilities in detonation waves and vortex sheets.        As an example of the new tools we have provided, we mention here the new calculi of singular pseudodifferential operators for wavetrains and pulses that we have successfully applied in a variety of contexts.  Most recently, we have used the calculus for pulses to make rigorous the study of Rayleigh waves (related to earthquakes) in nonlinear elasticity.       A byproduct of our work on stability of detonations has been some new contributions to ODE theory. In particular, we have provided the first rigorous treatment of turning points that occur at infinity, and we have clarified the regularity assumptions that must be satisfied in order for block diagonalization of systems of ODEs to be possible.      The project has contributed very directly  to the training of two mathematicians. Matt Hernandez wrote his undergraduate senior thesis under my supervision on a topic in the project; that thesis has been accepted for publication in a high quality professional journal (CPDE).  Colton Willig has just completed a PhD under my supervision on the topic of reflecting and evanescent pulses.  The project has also influenced the teaching of my teaching of graduate courses.      International collaboration has been an important feature of the project.  In particular, several of my collaborators work in France, and one of them works in China.
