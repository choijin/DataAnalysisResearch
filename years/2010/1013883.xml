<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop transgenic fungal endophyte to produce and sequester degradative enzymes during plant growth and for post harvest use of these enzymes to reduce recalcitrance and facilitate biomass conversion.  Efficient production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass is limited by several factors including (1) producing large amounts of low-cost biomass sustainably (2) overcoming the natural recalcitrance of lignocellulose, and (3) reducing the high cost of enzymes used in biorefineries to convert cellulose and hemicellulose to their component sugars. This project will help overcome these limitations by developing endophytes, beneficial fungi that live naturally inside plants, as key components of an integrated system for producing low-cost cellulosic biofuels. Endophytes are increasingly recognized as vital contributors to plant yield, particularly for monocots. Endophytes that enhance plant yield will be engineered to produce and safely sequester degradative enzymes as the plant grows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to develop and sell energy-crop seeds and biomass, and to license the novel endophyte.  The technology will have a significant impact on fermentation chemicals and fuel industries and their competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Increased production of biofuels is a key element in plans to strengthen the domestic supply of clean, renewable energy sources.  Production of biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks is particularly attractive because of its renewable conversion of solar energy and recycling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, as well as the options it offers for reducing the competition between food and fuel. The technical challenges to economical production of biofuels from biomass are significant but surmountable, using innovations being developed through research such as this SBIR Phase I project.  The most common biochemical route to cellulosic biofuels involves pretreating biomass with heat and acid (known as "DAP" for "dilute acid pretreatment") to disrupt the matrix of lignin and hemicellulose that encases cellulose microfibrils. After acid neutralization, the pre-treated biomass is digested with enzymes to release sugars, which are then fermented or catalyzed to ethanol or other biofuels.  While costs of producing enzymes for biomass deconstruction are decreasing, the current cost is still estimated at more than $0.50 per gallon of ethanol, well above the $0.05 per gallon that industry experts indicate must be achieved for cellulosic ethanol to be cost-competitive with gasoline.  How fermentation-based systems for enzyme production can soon be made ten times more efficient is unclear.  One approach that can significantly decrease the cost for deconstructing biomass is to develop techniques to produce the required enzymes in the plant itself so that the requirement for external enzymes is reduced. In this project, Edenspace worked with collaborators at the University  of Washington to develop an enzyme expression system that uses fungi that naturally live within the plant (endophytes) in a symbiotic relationship to produce enzymes that can be activated after harvest to assist in breaking down cellulose to fermentable sugars. This approach provides a flexible, low-cost means of producing enzymes necessary for post-harvest deconstruction of plant cell walls to produce sugars and other chemical feedstock compounds. The technology has potential applications in most biochemistry-based uses of plant biomass, such as fermentation of cellulosic hydrolysates for advanced biofuels, bioproducts and "green" chemicals.
