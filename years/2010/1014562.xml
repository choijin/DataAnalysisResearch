<AbstractNarration>Humor that denigrates women tends to trivialize gender-based discrimination under the veil of benign amusement. Existing research shows that exposure to gender-biased humor can have harmful effects by affecting how men perceive discrimination against women as well as men's actual willingness to discriminate against women.  Although framed as "just a joke," this kind of humor can act as a "releaser" of prejudice against women.  Gender-biased humor allows men who hold antagonistic attitudes toward women to express their sexism by replacing the usual non-sexist norms in a situation with a norm of tolerance for gender-based discrimination, thereby essentially justifying a wider range of discriminatory actions against women.  Across six studies, researchers Thomas E. Ford of Western Carolina University and Julie A. Woodzicka of Washington and Lee University are collaborating in research designed to build upon existing findings in this area. Their research will further advance basic knowledge regarding how gender-biased humor contributes to imbalanced relations between men and women in new and important ways.  Ultimately, this research will address issues of critical social relevance by identifying important negative consequences of gender-biased humor for both women and men and by illuminating the role that such humor can play in social interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project meets the criterion of an RUI project.  It will advance discovery and understanding while promoting the research and educational communities at two primarily undergraduate universities.  It will allow the PIs to mentor undergraduate students and Master's level students in the conduct of research.  The project will give special consideration to first-generation students who have historically underparticipated in undergraduate research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many consider sexist humor harmless because of the humorous aspect of the communication.  The research that we have completed strongly supports humor as an understudied and ubiquitous vehicle for prejudice transmission.  In short, sexist humor is not to be taken lightly.  Our research identifies important negative social consequences of sexist humor for both men and women and helps to illuminate the role that such humor can play in shaping social interactions.  Far from being benign amusement; sexist humor can have deleterious effects on women by promoting the release of prejudice against them.  In fact, among those who are high in sexism, sexist humor may play a unique role in encouraging sexist behavior.  Our work also shows that sexist humor can induce a state of self-objectification in women, impair cognitive performance, and can encourage beliefs that justify societal sexism.   Further, our research has helped to identify which social groups are most vulnerable to the negative, prejudice-releasing effects of disparagement humor.  Social groups can occupy one of three conceptually adjacent positions in the social order based on the degree to which society justifies prejudice against the group (Ferguson &amp; Crandall, 2006).  The first or left-most region is called the "justified prejudice region" and consists of groups that are consensually defined as deviants. The second or right-most region is called the "unjustified prejudice region" and consists of groups that are consensually defined as good or righteous.    The third or middle region is called the "suppressed prejudice" region or the "normative window region."  Groups in this window are defined as socially disadvantaged in a particular historical period.  Today such groups are thought to include racial minorities, sexual minorities, women and religious minorities. Our research shows that disparagement humor only releases prejudice against groups that are in the suppressed prejudice region.  For example, we found that after exposure to humor that disparages gay people, Muslims, and women, highly prejudice participants were more likely to discriminate against individuals in those groups.    Our work also examined the degree to which people see sexist humor as inappropriate and deserving of confrontation.  Sexist jokes were seen as significantly less "confrontation-worthy" than sexist comments delivering the exact same message or racist comments and racist jokes.  In short, people see racist comments, racist jokes, and sexist comments as worthy of confrontation, but view sexist jokes as undeserving of confrontation.  This is particularly concerning considering our research describing the negative effects of sexist humor.
