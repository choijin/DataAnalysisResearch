<AbstractNarration>This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research project will provide for the development of a manufacturing advancement known as intelligent melt rotation for the enhanced molding of polymer and nanocomposite products.  A distinction of the project will be a focus on very important but often overlooked polymer melt flow dynamics that occur in molding runner systems. Runner based flow issues in conventional systems can lead to dramatic undesired in-tooling melt flow imbalances and significant product quality problems.  As an extension of an existing multi-year research partnership, a collaborative team of researchers at Lehigh University and Beaumont Technologies, Inc. will address these problems by advancing melt rotation science as a means to manipulate and optimize flow dynamics through runner systems. The project will include phases focused on 1) how melt rotation affects the evolution of critical product quality variables; 2) dimensional, mechanical, and electrical product quality enhancements that can be realized through melt rotation; and 3) the effects of melt rotation on the migration, dispersion, and distribution of any fillers to be included in products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research will include the development of the fundamental experimental and analytical science base required to determine exactly how, when, and where to apply melt rotation principles to achieve selected manufacturing goals.  This will enhance U.S. competitiveness on the industrial front. From a broader perspective the project will also target enhanced education and engineering workforce diversity. A new cross-state outreach program will be developed that will partner Lehigh graduate and undergraduate students, Penn State Erie undergraduate students, and K-12 students from both ends of Pennsylvania on industry- oriented product realization projects involving melt rotation.  This will establish collaborative, team-oriented, and interdisciplinary scientific advancement as an enjoyable and productive norm in the minds of all involved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of the project was to enable higher quality, more reliable, and lower cost manufacturing of polymer products for a wide variety of applications. This was pursued through the experimental and analytical exploration of material shear imbalances that commonly occur during injection molding processes utilized throughout the world to make the majority of plastic products.  These shear imbalances regularly cause significant product quality problems, but better understanding them and making approriate processing accommodations can alleviate the matter.  Throughout the present study one such processing accommodation known as melt rotation technology was focused on.  This type of processing advancement can be utilized to manipulate the effects of shear induced imbalances to better satisfy product design goals.  The critical question is exactly when and how to use melt rotation technology.  The current project significantly contributed to answering this question through carefully coupled experimental and analytical research conducted by an interdisciplinary academic and industrial team.  By working together the Lehigh University/Beaumont Technologies team achieved a better understanding of common mold filling and final product quality problems that can be dramatically improved upon with the appropriate science based application of melt rotation technology.   Along the way, the team also created a unique physical faciility at Lehigh University that can now be utilized to visually probe injection molding processes in new ways going forward.
