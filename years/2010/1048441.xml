<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a joint program and three-day workshop to be held in Tokyo in October 2010 to observe the fiftieth anniversary of the NSF office in Japan.  The workshop will bring together leaders in research and education from the U.S. and Japan to discuss topics of common interest, to review accomplishments of past collaboration, and to identify opportunities for continuing joint activities. Topics on the agenda will encompass science policy as well as key research themes in biology, geology, ocean science, physical sciences, mathematics, information technology, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purposes of the workshop are to recap past accomplishments of U.S.-Japan cooperation in science and to lay the basis for future collaborations. Accordingly it will focus attention on research areas of high priority for both countries. The review of past activities and mutual discussions should identify new opportunities for collaboration research and education. In addition to the formal sessions covering particular research areas the participants will engage in informal communication involving site visits and outreach activities to enhance public understanding of science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The "National Science Foundation (NSF) Tokyo Regional Office Fiftieth Anniversary Symposium: Celebrating Advances from US-Japan Collaboration in Science and Engineering" was envisioned, organized and implemented in coordination with the NSF Tokyo Regional Office to review and highlight past accomplishments, and to chart and promote paths to continued future productivity in cooperative scientific and engineering research. The formal, plenary session of the symposium was convened on October 6, 2010, at the Tokyo American Center of the American Embassy in Tokyo, Japan. The centerpiece of the symposium program, which targeted a general, scientifically-informed audience representing the government, academic and press communities, was a full-day speakers panel. The presentation program featured, first, introductory keynote talks by government officers to set the context for the more scientific and technical presentations that followed, and second, area-specific reviews by experts in their respective fields. In both of these categories of presentations, American and Japanese counterparts formed speaking teams that showcased productive scientific and engineering cooperation. Former NSF Tokyo Regional Office heads served as program moderators and commentators, adding historical administrative and scientific perspective. The grant award supported the active participation expenses of eight American science and engineering researchers as panel speakers, and of the principal investigator as symposium co-organizer. The symposium brought together more than 150 invited attendees representing the stakeholder communities and the press.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The symposium program comprised a total of four introductory remarks by high-level government representatives, three keynote speeches, eight scientific and technical reviews by paired American and Japanese presenters, and closing remarks. The technical research areas represented in the program were: the historical and sociological culture of international collaboration, ocean drilling, plant biology, young scientist and engineer training, earthquake science and structural engineering, astronomy, robotics, and advancing gender diversity in the workforce.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key benefits overall to the researcher-participants were the broader exposure to the scope and value of US-Japan collaboration in science and technology, and the reinforcement of core values related to young researcher education and training, and to workforce diversity. In this context, the keynote lecture theme of science diplomacy drew the thinking of symposium attendees to a higher plane for considering the broader impact of international collaboration. Through the symposium activities, the participants, individually, were able to engage government officials, university and research institute administrators, and other researchers in in-depth discussions related to future collaborative opportunities of shared importance.
