<AbstractNarration>This project is developing curricula modules to prepare manufacturing technology practitioners for the aerospace industry and increase the number of interested candidates for aerospace manufacturing jobs. The project identifies and addresses the changing skill sets required to meet the needs of the aerospace industry for advanced manufacturing technicians through the appropriate knowledge and skill sets coupled with aerospace centric examples and context. Curricula modules are being developed and used by two-year colleges for student education and by industry for in-house training of employees. The project results are being disseminated through a broad set of venues such as the Aerospace Automation Consortium, publications, conferences, and expositions of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, and presented through academic journals and conference proceedings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Advanced Aerospace Manufacturing Education Project    Our nation is not currently producing enough qualified workers to fill important jobs in aerospace companies, and the shortfall will increase as retirements grow in coming years. To maintain America's leadership in the global aerospace marketplace in the 21st century, we must cultivate a highly skilled workforce of scientists, engineers and other technical specialists critical to our national security, our economy and the strength of our industrial base. The aerospace industry added approximately 10,000 workers to its ranks in 2008, at the start of the Advanced Aerospace Manufacturing Education project, closing the year with 655,500 direct employees, with the largest numbers employed in California and Washington. Aircraft manufacturing makes up roughly one-third of the industry's employment. According to Advanced Technology Services (ATS), and ACNeilsen, 41 percent of skilled technicians will retire by 2017 and an Industry Week survey commissioned by ATS found that 39 percent of aerospace companies report that the labor shortage is having an "extreme" effect on their ability to grow. Over the next decade, projections indicate growth in aerospace manufacturing will include an additional 28,000 workers. The impacts of age and attrition will continue to push that number upwards. About 27 percent of all aerospace manufacturing employees will be eligible for retirement by 2008. Prime contractors themselves have identified retirement rates in manufacturing centers to as much as 30% over the next five years. Economic factors within the industry have caused companies to re-assess employee profitability models. It is no longer cost effective to wait 2-3 years for new engineers and technicians to understand the blue-collar workers, combined with the inability to hire new workers in the current economic climate presents a tremendous challenge of transferring knowledge and skills. Through the NSF funded (DUE# 1003637) project, El Camino College, Butler Community College, Oregon Institute of Technology and Purdue University formed the Aerospace Manufacturing Education project (aerospacemfg.org). The project was funded at $864,429 for three years. The purpose of the project was to develop curricula modules for manufacturing technology and engineering students in aerospace manufacturing technology. The modules covered a breadth of topics in manufacturing specific to the aerospace industry, and provided a common fluency in aerospace manufacturing procedures, processes, and terminology. Through the training modules developed, the project addresses specific areas of manufacturing technology relevant to job creation for entry level workers and career growth for existing workers. The primary goal of the project was to continue development of educational modules that are effective in preparing manufacturing technology practitioners for the aerospace industry and increase the number of interested candidates for these jobs. This group includes operators, mechanics and assemblers who are generally prepared with a two-year degree, and manufacturing technologists and engineers who are generally prepared through a four-year degree. Through an iterative process, the project team developed curricula modules with strong support from industry advisors that were easily implemented by college technical educators. Modules consist of PowerPoint presentations, audio-visual materials, instructor notes, pre- and post-tests, suggested student activities and student reference materials. This approach  was used  to address the fact that developing and seeking approval for new curriculum at the community college level can be a very cumbersome and costly process, from inception to delivery sometimes taking as long as three semesters. Rather than bogging faculty down by following course and curriculum approval processes, the modules are designed to be integrated into existing related courses. The modules are ava...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
