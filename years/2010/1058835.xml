<AbstractNarration>Professor Peter Stair of Northwestern is supported by the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the surface chemistry associated with the synthesis of catalytic structures using low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) to prepare heterogeneous catalysts with controlled structures of materials deposited on flat substrates using low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques; (2) to characterize the surface chemistry of the ALD-grown materials using a suite of surface analysis tools; and (3) to study the catalytic chemical transformations of simple molecules relevant to energy and the environment and correlate the catalytic performance with the structure and composition of the ALD-synthesized catalysts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide fundamental information on elementary bond activation reactions and on the nature of the catalytically active sites of these nanoscale catalytic systems at the atomic level. It will also lead to a better understanding of the structure and activity of practical catalysts of relevance to energy and the chemical industry. The students involved in the project will be provided with highly technical training in surface science and catalysis. They will also gain a broader perspective on heterogeneous catalysis as a result of interactions with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

The importance and ubiquity of catalysis in our everyday lives has led to significant efforts to improve the efficiency of these processes.

The application of ALD to catalysis is a recent advancement. During ALD a material is deposited layer-by-layer with atomic control.

It has been demonstrated that a bidentate VO4 monomer (Figure 1, structure 2) is more active than the other known structures. However, the tridentate species (structure 3) is most commonly observed on typical metal oxide supports such as Al2O3. With X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and ALD we have shown that bidentate VO4 monomers can be preferentially formed by the deposition of vanadyl triisopropoxide onto SrTiO3 (001). The key to forming this bidentate structure is in choosing a support whose oxygen atoms have a geometry and spacing that only allow the formation of two vanadium-surface bonds.  Study 2. Titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) is a commonly used reagent in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2. As depicted on the left side of Figure 2, the reaction proceeds between TTIP and surface hydroxyl groups to form a bound Ti species and release isopropanol. The ALD reaction stops when the surface hydroxyls are covered by these species and no longer accessible for further reaction. However, upon reacting TTIP with an oxidized molybdenum surface we observed a process in which TiO2 grows continuously. The reaction never stops.

These two properties make it possible to selectively deposit late transition metal clusters and single atoms by ALD. The deposited metal species are stable because they are trapped by strong binding to the reactive sites. Our initial effort has focused on the growth of Pt in mesoporous zeolite H-MFI. Two types of Pt species, single atoms and clusters, were identified by spectroscopic measurements using CO as a probe molecule. The ratio between these two types of Pt species can be widely tuned by the ALD chemistry. We also observed tha...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
