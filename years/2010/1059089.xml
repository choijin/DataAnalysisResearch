<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Alan Van Orden of Colorado State University. In collaboration with investigators at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Prof. Van Orden and his students will employ high resolution imaging methods to study electronic interactions in small clusters of luminescent quantum dots. The study aims to uncover new basic science about the nature of electronic interactions in quantum dots assemblies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will uncover new basic science about the nature of electronic interactions in luminescent semiconductor nanoparticles assemblies that will be of great value in the rational design of optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells. The synergistic collaboration with researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will provide training opportunities to students and postdoctoral researchers in a field of science that has a direct impact on alternative energy research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project investigated fundamental physical principles governing the transport of electronic energy in small assemblies of nanometer sized semiconductor particles. These particles are sometimes referred to as quantum dots, or QDs, because the electrons-hole pairs created when they absorb light are confined in all three spatial dimensions. This gives quantum dots unique electronic and optical properties, including discreet electronic energy levels and band gaps that are "size-tunable." The energy transport is believed to occur when one quantum dot that is part of an assembly of multiple quantum dots absorbs a particle of light, causing an electron in the quantum dot to undergo a transition to an excited electronic state. This excitation energy can then transfer to a neighboring quantum dot, in turn, promoting the electron in the neighboring quantum dot to an excited state, which can then transfer to yet another neighboring quantum dot. The process terminates when a donor or acceptor quantum loses its energy through photoemission or the energy dissipates as heat.

Knowing how the quantum dots assemble and which structural parameters of the quantum dots affect the energy transport is key to achieving this goal and was the main subject of our research project.
