<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant sponsored Ph.D. students to attend the ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), which is one of the premier conferences in computer science.  Ph.D. students represent the next generation of top notch researchers that will advance science.  To mature as researchers, it is critically important that they get the opportunity to network at premier events, such as POPL.  In total, this grant provided partial or full support for 16 students to attend the conference.  Without this support, these students lacked the financial means to have attended the conference.  Underrepresented groups were especially encouraged to apply for the travel awards sponsored by this grant.   The process of using this grant occurred as follows.  The Professional Activities Committee (PAC) of SIGPLAN (the professional organization that sponsors POPL) selected the individual travel awards.  After the SIGPLAN PAC's own funds were fully distributed, the PAC considered any additional requests that could not be funded from the SIGPLAN PAC budget.  The allocation was prioritized to individuals who were US citizens and also with an eye on students who were felt would benefit the most from the opportunity to participate (e.g., early in their graduate career).  Only students studying at US institutions were funded from this source.  Diverse participation was also sought.
