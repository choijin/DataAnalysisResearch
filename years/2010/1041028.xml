<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR), Intergovernmental Oceanographic  Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, and International Geosphere - Biosphere Programme (IGBP) have formed an international committee to plan the Third Symposium on The Ocean in a High-CO2 World. The third symposium will (1) provide a forum for the global community of scientists studying ocean acidification to share their research results through oral and poster presentations; (2) identify priority research topics and approaches for international collaboration through discussion groups; (3) create a summary of the latest research results for policymakers, and (4) create a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal and a scientific summary to disseminate the results of the symposium to the broader ocean science community and make the results available for assessments such as that of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The symposium will be hosted by a consortium of institutions in Monterey, California in autumn 2012. The planning committee will consider topics identified by national research communities, such as the priority areas identified by NSF through responses to its solicitation of first-year Ocean Acidification proposals-  molecular/cellular, high latitude, and paleoceanographic aspects of ocean acidification - and priorities identified by the National Research Council report Ocean Acidification: A National Strategy to Meet the Challenges of a Changing Ocean.  Funding will emphasize support for early career scientists, students and scientists from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

Following the three science days, a "Policy Day" presented a summary of the science from the first three days, as well as presenting viewpoints on ocean acidification as a public policy issue. Prominent leaders, such as Prince Albert II of Monaco and U.S. Congressman Sam Farr, were joined by Dr.  Jane Lubchenco, the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, Bill Dewey, a commercial oyster farmer, and media representatives and scientists to discuss the need for better information about the effects of ocean acidification and means to reduce and mitigate its effects.    Several forms of written outputs from the symposium have been completed or are in progress.  A paper was published in early 2013 on the early-career scientist activities at the symposium and how these could be used as a model for other meetings. A special issue of the on-line peer-reviewed journal Biogeosciences will be published. Three papers have already completed the peer-review process and are available on the journal Web site. Finally, a Summary for Policymakers is being prepared, to present the scientific information most useful for individuals who need to create environmental policy and manage marine ecosystems.
