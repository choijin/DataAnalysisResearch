<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor Daniel Talham and colleagues Alexander Angerhofer, Lisa McElwee-White, Juan Nino and Adam Veige from the University of Florida will acquire a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer with far infrared capabilities as well as an electrochemical cell and a stop-flow system. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) mechanism-based approaches for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) of copper barriers, (b) enzyme kinetics of wild-type and mutant oxalate decarboxylase, (c) design and evaluation of electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction, (d) stopped-flow and electrochemical IR analysis of oxygen atom transfer from trianionic pincer chromium(V)-oxo species, (e) studies of FTIR in organic synthesis, and (f) studies of structure and electrical relationships in superconductors and dielectrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique used to obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption or emission of solids, liquids or gases. An FTIR spectrometer simultaneously collects spectral data in a wide spectral range and transforms the raw data using a mathematical algorithm to provide a spectrum. This type of modern instrumentation has opened up new applications of infrared spectroscopy using electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths longer than those of visible light. The stop-flow system allows rapid mixing for the study of chemical kinetics and the electrochemical cell allows use of direct current to oxidize or reduce compounds and simultaneously study the changes in the spectra. The instrumentation will be located in a spectroscopy facility and will be used by a large number of researchers and students.</AbstractNarration>

Analysis of the kinetic data, as well as additional computational  and X-ray crystallography data, now point more strongly to a "ring  strain gradient" as the most significant selectivity driver for multi-functionalization of  BTF.    The Sumerlin group has used the  Bruker v80 FTIR instrument to investigate the conjugation of a novel  polymeric drug to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). These particles have been proposed as drug carriers with remote release actuation  triggered by the heat generated upon exposure to an alternating  magnetic field (AMF). The objective of this work to synthesize a  novel polymeric drug-magnetic nanoparticle conjugate system, which  will significantly improve the drug loading, water solubility and  biocompatibility of the magnetic nanoparticles. It will reduce the  possibility of deactivation during circulation as well. The  polymeric drug is synthesized by RAFT (Reversible Addition  Fragmentation chain Transfer) polymerization with a  temperature-sensitive Diels-Alder linked fluorescein monomer. The  drug release behavior could be controlled by localized hyperthermia  induced by alternating magnetic field. The Bruker v80 FTIR instrument is  an important tool to investigate the conjugation of the polymeric  drug to the magnetic nanoparticles.   The  Talham group has used Far IR spectroscopy (600-250 cm-1)  in an exploratory study to probe the Mo-C bonding in a new  coordination polymer (K4Cu2.5Mo(CN)12.5&midd...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
