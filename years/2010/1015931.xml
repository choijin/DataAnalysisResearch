<AbstractNarration>US-China Workshop on High Performance Computing Application Acceleration&lt;br/&gt;The Arctic Region Supercomputing Center (ARSC) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Chinese colleagues will organize a US-China workshop on application acceleration for high performance computing (HPC) applications.  This workshop, to be held in Beijing in October 2010, will address challenges for achieving efficient application performance on HPC systems.  These challenges have grown, mainly due to the prevalence of multicore processors and acceleration hardware such as GPUs and the Cell processor.  The common interests of Chinese and American scientists in responding to issues of application acceleration have been confirmed through collaborative workshop planning, and some face-to-face visits, but there are few regular opportunities for scholarly communication between US and China researchers on these topics.  The workshop will bring US leaders in acceleration technologies to China for three days of scholarly communication and collaboration, with a specific goal of identifying mutually interesting topics for ongoing collaborative research projects.  The workshop will include faculty, students, junior researchers, and senior researchers, with participants from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;Application acceleration in high performance computing is not a solved problem.  Some of the same acceleration technologies used in new high performance computing (HPC) systems are found in today?s desktop and notebook computers, including GPUs and multicore processors.  However, HPC systems are thousands of times larger, and the programs that run on them need more effective communication among the various components and methods for dividing the computation across the system, and other issues such as dealing with very large output and the potential for individual components to fail need to be addressed.  The workshop will bring together experts from the two countries to share their views on the state of the art in application acceleration, with the goal of enhancing scientific discovery and analysis through high performance computing.  After the workshop, the US and China participants will pursue joint research projects and scientific collaborations. This workshop is supported by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering with co-funding from the Computing and Communication Foundations Program of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ High performance computing (HPC) is at the leading edge of solving computationally based problems on powerful next-generation computer systems.  These systems incorporate advances in hardware and software that create a need to consider how best to use them, in order to take full advantage of their unique capabilities and architectures. Researchers in the field of high performance computing worldwide have similar interests in this application acceleration, yet there has been comparatively little direct communication between researchers in China and those in the US.  This includes formal conferences and workshops, and ongoing research collaborations.  To address this lack of communication, we held a workshop in China in October 2010.  The workshop took steps to open pathways to effective research collaborations on HPC application acceleration between leading institutions and scholars in both countries.  The National Science Foundation (NSF) funded travel for the US-based scholars to China.  China participants were sponsored by their home institutions.  China local events such as evening banquets and tourism for US participants, as well as a logistical coordinator, were funded by three co-coordinating institutions.  These were Beihang University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Tsinghua University.  Supplemental support came from Intel (China) and NVIDIA (US).   Workshop coordinators met in Beijing in April, and again in Illinois in July 2010, to plan the workshop.  Based on mutual interests, two major application areas were chosen to structure the workshop: earth systems (including climate and weather) and molecular dynamics (including computational chemistry).   The workshop was judged by attendees to be highly successful. It was intended as a first step in ongoing collaborations, and the remaining steps will be pursued during upcoming months and years.  These steps are anticipated to occur at several levels.  At the national and transnational levels, workshop co-coordinators and participants will interact with national funding agencies (particular NSF and the China Nationa Science Foundation) to foster joint funding opportunities and other mechanisms for multi-nation funding.  At the institution level, participants will develop memoranda of understanding, site visits, campus-based events, short- and longer-term visits, and other ways to make it easier to build deeper cross-border research relationships.  At the disciplinary level, additional workshops or meetings, including meetings that are subsidiary to larger meetings (such as the annual IEEE Supercomputing conference), will help bring in new people, and insure discussions and outcomes are relevant to specifically identified areas of computational science.  At the individual level, the workshop served to introduce participants from the US and China, and the combination of formal presentations, informal events, and group sessions helped participants to identify areas of common interests.  There were firm expectations of follow-up conversations, meetings, information sharing, and grant seeking.  Information sharing, and the development of new interpersonal relationships, was a major outcome of the workshop.  The co-coordinators are committed to monitoring, mentoring, and otherwise supporting the development of new research collaborations, and to broaden participation among US and China researchers.  A future workshop, anticipated for 2011, will look back at what worked and what needs further work.   We hope to be able to report further progress on all aspects of collaborations and national-level coordination opportunities at that time.
