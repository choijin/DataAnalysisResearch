<AbstractNarration>This project utilizes the power of phylogenetic systematics to identify and classify specialized species of fungi associated with wild rubber trees (Hevea). A goal of the project is to document fungal species that can be used in biological control of devastating Hevea diseases, including the South American Leaf Blight (SALB). The project will:  characterize fungal species associated with wild Hevea species by collecting and identifying the fungi using modern phylogenetic tools; elucidate coevolutionary patterns between fungi and their hosts, and host preferences, by analyzing and comparing phylogenies of selected fungi and their corresponding plant hosts; and identify biocontrol agents against Hevea diseases by evaluating selected fungi in biocontrol assays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The largest and most productive commercial rubber plantations are in Asia and Africa. This is due to the difficulty of establishing plantations in regions where SALB exists. SALB is not yet present in Africa or Asia, and its potential spread to these continents represents significant biological and economic concerns. Even though potential impacts of SALB are large, few control methods have been published. Fungal biocontrol against Hevea diseases could be part of this solution.</AbstractNarration>
