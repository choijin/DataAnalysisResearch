<AbstractNarration>SES-1030395&lt;br/&gt;PI: Roger L. Moore&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Jordan W. Smith&lt;br/&gt;Institution: North Carolina State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research analyzes individuals' perceived ability to adapt to changing climatic conditions. At issue is how individuals' perceived resilience is affected by social, economic, and environmental contexts. It is suggested that individuals' ability to adapt to changing climatic conditions is limited by both economic and social-psychological dependencies. Additionally, the hypothesis is presented that the dependence/adaptation relationship is influenced by the characteristics of individuals' social networks. The role social networks play in the dependence/adaptation relationship is tested through three mixed-methods case studies in rural, resource dependent communities within the Southeast. The approach improves the empirical understanding and theoretical development of resilience as a social process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;By gaining a clearer understanding of how individuals' social networks affect their perceived ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, decision makers can focus on policy solutions that increase adaptive capacities and build social resilience.</AbstractNarration>
