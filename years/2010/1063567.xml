<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Sustainability of aging structures remains of vital importance to the United States.  This is especially true in the aerospace industry where repair and remanufacture of aging aircraft are becoming increasingly important.. Built-up aircraft structures and skins are prone to cracking during normal lifetime because of the high stress and repeated loading conditions.  As an alternative to the high cost of replacing these structures, crack repair methods such as hole-drilling and arc-welding have been developed.  These techniques may adversely affect the material adjacent to a repair.  The potential for cost savings and increased lifespan of aging aircraft using advanced manufacturing technologies such as friction stir welding and processing is very significant.  Friction stir welding is a solid state (no melting) forging process and has the potential to produce enhanced repairs in high strength aluminum alloys such as 2000 and 7000 series alloys are used widely in applications of aircraft body panels.   The research presented here is a step in investigating the potential of friction stir weld repair of cracked panels.  The research also investigates the effect of multiple repairs (multiple-pass welding) on the failure lifetime of the repaired components.  Results show the ability for friction stir weld repair to significantly enhance the lifetime of cracked panels.  In the case of multi-pass welding, the repairs showed the ability to restore the lifetime of the component (comparable to the original material) and eliminate defects produced during un-optimized welds.  Figure 1 below shows the effect of multi-pass welding to eliminate void defects in the weld zone.   The funding for this project was also  used to enhance educational development in welding engineering on the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&amp;T) campus and our partner vocational college Western Dakota Technical Institute.  The funding was also used to support Native American students (a key initiative on the SDSM&amp;T campus).  It was used to directly support two Native American SDSM&amp;T undergraduate research students (Jon Lu and Sean Longfox).  The funding also bolstered activities which support underrepresented Native American high school students such as the GEAR-UP Summer Program for Native American Students by providing an opportunity for these high school students to be directly involved with this research program.  Figure 2 below shows Native American undergraduate student Jonathan Lu working with Native American high school students as part of the South Dakota GEAR-UP program.
