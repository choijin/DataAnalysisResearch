<AbstractNarration>The project concerns symplectic topology, mirror symmetry, and their relationship. On the topological side, we study symplectic cohomology and its analogue for Lagrangian intersections (wrapped Floer cohomology). Recent advances of Bourgeois-Ekholm-Eliashberg and the author yield powerful computational tools, which we intend to exploit in order to study non-uniqueness questions for symplectic structures on open manifolds. On the mirror symmetry side, we consider decompositions of symplectic manifolds into pairs-of-pants, in the sense of Mikhalkin. One question under consideration is whether the Fukaya category can be reconstructed by gluing together pieces corresponding to each pair-of-pants. In general, this is not true and has to be modified by instanton contributions. However, there are cases where such contributions should be absent, and this would give a new viewpoint on Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a broader perspective, a crucial issue in many current investigations in physics and mathematics is the emergence of the classical notion of space from a quantum description. In the situation under study here, the main feature is that the construction of the classical space involves a series of gradual distortions, which can be determined by complicated but explicit formulae. This is a simplified mathematical model of a general class of physical theories, and not realistic as such. However, studying such models shows us where we are facing conceptual difficulties, which is important in order to develop our understanding further.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to investigate the "qualitative" or "topological" structures that arise in classical mechanics. This is generally speaking an active field of research, and indeed, this project together with progress by others in the field have led to a signifiant change in our understanding of those structures.  The first part of the project addressed what seemed an artificial "barrier" which prevented us from understanding the apparent complexity of the topological situation. The ideas that had been brought up in this context have now been combined with recent notions of "flexibility" (work of Eliashberg and others). The outcome is that the topological situation is probably less complicated than imagined, and instead of having encountered a "barrier", we may have actually reached the limits of topological constructions. Thus, while this situation is far from being fully resolved, significant progress has been made.  The second part of the project concerned notions of "locality" in the same context. There, only partial progress has been made, due to the high complexity of the methods required. Nevertheless, these notions have been successfully applied in several example situations.  Unexpected discoveries that have been made during the project include a better understanding of the phenomenon of periodicity or "flux"; and a renewed interest in the iteration theory of symplectic maps.  The results of the project have been disseminated through papers, talks (including ones for non-specialists), and lecture notes.  Concerning the aspect of training the scientific workforce, the project has partially supported the work of several graduate students (3 of whom have already completed their PhD; 2 of those are working in academia, and the last one in industry).
