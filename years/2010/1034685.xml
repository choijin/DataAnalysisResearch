<AbstractNarration>The sixth NSF/Northeast Workshop on Systems and Control will be held at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, from Friday April 23 through Sunday April 25, 2010. The workshop primarily aims to enhance the education and professional preparation of graduate students and postdocs by providing them with an opportunity to present their work; to interact with their peers, established researchers in the field, researchers from industry and government labs, and program managers from the National Science Foundation; to hear about cutting edge research from plenary speakers; and to learn about cross-disciplinary topics of interest from keynote lecturers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In additional to the student participants, this workshop will bring together leading researchers in the (broadly interpreted) field of control, some of whom we intend to invite as plenary speakers and keynote lecturers. As such, the workshop will provide a forum for the much needed interaction between control theory and various cross-disciplinary application areas, resulting in a cross-polination of ideas and providing an impetus for interdisciplinary collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will encourage a broad and diverse group of students to pursue research careers, by providing them with an opportunity to closely interact with leading researchers in the field in an intimate setting. Moreover, the unique opportunity to get to know and interact with program managers will be invaluable for these students and postdocs as they transition into independent junior researchers over the next few years.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit: The single track workshop provided a forum for the  much needed interaction between control theory and various  cross-disciplinary application areas of national interest, including power systems and systems biology, resulting in an exchange of  ideas and providing an impetus for interdisciplinary collaborations.  Broader Impacts: The  proposed workshop encouraged a broad and diverse group of students  to pursue research careers, by providing them with an opportunity to  closely interact with leading researchers in the field in an informal  setting, as well as with panelists representing academia, industry and national laboratories. Moreover, the unique opportunity to get to know and interact  with NSF program managers will be invaluable for these students and postdocs  as they transition into independent junior researchers over the next  few years.
