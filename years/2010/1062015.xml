<AbstractNarration>There is considerable current interest in decision support that might help improve difficult decisions, such as those that planners make when considering uncertain, long-term environmental changes. Previous research and practice suggests that scenario-based planning processes can help decision makers to restructure decisions by designing additional and adaptive options. This research tests this scenario hypothesis by comparing decisions using decision-support tools that provide forecasts in one of two ways: either by presenting best-estimate probabilities or by presenting alternative scenarios. The hypothesis states that the scenario version will lead to higher probability of a successful restructuring of the decision options. Participants have the challenge of managing a hypothetical fishery. Acting as individuals or in groups, they set a suitable catch-limit policy for a period extending into the future. Participants then use an interactive fisheries model decision-support tool that helps them to evaluate options and to design new ones, while placing reasonable constraints on the options available and their potential performance. Participants are informed that key input data, such as the sustainable yield from the fishery, are the subject of scientific disagreement, resulting in deep uncertainty about the future. The fisheries model will show that a particular adaptive management strategy will, in contrast to other decision options, satisfy the participants? conflicting objectives over a wide range of expectations about sustainable yield and other uncertainties. But the options initially given the participants will not include this adaptive strategy nor will they find it immediately obvious that such a strategy exists. The primary experimental manipulation is whether the decision-support tool organizes information in terms of best-estimate forecasts or in terms of scenarios. The primary outcome measure is the probability of identifying the successful adaptive strategy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to help decision makers design new and potentially more successful decision options could be a valued aspect of decision support. But much research on decision making and decision support focuses on choice among a fixed set of options, rather than on the design of new options that might reduce difficult tradeoffs. The presence of deep uncertainty ? where decision makers may be unsure about contingencies and probabilities ? can make it even more difficult to understand or agree on the potential consequences of alternative options, and thus to design new options effectively. The results of these experiments shed light on the social and psychological processes involved in complex, deeply-uncertain policy decisions. The work also informs improvements in decision support methodologies and contributes to ongoing policy discussions regarding the most effective means of conveying deeply uncertain information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Which is better for decision support &ndash; scenarios or probabilistic forecasts?   Decision support systems provide structured information that helps people make better choices. Those designing such systems &ndash; for instance ones for environmental management &ndash; often choose between scenarios and forecasts when considering how best to characterize uncertainty for their users.  Some commentators stress the importance of probabilistic forecasts, arguing that decision makers ultimately need this information to choose wisely among options. Others argue that a set of scenarios &ndash; defined here as descriptions of alternative future conditions with no probabilities attached &ndash; can help decision makers expand the range of futures and the range of decision options they consider.    This study tested what we call the scenario hypothesis, namely, that Decision support processes that employ scenarios, as opposed to probabilistic forecasts, to characterize deep uncertainty will help decision makers consider a wider range of futures and attributes and that this broader vantage will encourage the choice of more robust options that perform reasonably well in a wide range of futures.    To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment that asked participants to recommend a fishery management strategy that achieved both economic and environmental goals under uncertainty with the help of an interactive, computerized decision support tool.  The tool was designed to provide a rich policy environment and was built on a realistic (if simple) fishery model.  The toolÆs dynamic interface presented users with a large, complicated set of potential decision options that required a significant amount of effort to explore, such that actively comparing all options under different futures was not feasible.  Only a small number of strategies performed well for both objectives over the entire range of uncertainty. (We refer to such strategies as robust.) For some participants the tool presented information on uncertainty with scenarios (Scenario Condition); for others the tool presented probabilistic forecasts (Forecast Condition).  We wanted to understand how the different uncertainty presentations affected which strategies participants considered and which strategies they chose.   We found that participants in the Scenario Condition were significantly more likely to choose robust strategies than those in Forecast Condition, thus supporting the scenario hypothesis. Participants in the Scenario Condition were also more likely to report that they considered multiple futures, rather than a single future. In particular, participants in the Scenario Condition appeared to pay more attention to worst cases than participants in the Forecast Condition. Participants in both conditions overwhelmingly chose high expected value strategies, that is ones that performed for both measures for many (though not always all) futures.  This finding provides evidence that participants understood the decision support tool and were using it as intended. Unexpectedly, participants were no more likely to choose such high expected value in the Forecast the Scenario Condition, even though the former had access to probabilistic information, while the latter did not.    These results provide important lessons for those designing decision support tools.  Most basically, this experiment suggests that using scenarios, rather than forecasts, to display deep uncertainties can encourage users to consider a wider range of futures and to choose robust strategies. The experiment also provides evidence that a careful choice of scenarios, even without probabilities, can provide sufficient information for good decision making.  Future work might extend these results by examining ways to combine scenarios and forecasts and by providing a richer context for the ways in which scenarios and forecasts might differ.
