<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research project is to develop a novel design methodology for a class of fiber-reinforced composite materials, combining the greenness of geopolymers with the enhanced durability of Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC).  Sustainable alternatives to energy intensive, high carbon footprint, Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC)-based building materials are needed in order to meet the needs of both new construction and to maintain existing infrastructure in harmony with the natural environment.  True sustainability demands both material greenness and enhanced durability, which lowers the need for costly and environmentally unfriendly repair work.  These new Engineered Geopolymer Composites (EGCs) will provide a highly sustainable alternative to OPC-based materials for infrastructure systems, an alternative that is badly needed and not currently provided by any other materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a societal level, this project will touch the life of every person by producing truly sustainable construction materials that substantially lower the energy consumption and carbon production of the building and construction industries.  Replacing even one percent of OPC-based materials with EGCs would be equivalent to taking millions of cars off of the road.  Further, the novel design methodology will be adaptable to numerous fields beyond civil engineering, leading to more efficient materials development elsewhere.  Locally, high school and college students will benefit as the results of the research are incorporated into classes (both at the university and through remote learning) and demonstration projects.  The research will also be incorporated into an established local pre-college engineering program, intended to increase the number of minority students in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
