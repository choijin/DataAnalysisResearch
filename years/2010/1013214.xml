<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Directed cell movement in response to chemical signals occurs during development, axon guidance, wound healing, tumor progression, and the immune response.  Cells interpret external cues through signaling networks and then engage migration machinery to generate mechanical force for membrane protrusion at its leading edge.  Our work focuses specifically on the interface between the cellÃ†s signaling guidance system and the molecules that generate motive forces.  My summer project focused on analyzing the behavior of these molecules in living cells using high-resolution microscopy techniques.  Understanding biophysical behaviors of individual signaling molecules allows one to  explore how emergent protein properties underscore directed cell migration and ultimately enhances of our understanding of cell migration disorders like cancer metastasis or chronic inflammation.
