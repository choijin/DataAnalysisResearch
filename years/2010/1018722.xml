<AbstractNarration>Controlling Uncertainty: On the Sequential Refinement of Belief&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on a variety of information acquisition and sensing applications in which a&lt;br/&gt;decision maker, by carefully controlling a sequence of actions with uncertain outcomes,&lt;br/&gt;dynamically refines his belief about a phenomenon of interest in a speedy, accurate, and efficient&lt;br/&gt;manner. The model includes a class of applications in communications, design of experiments,&lt;br/&gt;cognitive science, and sensor management. In particular, the following three problems are&lt;br/&gt;tackled.&lt;br/&gt;? Active Sequential Hypothesis Testing: There are a set of hypotheses, one of which is true. A&lt;br/&gt;decision maker is asked to identify the correct hypothesis by sequentially employing either one&lt;br/&gt;of available sensing actions. Actions costs differently and produce statistically distinct&lt;br/&gt;observations. Given a penalty for error in declaration, the work investigates the optimal&lt;br/&gt;selection of sensing actions.&lt;br/&gt;? Feedback Schemes for Joint Source-Channel Coding with Bandwidth Expansion: A message is&lt;br/&gt;to be conveyed to a receiver over a noisy memoryless channel with feedback. The expected&lt;br/&gt;distortion between the message and the receiver?s construction is sought to be minimized over&lt;br/&gt;the choice of causal encoding functions as well as the decoding function.&lt;br/&gt;? Joint Source-Channel Coding over a Multiple Access Channel with Feedback: Multiple&lt;br/&gt;transmitters convey messages to a common receiver over a noisy memoryless multiple access&lt;br/&gt;channel with perfect output feedback.&lt;br/&gt;These problems boil down to the sequential control of a dynamical system whose system is the&lt;br/&gt;conditional distribution of the unknown (true hypothesis, message, etc) and whose dynamics is&lt;br/&gt;dictated by the Bayes? rule. In particular, the optimal choice of actions, i.e. refinement in the&lt;br/&gt;conditional distribution and reduction of uncertainty, is investigated.</AbstractNarration>
