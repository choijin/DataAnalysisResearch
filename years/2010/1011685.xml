<AbstractNarration>The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a high priority project in the world high-energy physics program. As part of an ongoing effort to educate and train young scientists for this project, the ILC Global Design Effort (GDE), the ILC Steering Committee (ILCSC) and the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA) Beam Dynamics Panel will jointly organize the Fifth International Accelerator School for Linear Colliders in 2010 in Europe. This award provides funds for partial support to U.S. students to attend the school.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project provided financial support for young US scientists attending the 2010 International Accelerator School for Linear Colliders, which took place from October 25 to November 5, 2010 at Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerlnad. The school was endorsed by the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA), a leading organization of the world high-energy physics (HEP) and accelerator community. Its goal was to train young generations for the next big machine after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), namely, a future lepton collider. Since the time scale from conception to completion of such a big machine is very long (20-30 years), the training and education of scientists and engineers for tomorrow is of critical importance. We must have a new army ready before the old soldiers fade away. The world interest in such a big machine is strong. The number of applications from 44 countries exceeded the number of students that we could accommodate by a ratio of 4 to 1. The admitted students represented a young, talented and highly motivated group. They received the best education at the school from a dozen renowned physicists in their respective fields: superconducting rf, room temperature rf, instrumentation, controls, electron and positron sources, linear accelerators, damping rings and beam delivery systems. The training they received have a wide range of applications, not only in HEP, but also in other research areas (such as light sources and spallation neutron sources) as well as in industry, national security, clean energy and medicine (isotope production, imaging and radiation therapy). Many of them will merge as leaders in science and technology 10 or 20 years from now.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/10/2011<br>      Modified by: Weiren&nbsp;Chou</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/1011685/1011685_10019831_1318282143880_Groupphoto--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/1011685/1011685_10019831_1318282143880_Groupphoto--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2010 LC School"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/1011685/1011685_10019831_1318282143880_Groupphoto--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2010 LC School"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2010 International Accelerator School for Linear Colliders, October 25 - November 5, 2010 at Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerland.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Hermann Schmickler</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Weiren&nbsp;Chou</div> <div class="imageTitle">2010 LC School</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
