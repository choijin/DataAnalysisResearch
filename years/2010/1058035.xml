<AbstractNarration>This award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports the work of Professor Gideon A. Fraenkel of Ohio State University on the structure and fast equilibrium dynamic behavior of carbanions and carbanionic species. In the work particular organolithium compounds are prepared which are designed to reveal in simple fashion specific aspects of structure and dynamic behavior. Structures are investigated using NMR, X-ray crystallography and DFT modeling. The kinetics and mechanisms of fast molecular reorganization processes at equilibrium are revealed from NMR line shape analysis.  These processes may include the dynamics of carbanionic inversion, carbon-lithium bond and ligand lithium bond, exchange respectively and aggregate interconversion. Aspects of structure of interest include the effect on degree of conjugation within the carbanion due to orientation of anion and cation. These studies will be applied to lithium salts of dihydropyridines.  Other studies involve a new possible preparation of ladder polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader aspects of this program involve opportunities to train undergraduates including women and members of underrepresented minorities in a variety of sophisticated techniques which will help them prepare for careers in industry or academia.  Undergraduates have always been involved in the research.  There is extensive collaboration with groups around the world, within the Chemistry department here at Ohio State University and in industry on dynamic NMR problems and as well as on chemistry developed by the Fraenkel group. All these interactions provide excellent contacts for members of the group.</AbstractNarration>
