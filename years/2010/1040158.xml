<AbstractNarration>This NSF MRI Award funds the acquisition of a high field 800 MHz NMR spectrometer to enhance research programs at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). In addition to providing support for NSF and other federally funded research, the new NMR system provides a substantial gain in sensitivity (up to 260% increase) and resolution (up to 137% increase) for three-dimensional NMR experiments, compared to the existing lower field instrumentation at UMCP (600 MHz). Much of the research that would be strengthened and enhanced by the acquisition of this NMR spectrometer can be grouped into three key areas: Studies of Biomolecular Structure, Dynamics, and Function; Catalysis and Materials; and Nanoscience and Supramolecular Chemistry. All three areas are interdisciplinary research thrusts at the University of Maryland, and they provide an excellent avenue for educating and training a significant number of students. Training students, especially those from traditionally underrepresented groups, in these areas will have an impact on the use of NMR. The results of the research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
