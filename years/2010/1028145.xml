<AbstractNarration>One of the most important characteristics of organisms is their body size -- influencing all physiological processes, life history traits and, ultimately, each of the fundamental processes affecting the diversity and geography of life (immigration, evolution and extinction).  Despite its fundamental and pervasive importance, body size varies tremendously among as well as within species.  This variation, however, is far from random, exhibiting ecological, geographic and temporal trends that are so general and intriguing that they are termed ecogeographic "rules" of nature (e.g., Bergmann's rule, the island rule and Cope's rule).  The investigators will conduct empirical research to develop an integrative theory that will provide a single conceptual construct in which to understand patterns of body size variation across space and time; patterns that are typically viewed as unrelated phenomena.  The international and integrative research program the investigators have developed combines theoretical, experimental and comparative approaches across a range of disparate, but strategically selected species and over a broad range of time scales (from the recent and historic periods through the Pliocene), thus allowing them to explore the generality, antiquity and causality of geographic variation in this fundamental feature of life.  The principal approach in this project will be to compare body sizes of museum specimens to test for predicted geographic and ecological trends among three focal groups of mammals: 1) mammals inhabiting paleo-islands during the Pliocene and Pleistocene; 2) extant, native mammals inhabiting islands across the globe, and 3) mammals introduced onto islands by Polynesians and by Europeans during the past 2000 years.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide an integrative understanding of the factors influencing one of life's most fundamental characteristics -- body size, and its variation over space and time.  Given that body size influences all physiological, behavioral and ecological characteristics of organisms, these studies will provide important information on the capacities of animals to adapt to environmental challenges including climate change and modification of native landscapes.  The products of the fully funded research will include development of international partnerships between research labs in Europe, New Zealand and Hawaii, web access to all scientific data, mentoring of a Ph.D. level graduate research assistant and undergraduate assistants, development of an undergraduate field course in Biogeography, Evolution and Conservation of Insular Biotas, partnership with natural history museums to create an exhibit on The Evolution of Body Size on Islands, and consultations with conservation organizations to assist them in developing effective strategies for conserving not just diversity per se, but also a fundamental aspect of the natural character of native species -- their body size.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Body size is one of the most fundamental aspects of any organism, influencing the ways in which it interacts with the environment and other organisms. Body size of species are not constant through time, but instead evolve in response to changing environmental conditions. One of the most fascinating aspects of evolutionary change in body size is exhibited by mammalian species that inhabit islands. Over time, mammals that colonize islands often show pronounced changes in body size, such that small animals (like shrews) tend to become larger, whereas large animals (like elephants) tend to become smaller. As illustrated in the attached image, these changes can be dramatic. For example, one elephant species formerly found on an island in the Mediterranean Sea was less than one-twentieth the size of its mainland ancestor. Our project aimed to better document and understand these changes in mammalian species on islands worldwide. To address these issues we compiled data from published studies that recorded body size of insular mammals and we took measurements on the size of specimens preserved in museum collections. We found that patterns of insular dwarfism and gigantism are common and that the direction and magnitude of change in body size can be explained by the characteristics of individual species (such as their ancestral body size) and by environmental factors (such as presence of competitors and predators) on the islands where these species occur. We found the most pronounced changes in body size for species that had been isolated for long periods of time, but also found that species that had colonized islands quite recently, e.g., within the past few thousand years, also showed changes in body size. This work is important for scientists because it shows that the documented pattern, the so called &lsquo;island rule&rsquo;, is well-supported on islands worldwide and because it lays the foundation for understanding the factors the promote rapid evolutionary change in body size. This work is also important in planning for the conservation of continental species over the long term. This is because most areas set aside to preserve species (such as national parks) now exist in an insular context, such that the species that live within these preserves occur within a restricted area. Consequently, these species are likely to be subjected to changes in body size (often quite pronounced) over the next few hundred years and without proper planning we run the risk of miniaturizing many of the largest and most majestic species on the planet.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/24/2013<br>      Modified by: Dov&nbsp;F&nbsp;Sax</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1028145/1028145_10048082_1374679486132_ImageforProjectReport--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1028145/1028145_10048082_1374679486132_ImageforProjectReport--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Change in body size of mainland-island species pairs"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1028145/1028145_10048082_1374679486132_ImageforProjectReport--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Change in body size of mainland-island species pairs"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Small mainland species (like shrews) that colonize islands tend to become large relative to their mainland ancestors, whereas large species (like elephants) that colonize islands tend to become small.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Figure 6, Lomolino et al. 2013; Journal of Bio...]]></DRECONTENT>
