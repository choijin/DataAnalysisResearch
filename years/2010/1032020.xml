<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems studies conducted by the University of Cincinnati site (lead), the Missouri University of Science and Technology site and the University of Michigan site. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-507.  The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research focuses on methods for controlling and evaluating the quality of data used in prognostic applications of system health and indicating when maintenance is needed. The proposal is well conceived, well organized, and the goals and objectives of the research are presented well. The tasks to be accomplished over the two years are clearly outlined, as well as which of the cooperating institutions will carry out the work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research answers a significant research question raised by the industrial partners. For many companies assuring the quality of datasets before actually performing prognostics can avoid unnecessary investment in redundant prognostics analysis due to poor quality datasets. Assured data quality will improve prognostics results, which leads to better maintenance decisions and significant cost saving. The IMS Center has actively involved minority and female graduate students and has provided a number of Research Experience for Teachers and Undergraduates (RET and REU) projects.</AbstractNarration>

The main  application of the project outcomes is related to fault detection,  root-cause analysis, and prediction to prevent costly unscheduled  downtime and catastrophic failures.  Specifically, three types of outliers have been successfully studied and addressed through model-based approach:  Random Gaussian noise in sensor input - including noise injected due to  environmental factors, sensor quality and accuracy, and incorrect  installation of sensors and wires. Sensor failure - including sensor damage, broken wire, and obstruction of sensor (e.g. due to clogging) Spurious errors and data corruption - including lost data due to system  power disruption, corruption of data during transmission and storage.    These outliers result in false and missed alarms for the diagnostics and prognostics scheme. Missed alarms may lead to a costly, unscheduled downtime of machines, vehicles, and systems thus reducing competitive edge of companies.
