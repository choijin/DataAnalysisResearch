<AbstractNarration>Subduction is a process in which oceanic crust and upper mantle are consumed beneath the margins of island arcs, such as Japan and Sumatra, or the margins of continents, as along the northwest coast of the U.S. Subducton gives rise to violent volcanic eruptions as well as great ?megathrust? earthquakes and tsunamis. Dramatic demonstrations of the destructive effects of subduction have occurred recently in Indonesia, Japan, and Chile. Water released from the subducted plate is a significant, but poorly understood, contributor to these events; this seismic survey of the Juan de Fuca Plate has the specific aim of characterizing the plate from its formation at the ridge, through alteration and hydration of the plate as it ages, to subduction of the plate along the Cascadia margin. Owing to the very high risk of large earthquakes in Cascadia, improved understanding of the role of water in the subduction process is a primary broader impact of the survey. The project is also an important adjunct to the Cascadia Initiative, a multi-year deployment of instruments both onshore and offshore to study the structure and seismicity of the Cascadia region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The largest earthquakes and the most explosive volcanic eruptions on our planet occur at subduction zones where one tectonic plate descends beneath another. A key parameter that affects many aspects of the subduction process is how much water is bound within the  downgoing plate and how that water is distributed.  At the Cascadia subduction zone, which extends from northern California to British Columbia, the Juan de Fuca plate descends beneath North America giving rise to large earthquakes in the geologic past. Regional variations in subduction zone properties and seismicity are observed along the Cascadia margin and variations in the hydration and structure of the subducting plate could contribute.  In order to further our understanding of the state of hydration of the Juan de Fuca plate prior to subduction, a marine active source seismic study was conducted across the plate and along the continental margin. The data acquired provide the first plate-scale imaging of any oceanic plate as well as new constraints on the structure of the crust and uppermost mantle of the Juan de Fuca plate. Our primary results include first evidence for subduction bend faulting through the crust and into the mantle at Cascadia and the discovery of regional variations in this bend faulting with greater extents of bend related plate hydration inferred for offshore Oregon. The amount of water bound in the incoming Juan de Fuca plate estimated from the seismic data is lower than at other subduction zones with most water bound in the upper crust.  However a marked regional change is observed at ~45&deg;45Ã†N with higher water contents to the south of this location.  Our seismic reflection images reveal a coincident change in the density and orientation of crustal faults at this location, consistent with more subduction bend faulting extending through the crust offshore central Oregon.  Our characterization of the state of the Juan de Fuca plate prior to subduction bears on studies of earthquake hazards in the heavily populated Pacific Northwest where great Cascadia megathrust and damaging intraslab earthquakes have occurred in the historical past. The new data provide support for the presence of a zone of aseismic slip offshore Oregon and reveal segmentation in down-going plate structure associated with pseudofaults inherited from crustal formation that coincides with previously proposed paleoseismic rupture zones, relevant for predictions of seismic hazard along the margin.
