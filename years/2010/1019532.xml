<AbstractNarration>This project builds upon the successful Phase 1 project, STEM Real World Applications Modules. New modules are developed which are closely tied to classroom concepts with mathematics used in industry. The team of investigators includes leaders in the mathematical research and educational communities, and mathematicians with years of industry experience.  The overarching goal of this team is to show undergraduate students that strong mathematical skills lead to more employment options and greater chances of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dissemination plan has three main components. The project impacts students and faculty members nationwide through distribution of effective teaching materials. A key part of the dissemination starts with 12 faculty members at 7 additional institutions beta testing the developed modules. After beta-testing, the modules are made available on the project website. Finally presentations about the modules and their effect on student learning are given at conferences, and articles about the modules are submitted to educational and research journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    One of the most common questions posed by mathematics students is "Where will I ever use this?" Traditional mathematics curricula seldom offer cutting-edge, real-world problems encountered in industry. It is not easy to find applications that are both accessible to students and relevant to their course work. As a result, mathematics majors are not aware of what careers their coursework is preparing them for outside of teaching.  To provide professors with this material, we created a series of focused learning materials, or modules, which featured real-world exercises suitable for undergraduates. For example, Menger?s Theorem is used to investigate the reliability of National LambdaRail?s fiber-optic network. Perfect matchings are illustrated in a problem encountered on the reconstruction of 3-D surfaces for Microsoft Research. Once these modules were created, they were beta tested by 246 students at five colleges and universities. The modules were also disseminated through 14 publications in refereed journal and 12 conference presentations. To complement the modules, RIT and Sioux Falls hosted a Careers in Mathematics Speaker Series. These talks brought nine professionals from various industries to speak to undergraduates about how they used mathematics to solve problems encountered in their workplace. Students are not the only ones who seek connections between their classwork and future careers. Innovations in the instruction of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are necessary and valuable to professors as well. The modules created in the STEM Real World Applications of Mathematics serve both the students and their professors in answering the question, "What else can I do with a mathematics degree than teach?"
