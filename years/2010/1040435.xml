<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to acquire a mask aligner for photolithography (from mm to 0.6 micrometer scale) and a nanometer pattern generation system to be attached to the existing SEM for sub-100 nm e-beam lithography (EBL).  Microfabrication, originally developed for silicon-devices and integrated circuits, has become an essential technology to explore properties of new materials, such as graphene and metamaterials, and create devices with novel functionalities, such as sensors and nano/microelectrical-mechanical-systems (N/MEMS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Combined with the existing equipment at Utah State University?s Nanoscale Device Laboratory (NDL), these two additions will enable, for the first time at USU, the characterization of new materials and the creation of novel devices for a number of cross-disciplinary research projects. Once the equipment is set up and capabilities are highlighted from these currently underway projects, it is expected that more researchers will use NDL to explore the unlimited world of micro/nanoscale devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Acquiring the requested system will be a significant research infrastructure improvement for USU and will undoubtedly help USU to recruit faculty and students interested in nanoscale science and engineering.  Students, including underrepresented groups, working at NDL will receive invaluable training in the basics of microfabrication allowing them to carry out research more efficiently at national nanofabrication facilities.  NDL has been involved in open-house and class-demonstrations, and further activities involving microfabrication are planned.  More industrial partnerships will be actively pursued at NDL not only to commercialize successful prototypes but to stimulate research focusing on the needs of society.</AbstractNarration>

Microfabrication, originally developed for fabricating semiconductor devices and integrated circuits, has become an essential technology to explore properties of new materials and create devices with novel functionalities, such as sensors and nano/micro-electro-mechanical systems. In its 57 yearsÆ history Utah State University, the land-grant institution in the state of Utah, never had a microfabrication facility which can allow faculty and students to participate in these exciting research areas on campus. Since 2008 the PI and his colleagues have accumulated a slew of sample preparation and characterization equipment, including a scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope, thermal evaporator, profilometer, and a thin-film thickness measurement system at the Nanoscale Device Laboratory (NDL), but there was no capability for lithography- the first step of any fabrication. The arrival of these two instruments enables many research projects and a microfabrication course for student training.       Dr. T.-C. Shen (PI, Physics) has used the mask aligner to pattern carbon nanotube forests. (Fig. 1) Because carbon nanotube forests are the blackest man-made materials, fabricating a very sensitive carbon nanotube bolometers which measures infrared radiation with fast response is currently in progress.  Another work in progress is to fabricate very compact carbon nanotube electron emitters.  We plan to use capillary force to shape a pillar of carbon tube forests into a sharp tip which will be a compact, low-power electron source for x-ray generator, display or gas spectrometer.  These projects are supported by Space Dynamics Laboratory. The mask aligner also provides Dr. Reyhan Baktur and her student (Electrical and Computer Engineering) a fast turn-around study of 5 and 10 GHz conformal antenna fabricated on the 0.15-mm thick cover glass of the solar cells which will be on board of cube satellites. The antenna is shown in Fig. 2.  Although there is room for improvement, the antenna shows its functionality both with (blue) and without (red) solar cell underneath as shown in Fig. 3.  Integrating antennas directly on solar cells have tremendous impact on space exploration.  This project has been funded by National Science Foundation. To have a rapid and ultrasensitive diagnosis for heart attacks, Dr. Yue Cui and coworkers (Bioengineering) are investigating devices made of microfluidic channels integrated with bio-inspired nanosensor arrays.  By measuring electronic signals from the device, the concentration of specific biomarkers can be determined.  The ultimate goal of this device is to diagnose and exclude acute myocardial infarction.  The mask aligner has been used to define the microfluidic channels. (Fig. 4)  This project is funded by the American Heart Association. The PI and co-PIs of this team has offered a 3-credit experimental course, Introduction to Microfabrication, in each spring semester for the past 3 years.  The total number of registered students is 34, including 19 undergraduate and 15 graduate students. (Fig. 5)  The backgrounds of the students reflect the multi-disciplinary nature of microfabrication- Physics (8), Chemistry (3), Electrical Engineering (17), Mechanical Engineering (3), Bioengineering (2) and Civil Engineering (1).  In addition to graduate students who need to use microfabrication for their research, majority of these students are seniors and they believe that taking this course will enhance their careers in the science/technology areas. Of course, microfabrication requires a lot more instruments than just these two, but the momentum gathered by these two instruments wi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
