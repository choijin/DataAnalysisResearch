<AbstractNarration>There is no shortage of examples of the link between power and corruption, but how does power corrupt? Ironically, existing research has demonstrated many of the benefits of power: power enhances cognitive function, facilitates an adaptive approach motivation, and the powerful enjoy disease resistance. How then can power lead to corruption and such incredibly adaptive outcomes?  This CAREER research project examines the link between power and corruption by systematically testing the extent to which power provides a physiological immunity to stressors. According to this perspective, the basic physiological architecture of human beings actually facilitates corruption unless individuals are aware and motivated to circumvent it. The current proposal outlines a research program in the neuroscience of how power corrupts. The proposed research focuses on the "power-as-immunity" theory which explains how power -through a stress buffering mechanism- lowers the emotional, cognitive, and physiological costs of all kinds of stressful things, good and corrupt.  The theory transforms and extends current theories about power by describing the basic mechanisms through which power shapes emotion, cognition, and behavior. The 12 proposed experiments will help science to further understand the basic effect of power on stress as well as when the stress-buffering mechanism leads to corruption and the exact mechanisms which underlie the stress-buffering effect of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will partner with a leadership and ethics center at HAAS Business School to develop new ethics curricula to be immediately integrated into the core MBA curriculum. The aim is to develop an entire ethics module for undergraduate and graduate level business students using interactive, role-play based business cases which will be widely available to anyone at any school interested in enhancing ethics training. The project also involves rigorous training of undergraduate and graduate students who will gain expertise in social neuroscience methods.  Ultimately, this work which is focused on power's effect on corruption will offer practical insight and training for tomorrow's business leaders.</AbstractNarration>
