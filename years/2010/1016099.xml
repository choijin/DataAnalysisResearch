<AbstractNarration>Real-time information is a fundamental emerging issue in the creation&lt;br/&gt;and management of Web content. Increasingly, rather than consulting&lt;br/&gt;relatively static sources that are indexed on a periodic basis,&lt;br/&gt;people refer to information on news sites, blogs, social-networking&lt;br/&gt;sites, and Twitter feeds that change dynamically and spread rapidly.&lt;br/&gt;This project will study how information content varies over time, how&lt;br/&gt;it is transmitted through underlying social networks, and how its&lt;br/&gt;recipients assemble it into larger units. The project will explore&lt;br/&gt;new techniques for addressing these issues, based on novel methods&lt;br/&gt;for tracking, analyzing, and presenting information that evolves and&lt;br/&gt;spreads rapidly over time. The resulting approach aims to transform&lt;br/&gt;important aspects of the ways in which real-time information on the&lt;br/&gt;Web is handled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First the fundamental units of information that spread through the&lt;br/&gt;underlying information networks will be identified. From a set of&lt;br/&gt;nearly 1 billion news media articles and blog posts (approx. 6TB of&lt;br/&gt;data), and a collection of 500 million tweets from Twitter, small&lt;br/&gt;(generally textual) units of information will be identified that&lt;br/&gt;remain relatively stable as they spread through the Web.  The&lt;br/&gt;temporal variation within these basic units will be analyzed and&lt;br/&gt;modeled.  This modeling will include connections with biological&lt;br/&gt;models of epidemics, as well as new frameworks that exploit the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental differences between biological and social contagion.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the temporal variation will be related to network-level&lt;br/&gt;models for the diffusion of this information. Generally, the actual&lt;br/&gt;networks on which real-time information spreads cannot be directly&lt;br/&gt;observed, nor can the influence of any particular node in the network&lt;br/&gt;be directly measured.  Therefore, the project will develop machine-&lt;br/&gt;learning techniques that infer these hidden networks and unobserved&lt;br/&gt;levels of influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information see the project web site at:&lt;br/&gt;http://snap.stanford.edu/proj/mipro</AbstractNarration>
