<AbstractNarration>In this project the principal investigator will study interactions between subfactors and conformal field theories, a topic that has proved to be very fruitful lately. The main emphasis of this research is placed on two aspects of the subject: (1) the study of supersymmetric and exotic conformal field theories using operator algebraic techniques, and (2) the study of a vast generalization of a conjecture from finite group theory to the general setting of subfactors. The applications of these operator algebraic techniques are expected to produce answers to a number of  representation theory questions and to shed light on certain exotic subfactors, such as those arising from conformal inclusions. The general framework of subfactors will also provide new insight into some old group theory conjectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of operator algebras was introduced by John von Neumann in order to provide a proper mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. Noncommutativity (i.e., the fact that a product AB may differ from BA), which is a key feature of quantum mechanics, is an important aspect of operator algebras. Vaughan Jones's subfactor theory is built on this noncommutative  framework and has provided linkages of operator algebras with some major parts of mathematics. Conformal field theory is a theory describing critical phenomena in condensed matter physics, and it also plays an important role in string theory. The remarkable interactions between subfactors  and conformal field theory have led to many interesting mathematical developments. The aim of this research is to find solutions to some of the important mathematical issues that surface in this context and that have a wide range of applications.</AbstractNarration>

The research objective of this project is to develop further  the connection between thesesubjects, and find applications in the other area of mathematics.The project  rely on  operator algebraic and subfactortechniques developed in studying CFT, and  insights about old and new  problems provided by  the general framework of subfactors. Solutions of the posed problems  have important applications in these diverse area of mathematics. Results have been disseminated as research publications and presentations at professionalmeetings.  The computational aspects of some of the proposed questions  to graduate students, and has attracted more  students to enter this exciting research field including one female Ph. D. student and one female Post Doctor.   The proposed research intersects well with the research of severalgroups in PI's  department including mathematical physics,representation theory and low dimensional topology.  In the period PI has 8 papers (5 of them are join papers) either in print or has been accepted to appear. The main outcomes are the following:  (1)  New subfactors with interesting intermediate lattice structurs from CFT;  To do this we have developed new echniques of analyzing structures of subfactors from CFT.  (2) A reduction of tensor product problem to depth two cases;   This result was very surprising in that the formulation of tensor product problem is for general subfactors, and our theorem says it is enough to prove it for depth 2 subfactors.  The main technique is inspired by our earlier work on coset conformal field theory on the remarkable properties of fusion rules in the vacuum sector.  (3) Build a mathematical fundation of N=2 super conformal nets;  Our main motivation was to develop a mathematical understanding of chiral rings from non-commutative geometry point of view. Though this goal is still unfinished, we have answered for the first time some basic questions about minimal N=2 super conformal nets and filled in a major gap in the literature on such issues  (4) Produce new vertex algebras inspired by Mirror extensions.  This is a completely  new way of producing vertex algebras and hence new rational vertex operator algebras.             Last Modified: 08/21/2014       Submitted by: Feng Xu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
