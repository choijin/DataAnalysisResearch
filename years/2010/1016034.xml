<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This is an effort to address the growing and increasingly diverse data management needs of the NSF arctic research community. Core activities of an Integrated Arctic Data Management Services (IADS) will include identifying and cataloging all data produced by NSF arctic investigators and providing assistance and tools to meet requirements to publish data and associated metadata. IADS will ensure that data are well documented to guarantee preservation and to promote interdisciplinary reuse, and it will enable data discovery through diverse portals, including a new IADS portal for publishing investigator metadata and data, special project support, and access by the broad community. IADS will foster scientific synthesis through its support services and help-desk functions, and by enabling integration of datasets stemming from NSF projects with data generated through activities of other U.S. agencies and other countries. The IADS will tackle the complexity of data types emerging from the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH), the Arctic Observing Network (AON) and other efforts to serve diverse stakeholder needs. Along with advanced search and discovery capabilities, the IADS will include services such as reformatting (re-projection of gridded data, point to grid conversions, options to download data in a variety of formats), subsetting and visualization. Visualization services will include demos and instructions on how to use Integrated Data Viewer, Google Earth and other tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The core operation of this activity represents broader impacts. IADS will make its data holdings discoverable and usable, promote scientific synthesis and foster interagency collaboration crucial to meeting SEARCH objectives. Through activities and coordination with SEARCH/AON leadership via workshops and other venues, data management will be elevated to an integral part of scientific research. Support of groups before they go to the field will include metadata education, instruction on how to organize a data set before publishing, and provision of software tools to take to the field. The rewards of these various activities will be better data stewardship, services and data integration capabilities to benefit the arctic research community in coming years and decades.</AbstractNarration>

ACADIS development and support has allowed NSF/PLR/ARC to meet the increasing priority of data management in discovery science and to set a high standard for the stewardship of the crucial data needed to answer questions about the changes now underway in the Arctic. ACADIS developed out of a necessity expressed in the Arctic Observing Network (AON) design to develop and implement a comprehensive data management strategy. This was an important component of NSF?s contribution to the International Polar Year (IPY) of 2007-2008.

The ACADIS data legacy includes more than 3600 datasets archived together with ISO standard 19115 metadata and documentation. Figure 1 summarizes the growth of datasets archived in ACADIS from 2008  to 2016.  One of the more important and flexible components of the ACADIS system was the ability to accept data in a variety of formats (more than 60) representing more than 50 scientific disciplines.  The ACADIS Gateway enabled scientists, students, and the public to explore, discover, access and download data collected by more than 400 contributing investigators representing more than 210 NSF grant awards.  Figure 2 provides a summary of metrics associated with ACADIS.  This was an archive with international interest, steadily increasing monthly use and remarkable disciplinary diversity.  Another ACADIS component was the Arctic Data Explorer, available online as a broad discovery tool for finding and accessing interdisciplinary Arctic data from diverse investigators, projects, agencies, and nations in repositories scattered around the world. More than 640 publication references have been logged by ACADIS, including 519 research publications, 9 books, 95 conference proceedings, 3 Special Journal issues, and 8 graduate school theses and dissertations.
