<AbstractNarration>The Conference for African-American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences (CAARMS) is an annual conference that allows minority researchers and students in the mathematical sciences from across the country to interact with each other as research mathematicians. Lectures are given by 12 invited speakers who are primarily African-American but not exclusively. The format of the conference allows all of them to give single hour, non-parallel lectures over at three day period. This is to ensure that all the participants of the conference are exposed both to the breath of African-American researchers in the mathematical sciences as well as the breath of the mathematical sciences themselves. Students are encouraged to attend and contribute to the intellectual activity of the conference by making poster presentations on the first day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young researchers attending the conference serve as judges for the posters. Awards are given to the students on the second day. On the third day, the winning students give short lectures about their work. Finally, there are refereed proceedings for some of the conferences. Five have been published to date. Future plans are to have a pre-conference workshop for undergraduate students who are beginning to learn about doing research in the mathematical sciences and one for young faculty on research collaborations and proposal writing. A permanent CAARMS website (www.caarms.net) is being developed that will encourage research collaborative activity throughout the year. The schedule for the next three CAARMS conferences is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAARMS17 (2011)--Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), June 1-4, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;Chairs: Prof. William A. Massey (Princeton University) and Prof. Russel Caflisch (IPAM,&lt;br/&gt;UCLA)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAARMS18 (2012)--Stanford University, June 2012.&lt;br/&gt;Chairs: Prof. William A. Massey (Princeton University) and Prof. Peter Glynn (Stanford&lt;br/&gt;University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAARMS20 (2013)--Princeton University, June 2013.&lt;br/&gt;Chair: Prof. William A. Massey (Princeton University)</AbstractNarration>

The mathematical sciences are defined in the broadest sense to include (in alphabetical order) computer science, machine learning, mathematical applications, mathematical theory, operations research, statistics, and other related technical fields where mathematics plays a major role. The conference also exists to complement and cooperate with other established groups that promote African-Americans in the mathematical sciences.</p> <p><strong>Program:</strong> The conference begins with a student workshop, named the <em>J.

Ernest Wilkins (1923 &ndash; 2011), still the youngest (at the age of 19) PhD mathematics graduate from the University of Chicago. CAARMS conferences have <em>no</em> parallel sessions and provide a platform to showcase the work of up to 10 African-American researchers per conference. They are all given 52 minutes (a micro-century) to talk about their research followed by questions. Additional lectures may also be given such as expository talks, working lunch discussions, or multiple lecture tutorials. All these talks are integrated with approximately 20 to 25 brief (2 minute) oral research presentations given by Black students from schools around the country. Their talks are an overview of poster presentations that they give at the end of the day. After researchers attending the conference judge their work, the award winners give longer (20 minute) oral presentations of their research by the end of the conference. This final event is named the <em>David Blackwell Workshop for Future Research</em>, in memory of the late Dr. David Blackwell (1919-2010). Dr. Blackwell, an outstanding research contributor to 20<sup>th</sup> century mathematical statistics.
