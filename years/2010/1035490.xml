<AbstractNarration>The Hawai'i Noyce Teacher Scholarship (HINTS) project unifies the educational efforts and resources of the University of Hawai'i at Hilo (UHH), two community colleges (Hawai'i Community College and University of Hawai'i Maui College), and several Hawai'i Department of Education (DOE) complexes on the islands of Hawai'i, Molokai, Maui, and Lanai. HINTS is providing three-year scholarships and educational technology to 10 future mathematics secondary teachers while establishing a robust support structure of ongoing professional development and collaboration in mathematics education. Unique to this project is its focus on designing and implementing pedagogical models that meet the specific needs relating to Hawai'i's vast cultural and economic diversity.  The project provides summer internships at a Math Camp, summer workshops, mentoring and the provision of math coaches for the new teachers.  The  collaboration among UHH, the community colleges, and Hawai'i DOE allows the HINTS faculty and scholars to fine tune the delivery of secondary mathematics instruction meeting the challenges of individual partnering complexes and schools. HINTS is expanding  on these present partnerships and establish a permanent pipeline that draws talented mathematics majors from community colleges and lower-level UHH mathematics courses and assists them through teacher certification and licensure and into their first several years of teaching in high needs DOE secondary schools. This network of programs, resources, and collective recruitment efforts is strengthening  ties between UHH, the community colleges, and several high need DOE complex areas on several islands. HINTS scholars are uniquely positioned to develop innovative pedagogical approaches in mathematics focused on teaching ethnically diverse classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Hawai?i has been facing a drastic teacher shortage, with the most drastic shortages in the fields of STEM and SPED which has resulted in Hawai?i recruiting teachers from the mainland.  Additionally, the majority of the schools in Hawai?i are classified as high need schools as defined by socioeconomic status, teacher turnover rates, teachers teaching outside of their content areas and student performance. These schools share many of the same challenges as rural schools, including, but not limited to the need to have additional social responsibilities in the community and student transience.  The goals of this project were to: Attract a diverse, high quality pool of applicants; Prepare highly qualified mathematics teachers; Support HINTS program graduates in their first years of teaching, thereby improving their chances of retention beyond the required service commitment. The Hawai?i Noyce Teacher Scholarship (HINTS) program is an innovative collaborative project involving University of Hawai?i at Hilo and the Hawai?i Department of Education in an effort to increase the number of highly qualified intermediate and high school mathematics teachers in Hawai?i. The Hawai?i Noyce Teacher Scholarship program provides substantial support to scholars pursuing licensure in mathematics in the State of Hawai?i. The HINTS program will provide a range of financial, academic and professional support to help your career goals come true. HiNTS support includes:  Full Tuition Scholarships Technology Support including laptops, iPads &amp; calculators Mentoring in creating an engaging and culturally relevant lessons  Travel to National Conferences  Professional development in both mathematics content and pedagogy.   In an effort to prepare our scholars, the Hawai?i Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program hosts an annual Math Day to promote interest in mathematics and to provide our scholars with practice writing and delivery engaging math lessons.  Previous Math Days have included a CSI: A Math Day Murder Mystery, The Amazing Race: A Virtual Place-Based Learning and Games of Chance: A Math Day Carnival. Based upon data collected, most participants felt the day was fun and worthwhile in addition to being educational.  This grant has increased interest in teaching in the area of mathematics. During interviews with the scholars it was discovered that most thought of going to graduate school and teaching at the college level. Upon learning about the grant they chose to apply, and after understanding all the requirements of this scholarship they are thankful for the opportunity it provides. In response to the publicity of this grant, the teacher education program is receiving more potential math teacher applications than in previous years.    As the sole institution in the state of Hawai?i with a Noyce scholarship program, HiNTS created a pipeline in Hawai?i that will guide future mathematics teachers through licensure, initial placement and tenure phases of their careers.  This network of programs, resources, and collective recruitment efforts strengthened ties between UHH, the community colleges, and the Hawai?i DOE.  This synergetic effort produced locally grown well-trained educators that are personally aware of the cultural and ethnic diversity of the Hawaiian Islands.  This broader understanding of the interplay between culture and science in Hawai?i allows HINTS scholars to successfully promote participation and critical thinking for all students, including underrepresented groups and students in rural areas.   Ultimately, since mathematics is the cornerstone of scientific advancement, the heightened quality of mathematics education will allow the state of Hawai?i to develop further as a scientific center and will produce a well-trained, local workforce for Hawai?i?s ever growing astronomical, geological, and oceanographic research ventures.  Furthermore, HINTS scholars will be uniquely positioned to develop innovative pedagogical approaches in mathematics focused on teaching ethnically diverse classrooms.  Although many of these newly created pedagogical models specifically target students of Hawaiian and mixed ancestry, they are being shared by the HINTS scholars nationally at conferences and through publications, therefore serving as potential templates for other school districts with similar ethnic heterogeneity and dual urban-rural demographics.
