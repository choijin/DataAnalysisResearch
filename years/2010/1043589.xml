<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to investigate the impact of earth surface processes on the application of cosmogenic exposure dating in Antarctica by combining multi-nuclide techniques, detailed field experiments, rock-mechanic studies, and climate modeling. They will analyze cosmogenic-nuclide inventories for a suite of six alpine-moraine systems in inland regions of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. This area is ideally suited for this study because 1) the targeted alpine moraine sequences are critically important in helping to reconstruct past temperature and precipitation values over the last several million years, 2) the production rates for cosmogenic nuclides are typically high and well-known, and 3) the complexity of surface processes is relatively low. Their work has two specific goals: to evaluate the effects of episodic geomorphic events in modulating cosmogenic inventories in surface rocks in polar deserts and to generate an alpine glacier chronology that will serve as a robust record of regional climate variation over the last several million years. A key objective is to produce a unique sampling strategy that yields consistent exposure-age results by minimizing the effects of episodic geomorphic events that obfuscate cosmogenic-nuclide chronologies. They will link their moraine chronology with regional-scale atmospheric models developed by collaborators at University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This research is interdisciplinary and includes two early career scientists. Results of this work will be used to enhance undergraduate education by engaging two female students in Antarctic field and summer research projects. Extended outreach includes development of virtual Antarctic field trips for Colgate University?s Ho Tung Visualization Laboratory and Boston University?s Antarctic Digital Image Analyses Laboratory. The PIs will continue to work with the Los Angeles Valley Community College, which serves students of mostly Hispanic origin as part of the PolarTREC program. This project will contribute to the collaboration between LDEO and several New York City public high schools within the Lamont-Doherty Secondary School Field Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Past fluctuations of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) and nearby glaciers can shed light on the stability of the single-biggest ice-sheet on Earth, and its potential to contribute to ongoing and future sea-level rise. However, terrestrial observations of such past fluctuations have been difficult, as dating of the geologic markers of such fluctuations remains challenging. The relatively new dating technique referred to as 'Cosmogenic Nuclide Surface Exposure Dating (SED)' has proven very useful in many areas, but many SED studies in Antarctica show a wide scatter of ages, limiting the precision of this approach.  We attempted to improve this situation by combining two cosmogenic nuclides, the radionuclide Cl-36 and the stable noble gas He-3, to date glacier deposits in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, directly adjacent to the EAIS.  Based on this new approach, we could, for the first time, robustly date a glacier advance in the Dry Valleys during MIS-11, a period between 395-415 ka ago known as a particularly long interglacial period of global climate. If the age of this glacier deposit is confirmed on a regional scale in Antarctica, it would support the view that AntarcticaÆs glaciers were expanding during global interglacial periods, and that they were in similar configuration but slightly larger than today during MIS-11.  As for the progress in the SED technique, this project has established the technique to measure Cl-36 and He-3 in parallel from pyroxene, a widely abundant mineral in Antarctic Ferrar Dolerites and we hope that this progress will trigger many more similar studies to better understand Antarctica's glacier geomorphology.
