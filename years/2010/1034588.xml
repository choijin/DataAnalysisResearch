<AbstractNarration>Martinsville and HenryCounty National Society of Black Engineers aims to break the cycle of poverty for African American youth in Martinsville by introducing them to the field of engineering through its program: Achiever's Plus.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This proposal is providing an opportunity to 50 African American students (grade 7 to 12) at Martinsville and Henry County chapter of NSBE to participate in Regional and National conventions. The regional convention will take place in Pennsylvania in the first week of November 2010, while the NSBE National Convention is to be held in Saint Louis,  Missouri in March of 2011. The students in this chapter have attended the last year regional conference in North Carolina and competed in Math, Robotics, Science and Leadership competitions. The chapter won 16 awards including the chapter with the highest grade point average. In addition, the students took first, second and third place in science division; and will compete again this year in Saint Louis MO. This activity will enhance the following:&lt;br/&gt;Bolster the students' self-esteem and give them a sense of accomplishment; encourage and assist them in improving school attendance, and school performance; and, importantly, expose African American youth in the area to college-level and career opportunities in math, science, and technology-related fields, with a special emphasis on engineering fields. This proposal is exempt from external review in accordance with the PAM, Chapter V.B.2.n.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Outcomes Report for the General Public     Project Title: Achiever's Plus Program- Fall 2010; Pennsylvania; and Spring 2011 in Saint Louis, MO.          The Martinsville and Henry County Chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers would like to thank the National Science Foundation and Dr. Omnia El-Hakim so much for the grant and all your help in acquiring the grant.  The grant has helped to open so many doors for our students and they have received so many accolades for their hard work. The students and the parents were so excited about the grant that they began preparing themselves for the conference competitions in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, immediately following the grant announcement in August of 2010.  Students were in my classroom five days a week after school and late hours into the evening for practice and working on projects for the competitions. There were many times that the students were working on weekends to prepare themselves for the competitions.  The hard work paid off because the chapter brought home more awards than any chapter represented at the conference.  The students came back with even more energy and high self esteem, looking forward to the national competitions in St. Louis, Missouri.   For many of our students, this was their first flight and also the furthest away they had been from home.  In addition to the regional awards, they came back home with national awards.     Having the funds in place for the students to travel to the conferences was a tremendous help for the students and me.  This gave them more time to concentrate on preparing for the competitions and not have to spend a lot of time after school and on weekends fundraising to get the finances for the travel. Additionally, we were able to spend more time helping the students to prepare for the competitions.  As a result of theses successes, two of our students were invited to Washington, DC to interview with President ObamaÆs administor of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Lisa Perez Jackson. The same students were selected to travel to California to represent the Communities Helping Improve Local Lives (CHILL) organization.  Another one of our members was selected to represent the state of Virginia at the National Boys and Girls Convention in Atlanta Georgia. The list goes on.            Page 2     While at the convention, the students kept journals of their activities.  These are some of the quotes: Reshona Blount wrote, "It has helped me learn about all the possibilities in engineering and it has taught me now to connect well with others."  Devante Martin wrote, "Attending the conventions has helped me connect with different people all over the world.  It motivated me to be more interested in engineering and helped me become a better team member in engineering workshops."  Tanisha Ross wrote, "These experiences have taught me about being a better leader and being able to communicate with people outside of my community. There are so many engineering fields that I did not know existed.  Also, I have built a pool of networking people that I can talk with about the engineering fields and possibly help me to get an internship in one of the fields."     Having these experiences has changed the lives of these students.  They now know what they thought was impossible is now possible. In addition to self esteem being boosted, grade point averages have gone up.  They are self motivated and taking charge of their education.     Martinsville, Virginia has the highest unemployment rate in the state and this has been the statistic for more than one year.  There is a high illiteracy rate and teenage pregnancy continues to rise.  Yet, with the interventions of this organization, we still have great successes. No one would ever believe what an impact this grant has made for these students which also impact the community.  For our students, all you have to do is believe in them, provide the opportunity and exposure; then,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
