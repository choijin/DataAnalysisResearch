<AbstractNarration>1068070 Boston University; Thomas Bifano &lt;br/&gt;1068109 University of California-Davis; Dennis L. Matthews &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center for Biophotonic Sensors and Systems (CBSS) will advance photonics technology as the enabler for major advances in disease diagnostics and drug discovery. The research efforts will be anchored by Boston University's Photonic Center as the lead institution, partnered with the University of California-Davis Center for Biophotonic Science and Technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center, comprised of Boston University (BU) and the University of California-Davis (UCD), plans to establish a natural resource for Biophotonic Sensors and Systems (CBSS) where photonics provide the enabling technologies for advances in methods to detect/sense and identify biological properties, conditions, or changes at the molecular and cellular/sub-cellular level. The potential target applications of disease diagnosis, drug efficacy testing, patient monitoring, and food and water safety represent a balanced mixture of highly-relevant topics well suited to the I/UCRC model. Both BU and UCD have mature photonics research Centers and a track record of achievement in managing translational research activities. The proposed CBBS will build on the respective University's research talent and technology transfer skills to attract industrial partners who will subsequently play a significant role in planning, selecting, and implementing the output of the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus on global health initiatives and numerous planned educational programs provides a platform for significant broader impact of this center. Technology transfer plans are appropriate and both universities have a good history of translational research. The industry participation will enhance the students educational experience by providing a pipeline for talented engineers and scientist to industry. BU and UCD are committed to developing the academic potential of under-represented groups in STEM fields. The success of the proposed Center will enable new photonics sensor technologies that can improve public healthcare, food and water safety, and homeland security.</AbstractNarration>

The goal was to establish a national consortium where photonics provides enabling technologies for advances in methods to detect, sense, identify and understand biological properties, conditions, or changes at the molecular, cellular, and subcellular level. This early-stage research has applications and is expected to lead to significant commercial benefits in areas such as: disease diagnosis; drug discovery, screening, and efficacy testing; patient monitoring; food and water safety.  During Phase I (2011-2017, including a 1-year no-cost-extension), we built the membership, defined center processes for soliciting and reviewing proposals, and developed a technology roadmap, while constantly facilitating information sharing between industry and academia about unmet needs that pose societal challenges and the potential for new biosensing advances to provide technology solutions. The current research thrusts in CBSS are: Bioimaging, Optical Diagnostics, and Analytics, as detailed in the center?s technology roadmap.  For the past 6 years, CBSS engaged more than 50 scientists, engineers, and business professionals at Boston University and UC Davis. Faculty from diverse colleges, schools, and graduate groups (medicine, engineering, physics, chemistry, biophysics, food and agricultural sciences) participated at the UC Davis site and contributed research expertise in spectroscopy, microscopy, imaging, single-molecule analysis, non-linear techniques, and more, as well as applications.  The Center had a total of 17 members, with the current industry membership for CBSS currently at eight members. Collectively, the CBSS industry membership links the Center?s research to applications of high demand in the marketplace. For example, the need to decrease healthcare costs is a strong driver for developing non-invasive biosensing technologies, and methods that detect diseases in their earliest stages, when they are easiest and less costly to treat, and chances for successful treatments are the highest.  Notable Center accomplishments include:  27 distinct research projects were supported by affiliated companies 2 new patents were made available to affiliated companies 5 project technologies are being commercialized by affiliated companies 1 spin-out company was launched (at Boston University; also a graduate of the NSF I-Corps program) 42 publications were associated with CBSS funded research projects   At the UC Davis Site:  13 graduate students, 20 postdoc fellows, and 6 undergraduate students received training, and 2 CBSS-affiliated students graduated with PhDs 4 undergraduate students received training and REU stipends   Here are some highlights of impacts to the field that are directly attributable to CBSS efforts at the UC Davis Site:  Researchers designed and built a novel multifocal Raman instrument, that exhibits 100 times faster hyperspectral Raman imaging compared to a conventional Raman microscope, using a modulated multifocal detection scheme. Developed a new assay based on SERS (Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy) as detection method and aptamers, which is specific, robust, cost effective, and fast. This assay was used to detect thrombin and other proteins of interest at 0.5 micrograms/mL limit of detection. Scientists also developed a new method to fabricate reproducible, flexible, tunable plasmonic nanostructures for SERS sensing, with enhancement factors as high as 1.4 x 10^6 . Over a 3-year project, scientists developed adaptive optics (AO) optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging techniques (AO-OCT) and AO-SLO (Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy), enabling non-invasive monitoring of marked individual cells in the eyes of live mice over their lifespan. Together with a UC Davis RISE grant, such advances were applied to receive NIH grants, and established the rodent eye as a valuable non-invasive window for studying cancer nanotherapeutics in longitudinal studies in live animals.   CBSS contributes to the nation?s research infrastructure base by supporting research at our university sites. The I/UCRC framework enables us to learn from industry what are the areas of greatest needs in terms of new technologies and research tools, and to pursue research that can be applied to solve real-world challenges, for significant societal impact.
