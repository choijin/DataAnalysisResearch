<AbstractNarration>Computing (35)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing accessible, scalable simulation of robotic systems for use across the collegiate computer science curriculum.  It is also assessing the utility of simulation in managing the time students spend on robot construction and software debugging at different course levels in the curriculum. The project is adapting JPL/NASA's ROAMS system to create the Robotic Analysis and Modeling Simulator (RAMS) for teaching material with a robotics component across the computing curriculum. RAMS is testing the pedagogical benefits of interfaces that can be scaled by the instructor to offer students simulation details appropriate to the laboratory project at hand.  RAMS is using a platform-neutral approach to model robots to help educators more easily identify and exploit pedagogical commonalities among the many educational platforms in use today. The project's intellectual merit derives from researching how to make mechanical and environmental background knowledge in robotics projects appropriately accessible to computer science majors and from investigating the role of simulations in improving computer science students' educational experience with robotics. The project's simulator has broader impact in making computer science education's "robotics revolution" more accessible at colleges with little hardware engineering support to help students develop skills at designing software for robots.  The RAMS system is being evaluated as a basis for Internet resources to allow schools with limited resources to participate more cost-effectively in national or regional robotics competitions through realistic networked simulations.  This project is making NASA software from popular programs (e.g. Mars Rovers) more accessible to the US undergraduate community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Robotics is a burgeoning field with employment opportunities for a variety of college studies areas, including computer science majors. There has been much work in understanding how to provide computer science majors direct programming experiences on physical robots such as Lego Mindstorms. However, due to engineering issues such as robots falling over, or slipping on smooth surfaces, computer science students occasionally report becoming too distracted from learning well the computer science topics on which robotic projects may be focused.   This project was designed to explore the primary question of the role simulation might play, in conjunction with physical robots in computer science education. The focus was predominantly considering cases where students might be distracted from programming issues by "messy" robot interactions with the real world. The secondary question underlying the research focused on how to educate computer science majors about the industrial practice of using simulation to design and test robot systems before construction. The final research question was designed to explore the effect of abstract learning on novice learners.  For the project's purposes, an advanced simulation testbed was developed using NASA/JPL's ROAMS framework so as to mazimize the realism of virtual robots and their classroom environments for students.  During the research program's final three years, participants from introductory, intermediate, and advanced computer science programming courses were divided into two sets: one set of course sections used pre-constructed physical Mindstorms NXT robots, while the other used pre-constructed physical Mindstorms NXT robots along with simulations of the robots.  In the second set, students were expected to debug their software on the virtual robots, running their simulations at faster-than-real-time rates, before running final tests on the physical robots.  The project's hypothesis was that student surveys would indicate that the simulations would have neutral-to-slightly negative impact on reported student learning for introductory courses' projects, but that simulations would have a positive impact on reported student learning for more advanced courses' projects.  The reasoning was that novice students might be too eager to work with the physical robots and feel that the simulations of rather simple assgnments (e.g. make a robot trace a simple geometric path) were a distraction, while advanced students would see the benefit of trying out their code in sped-up simulations first, then running the debugged code in their physical robots later.  The quantitative survey results, however, showed a high degree of neutrality broadly across all student levels (novice, intermediate, advanced) toward the role of simulation in reported learning.  When broken down by gender across the student levels, it was found that female respondents had a strongly neutral response to the role of simulation in their learning, whereas male respondents had neutral-to-strongly-positive responses.  The results of this Male-Female difference are of interest and warrant additional research.              Last Modified: 06/12/2017       Submitted by: Frank I Klassner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
