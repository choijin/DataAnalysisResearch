<AbstractNarration>Support for graduate and post-graduate student attendence of the 2010 North American School of Information Theory is provided. The 2010 school builds on the success of the First and Second Annual Schools of Information Theory held in 2008 at Penn State University and 2009 at Northwestern University. At the 2008 event, 101 students and 13 senior attendees participated; at the 2009 event, we had 141 students and 21 senior attendees participated. For the year 2010 school, 233 applications from 62 institutions were received, which represents a 40% growth in student participants over 2009 and a doubling over 2008.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main motivation for the school is to provide a venue where doctoral and post-doctoral students can meet to discuss research, form friendships and collaborations, and learn how to actively and socially participate in scientific research. The students present themselves and their results in a friendly environment, interact with well-known senior scientists, and exchange ideas.</AbstractNarration>
