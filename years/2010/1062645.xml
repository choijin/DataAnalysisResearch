<AbstractNarration>This award to East Tennessee State University (ETSU) will provide research training to six undergraduate students for 10 weeks, during the summers of 2012-2014.  Students can select from a variety of projects focused on the development of vertebrate animals.  Students will work individually as well as in groups with faculty members from four basic science disciplines, including the College of Arts and Sciences (Biological Sciences) and the College of Medicine (Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology, Pharmacology, and Physiology).  All projects emphasize important techniques to collect and analyze data at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels of organization in order to understand developmental processes.  Students will have access to modern laboratories and equipment that support protein biochemistry; molecular biology; cell/tissue culture; histology; and diverse types of microscopy and digital imaging.  The program includes sessions focusing on scientific research skills; responsible conduct of research; communication skills; and postgraduate studies and application procedures.  An important feature of the program is the opportunity to interact with other undergraduate researchers on campus, including participation in an annual ETSU Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium.  Student experience is enhanced by field trips to local science museums, parks and industry. Recruitment of students will include the program website; direct contacts with colleges; and site visits to target institutions.  Student selection will be based on academic record, expressed interests in biological research and postgraduate studies, and recommendation by their faculty. Program success will be assessed by various means, including an assessment tool common across REU programs and the tailored use of a framework that defines and assesses progress in development of research skills. Students interested in an opportunity for an intensive summer research experience are encouraged to visit http://www.etsu.edu/honors/reu, and to contact the PI (Dr. Rebecca Pyles, pylesr@etsu.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure, our Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) focused on research in areas of Integrative Developmental Biology.  Six student participants were selected each summer 2012&mdash;2014 to work with six scientists investigating aspects of developmental biology of vertebrate animals.  Our program sought to offer opportunities to students from groups currently underrepresented in science and from smaller colleges/universities that did not offer significant research experiences for their undergraduate students.  From 2012--2014, a total of 348 applications were received from students at 294 unique institutions, including community colleges and historically black colleges and universities from all regions of the U.S., including Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  A total of 18 students were selected, including 12 females (6 males); three African-American and one Native American student. Of all participants funded, two were from larger schools; three were from our home institution; and the remaining 13 students were from smaller colleges around the U.S.   Our program was based on a highly interactive model, encouraging collaboration and interactions among participants and research mentors. Top priority for students, however, was dedicated to time in the laboratory working with a faculty mentor on their selected research project.   A weekly group meeting afforded the chance for much conversation and interaction among students and faculty, especially during student-led journal article reviews and more informal conversations about graduate school and academic life.   In this environment, students received formal training in Animal Use &amp; Care; Occupational Health &amp; Safety; Laboratory Safety; and Responsible Conduct of Research.  Faculty-led instruction was provided in reading scientific literature; oral and poster presentations; scientific writing (e.g., grants, articles); graduate application process; as well as developmental biology, scientific process and use of an integrative approach.  Students completed written reports (either journal or thesis format) and gave formal oral presentations at our annual campus Summer Life Sciences Research Symposium.  Upon leaving our program, four students have (or will, Oct.  2015) give formal presentations at professional scientific conferences about their summer research in our program.  Of our total 18 student participants, five have yet to graduate (rising juniors in 2014) and three of these have been selected for summer research programs for summer 2015.  Of graduated students, one is employed by a forensic chemistry laboratory; one is applying to osteopathic schools; one is attending medical school (Univ. of Virginia); and six have been accepted and/or are attending graduate school (U. Cincinnati; Ohio State U.; Columbia; Duke; Emory; and Northwestern).  Of these six students, five are in Ph.D. programs and one has begun his Masters program.  To date, 50% of our REU students have elected to continue their studies in the life sciences, either in professional or graduate school.  Each of these students was supported in their graduate or professional applications by the REU mentor from our program.  We are pleased that most of our students continue to stay in contact with us and allow us to assist them in attaining their goals.
