<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit.  Cell division is a fundamental feature of all life and involves the precise transmission of genetic information from mother to daughter cells.   Each cell division cycle is therefore executed as a tightly regulated, stepwise program.  Ubiquitin and SUMO, two small proteins that are attached to other cellular proteins to signal their destruction, control important aspects of the cell division program in eukaryotic cells.  Ubiquitin's essential role in the timely destruction of key cell cycle regulators is well documented, but the role of SUMO is less well understood.  Research in the laboratory of the investigator has led to an important discovery that defines a novel role for SUMO in protein ubiquitination.  Briefly, degradation of several nuclear proteins, including some that are involved in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation, are preceded by modification with SUMO. These sumoylated proteins are then recognized by SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs), which mediate their ubiquitination.  Cells that lack specific STUbLs accumulate high levels of SUMO conjugates, chromosomal rearrangements, and become hypersensitive to DNA damage.  This project now aims to elucidate the functional roles of SUMO-dependent protein degradation in the transmission and maintenance of genetic information.  Briefly, the cellular pathways, targets, and interactions of STUbL proteins will be identified.  Since STUbLs are conserved, this research will provide novel insights into our general understanding how genome integrity is maintained during the cell cycle, from yeast to humans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts.  The investigator will continue to foster the involvement of a diverse group of students in the scientific discovery process by providing hands-on research opportunities in the teaching and research laboratory.  For example, the investigator has developed and will involve students in the Genetic Model Systems Lab, a laboratory course that provides a real-life research experience to teach students of all levels and backgrounds about the powerful applications of genetic model systems in research.  Additionally, outreach activities are planned as an integral part of the investigator's research. The lab will continue to host high-school and undergraduate student researchers from underrepresented backgrounds and will invites research collaborations with faculty from local colleges, universities, and high schools.  Results of this research will be presented at scientific meetings and will be available through open-access research publications and a laboratory Web site.  In coordination with the William and Mary Development Office, the laboratory will also participate in a program to invite visitors to the lab, including government officials, journalists, and other groups, to promote public understanding of our research.</AbstractNarration>

Kerscher  (2016)  Cell division is a fundamental feature of all life and requires the precise transmission of genetic information from mother to daughter cells.

This grant focused on three important aspects of STUbL biology:  1) How do STUbLs interact with their ubiquitylation targets? To answer this question we employed a structure-function approach to dissect domains of the budding yeast STUbL subunit Slx5.  We identified distinct domains of Slx5 that are indispensable for the interaction with Slx8 (another STUbL subunit), Smt3 (yeast SUMO) and sumoylated substrates.  We also mapped a novel arginine-rich domain in Slx5 that plays a critical role in its homodimerization and the nuclear localization of this STUbL subunit.  These findings hint at a sophisticated mode of regulating the assembly and targeting of STUbLs.  2) Are there additional STUbL functions? We determined that Slx5 functionally interacts with Siz1, a SUMO ligase that suppresses illegitimate homologous recombination and is conserved in human cells (Westerbeck et al., 2014., Szymanski and Kerscher, 2013).

Since STUbLs are highly conserved, this research provides key information for the study of protein quality control and the cellular stress response to protein misfolding in other eukaryotes, including humans.  3) What are the targets of STUbLs in the cell division cycle and genomic integrity?  As detailed above, we identified the conserved Siz1 protein as an important substrate of Slx5.  Additionally, we also engaged in a fruitful collaboration with the Basrai Lab (NCI/NIH) to unravel how STUbLs control the histone-like centromere protein Cse4 (histones are proteins that structure and order DNA in eukaryotic cells).  A publication resulting from this collaboration reveals the novel finding that Cse4 is sumoylated by the E3 ligases Siz1 and Siz2 and ubiquitinated by Slx5.  Slx5 regulates ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Cse4 and prevents it from being improperly localized (Ohkuni et al., 2016). Therefore, this study predicts that functionally related proteins in humans (RNF4 and CENP-A) are essential for proper chromosome segregation.
