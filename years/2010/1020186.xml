<AbstractNarration>This project evaluates the benefits of using different types of place-based ecological data in high school science classrooms. This project will combine and assess the use of first-hand (collected by students) and real-time second-hand data in teaching science and critical thinking skills. The guiding question for the project is "Does using place-based, first-hand ecological evidence, and relating that to place-based, second-hand data, improve students' environmental science literacy, nature of science understanding, and knowledge of ecological concepts?" Other questions the proposed project will explore include: How can teachers best engage students in understanding and evaluating critical environmental problems through the use of data? Does the use of real-time data in the classroom help connect students with science content and/or the scientific research community? What knowledge and skills do teachers need in order to make effective use of the data being made available to them by ecological monitoring networks such as National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer these questions, a place-based, ecology curriculum, the Changing Hudson Project, will be used along with data and field trips provided by regional partners. A quasi-experimental study in high school classes in the Mid-Hudson Valley of NY will compare different instructional models, providing preliminary evidence of the relative strengths and limitations of different approaches. A range of formative assessment methods will be used to describe and assess students' understanding of ecology, and their engagement, motivation and capacity for collecting, analyzing, and applying ecological data. The evaluation will include pre-and post-assessments given to students in the treatment classrooms and in a comparison classroom in the same schools. Questionnaires, focus group interviews, and student portfolios will be used to assess student understanding and dispositions in sample classrooms.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses an exciting and interesting area of research regarding the inquiry approach to science and the utility of cyber-enabled science investigations. Many K-12 teachers find it difficult to expose students to the real environment. Field trips can be expensive, and liability concerns scare many teachers and especially school administrators away from allowing students to experience natural settings outside of the classroom. This phenomenon is lamented by ecologists and has led to a movement to get kids outside more.  The concern is that students today have a 'Nature Deficit Disorder,' as coined by Richard Louv in his book 'Last Child in the Woods.' Advocates of cyber-learning propose that technology provides a solution by allowing students to experience the outside world virtually, and that they can collect and analyze ecological data from the comfort of their classroom desks. Virtual experiences may be better than no experience at all, but how do they compare with first-hand experiences?  This proposal aims to determine how virtual experiences compare to real-life experiences with regard to understanding ecological concepts, analyzing ecological data, and drawing scientifically-reasoned, valid conclusions.</AbstractNarration>

The project was directed by Alan R. Berkowitz, Stuart E.G. Findlay and David S. Strayer with a total of twenty teachers participating in a robust Professional Learning Community over three years (Figure 1). The major goals of the DEEP include the development, implementation, and evaluation of a series of professional development efforts designed around the use of primary and secondary data sets as a means of exploring science.  The questions addressed revolve around exploring and understanding: 1) the benefits from and requisite supports for students to do data-based inquiry and critique using combinations of first hand and second hand data; 2) the roles that teachersÆ proficiency with and motivation for data exploration in ecology and associated teaching practices play in shaping student learning; and 3) what professional development activities and resources support teachers in effective data exploration teaching.     The professional development opportunities provided by DEEP helped teachers develop their understanding of, and ability to implement, a refined set of lesson modules designed to engage students in data exploration processes, which we visualized with the DEEP Inquiry and Critique Framework (Figure 2).   This visual was used throughout the professional development sessions to guide our thinking about how to explore data both with teachers and with students.      TeachersÆ implementation of DEEP modules and their associated practices were characterized by a focus on 1) exploring variability in real datasets with students, 2) eliciting, interpreting and responding to studentsÆ data exploration knowledge, skills, and attitudes and 3) supporting students to use evidence and reasoning to support a claim (see Figure 3 for a checklist of practices). In addition, teachers reported that as a result of the professional development and support provided by this project, they felt substantially more confident in their own data exploration skills and their ability to introduce those skills to students. Teachers also reported having greater comfort in finding, interpreting, and using data sets in their teaching, and that they would continue to use the DEEP modules and principles in their teaching (Figure 4).  Factors that were identified as supporting and constraining teachers can be seen in Figure 5, with participation in the PLC as the number one support and time as the top constraint.     Student data were analyzed to better understand their abilities related to different aspects of our framework for inquiry and critique (Figure 2). The findings indicate that students know what variability is (60%, N=310) and how to identify it (80%, N = 310), but this understanding is limited as only 17% of students could explain why variability is important for answering a scientific question, making a claim, or formulating a prediction (Figure 6).         Intellectual Merit     The research associated with this PD effort was designed to help understand what students need to help them develop data explorations skills essential to the practices of constructing, defending, and evaluating evidence-based claims, and what types of supports teachers need to effectively implement data exploration instruction.  These skills include, but are not limited to, identifying potential sources of variability, understanding the implications of variability, and understanding how variability in a data set can influence claims made based on that data.  Our hypothesis was that explicit instruction and practice with data exploration skills would increase teacher knowledge and efficacy which would in turn result in an increase not just in student understanding of data exploration issues, but also result in studentsÆ increased ability to construct, ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
