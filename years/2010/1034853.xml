<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to strengthen K-8 geoscience education in the state of Georgia through the use of an innovative but underutilized weather science and safety curriculum, the Red Cross Masters of Disaster (MoD) curriculum. The principal investigators are conducting a series of week-long professional development workshops in the summer of 2011 and 2012 for approximately thirty (30) science teachers in each of three selected county groups (Bibb, Brantley/Glynn, and Calhoun) of Georgia that are socio-economically and climatologically vulnerable to severe and extreme weather conditions. The workshops focus on teaching teachers about the Red Cross MoD weather science and safety curriculum for K-8 students. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the workshops will determine impact on teacher learning, and eventually on what students learn, how much they learn, and what knowledge they take home with them when teachers deliver the MoD curriculum after attending the workshop. Smaller scale versions of these workshops, offered for the past two years at the University of Georgia with support by a Teacher Quality grant, have indicated that these workshops have much promise in increasing science teacher's weather and climate literacy.  It is expected that this project will provide useful data on the effectiveness of the MoD curriculum to increase students' knowledge of weather science and safety and to promote a culture of weather safety in students and their families.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project aimed to provide answers to the following questions: 1. Can Georgia teachers from kindergarten to eighth grade (K-8) learn about weather science and safety in a week-long workshop so that they feel sufficiently knowledgeable and confident that they can teach their students about lightning, tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods?  2. Do students learn when teachers provide weather science and safety instruction? and 3. Do students take their weather science and safety knowledge and lessons home so that parents and families are better prepared to deal with severe weather?   These are important questions to answer for several reasons: 1. Many K-8 teachers, even if the teach science, may have not had much of any formal training in teaching students about earth or atmospheric science. 2. Georgia teachers we surveyed were not satisfied with existing curricular resources for teaching their students about weather science and safety.  3. The American Red Cross produces an excellent curriculum, Master of Disaster, for the K-8 grades that helps students learn about the science and safety of lighting, tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods that many Georgia teachers did not know about.  4. Helping children to understand the science and safety of extreme weather when they are young will likely help them to remain safe and not to take risks with the weather when they become adults, and 5. Helping children to understand weather science and safety may help their family members, especially parents, to become more aware of and prepared for severe weather.  To conduct this project, we provided three one-week long weather science and safety workshops for 66 teachers in Georgia counties that may be both climatologically and socioeconomically vulnerable to the effects of severe weather.  The weather workshop website describing the project can be found at this web address:  http://www.weathersafety.net.  Our objectives in the this training were to educate teachers about weather science and safety using the Master of Disaster (MoD) curriculum, to build their sense of confidence in providing weather science and safety instruction to their students, and to assess the teachersÆ increases in weather science and safety knowledge as a result of attending the workshop.  The data we collected about the workshop effects indicated that teachers did feel more efficacious about providing weather science and safety instruction to their students and did make gains in their knowledge about the science and safety of lighting, tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods.  In addition to the workshop training, we wanted the attending teachers to both share the MoD curriculum with their teacher colleagues and to teach the curriculum to their students.  We gave teachers additional copies of the MoD curriculum kits to share.   We observed a portion (13.6%) of the teachers who attended the workshop in their use of the curriculum at their schools one to two years after their workshop participation.  The teachers utilized the curriculum well, making use of its educational features and components.  With regard to sharing the curriculum with teachers other teachers, our follow-up survey showed that 26 teachers indicated that they discussed the curriculum with a total of 203 other teachers.  Thirty two teachers who responded to our tracking indicated that they provided 178 MoD lessons on lighting, tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods (approximately 5.6 lessons per teacher) and used the MoD curriculum somewhat to much in their lesson delivery.  Taken together, the teachers estimated that they provided direct instruction to 2465 Georgia students.  The teachers estimated that they their colleagues used the curriculum to reach another 3096 students, for a total of 5568 students who were exposed to the MoD weather science and safety curriculum.  The performance by a sample of 291 students on comprehensive tests of the science and safety aspects of lighting, tornadoes, hurricanes, or floods i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
