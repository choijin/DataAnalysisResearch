<AbstractNarration>Plains Indian Sign Language (PISL) Documentation Workshop, Summer 2010&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support of the NSF DEL program, co-PIs and sign language linguists Dr. Jeffrey Davis (University of Tennessee) and Melanie McKay-Cody (Chickamauga Cherokee/Choctaw, William Woods University) are conducting the first fieldwork in over 50 years to focus on the linguistic structure of Plains Indian Sign Language (PISL). Based on recent fieldwork in 2009, the co-PIs have identified more than two-dozen PISL signers, including women and deaf tribal members, from among the Northern Cheyenne, Crow, Blackfeet, Assiniboine, and Mandan-Hidatsa. This demonstrates that PISL continues to be used within Plains tribal groups and still functions as an intertribal signed lingua franca.  Formal linguistic documentation and description of PISL has been long overdue, and this workshop will present the latest findings and insights about the linguistic nature and structure of PISL, the outcomes of signed language-spoken language contact, and the conveyance of human language in signed and spoken modalities.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held on the Northern Cheyenne reservation, August 2010; and, will involve participants from several tribal groups and colleges.  In collaboration with personnel from Montana State University, Billings, Little Bighorn National Monument, and Dull Knife Memorial College, it will be widely publicized and it is anticipated that more PISL signers will be identified. The workshop will showcase and disseminate recent findings about PISL usage, lexicon, and grammar.  For the first time, it will bring together sign language linguists and Deaf and American Indian individuals to train them in linguistics, field methods, and language documentation technologies (e.g. ELAN). Working with Native signers, the co-PIs are transcribing/glossing and translating PISL using ELAN; identifying lexical-grammatical categories; and, conducting comparative syntactic analyses.  These findings will be submitted to peer-reviewed linguistic research journals, contribute to the compilation of a PISL dictionary with grammatical descriptions, and integrated into the project website/online digital archive of American Indian sign language documentary materials, so that the broadest possible audiences will have access to them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dr. Jeffrey Davis (PI, The University of Tennessee) and American Indian collaborators (co-PI Melanie McKay-Cody, Cherokee/Choctaw and James Woodenlegs, Northern Cheyenne) organized and coordinated the Plains Indian Sign Language (PISL): 2010 Summer Meeting and DEL Workshops, Northern Cheyenne [TseÆtsehestahese] Reservation, Montana.   The chief purpose was to collaborate with members of Native American signing communities to document the current geographic spread, domains of use, and linguistic status of PISL, classified as an endangered language variety [SIL code: psd].  We collaborated with PISL stakeholders from American Indian communities and tribal colleges to organize, publicize, and conduct this historic meeting.  Thirty participants registered for the workshops, and over fifty community members attended public presentations at the tribal college. This meeting brought together sign language linguists and Deaf and American Indians for the first time that we know of.  We trained our sign language and linguistic students, identified and filmed more than one dozen Native signers &ndash; including women and deaf tribal members from [TseÆtsehestahese], Blackfeet [Amskapi Pikuni], Crow [Apsaalooke], Assiniboine [AÆaniinen], Nakoda, and Lak?&oacute;ta [Tetonwan] nations.  There has been a marked decline in the number of Indians learning indigenous signed and spoken languages due in part to various socio-historical factors (the replacement of PISL by English and American Sign Language [ASL] in some instances). PISL is now primarily known by hearing elders and by American Indians who are deaf.  Although currently considered an endangered language PISL remains resilient and is still learned and used by dozens of American Indians and potentially hundreds in the US and Canada (Marvin Weatherwax [Blackfeet scholar], personal communication 2010). Documentary linguistic work is critical to determine the number of signers and to the survival of PISL; and, to advance our knowledge of the cognitive, cultural, and linguistic underpinnings of indigenous signed languages.  The August 11 &ndash; 15, 2010 meeting and DEL workshops on the Northern Cheyenne [TseÆtsehestahese] Reservation were needed for two main reasons: 1) PISL is highly endangered and rapidly vanishing; and there had been no formal survey of its present day acquisition and usage to determine the number of extant PISL signers since the mid-1950s; and, 2) the PISL legacy and contemporary documentary materials collected by the project thus far contain a wealth of information about American Indian cultural heritage that should be shared with the communities where sign language once flourished; and the meeting and workshops aimed to fill in the gaps in the linguistic research in order to better understand its linguistic typology and structure.  In close collaboration with the Northern Cheyenne [TseÆtsehestahese] Tribal College, we filmed more than one dozen signers from various tribes of the Great Plains cultural area participating in the meeting. The twenty hours of videotaped data and over two-hundred photographs of this meeting and workshops are being integrated into the projectÆs website/online digital archive. The project includes the storing, archiving, distributing, and annotating of footage and documentary materials from the fieldwork.  To advance PISL documentary linguistic work and to make this sign language more accessible we are incorporating emergent technologies and using captions, voice-over, and careful explanations.  We are working closely with Native signers to document the current sociolinguistic status of PISL; describing its linguistic nature and structure; and, conducting comparative linguistic analyses of varieties and dialects. We are gaining valuable insights about PISL-ASL contact, signed language-spoken language contact, and the conveyance of human language in both signed and spoken modalities, and the linguistic underpinnings of signed and spoken langua...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
