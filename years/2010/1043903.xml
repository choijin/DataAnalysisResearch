<AbstractNarration>Statistics curricula have required excessive up-front investment in statistical theory, which many quantitatively-capable students in ``big science'' fields initially perceive to be unnecessary.  A research training program at Carnegie Mellon exposes students to cross-disciplinary research early, showing them the scientific importance of ideas from statistics and machine learning, and the intellectual depth of the subject. Graduate students receive instruction and mentored feedback on cross-disciplinary interaction, communication skills, and teaching. Postdoctoral fellows become productive researchers who understand the diverse roles and responsibilities they will face as faculty or members of a research laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The statistical needs of the scientific establishment are huge, and growing rapidly, making the current rate of workforce production dangerously inadequate.  The research training program in the Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University trains undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in an integrated environment that emphasizes the application of statistical and machine learning methods in scientific research. The program builds on existing connections with computational neuroscience, computational biology, and astrophysics.  Carnegie Mellon is recruiting students from a broad spectrum of quantitative disciplines, with emphasis on computer science.  Carnegie Mellon already has an unusually large undergraduate statistics program. New efforts will strengthen the training of these students, and attract additional highly capable students to be part of the pipeline entering the mathematical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has succeeded in each of its principal aims. The project focused on fostering cross-disciplinary statistical research and effective data analysis in the sciences, through development of novel educational and collaborative resources in the field of statistics and a broadening of recruitment into the field. Testaments to the success of this work include the explosive growth of our programs, the wide range of trainees we have attracted, the subsequent accomplishments of these trainees, and the wide interest in and uptake of our ideas by the statistical community. Among the accomplishments produced by the project, we have had particular successes in the following core areas.Innovative Revision of Core CurriculumAs part of this project, we have developed new, required Statistical Computing courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The new courses weave together traditional statistical computing content with fundamental concepts and software-engineering practices. They also give students hands-on experience with techniques for working with large, complex data sets and interdisciplinary applications.We have also overhauled our undergraduate capstone data-analysis sequence to use interdisciplinary research problems as methodological case studies. We also transformed our upper level electives to a rotating set of special topics courses and created five new Freshman Seminars (small, interactive courses).This project also supported new ``honors'' intermediate-level course on statistical inference and learning theory; a focused research experience course for advanced students; and new half-semester courses or both undergraduate and graduate students in research areas where our faculty have special expertise.The project has also improved our graduate program. In particular, RTG funding for Ph.D. students has helped students to engage with research sooner and spend more time doing research. Shifting effort from TA work to research gives students more time to build a foundation in statistics and application areas. Also to this end, enabled by RTG funding, include changes to our Advanced Data Analysis project and increased opportunities to engage with faculty research earlier.We have also developed a new graduate course on Convex Optimization, teaching critical algorithms that underlie many modern statistical and machine learning methods. We have redesigned our core Intermediate Statistics course to focus on modern theory and to demonstrate the value of statistical thinking in large-scale problems. Both courses are highly popular among students in Statistics and many other departments.  At a higher level, the project has led to expansion of our joint Ph.D. program with Machine Learning and supported development the nation's first joint undergraduate major in Statistics and Machine Learning. Since its inception, the latter has grown explosively. We also have built joint Ph.D. programs with the Engineering and Public Policy department and with the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, supplementing our successful joint Ph.D. program with the Heinz school of Public Policy.Fostering Cross-Disciplinary ResearchOur undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty are encouraged to get ``in the trenches'' of another field to tackle interdisciplinary problems. This project let us take this to the next level. For undergraduates, we added a supervised Undergraduate Research course and enhanced the use of real data sets and problems throughout our curriculum. We created regular undergraduate research assistantship positions and, with project support, have been able to hire 4-5 such assistants each semester into vertically-integrated groups with graduate students, post-doctorates, and faculty. To accommodate the great demand for these positions and international students not eligible to receive NSF funds, we offer similarly supervised independent study credit. In the last five years, we have also doubled the size of our Honors Thesis program. More than 80% of our recent Honors Thesis students go on to Ph.D. programs.Summer Program and Minority OutreachUnder this project, we have run successful summer programs to give undergraduates experience with statistical thinking and methods applied to interdisciplinary research problems. Our primary goals are to draw students into the field who might not otherwise think of Statistics as a career, especially students from traditionally underrepresented populations. While these goals proved challenging, we are very happy with the results. We have had students from diverse majors, and each year from a third to half of the students have been from under-represented groups. Our success has attracted outside funding to enable this program to continue.Trainee SuccessOur visiting faculty have been highly sought after. Four recent RTG-supported fellows (Jessica Cisewski, Rebecca Steorts, JaredMurray, and Jordan Rodu) have established strong, international research reputations during their three-year terms here and have moved to tenure-track positions at Yale, Duke, and UT-Austin and a post-doc at Wharton. We have also had many stellar undergraduate students go on to statistical careers in industry and graduate school. Our RTG graduate students have found excellent jobs in diverse industries and academia. Our metric of success is not time to Ph.D. but rather time to active research, and we have seen it drop significantly.
