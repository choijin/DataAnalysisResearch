<AbstractNarration>This award to the Alabama A&amp;M University (AAMU) will provide a ten-week research experience to undergraduates during the summers of 2012- 2014. Students will spend the first two weeks at AAMU followed by eight weeks at Nanjing Forestry University in China. The program focuses on Ecological and Environmental Science Research in an Urbanizing Landscape, engaging students in a broad range of ecological and environmental science research with a focus on the hypothesis driven quantification, experimentation and modeling of human induced ecological and environmental changes, particularly the ecosystem responses to urbanization. The program will expose talented students to international collaborative research. Students will improve their written and verbal communication skills and enhance their self-confidence and ability to do teamwork. The program is designed to enhance students? critical thinking and analytical skills, and provide opportunities for networking among students, faculty, and scientists in the US and China. Each student will complete a research project, prepare a written report, and give a presentation. Additionally, students will be exposed to China's language, culture, and history. Students will be recruited through the program website, mailings, and faculty-to-faculty communications.  Students will be selected based on academic record, research interest and experience, and potential for outstanding research in ecology related fields.  An Advisory Committee will provide program review, advice and consultation.  Students will be tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The successes of the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://www.aamu.edu/Academics/agricultural-and-environmental-sciences/departments/nres/Pages/REU-Program.aspx, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Yong Wang at yong.wang @aamu.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Elica Moss at elica.moss@aamu.edu).</AbstractNarration>
