<AbstractNarration>University of California, Irvine, doctoral student Cristina Bejarano, supervised by Dr. Mei Zhan, will explore the cultural and social implications of recent institutionalizations of public health genomics. There is a growing trend in medical and genetic research to  apply genomic science to public health research, programs, and policies. The researcher will focus on the implications of these developments for understanding the changing relationship between citizens, healthcare, science, and society.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in Mexico, where, in advance of upcoming national anniversaries, a specifically Mexican genomic has recently been announced by both scientists and politicians. The research objectives are: 1) to understand if and why a biologically-based notion of national identity is being promoted;  and  2) to examine effects this idea of national identity may have on how Mexicans participate in and have access to their national healthcare system. The researcher will employ  multiple social science methods including:  participant observation and semi-structured interviews with key informants at  research institutions and at political events celebrating the 200th anniversary of Mexican Independence and the 100th anniversary of the Mexican Revolution; interviews with patient advocacy groups, health pratitioners, and other stakeholders; and text analysis of media and educational materials related to genomic science, the Mexican genome, national narratives, and national identity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By building on social studies of science and medical anthropology, this research project will further understanding of the relation between science and politics, biological citizenship, and biosociality. The knowledge gained from the particular case of public health genomics in Mexico will advance our understanding of these key themes as well as provide insights into similar processes occurring in other countries.  Supporting this research also supports the education of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>
