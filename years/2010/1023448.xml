<AbstractNarration>Government agencies at the state and local level are beginning to develop coast management adaption plans for dealing with the effects of climate change.  In this Dissertation Improvement Grant Proposal, the co-PI presents hypotheses regarding how planning and priorities at the state and local level differ and interact and how perceptions regarding the importance of uncertainties varies with the scale of governmental units. The hypotheses will be tested using results from a series of 30 semi-structured interviews and a web-based survey to be distributed to 1200 coastal managers in three states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this research will contribute to understanding how perceived risk and uncertainty influence the analysis and evaluation of adaptation and provide insight into how state-level adaptation plans support local management needs. Results may therefore be used to inform the development of more scale sensitive and policy relevant assessments.  Research findings will be published in academic peer-reviewed literature, presented at academic and professional conferences, and packaged into short summaries in formats useful for non-scientists. Such efforts ensure that research, extension, and outreach efforts support local and regional adaptation initiatives</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             This project builds upon existing climate change adaptation (CCA) research by investigating three research questions that analyze the influence of perceived risk, uncertainty, trust, and scale on adaptation in US coastal communities.  First, this study evaluates differences between planner expectations and climate projections of the magnitude of change and range of uncertainty of global temperature and sea level rise by 2030 and the likelihood of potential climate change impacts by the mid-late 21st century.  Second, this study investigates differences in adaptation priorities, including current planning efforts, perceptions of the level of support, and the desired role of the state in local-level planning among planning entities.  Third, this study evaluates the influence of perceived risk, uncertainty, and trust on support for CCA planning.              Semi-structured interviews (n = 27) and a web-based survey (n= 137) were used to investigate these research questions.  Participants included city planners and engineers, county and borough planners, employees of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and division heads of state government offices.  This group was selected for analysis because they play a critical role in the development of CCA plans and have received limited attention in previous coastal survey-based research.  Alaska, Florida, and Maryland were selected as the study areas as each state has recently passed a CCA plan and is facing different coastal management challenges.  The major findings from this research are: 1) Coastal planners hold notably different expectations of climate change than climate science projections.  Planners expect a much greater increase in temperature and sea level rise and perceive greater range of uncertainty than climate science projections by 2030.  2) There are significant differences in CCA adaptation priorities among planning entities across study areas and levels of management.  These differences include factors support for CCA, factors motivating the development of CCA plans, the desired role of the state in local-level plans, and elements to include in a state-level plan.  3) Higher levels of perceived risk and trust in climate scientists significantly increase the odds for a higher level of support for local-level CCA strategies.  Uncertainties in how the climate will change (e.g., how much sea level  or sea level will rise) is a significant barrier to local-level planners and not significant for NGOs and state-level planners.  Together, these findings advance our understanding of potential barriers to CCA planning in multi-level government systems.  Findings from this research may be used to improve environmental decision-making processes.  First, this study identified differences in support for CCA planning, priorities motivating the development of plans, the desired role of the state in adaptation planning, and elements to include in a state-level plan across different levels of management and study areas.  These findings may be used to inform the development of more scale sensitive and policy relevant adaptation planning efforts.  Second, this study found that planners at multiple levels of governance are more likely to engage in climate outreach efforts to support the development of, and allocation of resources for, CCA when they feel for a risk to the impacts of climate change and trust climate science messages.  These findings may be used to improve climate change outreach and extension efforts.   Findings from this research have been presented at academic and professional conferences and short summaries of the research results, written in formats intended for non-scientists, have been disseminated to community leaders, coastal organizations, and individuals responsible for the development of state adaptation plans.  Dissemination of the results is important in order to increase the adaptive capacity of coastal communities to climate change. Findings wil...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
