<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of a Real Time PCR thermocycler system. This piece of equipment essentially consists of a conventional thermal cycler used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a fluorescence detection system. A common application for this system is called Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) because fluorescence can be monitored as samples undergo PCR amplification. The experiments that will use the RT-PCR system include the conventional Molecular Cell Biology assays that rely on PCR amplification of nucleic acids, as well as relatively novel applications in protein biochemistry and supramolecular synthetic chemistry that are not PCR-based.   The RT-PCR system will be used to better understand cell division in yeast by quantifying gene expression levels; explore gene expression patterns of different insulin-like proteins involved in insect feeding; experimentally document the effect of X-irradiation on archaeological samples;  develop an assay to be used to identify novel nuclear hormone receptor ligands, and facilitate screening of a range of novel chemicals designed to serve as fluorescent molecular sensors.  All of the projects described in this proposal will be conducted with the assistance of undergraduate students. Results from the studies conducted with the new thermocycler will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award has facilitated the development of undergraduate-involved research at the State University of New York at New Paltz.  Over the course of the 3 year grant period, around 30 students have worked with the machine has part of their independent study projects in Biology, Chemistry and Anthropology.  This work has been presented at national meetings (Cell Biology, Biophysical Society) and to date, one journal article has been published.  These students are now much better equipped to find a job post-graduation, since this type of equipment is important in many settings.  In addition to students working on individual projects, around 200 students utilized the equipment as part of their curriculum in Biology and Biochemistry.   These lab activities allow students to better understand the material learned in class, and provide valuable real-world experiences that will help them attain employment.  This piece of equipment will continue to be used for the development of new labs next semester, including our new Biochemistry major capstone course.  Finally, this equipment has facilitated the development of a completely new line of investigation into the development of dog-breed specific DNA genetic tests.  This project is being developed to provide this service to interested dog breeders and provide undergraduate students with a paid internship-like experience as part of their studies.
