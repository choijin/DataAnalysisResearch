<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Commutative Algebra deals largely with the study of polynomials in an arbitrary number of variables.  In particular, one might want to find the common roots of a given set of polynomials.  This is a problem that is first introduced in high school algebra; given three linear equations, find the values of x, y, and z that makes each equation zero.  It is a natural extension to increase the number of variables and to consider polynomials of higher degree (a linear equation is degree 1).  This makes the problem substantially more difficult and the higher degree and more variables one allows, the more computationally expensive it becomes to explicitly find the common roots.  So, we tweak the question.  Given a family of polynomials (we call this family an ideal), are there invariants and/or characteristics that give us an idea of how complex the given family is?  Although the original title of this project mentions Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the set we ended up focusing on an invariant of the ideal called depth.  Even if we fix the number of variables, there is an infinite number of families of polynomials.  To make the problem approachable, we must restrict our focus.  This project restricted to ideals obtained from discrete finite graphs (which is a set of points called vertices and line segments joining these vertices which we call edges).  The number of variables our polynomials can have, then, is the number of edges in the graph.  These polynomials arise from even closed paths on the graph, i.e. a path along the edges of the graph that start and end at the same vertex.  We began the project by running examples computationally until we found a family of graphs whose ideals all had depth equal to 7.  An image of this family is attached to this report.  Finding such a family led to a more general result: given integers d and f,  one can find a discrete graph, called G, with d vertices such that its associated ideal has depth equal to f.  This is the main result of the paper "Depth of Edge Rings Arising from Finite Graphs" co-authored with Takayuki HIbi, Akihiro Higashitani and Kyouko Kimura which appeared in the journal Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society.  The crux of this paper was proving that this family of graphs yielded ideals with depth equal to 7.  We were then able to extend the methods used in this paper to prove similar results about algebraic objects called initial ideals and have submitted the paper (with the same co-authors) "Depth of Initial Ideals of Normal Edge Rings" which was submitted to the journal Mathematica Scandinavica.
