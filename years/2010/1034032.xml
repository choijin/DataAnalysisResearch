<AbstractNarration>PI: McAlindon, Peter J.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1034032&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;A technology and human expert step-by-step process is proposed to provide persons with disabilities an opportunity to independently develop their own ideas as entrepreneurs. Many persons with disabilities have a propensity to become entrepreneurs but often times have difficulty accessing and participating in traditional entrepreneurial activities. Our goal is to develop an online environment that allows persons with disabilities to participate more fully in the process of becoming and being an entrepreneur. In addition to providing individuals with disabilities a tool set to improve and enhance entrepreneurship among them, the proposed collaborative environment will be a very powerful research tool to test hypotheses about the cognitive, affective, and inter-personal constructs and mechanisms involved in entrepreneurship and among persons with disabilities. For example, the proposed environment would allow both formal and informal firsthand inquiry of entrepreneurial and technology questions. Additionally, the proposed environment would allow research on entrepreneurship and on cognitions of persons with disabilities in non-laboratory and non-classroom situations. Authentic field and informal learning experiences are regarded by educators as important for advancing learning and motivation to pursue career paths in entrepreneurship. Unlike other, laboratory-based research on these topics, the proposed environment would be able to obtain relatively large and potentially quite representative samples of individuals engaging in real-life problem solving and assessment. Thus, in addition to allowing the testing of new mechanisms/hypotheses, the proposed environment would also allow generalizability studies from prior laboratory-based research into the "real world".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will provide technology to persons with disabilities that will allow them to experience entrepreneurial education activities from a hands-on perspective. This will promote learning and may enhance self confidence in their capacity to function independently in starting their own businesses. This could lead to an increase in the number of individuals with disabilities entering the workforce and supporting related activities of other disabled or able-bodied entrepreneurs. Persons with disabilities are frequently unemployed and draw taxpayer monies for support. Increased representation of persons with disabilities in entrepreneurship by its very nature will reduce their unemployment numbers and the need for taxpayer support for not just the founder of the effort, but perhaps several employees who also have disabilities. Non-disabled entrepreneurs can use this program as well and it should be equally effective.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this research is to create a framework for an accessible, mentor/mentee relationship based system for persons with disabilities so they can investigate becoming entrepreneurs and become part of a broader entrepreneurial ecosystem. A strong entrepreneurial ecosystem requires one in which persons with disabilities are included.   The principal discipline is entrepreneurship and more specifically, entrepreneurship that is designed for persons with disabilities. Much of what is required of an entrepreneur is access. Access to information, to people, to money, to live or web based events, seminars, webinars, etc. Access to all of these things may be limited for a person with a disability. If the information is not accessible, persons with disabilities could be left out of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. ItÆs been said, "Necessity is the mother of invention." If that is true, persons with disabilities have the greatest potential to benefit from invention; their own inventions because they are often necessary for the their well being, communication, education, social development, etc.   As a person with a disability learns about entrepreneurship and ultimately becomes an entrepreneur or, in the case of working in established organizations, an intrapreneur, the opportunity for an increased number of inventions and discoveries increases.  Entrepreneurs are often the prime developers of technologies that drive future markets. Collaboration with other entrepreneurs also opens up and accelerates ideas and awareness for future discoveries thereby increasing the advancement of entrepreneurship and STEM. The very nature of entrepreneurship is a process by which future discoveries are best identified, investigated, and exploited to their full potential. It requires a diverse team of entrepreneurs and other professionals to help bring an idea to market. Taking part in a well diversified team has seemingly been off limits to a number of persons with disabilities.   It is important that entrepreneurs and the larger business community become more aware of this need and recognize the contributions of people with disabilities to their efforts and are willing and able to include them in their workplaces, supply chains, marketplaces and perhaps most importantly, their own entrepreneurial endeavors.   We have amassed over 500 plus books, articles, videos, online courses, instructional videos, research papers, websites, and other information and resources which are used to support both mentors and mentees using our system. This library is designed to be integrated into existing, established entrepreneurial programs across the country; resources can be shared easily and best practices will be made available.    Because the process of creating a new venture is very challenging, our system implements a step-by-step, mentor mediated learning system to make sure the steps that a mentee is taking are in the right direction and are not too small to slow growth or too large to overwhelm the mentee.  We have created an awareness of the program, have a deep, diverse, local mentor list, a lean startup methodology to increase success of a venture, and a growing means to fund viable ventures borne out of this research effort.   Part of the vision of the program was the creation of a group of thought leaders that include members of the disability community and assistive technology market, experienced entrepreneurs for early stage entrepreneurial development, instructors and professors in entrepreneurial education, and community leaders. Our greatest dissemination efforts have grow organically and as entrepreneurs with disabilities become successful themselves, awareness of the program should grow as well.
