<AbstractNarration>The proposal focuses on a class of random growth models of one and two-dimensional interfaces. The growth is local, it has a smoothing mechanism, and the speed of growth may depend on the local slope of the interface.&lt;br/&gt;The central role is played by models that enjoy a rich algebraic structure.&lt;br/&gt;In many cases this is reflected through determinantal formulas for the correlation functions. Large time asymptotic analysis of such formulas is expected to reveal asymptotic features of the emerging interface in different scales. The main goal of the project is to produce and collect various pieces of information to form a unified picture of the asymptotic behavior of large randomly growing interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal focuses on the study of large time behavior for various models of random interface growth on the plane and in the three-dimensional space. Such models appear naturally in both mathematics and physics, for example when one considers ideal crystal melting, or molecular condensation on a substrate, or traffic evolution. Accurate analysis at large times is typically very difficult, and we concentrate on models with additional algebraic structure that originates in seemingly unrelated parts of mathematics. This structure helps to discover new phenomena that tend to be universal, i.e. present in a much wider range of models. As a result, using sophisticated mathematical tools, we find new universal laws that play the role of the famous bell-shaped curve, and that can often be observed later through physical and numerical experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the course of the award I  worked on probabilistic systems that can be analyzed by essentially algebraic methods.  The historically first example of such a system goes back to De Moivre (1738) and Laplace (1812) who considered the problem of finding the asymptotic distribution of a sum of i.i.d. random variables for Bernoulli trials, when the pre-limit distribution is explicit, and took the limit of the resulting expression. While this computation may look like a simple exercise when viewed from the heights of modern probability, in its time it likely served the role of a key stepping stone - first rigorous proofs of central limit theorems appeared only in the end of the XIXth century.  At the moment we are arguably in a ``De Moivre-Laplace stage'' for a certain class of stochastic systems which is often referred to as the KPZ universality class, after an influential work of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang in mid-80's. The class includes models of local random interface growth that have built-in mechanisms of smoothing and lateral growth. Directed polymers in space-time uncorrelated random media and driven diffusive lattice gases are well known examples in (1+1) dimensions.   While the class and some of its members have been identified by physicists, the first examples of convincing (actually, rigorous) analysis were provided by mathematicians, who were also able to identify the distributions that play the role of the Gaussian law. The most well-known ones are the Tracy-Widom type distributions, named so because they had previously appeared in Tracy-Widom's work on spectra of large random matrices.  The reason for mathematicians' success was that there is an unusually extensive amount of algebra and combinatorics required to gain access to suitable pre-limit formulas that admit large time limit transitions. The ``solvable'' or integrable members of the class should be viewed as projections of much more powerful objects whose origins lie in representation theory. In a way, this is similar to integrable systems that can also be viewed as projections of representation theoretic objects; and this is one reason we use the words integrable probability to describe the phenomenon.   In order to capture a broader variety of integrable probabilistic systems, about five years ago we introduced a class of probability measures called Macdonald processes. These measure are built from Macdonald polynomials - a family of multivariate symmetric polynomials that plays a central role in modern representation theory (they were originally introduced by I.Macdonald in mid-80's). Using the rich algebraic structure of the Macdonald polynomials, one is able to obtain precise information about Macdonald processes that allows one to prove very fine asymptotic statements (concentration of measure and fluctuations around the mean) for the probabilistic systems that can be obtained from the Macdonald processes via various degenerations.  The technique of Macdonald processes has a number of other applications as well. Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of what it was already used for (within the project):  asymptotics of the KPZ equation with a certain class of initial conditions;  asymptotics of Log-Gamma fully discrete random directed polymers;  asymptotics of q-TASEP and ASEP;  discovery of new integrable (1+1)d interacting particle systems - discrete time q-TASEPs and q-PushASEPs;  Gaussian Free Field asymptotics of the general beta Jacobi corners process;  Gaussian asymptotics of the discrete integrable log-gas at an arbitrary temperature (so-called Jack measures);  spectral theory for the q-Boson particle system and for the XXZ quantum spin chain;  asymptotics of probabilistic models originating from representation theory of the infinite-dimensional unitary group.  In a very recent and very exciting development, it became apparent that it is meaningful and useful to expand this technique to the case when the Schur (or Macdonald) polynomials are replaced by the wave functions of quantum integrable spin chains in infinite volume.   One of the simplest and well-known spin chains is the (anisotropic Heisenberg) XXZ model of quantum ferromagnetic. Its wave functions can be viewed as multivariate symmetric polynomials, and they are different from the Macdonald ones, although they share many features.   We developed a standard toolbox of the symmetric function theory for the these wavefuctions functions, including the branching rule, the Pieri rules, the Cauchy identities (needed to produce explicit Gibbs measures), orthogonality relations, etc.         Last Modified: 09/02/2016       Submitted by: Alexei Borodin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
