<AbstractNarration>Susquehanna University's program "Broadening Intensive Opportunities for Scholarship (BIOS)" provides scholarship support for academically qualified, financially needy incoming undergraduates to persist to earn a Biology degree.  Recruitment targets students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM majors, part of an ongoing priority in the university to increase the diversity of the student body.  Each year a cohort of ten entering students is placed in common courses, including a pre-matriculation Bridge program and a first-semester seminar that addresses issues arising during the transition to college.  Structured mentoring, alternative pathways through the major requirements, and opportunities for undergraduate research and internships all play important roles in enhancing students' experiences both in and out of the classroom.  Susquehanna's commitment to the program is underscored by its willingness to provide continuing scholarship support after the first two years from university resources and by its support of faculty involvement in mentoring and special instruction.  Faculty development is offered through a Center for Teaching and Learning, which focuses its programming on topics of interest to faculty, in this case the instruction of students from hitherto underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Susquehanna University is a small (2.200 student) liberal arts college located in rural central Pennsylvania.   A major goal of recent strategic plans has been to increase the number of underrepresented students enrolled at Susquehanna, and we have achieved success towards this goal in the past 5 years.  However, the retention of underrepresented students in the biology major has lagged behind that of majority students; prior to receiving the award, the overall retention rate in the major averaged 54%, but the retention rate for underrepresented students was 26%.  In order to address this gap, Susquehanna University's Biology Department received an NSF S-STEM grant in 2012 (Broadening Intensive Opportunities for Scholarship; BIOS) to create a program that provided scholarship support for academically qualified, financially needy undergraduates, with the aim of increasing persistence to graduation. Students accepted into the program were predominately students of color, first generation students, or women, and many students represented several of these identity markers.  Three cohorts of 10 or 11 students (32 total) were recruited over 3 years, and granted four-year scholarships. The BIOS S-STEM grant funded each cohort?s scholarships for the first 2 years, and Susquehanna University funded the remaining 2 years.
