<AbstractNarration>The UC - Denver IT Catalyst project will acquire and analyze baseline faculty data as a mechanism for preparing the institution for transformation to comprehensively support women faculty in the STEM disciplines.  Because women are underrepresented among STEM faculty, especially at the rank of Full Professor, this project will conduct both quantitative and qualitative assessments of the status of women in science at UCD, focusing on the STEM disciplines but also including the social and behavioral sciences.  Specifically, this project will address three specific aims: 1) Acquire and analyze qualitative and quantitative baseline data regarding the current status of women faculty in STEM+ departments at UC Denver, 2) Gather information about best practices, lessons learned, pitfalls, and progress from ADVANCE-IT recipient institutions and other established and successful programs supporting women in STEM+ disciplines, and 3) Use the information gathered in Specific Aims 1 and 2 to develop a cooperative plan with the campus administration for institutional transformation that supports women faculty in STEM disciplines throughout their careers at UC Denver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The UC Denver IT Catalyst project will shed light on the degree to which University policies and work/life issues affect professional outcomes for women faculty using an emperically-based foundation.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project has potential to positively impact retention and advancement at other Colorado colleges and Universities and other campuses in the CUSystem, particularly the medical school with which this regional campus as most recently become associated.  An important component of the project includes dissemination of findings and plans to the larger academic and scientific community through national meetings and conferences.  Also, it is anticipated that an institutional transformation plan will be beneficial for all UCD faculty, students and staff and can be a model for other similar institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ADVANCE is an NSF-funded grant program with the goal of developing systemic approaches to increase the representation and advancement of women in academic STEM careers, thereby contributing to the development of a more diverse science and engineering workforce.  ADVANCE also has as its goal to seminally contribute to and inform the general knowledge base on gender equity in the academic STEM disciplines.  The University of Colorado Denver (CU Denver), a comprehensive campus in a diverse urban community, was awarded funding for its first ADVANCE project in the Fall of 2010. This ADVANCE IT-Catalyst funding opportunity is designed to support institutions in their efforts to conduct institutional self-assessment activities (data collection, data analysis, policy review) in order to identify specific issues in the recruitment, retention and promotion of women faculty in STEM disciplines. This area of work is considered fundamental for all institutions of higher education that plan to undertake institutional transformation.  Throughout the course of the ADVANCE-IT Catalyst grant at CU Denver, the focus has been to identify any systematic gender differences in and relationships between appointments, rank, pay and productivity and to determine factors that directly relate to faculty satisfaction at various ranks and disciplines, particularly for women.  Funding for this project has provided resources to gather data from STEM, STEM-plus (other integrated science fields supported by NSF) and non-STEM fields from ADVANCE generated climate surveys, analyses of institutional research data, annual productivity reports, interviews and feedback from institutional discussions.  To this end, quantitative and qualitative data have been collected to gain an understanding of the University?s strengths and challenges in fostering career growth among women faculty. Funding from the NSF has contributed to the collection of data from a campus-wide climate survey and interviews with faculty.

The results of this project will also serve to inform administrators and faculty who assume leadership positions to continue to explore avenues to promote female faculty and student success.  Visible female role models in STEM research, education, administration and leadership positions are vital to promote STEM careers among female students.
