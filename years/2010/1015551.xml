<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Advances in tissue engineering have led to the development of numerous new biomaterials. Among these are calcium phosphate ceramics, used in bone tissue regeneration for healing of large bone voids due to trauma or disease. These biodegradable materials are compositionally similar to natural bone and thus integrate easily with developing or healing tissue. While these bone biomaterials are useful for bridging critical-sized defects, which are gaps in the bone tissue too large to heal without surgical intervention, it could be possible to enhance them further to promote new vessel formation and subsequently faster tissue recovery. In order to accomplish this task, growth factors or living cells can be attached to the ceramic before implantation.
