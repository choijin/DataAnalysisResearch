<AbstractNarration>Recent advances in technology have made the design of parallel computers with thousands of processors more feasible.  Consequently, the study of different networks for linking processors is an integral part of the design of high-performance computers.  This project will study the interconnection topologies of three important families of networks from the point of view of network efficiency.  Examples of the type of problems to be considered include:  algorithms for efficient communication among processors; effective placement of scarce or otherwise limited resources; and fault-tolerant communication algorithms in the presence of node/link failures. In addition to facilitating graduate training, the project would provide detailed insight for understanding various tradeoffs in designing interconnection networks for large multiprocessor architectures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In parallel computing systems , nterconnection networks prescribe how to connect different computers that must communicate with each other.    Since quick and efficient communication is desirable and some of these systems are very large, the method used to connect these nodes of the system is very important.  This method of connecting these nodes is called the topology of the network.    In this project we investigated two relatively new networks whose design is based on two structures of numbers studied in algebraic number theory called the Gaussian numbers and the Eisenstein-Jacobi numbers.  These networks show strong potential for efficient communication. For instance, there is a Gaussian network with about 900 nodes in which every node has four neighbors and every two nodes are within 20 degrees of separation.   Among our results is recognizing a good way to address the nodes, which we then use to design some algorithms for efficient communication between nodes.   During this time we have published seven journal papers and one conference proceedings.  We are both honored to be teachers as well as researchers.  Part of the award money was used to support three undergraduate students, two of which are successfully studying in graduate school while the the third student is working at Microsoft.  The grant has helped to support a PhD student in computer science whom we co-advise and who is close to graduation .  In addition to this student, during this time we both have advised other graduate students in our respective departments.
