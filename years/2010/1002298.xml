<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to reverse-engineer human spatial control skills, with the goal of bridging the gap between human and autonomous systems. Adaptive and versatile spatial control capabilities are essential to successfully deploying unmanned aerial vehicles and other applications of autonomous control. understanding how humans achieve these skills is also important for the design of man-machine systems, such as active safety systems for helicopters or even tele-surgery systems. The research approach combines psycho-behavioral experiments and the application of control-theoretic principles. The working hypothesis is that human spatial behavior is determined by combining a type of model predictive control (MPC) process and a spatial value function (SVF). The MPC process describes how a trajectory is generated online,based on the immediate sensed environment; the SVF describes how the global environment and task elements are encoded and used in the MPC process. This model will then be used to study how the pilot adapts his/her strategies in the presence of disturbances, environment ncertainties, or when presented with novel ituations. Deliverables include the details of the odeling framework, documentation of research results, and outcomes of interdisciplinary student education and research experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will lead to developing new algorithms to model and replicate human daptability in spatial control tasks, paving the way for novel technologies for autonomous vehicle ontrol with unprecedented performance and adaptability. The improved understanding of human uidance skills will provide a gateway to new operator interfaces, augmenting human unctionality, effectiveness, and safety. Furthermore, the modeling framework will provide&lt;br/&gt;foundations for neurological studies, aimed at understanding the brain?s implementation of the patial control processes. Finally, the proposed interdisciplinary research activities will promote ew teaching and outreach activities, while attracting students from diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
