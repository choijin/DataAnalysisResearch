<AbstractNarration>This research investigates the usability of a number of remote voting platforms that are among the most viable candidates for fielding as states begin to consider the implementation of remote voting. The main focus of these usability studies is on the use of impoverished-display handheld mobile computers (i.e. smartphones) and traditional landline telephony interfaces delivered using interactive voice response systems, although vote-by-mail, kiosk, personal PC and hybrid systems are also being studied. Usability is being measured using the usability metrics outlined in ISO 9241-11 (effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction) in order to establish usability baselines for these kinds of remote voting technologies and allow for direct comparisons to usability metrics that have been established for current precinct-based voting systems. This investigation is also aimed at gaining an understanding of the human factors issues that might impact the ability of voters to accurately and successfully cast their ballots with these potential new platforms.  Results from these studies will play an important role in helping voting officials make better informed decisions about the kinds of technologies to consider and the attendant human factors issues as states begin to legislate the adoption of remote voting.</AbstractNarration>
