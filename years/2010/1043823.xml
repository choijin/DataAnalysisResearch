<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop resources for STEM learning by &lt;br/&gt;redesigning and expanding the "Jonathan Bird's Blue World" website; adding &lt;br/&gt;components to enable teachers and students to search episodes for specific &lt;br/&gt;themes, locations, or scientific concepts; and enhancing the lesson plans to &lt;br/&gt;explicitly match the content standards for teaching science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major objectives is to make the "Jonathan Bird's Blue World" web &lt;br/&gt;site content more widely accessible as an open source via an internet &lt;br/&gt;connection with a dynamic search capability. The project adds a significant &lt;br/&gt;amount of educational material and uses ocean topics to illustrate nationally &lt;br/&gt;accepted standards for science learning. It is applicable to both formal and &lt;br/&gt;informal environments and contains a multi-faceted approach to achieve its &lt;br/&gt;goal including the following objectives: (a) build a web site search &lt;br/&gt;capability that includes National Science Educational Standards&lt;br/&gt;(NSES) and Ocean Literacy Principles with a link to segments illustrating &lt;br/&gt;specific NSES; (b) create webisodes that feature specific NSES and develop an &lt;br/&gt;interactive map on the web site; (c) create a user survey tool and outreach for &lt;br/&gt;these improvements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By partnering with researchers and educators to incorporate nationally &lt;br/&gt;accepted standards for science learning into the website redesign, the project &lt;br/&gt;has a broad impact on professional development for teachers. It has the &lt;br/&gt;potential to reach diverse audiences in schools, homes and afterschool &lt;br/&gt;programs. "Jonathan Bird's Blue World" is designed to complement other &lt;br/&gt;educational materials and provide a useful resource for teachers everywhere, &lt;br/&gt;improving public scientific literacy in informal and formal settings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Oceanic Research Group (ORG) proposed a 15-month National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to develop and study resources for STEM learning with the Jonathan Bird's Blue World (JBBW) website. Goals included: (1) adding components to enable teachers and students to search episodes for specific themes, locations, scientific concepts, National Science Educational Standard (NSES), and geography; (2) creating web segments about specific NSES; (3) developing in-depth lesson plans aligned to the NSES; (4) creating a NSES topic page; (5) developing a user feedback survey and (6) adding these resources to the National Science Digital Library.   ORG worked with partners: ORG Educational Advisory Board, Goodwin Youth Web &amp; Interactive Group (website design) and Concord Evaluation Group (external evaluation) to design, implement and study this online educational resource that utilizes ocean topics to illustrate nationally accepted standards for science learning and is applicable to both formal and informal environments.   The project goals were attained and added a significant amount of educational material to the National Science Digital Library.  Intellectual Merit:  This project fosters an interest in science and STEM concepts utilizing the adventure and ocean topic content of Jonathan BirdÆs Blue World aligned to nationally accepted standards for science learning.  The webisodes feature themes of oceanography, marine biology, environmental science, and ecology. The lessons learned in the episodes can be expanded upon to include discussion on many related aspects of science: biotechnology, ocean engineering, paleontology, or marine geology.   JBBW helps facilitate discourse among students in varying levels of science education by encouraging them to employ critical thinking skills.    Broader Impact:  This project offers the benefits of furthering the understanding of science and ocean literacy and enhancing traditional learning models by providing activities that can be integrated into the teaching of science, math, and engineering at all educational levels.  By partnering with educators to incorporate nationally accepted standards for science learning into all aspects of the website redesign, JBBW improves K-12 STEM education resources.  There are no limitations for distribution with an internet outlet. This project has the potential to reach diverse audiences in schools, homes and afterschool programs.  The JBBW website is designed to complement other educational materials and provide a useful resource for educators everywhere, improving public scientific literacy.  The main accomplishments of this project are:  Creating Web segments about specific NSES: Web segments, specifically designed to illustrate National Science Education Standards, were created from footage filmed for Seasons 1 &amp; 2 of the Jonathan Bird's Blue World public television series.  ORG was able to create 6 web segments to correspond to the NSES. Lesson Plans for Web segments:  The ORG Educational Advisory Board developed 15 in-depth lesson plans as a resource for educators teaching the NSES and they are now available online in PDF format for free download at www. blueworldTV.com  Building a dynamic, categorized, searchable and search engine optimized video gallery engine. Creating an interactive map: The map offers the ability to navigate the growing list of the geographic locations of web segments. Selecting points or locations on the world map allows users to select those web segments from that location, brings up a geographic descriptions and an associated image. This map feature allows JBBW to visually incorporate geography and organize the content of the web site in a global context.   Creation of a quiz for social media followers that educates and directs them back to the website resources. Creation of the JBBW National Science Digital Library collection:  The JBBW collection at NSDL includes all material from Seasons 1 and 2 and provides links to th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
