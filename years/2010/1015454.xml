<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of my NSF East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes research was to determine the rate that soil is produced from bedrock in the Southern Alps of New Zealand.  Soil production rates were compared against erosion rates to determine the degree that soil formation contributes to the erosion of bedrock in the Southern Alps, which are one of the most rapidly eroding mountain ranges on Earth.  I collected 24 soil samples and stream sediment from five watersheds in the western Southern Alps.  The isotope beryllium-10 will be measured in soil and in stream sediment to determine millennial-scale soil production and erosion rates, respectively.  The transformation of rock into soil is an important geological process, because soil is fundamentally important to life on earth.  However, the rate that soil is produced from bedrock is known for only a few locations.  Little is known about soil production rates in mountainous regions, where the breakdown of rock into soil generates material that is prone to erosion by landslides.  Soil landslides are a major natural hazard in mountainous regions and are ubiquitous in the Southern Alps.  However, the contribution of soil formation and soil landslides to the erosion of the mountains is unknown.    My host scientist in New Zealand was Dr. Peter Almond and I also collaborated with PhD students Andre Eger and Brendon Malcolm, all whom are members of the Department of Soil and Physical Sciences at Lincoln University.  Dr. Almond is an expert on soil formation and hillslope erosion with considerable experience in the Southern Alps.  Our processing of the soil and sediment samples to extract beryllium-10 is ongoing. Our results are expected to yield some of the first soil production rates and whole-catchment erosion rates for the western Southern Alps.  The soil production and erosion rates will be compared against rates of tectonic rock uplift to determine the degree erosion and tectonics are linked in this landscape.  Please see future addenda to this report for updates on our findings.       Last Modified: 06/13/2011       Submitted by: Isaac J Larsen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
