<AbstractNarration>This project--led by science educators at Michigan State University, the National Geographic Society, the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL) at Colorado State University, the Berkeley Evaluation and Assessment Research (BEAR) Center, and AAAS Project 2061, and including schools in California, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, and Washington--builds on prior efforts with learning progressions, and is focused on key carbon-transforming processes in socio-ecological systems at multiple scales, including cellular and organismal metabolism, ecosystem energetics and carbon cycling, carbon sequestration, and combustion of fossil fuels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses an iterative design research process to develop and refine a suite of tools for reasoning and test efficacy of those tools in geographically and culturally diverse schools.  The project team is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1. Refining and validating a detailed learning progression framework covering the middle and high school years; ultimately, the framework will describe the development of students' capacity to use fundamental principles such as conservation of matter and energy to reason about carbon-transforming processes at multiple scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2. Refining 'Tools for Reasoning' that make hidden scientific principles - matter, energy, and scale - visible to students; the power of these tools lies in their flexible use for different processes, systems, scales, and curricular contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3. Developing and refining flexible teaching strategies that engage students in cognitive apprenticeship in the practices of environmental science literacy: a) inquiry and argumentation, b) explanations and predictions, and c) decision-making about environmental issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4. Using and refining existing summative assessments, and developing and testing formative assessment tools; these assessment tools will provide teachers and researchers with immediate information about their students' intellectual resources and will be linked to the learning progression framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     5. Developing, field testing, and assessing the effectiveness of six middle school and six high school units that use project tools and enact project principles; the units introduce students to fundamental principles, engage them in reasoning about carbon-transforming processes at organismal scale, and at landscape and global scales.  Each unit includes a) an online formative assessment and b) activity sequences that use tools for reasoning and teaching strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     6. Developing, field testing, and assessing professional development materials in both face-to-face and facilitated online forms; the materials introduce teachers to learning progressions in environmental science literacy, assessment tools, tools for reasoning, teaching strategies, and teaching materials and activities, and also address difficulties that teachers encounter in using learning progressions and enacting teaching strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary project outcomes will be coordinated instructional tools that are useful to professionals at all levels in the science education system--classroom teachers, professional developers, and developers of curricula, standards and assessments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Carbon TIME 1 Final Outcomes Report Carbon TIME (DRL 1020187) is a design-based research project with both development and research goals.  Our research and development focused on key carbon-transforming processes in socio-ecological systems at multiple scales: Cellular and organismal metabolism in plants, animals, and decomposers; energy flow and carbon cycling at ecosystem and global scales; carbon sequestration; and combustion of fossil fuels.  The current imbalance among these processes is a primary driver of global climate change. Understanding these processes involves interdisciplinary reasoning that encompasses all three dimensions of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  In particular, our work has focused on:  Three key practices: interpreting and analyzing data, engaging in arguments from evidence, and constructing explanations.  Two crosscutting concepts: systems and system models, and energy and matter: flows cycles, and conservation. Disciplinary core ideas in the life sciences (LS 1: From molecules to organisms: Structures and processes; LS 2: Ecosystems: Interactions, energy, and dynamics), Earth sciences (ESS 2: Earth?s systems; ESS 3: Earth and human activity), and physical sciences (PS 1: Matter and its interactions; PS 3: Energy)  Development activities and products: The full suite of Carbon TIME resources is available through the BSCS website (http://carbontime.bscs.org/).  The key components are a series of six teaching units (Systems and Scale, Plants, Animals, Decomposers, Ecosystems, Human Energy Systems) and an online assessment system that teachers can use for formative assessments and grading and that we used for research purposes.  Versions of all six teaching units and accompanying assessments were developed and field tested during the 2011-2 school year, then revised and feld tested again in 2012-3 and 2013-4.  A total of 93 teachers in 11 states participated in the field testing.  Research activities and products: We have completed analyses of over 7300 full baseline tests, pretests, and posttests.  These analyses, plus the interview data, provided the primary data source for a summary report (available on the Carbon TIME website).  The report (a) provides analyses of multiple forms of evidence for the validity of the Carbon TIME assessments as monitoring assessments, useful for comparing students, teachers, and programs, (b) provides strong evidence for the superior effectiveness of Carbon TIME units in teaching explanations of carbon cycling processes, and (c) develops principles for item construction and scoring.  We published an article describing a learning progression framework for students? conceptions of energy, as well as other articles describing advances in our learning progression research.  We have made substantial progress toward the development of a robust learning progression framework for students? inquiry and arguments from evidence.  Finally, we used classroom video to investigate and compare teaching practices in different classrooms and their effects on student learning. The advent of NGSS will make it necessary for state and local education agencies to revise their curricula and to provide professional support for teachers who must master new teaching practices.  By combining high quality curriculum materials and assessments based on learning progression research with high quality professional development, this project offers a proof of concept&mdash;a visible demonstration of how these essential elements of successful reform can work together&mdash;as well as a foundation for the development of future resources for responsive and rigorous science teaching.
