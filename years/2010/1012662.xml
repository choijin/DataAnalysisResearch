<AbstractNarration>Lionel (Bill) Poirier of Texas Tech University is supported by an award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division  to develop and test  massively parallel high performance computing codes that enable exact quantum dynamics (QD) rovibrational spectroscopy calculations for larger and more challenging molecular applications than are currently possible. The award is co-funded by a pilot program in OCI promoting the reuse of Cyberinfrastructure (CI) elements.  This capability is valuable for various dynamical, kinetic, and statistical modeling endeavors, for which accurate knowledge of  rovibrational states and  partition function of the molecular species involved is often vitally important. A novel feature of this research over previous quantum dynamics efforts is use of massive parallelization. Much of the requisite cyberinfrastructure, i.e., parallel linear algebra codes, developed by the PI previously, is already in place. To assess the performance, scalability, and broad applicability of the parallel codes, two extremely challenging, but very different, benchmark molecular applications are being considered, both well beyond the capabilities of the current state of the art in exact QD methods. The first is isomerization in neon clusters. The second is intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer in malonaldehyde, as a prototype for proton transfer in intermediate-barrier enzyme catalysis, and more complex biological systems. The scale of the proposed calculations is designed to be adjustable, and will be varied up to the maximum capacity of the 1000-plus-core Chemistry Computation Cluster (CCC) available to the PI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his research group are devoting much effort to make their computer codes, and exact quantum dynamics in general, easier for "non experts" to use, by developing a user-friendly "front end".  They are also hosting training workshop at the Texas Tech (TTU) Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, for TTU, regional and other users. The parallelQD codes are being updated and disseminated through the CCC.  These software tools greatly extend the complexity of systems that can be studied quantum dynamically, while simultaneously cyber-enabling a broader cross section of the chemical dynamics community to perform such calculations on their own.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Motivation &amp; Background: To understand molecules accurately requires using the laws of quantum physics. Unfortunately, simulating the quantum behavior of molecules on a computer is very very difficult, even for molecules as small as three atoms. This is because for each atom added to the system, the computational (CPU) effort can increase 1000-fold or more. So just to go from three atoms (e.g. water, H2O) to five atoms (e.g. methane, CH4) could require one million times as much CPU effort.  If we are to have any hope of tackling larger molecules quantum mechanically, we must find a way to effectively scale up the calculation on massively parallel supercomputers--with thousands or even hundreds of thousands of CPU cores all working on the problem at the same time. This is an extremely difficult challenge, however, because all of the different pieces of a quantum calculation "talk" to each other, resulting in the need for intercore communication that slows things down.  Finally, and equally importantly, if other scientists are to benefit from any such new technology, then we must have a computer program that is easy for non-experts to use.   Project Outcome:  The goal of this research project is to effectively scale up accurate quantum dynamics calculations across the next generation of massively parallel supercomputers. Previous work by the Poirier group and others had achieved massive parallelization for model systems, but only very modest parallelization for real molecular applications. Early on in this NSF-funded research project (CHE-1012662), the Poirier group achieved a parallel speedup of 976x, across 1140 computer cores (85.6% parallel efficiency), for a quantum dynamical calculation of the HO2 molecule.  More recently, i.e. towards the end of this NSF research project, we extended the effective parallel scalability of quantum dynamics calculations up to over 7000 cores. What used to take months of computer time can now be done in seconds.   Also, what used to be impossible can now be achieved.  Recently, for instance, the Poirier group computed one million quantum states of benzene--a 12-atom molecule. This calculation far exceeds any quantum dynamics calculation that has ever previously been performed, both in terms of molecule size, and also the number of quantum states computed.   Finally, an easy-to-use, modular, standalone code called ScalIT was created, together with ample documentation. This code enables experts and non-experts alike to conduct massively parallel quantum dynamics calculations on their own, for important molecular applications of interest in a variety of scientific fields. A number of research groups around the world are currently doing exactly this.  Impact &amp; Benefits:   Molecular simulations enable computers to replace expensive, difficult, and time-consuming laboratory experiments, and are thus routinely used in many important application areas (e.g., energy, drug design, nanomaterials, etc).  However, very few of these simulations incorporate quantum dynamical effects, even though these are often very important, and so the results are not always reliably accurate.  Research related to the above project outcome could thus dramatically improve the accuracy, reliability and true predictive power of molecular simulations, which could help lead to major breakthroughs in the many areas where such simulations are used.  Further Explanation: Poirier and collaborators have been developing accurate, efficient quantum dynamics algorithms for over 20 years, with the recent emphasis being massive parallelization. This is extremely challenging work, but necessary, because quantum calculations require enormous CPU effort. The successes of this research project thus constitute a ground-breaking advance.  In 2013, the ScalIT codes and documention were released for public use, and have been made freely available to other scientific researchers ever since. The Poirier group has also trained other resea...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
