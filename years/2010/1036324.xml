<AbstractNarration>The project will apply a tested methodological approach--a multi-metric approach to assess the impact of STEM instructional multimedia on undergraduate teaching and learning-- to the subject matter of electronic health records (EHR). The project deploy three comprehensive multimedia case studies that introduce undergraduate STEM students to electronic health records and assess the effect of this approach on student learning, including impact on higher order cognitive skills. Three constructs and criteria will be used to assess students' actual learning: 1) Learning-Driven factor, 2) Content-Driven factor, and 3) Higher-Order Cognitive Skills factor. Three inter-related qualitative and quantitative matrices will be developed to assess students' perceived learning (Perceived Learning Matrix), actual learning (Actual Learning Outcome Matrix), and learning processes (Learning Process Matrix). The innovative multimedia instructional approach developed in this project is expected to give students first-hand observational experience of EHR operations and can be used to teach other information technology topics where visualization is very important as opposed to traditional text book lecture on emerging technology issues.</AbstractNarration>
