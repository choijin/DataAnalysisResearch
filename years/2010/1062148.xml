<AbstractNarration>This collaborative award is made to implement an innovative model for biodiversity networks and data sharing called VertNet (http://vertnet.org). Biodiversity is in a crisis caused by multiple human impacts on the environment, and documentation of spatial and temporal biodiversity changes is immediately and urgently needed in order to address this crisis. The community of vertebrate natural history collections has begun to meet this need by establishing social and technological infrastructures that provide open access to data describing planetary occurrences of biological specimens. Taxon-specific data sharing initiatives such as MaNIS, ORNIS, HerpNET and FishNet 2 currently provide, in total, over 85 million records documenting where vertebrates occur. Together these networks include 171 collections from 12 countries, with an additional 52 collections (20 countries) committed to participation. Already, they are accessed at a rate of nearly 2.5 million records per week.  Participation in each of these networks has far exceeded expectations, resulting in growing issues of scalability, performance, sustainability, and ability to incorporate new members. VertNet will solve these impediments by moving to a cloud computing solution in which providers and users synchronize changes to a cloud-based network of vertebrate biodiversity data. Cloud computing is a pay-per-use model utilizing internet-based, third party computing resources that are fast and dynamically scalable. The new VertNet model removes the requirement and cost to contributors to buy or maintain their own servers while leveraging all of the data integrity and replication services provided by the cloud. Under the new model, contributors will use a web-based administrative interface to create a "provider" in the cloud. Subsequent updates will use the same local application to publish differences (additions, changes, deletions) since initial publishing. Data storage in the cloud will contain the primary data published from all contributors as persistently and uniquely available records. In addition, it will contain summary information about data aggregations, and will incorporate data from other sources such as auxiliary data look-ups, user feedback, and data quality assessments. VertNet will provide open access to data with new capabilities for discovery and visualization, and will integrate with several existing biodiversity and collection management applications. Development of VertNet will transform the use of vertebrate biodiversity data for cross-disciplinary research, conservation, and policy-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four predecessor projects (MaNIS, ORNIS, HerpNET, FishNet 2) have built a strong tradition of biodiversity informatics training and community-building. VertNet will continue this tradition, with impacts extending beyond the funded institutions. Specifically, VertNet will engage students from across the United States in two Summer Internships in Biodiversity Informatics and two Workshops in Biodiversity Informatics. In addition, undergraduate students will be offered volunteer apprenticeships through existing programs at UC Berkeley. An additional workshop that involves the broader community will address strategies for long-term sustainability of digitization and data-sharing efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The documentation of global patterns of biodiversity change is an important first step toward a wise, sustainable policy of conservation and management in the face of a rapidly changing environment. These patterns also have enormous societal importance, as they are used to make informed decisions about urban development and economics.  Unfortunately, much of the legacy data used to set biodiversity baselines needed for global assessment and trend analysis are locked away in the cabinets of natural history collections and museums.  The NSF-funded VertNet project (http://www.vertnet.org/) has set out to make these biodiversity data more discoverable and accessible to researchers, policy-makers, and the general public to enable scientific exploration and enhance public knowledge.     Building on the success of four taxonomic-based data portals over the previous 10 years, VertNet worked to further four primary goals to; (1) facilitate open access to museum data on the web via a public web portal; (2) enhance the value of specimen collections through improvements in data quality; (3) conserve curatorial resources by eliminating barriers to participation; (4) to use a technical design that could be adapted easily by other disciplines with similar needs, and (5) lower the long term maintenance costs by orders of magnitude as a means to create sustainability for the community.   In particular, the CU Boulder team has: 1) Developed new tools to access VertNet using the widely used R statistical software package; 2) Provided value-add to the providers via date and use reporting statistics; 3) Helped troubleshoot and overcome limitations with the cloud-based system for accessing data that has been developed.     To date the VertNet project has published more than 167 million museum records from 87 institutions, representing 276 collections of biodiversity data.  More than 17 million of these records are available to the public via the VertNet data portal (http://vertnet.org/search).  All 167 million published records are available through the use of our partner organizations, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF,  http://www.gbif.org/) and more than nine million records are available through the NSFfunded iDigBio project (https://www.idigbio.org/).  VertNet continues to publish data based on strong demand from the biocollections community.  Currently, the complete list of VertNet data publishers (active and waiting) consists of 190 institutions representing 582 collections. Of these 65% have been, or are in the process of being, transitioned into the new VertNet portal, including 123 institutions and 458 collections. Another 67 institutions representing 124 collections remain to be completed. This includes the publication of 42 collections of non-vertebrate biodiversity data.     The VertNet project resulted in a number of successful collaborations.  The technical infrastructure has been well received by the biodiversity community and is currently being adapted for use by other data projects including the NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity funded Amazonia Biodiversity project, the joint JRS Foundation/ReBioMa Lemur project in Madagasar (http://www.rebioma.net/), and the new Diversity of the Indo-Pacific Network (http://indopacificnetwork.wikispaces.com/).  During the last four years, VertNet project team members have provided over 100 training and educational opportunities for more than 1500 biodiversity professionals, students, and the public around the world.  These include intensive training workshops in georeferencing, biodiversity informatics, and data publishing, webinars on data quality improvement and building technical infrastructure, and papers and presentation at professional conferences.     The project is now entering its next phase of effort, and will shift its focus to support the efforts of the iDigBio project while it continues to publish its current waiting list of US and internationally-based collections of ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
