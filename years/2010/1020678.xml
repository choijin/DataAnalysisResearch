<AbstractNarration>This project is a two-year engineering pathways study that is extending research findings from the NSF funded Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education's (CAEE's) Academic Pathways Study (APS).  The APS conducted a series of longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of undergraduate engineering students' learning experiences and their transition to the workplace.  In this project, the experiences of early career professionals (ECPs) are being studied in order to better understand what educational institutions and employers can do to facilitate the transition from engineering student to practicing engineering professional.  More specifically, the project is conducting a mixed-method study of two research questions:  (1) What factors or combinations of factors facilitate the transition of ECPs into a professional culture, and their conceptions of and preparation for their specific professional careers?  (2) How, and to what extent do the factors that influence the professional development of ECPs contribute to their future careers?  The proposed research is grounded in social cognitive career theory that has been shown to be a useful framework for exploring engineering career persistence.  The project includes a rigorous evaluation plan coordinated by an independent evaluator to monitor the progress of the project and to study evaluation research questions about the integration of the APS results and the impact of collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

A primary goal was to better understand how to prepare engineering students for successful transitions into engineering and related careers. There is relatively little known about engineering alumniÆs post-graduate career pathways. This studyÆs focus on a large number of alumni from multiple institutions resulted in a detailed view of the diverse range of contemporary graduates and their career plans. The project built on the success of an earlier study of engineering undergraduates. The U.S. continues to struggle to meet the workforce demand for domestically educated engineers, making it important to better understand the transition and relationship between education and professional life.  The studyÆs findings include a greater understanding of how co-curricular experiences in industry (e.g., via internships, co-ops, summer jobs) can complement the learning and development students get in school. Although undergraduate engineering programs are generally doing a good job preparing students for professional life, some might consider adjusting their emphasis on certain skills and knowledge. For instance, over 80% of surveyed alumni rated communication and teamwork as "Very important" or "Extremely important" in their current work, but programs vary in how extensively they prepare students with these skills. We also found evidence of the versatility of an engineering degree, with a substantial minority of alumni going on to non-engineering jobs after graduating.  Looking ahead, we have published many tools and processes developed for this study, with the expectation that they can be valuable for expanded research on alumni in engineering or in other fields/professions.
