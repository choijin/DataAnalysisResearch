<AbstractNarration>The field of surface engineering is an emerging one with multiple areas of active research. There have been major advances in understanding the technology and its application to corrosion-resistant alloys. The International Symposium on Surface Hardening of Corrosion Resistant Alloys will be held May 25-26 on the campus of CWRU. This event serves as a "state of the art" meeting, bringing together researchers from universities, industries, and government agencies all over the world, as well as providers and end users of low-temperature surface hardening techniques. The technical program will explore the emerging technology of surface engineering. The research community, suppliers and end users of low temperature processes (gas, vacuum, ion and plasma processes) for surface enhancement of corrosion resistant alloys by interstitial hardening (carburizing, nitriding, nitrocarburizing) will benefit. The program includes domestic speakers and speakers from several countries in Europe as well as China and Japan. This project will support the attendance of graduate students and some of the domestic speakers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for Award 1042597     "Partial Support for an International Symposium   on Surface Hardening of Corrosion Resistant Alloys"        A. H. Heuer  Department of Materials Science and Engineering  Case Western Reserve University  Cleveland, Ohio  44106-7204                    During the past decade, it has become increasingly clear that corrosion-resistant stainless steels and nickel-base alloys can have their mechanical and electrochemical properties markedly enhanced by a variety of surface hardening processes.                 A very successful meeting devoted to surface hardening of stainless steels had been held at Case Western Reserve University, October 22-23, 2007.  (The Proceedings of this Symposium were published in the August Materials Transactions, Vol. 40A, No. 8, pages 1767-1810.)  At that time, there was a general consensus that a second follow-on meeting with a slightly expanded subject matter was desirable.                            Accordingly,  a second meeting entitled "International Symposium on Surface Hardening of Corrosion Resistant Alloys" was held May 25-26, 2010, again on the Case Western Reserve University campus.                 This recent symposium was quite successful, attracting nearly 100 participants, including 17 U.S. graduate students in Materials Science.  The small NSF Award was devoted entirely to support graduate student participation in the Symposium.  At the Symposium Dinner, a lecture entitled "Esthetics and Metallurgy of the Japanese Sword" provided an interesting contrast with the surface hardening/corrosion resistance theme of the Symposium.
