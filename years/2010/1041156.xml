<AbstractNarration>ECCS-1041156&lt;br/&gt;Dennis Chamot, National Academies&lt;br/&gt;Harnessing Light: Capitalizing on Optical Science Trends &amp; Challenges for Future Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Academy of Sciences will conduct an 18-month study Harnessing Light: Capitalizing on Optical Science Trends and Challenges for Future Research. The study will be conducted by the Board on Manufacturing and Engineering Design in collaboration with the Board on Science, Technology and Economic Policy. The National Research Council will appoint a committee to review the developments in optical science and technology since the 1998 Harnessing Light report and make recommendations for ways in which to capitalize on these advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This activity would build on the work done in 1998 and address the role photonics plays in national competitiveness and innovation. The new study would identify national strengths and weaknesses in relation to current and future needs including economic impact, workforce needs, and future research directions, and would consider the technology areas where optics is an enabler that can dramatically impact the economy of the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Optical science and engineering is headed toward another strong growth period, driven by developments in advanced materials, solid-state lighting, solar technologies, sensors, lasers, imaging, fiber-optic communications, digital photography, diagnostic medicine, computing/processing, and consumer displays/TVs. The impacted markets encompass critical issues that affect society, ranging from energy, data storage, and healthcare to manufacturing, communications, and security.</AbstractNarration>
