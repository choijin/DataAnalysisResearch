<AbstractNarration>Once a science focused on organisms and their ecosystems, ecology now spans the study of individual molecules to the entire biosphere.  This Ecological Society of America organized project is supporting an initial workshop to address the need in the ecology community to develop digital materials that are available to teach ecology at the undergraduate level.  The workshop is bringing together research scientists, faculty and technology experts to: 1) identify strategies and technologies to lower barriers that hinder, and develop incentives that will accelerate, contributions to and usage of the EcoEd DL resources; 2) establish and coordinate strategic partnerships among scientists (as potential providers of resources), and educators with their students in a wide variety of settings (as both potential contributors and users) to achieve intellectual sustainability; and 3) outline strategies for the financial sustainability of EcoEd DL to ensure site maintenance and anticipate the next generation of technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     From March 18-21, 2010, 32 researchers, educators, technology experts, and students convened in Washington, D.C. at the AAAS headquarters to generate ideas on how to accelerate the introduction of leading edge ecology into the undergraduate classroom. Our goal was to support outstanding undergraduate ecology education by encouraging the  submission of readily accessible, up-to-date ecological data, findings and visual resources for teaching in ecology courses and introductory biology that will equip learners with 21st century ecological knowledge and skills. Toward this end, ESA established its EcoEd Digital Library in 2001 and now sought to clarify its role and explore the opportunities made available through technological advances.      While there has been much discussion, integrating ecological research and education continues to be a challenge. The workshop directly confronted this situation by bringing together prominent ecologists and educators from diverse institutional settings to think about educational needs and requirements that can be facilitated with new online tools.     To inform the workshop, ESA also conducted a survey of its members in March 2010.  I. KEY FINDINGS OF MARCH 2010 SURVEY      The survey (N=419) revealed that while an overwhelming 87.6% majority agreed that ecology researchers have a responsibility to share their research findings for education purposes.     Other than lab exercises, almost half believed that it would only take between 1-4 hours to prepare simplified tables and charts, simplified datasets that students can analyze, as well as raw data that students can  process and analyze on their own. When asked how much time they felt they could devote to developing resources from their research that would be suitable for undergraduate ecology education, 75% responded that they had at least 1 hour to spare per month and another 36% thought they could spare more than 5 hours per month.      About 2/3 of respondents indicated that the opportunity to partner with another faculty member would be most helpful to make their research available to undergraduates. About half indicated interest in making research available for education as part of a structured professional or academic leadership program or in partnership with a research network or consortium.      Two major factors competing for researchers' availability is the time for administrative duties and pressing research as well as the perception that such activity will not be valued by their superiors.     Respondents were asked what might motivate them to make their research activities and results more readily available for undergraduate education. For 87% of respondents, satisfaction that students are learning important ecology concepts is important or very important. Slightly more than half indicated that recognition and reward for their educational endeavors are important or very important. About 47% of researchers indicated that  achieving broader impacts is important or very important.     When asked what the key components of an ESA-sponsored program should be to facilitate the development of educational materials based on their research, the top of the wish list were: identifying educational partners, offering web resources on effective education research, and creating a community of researchers and educators.     This survey showed evidence that ESA can play a big role in creating communities and partnerships among faculty who see value in sharing and/or using research in a form suitable for undergraduate ecology education.  II. KEY FINDINGS FROM THE WORKSHOP     Participants highlighted the potential for EcoEdDL to serve as a hub for learning communities and the important role of research data in a 21st century ecology education. In particular, they emphasized the need for:   a strong core repository of high quality resources on a variety of topics, including resources to teach analytical skills and  flexible,adaptable value-ad...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
