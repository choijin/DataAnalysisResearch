<AbstractNarration>This project will enhance student problem-solving ability in Statics and Mechanics of Materials by creating and delivering a new set of ill-structured problem modules.  These problems will be open-ended, require students to formulate assumptions that are implicitly given, and/or anticipate ideas at that stretch across the boundary of the given course material.  Students will engage in design or design-like exercises and use modern simulation tools as they approach such problems efficiently and maturely.  Research conducted will determine the pedagogical efficacy of ill-structured problem-solving, including the development of declarative, procedural, and conceptual knowledge. This will be achieved by creating an experimental cohort of students who will receive instruction with new modules, and evaluating the cohort's performance (in comparison with a control group) on various academic instruments and responses to questionnaires.  New modules will be developed to teach fundamental topics in Statics and Mechanics of Materials. Topics for the modules will be developed via a modified Delphi process in which experts in mechanics education will recommend topics of greatest importance. These tools will be assessed, along with learning gains of students who use them. In particular, the research design for this project makes use of tracking student performance along a "curricular strand" of four consecutive courses in order that retention and transfer of skills can be measured longitudinally. This project will take place at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag√ºez, where more than 99% of students are Hispanic and speak Spanish as their native language, and 32% of undergraduates in the College of Engineering are female (a rate which significantly exceeds the national average). In addition, recruitment of experts for the Delphi process will ensure that a meaningful number of participants are from Hispanic-serving institutions, and the new modules developed in this project will be available in both English and Spanish. Therefore, this project will engage underrepresented minorities (Hispanics) and women both through the direct participants in this project, as well as by reaching potential future users of the products developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project Leveraging Simulation Tools to Deliver Ill-Structured Problems: Enhancing Student Problem-Solving Ability in Statics and Mechanics of Materials advanced undergraduate instruction in mechanics by integrating the use of simulation tools in the foundational courses Statics and Mechanics of Materials as a means to approach elementary design questions while at the same time developing simulation as an explicity competency.

Intellectual Merit.  Over the course of the project, several simulation-based modules were developed for the courses in Statics and Mechanics of Materials, using platforms such as Excel (a spreadsheet), Matlab (a scientific computing software), and SAP2000 (an advanced structural analysis software with user interface).  These modules introduced elements of engineering design codes and open-ended questions as applied to problems related to structural engineering.  Examples chosen were the design of steel pipes and box beams for structures such as billboard signposts and platforms.  Typical textbook problems were also adapted to include "what if" secenarios so that students can see the effect of changing certain input assumptions.  The assessment undertaken by our project demonstrated that this approach improved students ability to handle problems of increased complexity, but that it did not necessarily improve their facility with the most elementary concepts.  Broader Impacts.  This project was implemented at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag&uuml;ez, which is a Hispanic-serving, bilingual, public institution.  The materials developed in this project are deployed in both English and Spanish, enabling a broad appeal to a wide audience of students and instructors.  Also, some of the design projects, by their nature, engaged students in broader social questions related to cost, aesthetics, and social good.  Students exposed to this project therefore have developed a wider view of engineering design beyond the solution of idealized textbook problems that have little realistic design context.
