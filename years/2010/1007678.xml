<AbstractNarration>The investigators study statistical analysis of multinomial counts with a&lt;br/&gt;large number K of categories and a small number n of sample size. This&lt;br/&gt;"large K and small n" problem is a very challenging problem that requires thinking about statistical inference at a fundamental level. Employing an auxiliary data-generating approach to reason directly toward probabilistic inference , the PIs develop methods that are probabilistic and have desirable frequency properties. A sequence of topics to be investigated include 1) one-sample and two-sample "large K and small n" multinomial inference; 2) large-scale simultaneous hypothesis testing; 3) application in genome-wide association study; and 4) associated efficient computational methods.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The "large K and small n" multinomial inference is motivated by genome-wide&lt;br/&gt;association studies with a large number of genotypes from single&lt;br/&gt;nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data. SNPs are major genetic variants that may&lt;br/&gt;associate with common diseases such as cancer and heart disease. With new &lt;br/&gt;statistical methods and computing software to be developed in the project, the&lt;br/&gt;research is expected to generate useful tools for applied statisticians and&lt;br/&gt;scientists who are challenged by very-high-dimensional count data.</AbstractNarration>

Research on inference with large-scale multinomial models requires thinking about statistical inference at a very fundamental level and looking for novel ideas beyond the current two dominant schools of thought, the frequentist and Bayesian.  As a promising alternative to existing schools of thought on statistical inference, the IM framework has been recently proposed by Zhang and Liu (2011) and Martin and Liu (2013, 2014a,b).

It is expected that the above research on a new way of multinomial inference will motivate researchers to think deeply about realistic assessment of uncertainty in practice for scientific discoveries.
