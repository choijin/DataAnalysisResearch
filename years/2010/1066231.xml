<AbstractNarration>1066231&lt;br/&gt;Shohet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plasma exposure, although often required for processing materials, has the potential to damage these materials so significantly that microfabricated devices will fail. This, project, conducted jointly between the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Stanford University, investigates the nature of charging and defect formation in dielectrics during plasma exposure and explores several methods to cure these potentially damaging effects. The goal of this project is to optimize the plasma conditions and processing methodologies in order to minimize the damaging effects. The plasma creates damage from the bombardment of photons, charged particles and free-radicals. In the past, it has not been possible to separate the plasma-induced damage effects from charged particle and photon bombardment during plasma processing. Furthermore, it has not been possible to measure the magnitude and distribution of charge outward from a dielectric-substrate and/or a dielectric-dielectric boundary, using conventional techniques such as surface-potential measurements. To measure the spatial charge distribution, a measurement technique using pulsed electroacoustic excitation of mechanical vibrations in dielectrics is implemented. This has the potential of fundamentally transforming how charge accumulation is measured in nanoscale dielectric films. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the optimization of the plasma conditions to minimize damage of the dielectrics, damage-curing methods will be directly linked into the processing steps. A controllable and functional processing/curing plasma reactor will be developed. Conventional post-processing curing will be replaced by an in-situ curing methodology that makes the processing more efficient and cost less. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unpatterned dielectric-semiconductor layers are evaluated for charge accumulation with surface potential and capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics, defect-state formation with vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopy and electron-spin resonance (ESR), observe modifications of bonding structures with Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy, surface morphology with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and physical changes with ellipsometry and nanoindentation. The proposal investigates the nature of the defects produced during processing and their effect on dielectric charging. Methods such as VUV/UV curing for low dielectric constant materials and annealing for high dielectric constant materials will be implemented during processing to minimize processing-induced damage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The ability to combine, in a single cross-disciplinary project, the required expertise in plasma processing and damage diagnostics, optimization of the processing conditions, separation of the processing-induced damage effects, accurate measurements of charge distributions stored in electronic materials, and the development of a predictive model will result in a determination of the conditions that will permit design and fabrication of new dielectric materials that are damage-free and highly-resistant to processing damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project, being cross-disciplinary and multi-institutional, will result in a number of unique aspects. A connection between materials science, plasma science, chemistry and electrical engineering is a key feature. This impacts courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and allows key roles to be played in the project by undergrad and grad students from a variety of disciplines. Providing presentations to multiple student groups, the direct involvement of a local community college, along with high school science teachers and their students will extend the project well beyond its specific goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report Grant CBET-1066231 PI: J. Leon Shohet, University of Wisconsin-Madison Co-PI: Yoshio Nishi, Stanford University   This is a joint project between UW-Madison and Stanford University to investigate the nature of charging and defect formation in dielectrics during plasma exposure and corresponding curing methods. The goal of this project is to optimize the plasma conditions and processing methodologies in order to minimize the dielectric charging and defect concentrations. In the past, it has not been possible to separate the plasma-induced damage effects due to charged particle and photon bombardment during plasma processing. Also, it has not been possible to measure the magnitude and distribution of charge outward from a dielectric/substrate and/or a dielectric/dielectric boundary, using conventional techniques such as surface-potential measurements.  We have shown that without direct measurements of both plasma and material properties, the relationship between charge accumulation and plasma parameters cannot be found. We used several types of industrially relevant plasma systems including electron-cyclotron resonance, parallel-plate and slot-plate antenna reactors. A capillary-array window is used to separate the charging mechanisms from charged-particle, photon, and radical bombardment, Both high-k and low-k dielectrics will be investigated. To measure the spatial charge distribution, we developed pulsed electroacoustic excitation of mechanical vibrations in dielectrics that we call charge tomography.  We have optimized the plasma conditions such as pressure control, power control, ion and photon flux measurements, as a function of the plasma gas. High pressures up to 1 Torr and low pressures down to 5 mTorr were examined. Optimized power settings will be found. Ion and photon fluxes will be measured with in-situ probe diagnostics and a portable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) monochromator. Plasma pretreatment effects with ambient gases will be investigated. We have examinaed the processing response of dielectrics used as electronic materials. We evaluated unpatterned dielectric-semiconductor layers for charge accumulation with surface potential and capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics, defect-state formation with VUV spectroscopy and electron-spin resonance (ESR), observe modifications of bonding structures with Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy, surface morphology with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and physical changes with ellipsometry and nanoindentation. We investigated the nature of the defects produced during processing and their effect on dielectric charging.              Methods such as UV curing for low-k dielectrics and annealing for high-k dielectrics were implemented to minimize processing-induced damage.     Some Specific Outcomes:  A new nonthermal UV/VUV curing process for      low-k porous dielectrics has been developed.   In addition, by implanting cesium in such      dielectrics, preservation of the low-k dielectric properties and increased      mechanical strength has been found.   The Schottky barrier at the low-k SiOC:H/Cu      interface has been measured. Free radicals have been detected using a      flurophore that are emitted from a processing plasma.  This permits the observation of radical      flux passing through thin films so that their absorptivity can be      measured.   Defect-induced band-gap narrowing the low-k      dielectrics has been measured. Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown has been      measured after VUV exposure of low-k dielectrics to observe the deterioration      of this property as a function of VUV photon energy.  It was found that mercury probe      measurements give unreliable measurements of TDDB because of mercury      diffusion into the dielectric.    The effects of neutron and proton irradiation      on Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) have been measured showing that      proton irradiati...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
