<AbstractNarration>This project addresses a key problem in advancing the state of the art in cognitive assistant systems that can interact naturally with humans in order to help them perform everyday tasks more effectively. Such a system would help not only people with cognitive disabilities but all individuals as they perform complex tasks they are unfamiliar with. The research focuses on structured activities of daily living that lend themselves to practical experimentation, such as meal preparation and other kitchen activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the core focus of the research is activity recognition, i.e., systems that can identify the goals and individual actions a person is performing as they work on a task. Key innovations of this work are 1) that the activity models are learned from the user via intuitive natural demonstration, and 2) that the system is able to reason over activity models to generalize and adapt them. In contrast, current practice requires specialized training supervised by the researchers and supports no reasoning over the models. This advance is accomplished by integrating capabilities that are typically studied separately, including activity recognition, knowledge representation and reasoning, natural language understanding and machine learning. The work addresses a significant step towards the goal of building practical and flexible in-home automated assistants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We developed methods that enable a computer system to learn to recognize complex human activities from a combination of language and visual perception.  The work provides fundamental contributions to natural language processing and machine vision, and provides a foundation for creating computer systems that a person can interact with in a entirely natural manner - as one would interact with a human assistant.  Applications of the results include assistive technology that help people with cognitive disabilities perform complex activities. Part of our work created a robust framework for complex event recognition that is well-suited for integrating information that varies widely in detail and granularity. The system takes in a variety of information, including objects and gestures recognized by RGB-D and descriptions of events extracted from recognized and parsed speech, and outputs a complete reconstruction of the agent's plan, explaining actions in terms of more complex activities and filling in unobserved but necessary events.   We compared the results from low-level events recognized using just the vision subsystem, with low-level events recognized as a result of vision with complex event structure (Table 1, Right). We show that a significant improvement in recognition precision (64% to 87%) and recall (66% to 80%) occurs when structural and temporal information is used through the use of the complex event structure when recognizing highly-structured activities. Another system we created, LegionAR, provides robust, deployable activity recognition training online activity recognition systems with on-demand, real-time labeling using input through crowdsourcing. Identifying and labeling activities is time-consuming, and automatic approaches to recognizing activities in the real world remain brittle.

We developed a way to automatically align video frames with their corresponding natural language expressions without any direct supervision. We also jointly learn the correspondences between nouns in the sentences and their referents in the physical...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
