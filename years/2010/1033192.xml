<AbstractNarration>This CISE special project funds the organization of the CISE Broader Impacts Summit. The goals of the summit include educating the CISE community about the NSF Broader Impacts criterion how to evaluate this criterion as part of a research project.  The Summit should provide researchers and educators with the opportunity to forge collaborations and build long-term partnerships that may lead to a wide range of activities with the potential to enhance CISE research projects. The Summit is to be organized by a Steering Committee that represents all CISE divisions and a range of CISE disciplines.  The investigators plan to discuss, present, and subsequently develop guidance materials for the CISE computing research community on how to effectively integrate broader impact activities into research projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project will arise from the working group discussions at the summit. At the end of the summit, a report is to be developed that synthesizes both current and future ideas in each of the five broader impact categories. This should provide research based methods for CISE investigators to connect their research and broader impacts in innovative ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this project will arise from the computing community members, by those to whom they speak about the summit, and by those who access materials created after the summit. The project includes dissemination plans to ensure the efforts from this project have an impact on future NSF projects. The impact on future NSF projects should result in significant broader impacts from CISE research projects across all five broader impact categories.</AbstractNarration>

The key goals as defined by NSF for NSF Broader Impacts has to do with:a) advancinge discovery and understanding while promoting teaching,   training, and learning,b) broadening participation of under-represented groups,c) enhancing infrastructure for research and education,d) broadening dissemination to enhance scientific and technological   understanding,  ande) benefits to society.  In summary, our project effected the lives of 100 students through two offerings of the "Science behind Computing" course as well as educated and elicited broad discussion of Broader Impacts among many forum, including the Gasarch-Fortnow popular blog.
