<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Our reliance upon the wonderful diversity of plant life worldwide is manifested in many ways, whether as sources of foodstuffs, structural building materials and fibers, or intermediate, specialty, and medicinal chemicals for everyday use.  Of particular importance is to understand how plants produce many of these valuable plant natural products and materials generated via intermediacy of highly reactive intermediates in their biochemical conversions, through so-called free radical chemistries. A key way in which these remarkable biochemistries evolved was recently identified, with the discovery of Dirigent Proteins (Latin, dirigere, to guide or align).  In this way, plants produce not only some of nature's most important compounds, such as lignans for plant defense, but also others highly valued and widely used by humanity.  In the project, how these remarkable proteins exercise and dictate control over the highly reactive free radical chemistries will be investigated.  This requires technologies using the most advanced instrumentation worldwide to probe dirigent protein structures and mechanisms of action, including state-of-the-art nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.  In this way, both their structure determinations and elucidation of how these proteins carry out these remarkable conversions will be enabled. It is generally accepted that the dirigent proteins have an unique biochemical mechanism, and it is now urgent to comprehensively unravel the underlying key details.    Another emphasis will be to use the information gained to provide a new protein source, from cottonseed, able to satisfy food requirements for 8.5 million people daily through better understanding of these remarkable free radical chemistries in dirigent protein mediated conversions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad impact&lt;br/&gt;Project activities are also deeply committed to helping solve societal challenges by providing the needed exposure of interested students at all stages of their development (high school, undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctorals), in order to inspire this upcoming generation (including various minority groups) to pursue a science career.   The approach thus includes providing comprehensive and varied research experiences through internships and exposing them to different opportunities in the Life Sciences.   In particular, emphasis will be given to exposure of students to the rapid technological developments that have occurred in science, which seamlessly link various disciplines ranging from plant sciences to computer science/bioinformatics.  This will include their participation in inspirational research projects and one-on-one mentoring.  Support to further the important role of science worldwide will be made in the form of presentations/workshops/lectures to high schools, various public gatherings, industry, science centers, federal and state delegations, as well as through international gatherings of many different types.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Transition of aquatic plants to land was evolutionary enabled by introduction and elaboration of phenylpropanoid metabolism. The latter massively utilized phenylalanine (until then mainly used for protein synthesis) to instead additionally produce a plethora of metabolites, such as lignans in seed coats, cell wall polymeric lignins in woody tissues, and diverse other phenolics with important physiological roles spanning flower color, pigmentation, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-herbivory properties. These substances were essential for successful plant growth/development and survival on land. Humanity could not exist as such without them.    Many phenylpropanoid pathway-derived metabolites exist in dimeric to polymeric form through oxidative phenoxy radical coupling processes, e.g. polymeric cell wall lignins which reinforce all vascular plants (stems, etc.). We discovered the first proteins controlling phenoxy radical coupling reaction outcomes, and named them Dirigent Proteins (DPs). While these first examples demonstrated control over dimeric lignan formation, others are now reported in terpenoid pathways, in macromolecular lignin biosynthesis, as well as potentially involved in other processes, e.g. to oligomeric/polymeric stilbenes.     We focused upon DPs involved in stereo-selective coniferyl alcohol radical coupling and discovered those producing (+) or (-)-antipodes of pinoresinol, as well as that affording (+)- gossypol from its achiral precursor hemi-gossypol. In those producing different pinoresinol enantiomers, effort was undertaken to begin to probe the biochemical mechanism of product formation. Using domain swapping approaches, regions were discovered in DPs that controlled formation of either (+) or (-)-antipodes. In addition, the (+)-pinoresinol forming DP X-ray crystal structure in trimeric form was determined.  Its potential substrate binding site was identified, with this awaiting completion of the fully resolved structure containing bound (coniferyl radical) substrate/substrate analogs. Homology modelling was done with the (-)-pinoresinol forming DP, the lignin-forming DP and the terpenoid pathway involving the DP-mediated process to (+)-gossypol. These distinct DPs vary considerably in size of the b1-b2 loop, but where the underlying biochemical rationale still needs clarification. Investigations are complemented with electron paramagnetic and high field NMR studies.     We also probed biochemical pathways to oligomeric secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) derived entities present in flax seed coats, and initially discovered the gene family encoding genes responsible for forming the (+) and (-)-pinoresinol enantiomers; interestingly, SDG is a nutraceutical with properties helping the human body fend off breast/colon cancers. MALDI (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) methodologies, together with ion mobility and collision induced fragmentation approaches, were employed to study SDG-hydroxymethyl glutaryl ester formation as intermediates to oligomeric seed coat lignans. These showed transient accumulation in the developing seed coat. In an analogous manner, flax accumulated cyanogenic glucosides, which were localized to the embryo at maturity.     We also isolated the corresponding gene(s) encoding DP(s) involved in (+)-gossypol formation from cotton flower petals from 2 different Gossypium hirsutum lines. Potential (+)-gossypol forming DPs were detected, cloned and expressed, including a (+)-gossypol forming DP) used in crystallization trials.     Other outcomes: 4 PDFÆs were trained: One is Program Director at the National Cancer Institute Office of Cancer Nanotechnology Research, another a WSU lab manager, another a scientist in a Brazilian research institute, and a fourth remains part of our laboratory. 5 Graduate students were trained.
