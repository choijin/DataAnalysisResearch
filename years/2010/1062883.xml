<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Western Michigan University that will provide a research experience in environmental signal transduction for 10 undergraduate students for 10 weeks, during the summers of 2010-2012.  The award is supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the Division of Chemistry (CHE) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS). The program focuses on fostering the development of undergraduate students in the life sciences by providing a cooperative learning environment that instills in the student how interdisciplinary approaches can be used to facilitate cutting edge research.  Over 20 participating faculty from the Departments of Biological Sciences and Chemistry engage the students in basic and applied approaches to understanding the signaling mechanisms by which biological molecules or chemical agents initiate action within cells, tissues, organisms or systems. Interactions within the group lead to new, innovative ways of studying signal transduction at different levels of organization - from molecular biology to ecology to systems biology - that have broad applications in agriculture, health and the environment. In addition, students attend workshops and seminars on a variety of topics such as responsible conduct in research, use of scientific literature, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process.  Students are recruited through campus visits as well as through traditional and electronic material and are selected primarily based on academic record, and potential for outstanding contribution to research.  Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://www.wmich.edu/nsf-ru , or by contacting the PI (Dr. Susan Stapleton at susan.stapleton@wmich.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. John Spitsbergen at john.spitsbergen@wmich.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Western Michigan University (WMU) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site hosted 42 students from 2011-2015.  Fifty-five percent of the participants were from underrepresented groups and came primarily from Midwest and Southern institutions where research opportunities are limited. This site successfully provided a collaborative research environment for the participating biological sciences and chemistry faculty and the REU students to focus on basic and applied interdisciplinary approaches to the understanding of the ways in which biological molecules or chemical agents initiate action within cells, tissues, organisms or systems. Interdisciplinary interactions within the group promoted excitement and enthusiasm for the field and for doing science.  New, innovative and exciting discoveries obtained by the students working with the faculty have broad applications in agriculture, health and the environment and will influence our approaches and understanding of various areas of chemical biology.  The REU site at WMU also went beyond the provision of a laboratory experience for these students by modeling life as an academic researcher and included additional professional growth and development opportunities through seminars and workshops as well as opportunities to meet and interact with area scientists and science business leaders.   The students presented their work to a broad audience at an end of summer symposium and were encouraged to attend professional meetings to present their findings to the larger scientific community.  Students have used this experience as a springboard for entry into graduate and other professional schools as well as to help make decisions regarding career choices.
