<AbstractNarration>The objective of the research is to design and develop a suite of electronic devices operating at terahertz frequencies.  The approach is based on the active control of metamaterial structures using plasma wave resonant behavior of the gated two-dimensional electron gas in the channel of GaAs HEMT devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research is focused on the creation of unique metamaterial/pHEMT hybrid devices to fill the "terahertz gap," where very few components exist today. The fundamental approach uniquely combines the emerging field of electromagnetic metamaterials with novel plasma wave electronic transport phenomena in transistors. The plasma wave behavior in sub-micron transistors offers the unique possibility to detect and modulate terahertz frequency signals. Modulator and demodulator device architectures will be developed to facilitate wireless communications in the terahertz regime with targeted data rates exceeding hundreds of gigabits per second. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research will help catalyze development in diverse areas such as high data rate wireless communications, terahertz spectroscopy for cancer detection and tools for homeland security.  The project will establish research and teaching laboratories at Boston College and Tufts University in the area of metamaterials and terahertz electronics.  The project will support diversity and outreach activities through research programs for undergraduates and summer programs for students from under-represented groups, The researchers also plan to offer lectures at local high schools primarily in minority-dominated neighborhoods, and participate actively in K-12 student-teacher mentorship programs established at Tufts University and Boston College.</AbstractNarration>
