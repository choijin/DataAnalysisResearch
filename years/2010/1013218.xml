<AbstractNarration>This is a one-year effort to develop and deliver an instrument package consisting of a Flux Gate Magnetometer (FGM), an Energetic Particle Detector for Electrons (EPDE), and an Energetic Proton Detector for Ions (EPDI), which will be flown on the upcoming Moscow State University (MSU) satellite Lomonosov.  The main scientific objective of this collaboration is to better understand the mechanisms responsible for scattering energetic particles into the atmosphere.  The project will provide accurate measurements of the energy spectrum of precipitating electrons and ions that have not yet been accomplished by previous satellite missions.  Lomonosov is planned to launch in late 2011 into a low-Earth, near-polar orbit, which is ideal for observing electrons and ions precipitating into the atmosphere.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The near-Earth measurements from the project will complement measurements of trapped radiation belt particles near the Equator from existing and upcoming missions, such as the NASA Radiation Belt Storms Probe mission.  Together these measurements will help quantify the dominant particle acceleration and loss mechanisms, which determines the dynamical evolution of the radiation belts.  The measurements will also be used to quantify losses for global predictive models of the near-Earth radiation environment.  Knowledge of particle precipitation rates to the atmosphere will help advance the understanding of  X-ray bursts frequently observed by balloon-borne instruments, which are thought to be associated with relativistic electron precipitation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student training both at MSU and UCLA is an important aspect of the project.  UCLA students will be involved in the fabrication, testing, and calibration of the particle and field package to be provided.  This collaboration with MSU allows for an in-flight test on new instruments and hardware that are expected to be highly beneficial to future NSF and NASA missions.</AbstractNarration>
