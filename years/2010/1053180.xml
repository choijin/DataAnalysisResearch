<AbstractNarration>This activity will provide hands-on activities to expose the general public to the significance of atmospheric sciences and its relevance to society.  This will done in conjunction with the Center for Severe Weather Research.  The Doppler on Wheels will be present at the EXPO so the public can see what instruments are use to help detect severe storms.  This effort will provide a platform for the geosciences to attract students K-12 experience some what this discipline has to offer to society.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit: This activity provided a new and unique opportunity to partner meteorologists, technicians, and engineers from the Center for Severe Weather Research (CSWR) with educators from the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) Office of Education and Outreach (EO) in achieving a public outreach goal. Together, they developed, tested, and shared demonstrations, hands on science activities, and graphic displays with visitors to the NSF-sponsored Adventures of a Storm Chaser booth and an adjacent Doppler on Wheels (DOW) during the October 23 &ndash; 24, 2010, USA Science and Engineering Expo on the National Mall in Washington, DC. &nbsp;CSWR and its staff, under the leadership of Josh Wurman, are funded primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF). They work closely with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the Pennsylvania State University to manage the NSF DOW facilities and associated Bistatic Network and Rapid-Scan programs which support research about the initiation of tornados, hurricanes, and convective phenomena. Directed by Susan Foster, UCAR EO has extensive experience in developing and presenting educational activities for K-12 and public visitors to the NCAR Mesa Lab in Boulder, Colorado. &nbsp;The EO team also included Rajul Pandya who directs UCAR&rsquo;s Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research Program (SOARS). SOARS is nationally recognized for providing educational and research opportunities, mentoring, career counseling and guidance, and financial support for culturally-diverse students in the atmospheric and related sciences. This collaboration enabled UCAR EO to integrate cutting edge research and technology into its weather education resources through the development of a new module entitled Radar and Weather Together (<a href="http://www.eo.ucar.edu/weather/">http://www.eo.ucar.edu/weather/</a>). CSWR scientists benefited by gaining training, demonstrations, and resources to engage and and focus their presentations on families and K-12 students. Guided by EO educators and CSWR scientists, SOARS prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, several of whom are fluent in Spanish, practiced their skills in science interpretation and communication while conducting outreach activities in the Adventures of a Storm Chaser booth at the Expo.
