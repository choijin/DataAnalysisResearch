<AbstractNarration>It is well established that atmospheric particulates, both natural and anthropogenic, directly alter earth's radiative balance by scattering and absorbing solar radiation.  The exact magnitude aerosol's direct radiative effect nonetheless remains somewhat uncertain.  While research on techniques to characterize aerosols in the visible and near infrared has been ongoing, there has been less attention paid to direct optical characterization of aerosols in the near-ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.  This effort will focus on development of an instrument to measure the aerosol scattering coefficient, extinction coefficient, and associated single-scatter albedo at UV wavelengths.  This instrument will make use of methodology previously developed by the researchers in which aerosol scattering and extinction coefficients are measured simultaneously on the same aerosol sample dispersed within an integrating sphere.  Extinction will be measured using the "cavity ring-down" technique while scattering measurements would be made by collecting light scattered from the probe beam with the integrating sphere.  The three-step project plan is to construct the instrument, optimize and characterize its performance in a laboratory setting, and then perform ambient monitoring of aerosol optical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research comes through development of provision of key measurements to help to close a major gap in current ability for direct optical characterization of aerosols in the near UV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include increased understanding of aerosol forcing relevant to climate research.  Educational and broadening participation aspects will be emphasized via support for two female graduate students and several undergraduates.  Public outreach will include a laboratory open-house during periods with many visitors on campus (such as weekend sporting events) to allow the general public an opportunity to see how human activities such as outdoor cooking can alter atmospheric composition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project has made valuble contributions to society by:  a. Broader Impact. Developing a new measurement technology for monitoring and studying the properties of airborne particles.  These particles contribute to human health problems and can reflect or absorb sunlight affecting Earth's climate.  The measurement device develped could possibly be developed commercially, leading to job creation.  b. Broader Impact.  The three year project has helped support several female graduate students complete work towards advanced degrees in Analytical Chemistry.  Seven female students were impacted in some way by this project.  At least 3 MS degrees and 2 Ph.D.s will result.  These students will have the opportunity to positively impact the nations economy in the future.    c.  Broader Impact.  Our lab hosted a open house during tailgating weekends at Texas Tech.  This allowed education of the genral public about our work and air quality issues.  d.  Technical Merit.  Measurements performed with the device built have been documented in the peer-reviewed journal literature.  Such measurements of the single scatter albedo for authentic and lab generated aerosols allows climate modelers to make informed decisions regarding key aerosol variables inputted into climate models.   Aerosol types considered included mineral dusts, secondary organic aerosols, and biomass aerosol.  Optical constants in the near UV spectral region were largely unknown prior to our study.             Last Modified: 01/03/2014       Submitted by: Jonathan E Thompson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
