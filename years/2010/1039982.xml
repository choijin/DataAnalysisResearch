<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Knowledge of englacial and subglacial conditions are critical for ice sheet models and predictions of sea-level change. Some of the critical variables that are poorly known but essential for improving flow models and predictions of sea-level change are: basal roughness, subglacial sedimentary and hydrologic conditions, and the temporal and spatial variability of the ice sheet flow field. Seismic reflection and refraction imaging and dense arrays of continuously operating GPS receivers can determine these parameters. The PIs propose to develop a network of wirelessly interconnected geophysical sensors (geoPebble) that will allow glaciologists to carry out these experiments simultaneously. This sensor web will provide a new way of imaging the ice sheet that is not possible with current instruments. With this sensor web, the PIs will extend the range of existing instruments from 2D to 3D, from low resolution to high resolution, but more importantly, all the geophysical measurements will be conducted synchronously. By the end of the proposal period the PIs will produce a network of 150-200 geoPebbles that will be available for NSF-sponsored glaciology research projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Improved knowledge of the flow law of ice, the sliding of glaciers and ice streams, and paleoclimate history will contribute to assessments of the potential for abrupt ice-sheet mass change, with consequent sea-level effects and significant societal impacts. This improved modeling ability will be a direct consequence of better knowledge of the physical properties of ice sheets, which this project will facilitate. The development effort will be integrated with the undergraduate education program via the capstone design classes in EE and the senior thesis requirement in Geoscience. The PIs will also form a cohort of first-year and sophomore students who will work in their labs from the beginning of the project to develop specifications through the commissioning of the network.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved the development of a network of seismic and GPS nodes that are wirelessly connected (which we call "geoPebbles" to show that these are small, self-contained, and rugged). The scientific impetus for such a network is to allow researchers to image the interior of glaciers and ice sheets: how thick the ice is, what the properties of that ice is, what lies beneath that ice, and so on. Researchers wish to know such properties of glaciers in order to better predict the response of glaciers and ice sheets to changing climate.  A network of geoPebble nodes can measure the seismic wavefield of the glacier on which it is installed, and scientists can use that seismic wavefield to determine much about the interior of the glacier.  (A seismic wave is the vibration of the earth after an earthquake or after an artifical seismic source is initiated). The individual nodes of the network measure their position using GPS and also use the GPS time to synchronize data collection across the network.  In other words, the time of arrival of the seismic wave at each node can be compared to the time of arrival at other nodes in order to characterize the region beneath the network.  The development of this network was motivated by the need to collect such data in areas that are difficult to travel in and where earlier methods (which involve long cables and wires) would be dangerous or impossible.  The geoPebbles are self-contained and wireless and can be installed without long inter-connecting cables.  The development of the geoPebbles was carried out in an open and collaborative way and the hardware, software, and data will be freely available to other researchers and scientists.  Students developed much of the hardware and software and found that the practical experience afforded by involvement in the project was valuable.  They highlighed it in when applying for jobs and indicated that employers rated this experience highly.  More than 100 geoPebbles are operational and are being used for research and education.
