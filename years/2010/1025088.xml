<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to enhance the operational, predictive capability of a widely-used, three-dimensional, time dependent, non-linear global model of the terrestrial upper atmosphere: The Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics model (CTIPe).  The project will assess the model's accuracy regarding long-term climatology (year scale) and day-to-day variability using long-term data sets acquired from both space- and ground-based platforms.  In addition, it will evaluate model capability during both simple and complex magnetic storms.</AbstractNarration>
