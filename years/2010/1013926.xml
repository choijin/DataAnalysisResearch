<AbstractNarration>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed project?&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will establish the feasibility of producing a novel class of amphiphilic graft copolymers to serve as thermoplastic hydrogel copolymers. Thermoplastic hydrogels are not available commercially and would be of great interest because, unlike conventional cross-linked hydrogel materials, they can be processed from solution or thermally into any form/shape via solvent casting, extrusion, thermoforming or hot melt injection. The proposed technology innovation will be achieved by the design of a series of amphiphilic graft copolymers with well-defined, adjustable macromolecular architectures with and without antimicrobial pendant groups along the chain. The project will explore a range of chemical compositions with variations in the chemical nature and concentration of hydrophobic grafts. The base polymer, poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline), is a commercially available polymer that is thermally stable, amorphous, water soluble, extrudable polymer. Physical crosslinks will be achieved by microphase separation. In the presence of water the hydrophilic backbone will swell. The degree of swelling and mechanical properties will be controlled by adjusting the macromolecular architecture tailored to the desired application requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project?&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be to develop processible hydrogels tailored for specific applications for wound care, water purification membranes, ink jet receptive layers for printing and thermoform contact lenses. The ability to tailor the properties of these materials by controlled synthetic methods using living polymerization methods will greatly enhance their utility to serve these diverse industries. Thermoplastic hydrogels can be processed, whereas cross-linked hydrogels are insoluble and infusible. Low cost processing methods such as thermoforming, injection molding or extrusion offer significant economic advantage over many current hydrogel products on the market. Moreover, the ability to adjust the composition and tailor the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature and microphase separation, which controls the degree of swelling, will enable the optimization of performance for a wide range of potential applications. The incorporation of non-leaching antimicrobial groups along the chain will enhance their utility in wound care and water purification membranes. Investigation of the surface and bulk morphology correlated to physical and thermo-mechanical data will help to obtain a better understanding of structure-property relationship of amphiphilic graft copolymers as a function of composition and observed morphology.</AbstractNarration>

The key technical objectives were to:  Prepare a series of amphiphilic graft copolymers by living cationic copolymerization of oxazoline-terminated macromonomer and 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline comonomer; Chemically modify a select number of the amphiphilic graft copolymers with quaternary ammonium moieties for potential application in water purification and other membranes; Characterize the amphiphilic graft copolymers with and without quaternary ammonium groups to understand the structure-property relationship between a wide variety of chemical compositions and their resulting morphology. Investigate morphology variations of the copolymers when prepared from solution and melt mixing. Assess the properties of the copolymers in terms of their proposed commercial interests (i.e. film forming ability for coatings applications, membrane performance for water purification, and tensile properties and swell characteristics for other hydrogel applications).   Four different synthetic approaches were investigated to prepare oxazoline-terminated macromonomer for the project. Three routes have been reported in literature and the forth was based on a novel approach using established chemistry. The three reported routes were all based on the concept of creating an oxazoline initiator and use that initiator to polymerize vinylic monomer such  as styrene to create the oxazoline-terminated macromonomer. The novel approach prepared the polystyrene first and then reacted the oxazoline initiator onto the polystyrene containing a good leaving group.
