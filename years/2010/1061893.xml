<AbstractNarration>The focus of this project is to develop a research and education network of faculty from small, primarily undergraduate institutions with the goal of including novel next-generation DNA sequence analysis in ongoing research, so that these research activities can be incorporated into core courses within the undergraduate life sciences curriculum. The network is collaborating with a genomic sequencing core facility located at Penn State University (University Park) to enable access to state-of-the-art sequencing technology to undergraduate students and faculty at small colleges in the mid-Atlantic region. Initial network participants include Juniata College, Susquehanna University, Duquesne University, Hampton University, Morgan State University,  Ramapo College of New Jersey, Gettysburg College, Lycoming College, Lock Haven University, Mount Aloysius College, Bucknell University and Hood College, with the genome sequencing facility at Penn State supporting the data acquisition and dissemination aspects of the initiative. Formation of the network is being initiated through 1) a workshop to address the logistics of starting and sustaining a network of faculty interested in using raw DNA sequence for undergraduate research and teaching, and 2) the formulation of a practical plan for obtaining the desired DNA sequence and a standard operating procedure to allow efficient interaction with multiple network participants and a core facility at a research-intensive institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Genomics and bioinformatics are dynamic fields well-suited for capturing the imagination of undergraduates in both research laboratories and classrooms. The formal relationship with a research-intensive core can provide an efficient and cost-effective mechanism for acquiring the desired raw sequence data needed for undergraduate research aligned with faculty interest at small colleges. In addition, network faculty will collaborate to develop teaching approaches that incorporate the novel sequence data into core courses within their undergraduate biology curriculum. A regional network can also provide opportunities for faculty and students to meet and present their data for peer-review and to hear from experts on trends in selected areas of genomics and bioinformatics. Anticipated outcomes include increased "real-world" student research experiences for undergraduates and coordination of innovative education initiatives that build from the novel research data collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: By making Penn State's genome sequencing facility more broadly accessible to small, primarily undergraduate colleges in the mid-Atlantic region, this network will provide additional educational opportunities and resources for STEM education and improved opportunity for students to be prepared for graduate, technical and research careers. More broadly, this regional model could be replicated in other geographic regions, using a sequencing core at a local research-intensive university, to support the research and educational activities of undergraduates at small colleges in that region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Developing innovative approaches and empowering undergraduate faculty with the tools to implement the recommended curricular changes and to enable access to state-of-the-art technology remains a challenge for undergraduate educators. This was the goal of this Research Coordination Network for Undergraduate Biology Education (RCN-UBE) Incubator award that involved 12 primarily undergraduate institutions in the Mid-Atlantic region working in partnership with an established genomics core facility at a research-intensive university (The Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA.).   The integration of state-of-the&ndash;art technology into the undergraduate environment is essential to training the future workforce that will be needed to support the coming needs of molecular medicine and the biotechnology sector as well as to maintain our nationÆs preeminence in the life sciences research. In addition these individuals will need to function and communicate effectively with their peers and the people they serve in a world that is constantly in political and technologic flux.    Genomics and bioinformatics are dynamic fields that provide both a challenge and an opportunity for science programs at small colleges. Innovation and curricular changes are more efficient at small schools than at larger institutions and the values and mission of the liberal arts make this setting ideal for the evolution of new approaches to undergraduate science education.   Providing undergraduates access to state-of-the-art technology has previously been addressed successfully for microarray technology, by the Genome Consortium on Active Teaching (GCAT). Providing undergraduates access to microarray technology GCAT, a grass-roots consortium of faculty at small primarily undergraduate institutions, has trained over 300 faculty and enabled more than 24,000 undergraduates to experience hands-on research by integrating microarray technology into the biology curriculum.  A major driving factor that enticed a diverse group of faculty to adjust their teaching strategies was the academic freedom associated with integrating their own research questions into an active teaching approach.     As Next-Gen sequencing approaches evolved and replaced microarray analysis by enabling more detailed molecular analysis across all fields of biology, this NSF RCN-UBE -incubator grant has catalyzed the formation of GCAT-SEEK and supported pilot acquisition of sequences from investigator-initiated projects at 8 of the original 12 network institutions. This allowed our network to identify several bottlenecks that make it difficult to seamlessly integrate Next-Gen sequencing into undergraduate courses and research experiences.  The first major challenge was experimental design by faculty members lacking experience with the technology (e.g., picking the optimal sequencing platform for the project).   The second challenge was navigation through the myriad of bioinformatic, computational, and statistical options to efficiently extract meaningful scientific value from the sequence data obtained. Since the fundamental mission of GCAT-SEEK is student training and learning, the third challenge that we identified was the development of appropriate and effective pedagogical and assessment tools. While no single network member is an expert in all areas, we responded to these challenges by identifying key individuals with expertise in each area to provide support to other network members using the GCAT-SEEK listserv, our results have shown that, collectively, we can start to address the initial bottlenecks.    In a broad sense, GCAT-SEEK aims to engage students in inquiry-based learning that is grounded in the key concepts and competencies of modern biology, and are connected to learning objectives and assessments.  Our goal is to improve this process by developing faculty-student workshops lead by experts in key areas to share their experience for the benefit of all.  The NSF RCN-UBE i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
