<AbstractNarration>This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) formal governance and informal social networks will impact recovery and rebuilding efforts in Haiti. We focus on South Florida, home to an estimated 263,000 Haitians, many of whom have family in Haiti; and a region that is already serving as a receiving area for severely injured earthquake survivors, and for school-aged displacees with relatives in this region. Three issues are critically important for purposes of urgent data collection: (i) understanding the role of the Haitian American community in relief, recovery and rebuilding efforts; (ii) documenting the trends and profiles of displacee influx to South Florida; and (iii) collecting and analyzing policies and plans that have been created in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level in response to this potential (or perceived) displacee influx. Interviews with key stakeholders including  members of Haitian-American community groups, non-profit organizations, city and county  (Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach) governments, school administrators and counselors, hospital administrators, and immigration officials and advocates, will service as the primary research method. We will also conduct secondary data analysis of preexisting plans and policies and their modifications, along with any new policies created. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value of this research extends beyond South Florida. Potential contributions are local, regional, national and international in scope, with beneficiaries that span multiple disciplines involved with social network ties and related analyses, school planning, emergency management, homeland security, disaster planning, evacuation, sheltering, healthcare, infrastructure planning and housing reconstruction. Not only will this research seek to fill knowledge gaps outlined above, but it can eventually inform collaborative management and policy in receiving areas, where governmental institutions will need to evolve to meet needs of displacees, including international disaster migrants.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit  Overall, this research has helped fill gaps in our knowledge on the role of diaspora groups and host communities in post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, with specific focus on the role of the Haitian-American diaspora associations based in South Florida, as well as the role of host communities, non-governmental organizations and government agencies that assisted earthquake survivors and displacees.  The two investigators who conducted this research are faculty from Florida Atlantic UniversityÆs Schools of Urban Planning and Public Administration. With respect to urban planning, the findings contribute to research on pre-and post-disaster planning at the local level and highlights the various gaps in our planning process and our plans. It also informs various facets of planning including housing, social service provision and further highlights the importance of voluntary groups and non-profit organizations as key advocates of vulnerable populations. With respect to public administration, this research helps inform and contribute to research on the role of local public agencies and vertical interaction with other levels of government (state and federal), along with their horizontal interactions and collaboration with non-profit organizations and community associations. It also contributes to the disaster management field by the findings related to host comm...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
