<AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative research project is aimed at studying and developing a high-throughput, template-based method for the growth of highly ordered arrays of semiconductor quantum dots in the silicon-germanium system.  An integrated approach based on theory, multiscale computer simulation, and experiments will be utilized to perform the study.  Atomic-scale computer simulation techniques such as the Monte Carlo method will be employed to identify optimal conditions for generating micro-patterned compositional distributions in a silicon-germanium substrate using stress applied via a patterned, reusable template.  The suitability of the compositional variations induced within the substrate, and the resultant surface strain patterns, will then be investigated in the context of growing ordered germanium nanostructures on the substrate using molecular beam epitaxy.  A dedicated experimental apparatus will be fabricated for performing the template-based compositional patterning of a substrate silicon-germanium wafer.  High-resolution electron microscopy will be performed and used throughout this study in order to establish direct connections with atomic-scale and multiscale simulation predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will establish materials and operating-condition criteria required for successfully realizing a conceptually simple, cost-effective, template-based method for growing a highly ordered two-dimensional array of germanium nanostructures on silicon-germanium substrates.  The primary goals of this work are to understand quantitatively the basic atomistic mechanisms that govern compositional patterning under applied stress and the coupling of this stress to nanostructure ordering, and then the use of this understanding to demonstrate experimentally the germanium quantum dot array formation.  If successful, this work could lead to a practical route for fabrication of high-density nanostructure arrays with a variety of potentially important applications, ranging from sensors, to data storage, to quantum computing.  Moreover, many of the basic atomistic sub-processes that will be studied, along with the associated computational and experimental techniques that will be developed, may be relevant to a wide range of materials processing applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A wide range of current and future electronic and optoelectronic semiconductor devices depend on our ability to manipulate electronic band gaps to produce precisely engineered quantum barriers.  The technology to engineer such barriers in one-dimension is well-established by the growth of multilayered semiconductor structures.  However, extending this success to two and three dimensions in a cost-effective way will require further advances in semiconductor materials processing.  In this project, we propose, develop, and study a new approach for three-dimensional manipulation of atomic compositions, and therefore electronic properties, in silicon-germanium alloys.  Here, a prefabricated array of sub-micron scale indenters is pressed into a silicon-germanium substrate at elevated temperature, creating a patterned mechanical field in the near-surface region.  The compressive stress field in the regions below the indenters drives away the larger germanium atoms creating a patterned compositional field that reflects the indenter array geometry.  The ability to manipulate the indenter sizes, shapes, and array geometry provides a high degree of flexibility.  Moreover, the approach is simple in concept and relies on a reusable indenter array, which makes the proposed process suitable for high-throughput nanomanufacturing.  The process is analyzed computationally with a new multiscale model for silicon-germanium atomic diffusion that accounts for the complex effects of temperature, composition, and stress on atomic transport.  The simulations predict a wide operating window for compositional redistribution suggesting that the technique is robust with respect to the various process parameters, such as indentation depth and annealing temperature.  In particular, it is shown that compositional redistribution is rapid, occurring over a timescale of several minutes at easily accessible temperatures, and most importantly, at indentation stresses that do not create any observable plastic deformation in the silicon-germanium substrate.    Plastic deformation proceeds via the formation of dislocations that would be highly detrimental for any electronic or optoelectronic devices fabricated on the substrate.  It is also demonstrated that a range of compositional patterns may be induced in silicon-germanium alloy using different indenter array geometries and thermal annealing conditions.  These results will be instrumental for further optimization of this promising process, which may lead to a facile new pathway for high-throughput manufacturing of novel optoelectronic devices.  Importantly, the steps that comprise this æstress-transferÆ process are expected to be compatible with existing semiconductor processing technology, paving the way for integration of new optoelectronic devices with existing ones.
