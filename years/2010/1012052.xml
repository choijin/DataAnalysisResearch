<AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Mikhail Anisimov of the University of Maryland College Park and his research group will employ static and dynamic light scattering, microrheology, slow scanning adiabatic calorimetry, optical and electron microscopy, and X-ray and neutron scattering to characterize the structure of aqueous solutions of alcohols and small amphiphilic ions. The general goal of the research would be to provide useful experimental data and insight into the question of equilibrium or long-lived mesoscale structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the proposed research may have a broad impact on the understanding of the role which water and aqueous solutions play in nature, industry, and in biological systems. In particular, the research may be relevant to various possible applications, such as nano-encapsulated oxygen delivery or protein unfolding and protein dehydration in aqueous solutions, and new smart materials resulting from self-assembly in solution.</AbstractNarration>
