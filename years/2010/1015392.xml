<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Stacie M. King will conduct two field seasons of archaeological research in southern Oaxaca, Mexico.  Nejapa is located in the mountainous Sierra Sur and marks the midpoint of a heavily traveled trade route connecting the Mexican highlands to the Pacific coast.  For at least 2500 years, armies and traders from highland empires and political centers traveled through Nejapa to try to access rich coastal resources.  Not all of these experiences were friendly and mutually beneficial.  As is known from archaeological and ethnohistoric sources, Mesoamerica is a world region with a long history of conquest and colonization.  While the Mixe, Chontal, and Zapotec peoples in Nejapa clearly experienced Spanish conquest and colonialism, they also endured multiple earlier conquests with potentially greater local impact.  In the centuries preceding the arrival of the Spanish, Aztecs were building a large empire, which ultimately encompassed large parts of what is now Mexico.  At roughly the same time, highland Zapotecs in Oaxaca embarked on their own hostile takeover of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.  Nejapa is the place where all of these efforts converged.  Initial archaeological research in Nejapa shows that the years between A.D. 1350 and 1650 were incredibly dynamic, with increased numbers of archaeological sites, economic and political diversity, and wider settlement distribution across valleys, foothills, and mountain ridgelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archaeological studies of culture contact and colonialism tend to emphasize interactions between indigenous peoples and Europeans.  Despite recent attempts to broaden definitions beyond the realm of first encounters between the Old and New World, in practice, studies often emphasize post-fifteenth century contexts.  The intellectual merit of this project is that it breaks new ground by including non-European colonialism and extending the time frame of colonialism earlier and later.  The goal is to examine how local sociopolitical relations in rural regions contributed to differential results during multiple conquests and colonialisms by foreigners.  Specific questions address the give and take between external and internal political forces, investment in resource-poor high altitude locations, effects of differential access to trade networks on local politics and economics, fortresses and military strategies, and ethnic relations during centuries of political upheaval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field work includes two seasons of settlement survey, mapping, and targeted excavations at key sites that span the years A.D. 1350 to 1650.  Laboratory analysis consists of geochemical sourcing of ceramics and obsidian, AMS radiocarbon dating, and artifact analysis.  This multi-scalar project represents the first part of a longer-term interdisciplinary study of the region's history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has several broader impacts.  First, it will facilitate the development of long-term institutional collaborations between the U.S. and Mexico by providing scientific training for undergraduate and graduate students from both countries and by creating ties between Indiana University and agencies in Mexico.  The field and laboratory work will also provide valuable cultural resource training to Mixe, Zapotec, and Chontal citizens across the region.  Finally, the adoption of innovative methods and technologies for digital data acquisition in high-altitude locations without electricity will be relevant to specialists in various disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The focus of this research is Nejapa, Oaxaca, an important region of Mesoamerica that had never before been studied by archaeologists. This archaeological research project generated new knowledge about the impact of conquest and colonialism in rural, multiethnic regions, and showed how complex sociopolitical histories contributed to differential outcomes in different communities during colonial encounters. The region of Nejapa is located at the midpoint of the heavily-traveled and hotly-contested trade corridor between highland Oaxaca and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Pacific coast of Oaxaca, which was a major route taken by Zapotec, Aztec, and Spanish forces in their campaigns to control the rich lands of the Pacific coastal plain. All of the project data show that conquest and colonialism are not short-term events, but rather, are long and protracted processes that do not affect all communities and regions similarly. The diverse peoples living in these rural, indigenous communities had many options when faced with foreigners and militaries with colonial aspirations. Sometimes, people chose to engage and set up favorable and productive economic and political partnerships. Others preferred to establish their homes in the highest mountaintops to maintain local control over when such encounters occurred. Yet, even the large numbers of people who constructed and lived in fortified mountaintops across Nejapa were still able to access imported trade items and maintain close and beneficial economic ties with neighbors and foreigners.
