<AbstractNarration>Building on the successes of ATE?s IT Across Careers (ITAC) Project and extensive experience developing national and regional voluntary industry skill standards, EDC and a technical committee of computer scientists and thought leaders in computational thinking (CT) from the University of Washington, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Williams College, Santa Fe Institute, and Raytheon Corporation will develop and validate a common core of CT skill sets used by scientists, technicians/technologists, engineers, and mathematicians in America?s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) workplaces. The project employs a skill standards development methodology used in European social partnerships to identify a ?learning occupation? and conduct an occupational analysis of that occupation?creating new language and a framework to describe work duties, tasks, skills, knowledge, and attributes of U.S. STEM professional and technical workers empowered with CT. The project will conduct a national online validation of the resulting CT duties, responsibilities, and associated skills, knowledge, and attributes. With expert STEM workers, the project team will develop written and visual examples of how STEM workers use CT skills in routine work to solve problems commonly found in STEM workplaces. Traditional and innovative dissemination strategies will be used to share findings with the national community of CT stakeholders to inform and advance ongoing efforts to define CT, and to integrate CT into K?20 education programs aimed at building the next generation of STEM innovators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project builds on existing efforts to define CT. It addresses the urgent need to ground the many emerging definitions of Computational Thinking in validated skills, knowledge, and experiences of working scientists, technicians, and technologists who use CT on a daily basis. Engaging expert computational thinkers from laboratories and industry, modifying the DACUM (Developing A CUrriculuM) process to describe CT, and using the ?learning occupation? as a mechanism to surface and promote dialogue across disciplines and work sectors are each radically different from current approaches used by computer scientists to describe and clarify CT. The concept of a learning occupation is a proven way of defining new occupations for emerging industries and occupations that have undergone substantive changes in worker responsibilities. The occupational analysis DACUM methodology has been widely validated and used internationally to identify the skills needed by front-line workers. The proposed activities meet an important need within the CT community and build on prior NSF and National Skill Standards development work. The technical committee connecting the project to national computer science and CT networks are experts who are influential in their fields and highly regarded contributors to evolving definitions of CT. The PI for this project is a seasoned NSF PI who has led NSF projects and a large NSF center successfully serving the needs of NSF projects that develop pathways to STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The occupational analysis methodology provides a new language and structure that can potentially transform dialogue among thought leaders shaping the emerging definitions of computational thinking. The technical committee will ensure that the work finds a prominent place in the national discussion on CT. Demystifying difficult CT concepts will contribute to the public understanding of CT as a foundational skill set for STEM workers and attract new students into STEM. The articulated skill sets and examples will provide learning guideposts for students seeking to become the STEM innovators of the future. Moreover, they will help educators design and develop relevant programs of study, career pathways, and curricula leading students to STEM careers. Examples of CT skills ?in action? in the workplace will be used by counselors and educators to help broaden participation in STEM learning and careers, and lead to the construction of learning experiences that engage underrepresented groups and grow their talent. The processes established within this project will advance understanding of what it takes to articulate new and emerging occupations in STEM and surface important new questions to pursue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computational Thinking "in Action" in AmericaÆs STEM Workplaces   This project defined the work of Computational Thinking (CT)-Enabled STEM Professionals employed in research and development institutes and industry settings.  It employed a radically different approach than traditionally used by computer scientists to describe and clarify computational thinking by:   1. Gathering input directly from expert computational thinkers employed in laboratories and industry,  2. Framing their shared skills and knowledge in terms of a defined emerging occupation,  and  3. Describing, in the form of Profiles of the Computational Thinking-Enabled STEM Professional, what workers in the defined occupation need to know and be able to do to succeed on the job.    Occupational definition (developed by CT expert panels):  A Computational Thinking-Enabled STEM Professional "engages in a creative process to solve problems, design products, automate systems, or improve understanding by defining, modeling, qualifying and refining systems, processes or mechanisms generally through the use of computers.  Computational thinking often occurs in collaboration with others".    This occupation was analyzed by two groups of expert workers:  research scientists and engineers from research/development institutes and product engineers from industry.  Each produced a profile describing their work functions, activities, skills, knowledge, and attributes. The profiles (attached) provide new language and a framework to describe work performed by STEM professional and technical workers empowered with CT. These expert workers also developed written and visual examples of how they use CT skills in routine work to solve problems commonly found in STEM workplaces (see CT In Action attached).  Adjustments were made along the way. We found that for the work of this project to be broadly accepted, the voice of the engineering community needed to come through more strongly than indicated in the first Profile developed by scientists and engineers from research/development institutes.  Despite similarities in major job functions and activities, product engineers pointed out that language used by them in industry settings differed from the language used by scientists and engineers in research  facilities/national laboratories.  A second occupational analysis that adapted the profile to reflect the authentic context of "product engineers" was  proposed to the NSF, approved and conducted. This was a major undertaking requiring a reallocation of resources within our budget. After discussing this with our NSF program officer we were advised to develop a separate proposal to host the workshop. The educatorÆs webinar/workshop was deleted from our deliverable requirements, was subsequently funded under a separate NSF grant and will take place in spring 2013. All other objectives were met and intended outcomes achieved.  Evaluation findings confirmed that the skill standards development process applied to this project produced a profile that captured the work of computational thinking STEM professionals.  Contributions: Demystifying difficult CT concepts and how they are applied in the scientific enterprise contributes to the public understanding that CT is a foundational skill set for STEM workers. The resulting profiles and examples provide a new language and structure that can transform dialogue among thought leaders shaping the emerging definitions of computational thinking. The work  functions, activities, skills/knowledge, behaviors and tools identified in the profiles provide basic building blocks for programs and curricula that lead to careers in which scientists and engineers use the affordances of cyber-infrastructure to create, innovate and solve our worldÆs most pressing problems. They also provide frameworks that can inform the development and sequencing of CT instruction for post-secondary academic and technical programs. The profiles can be used to develop career inf...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
