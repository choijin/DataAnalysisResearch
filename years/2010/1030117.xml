<AbstractNarration>SES-1030117&lt;br/&gt;PI: Lynn Smith-Lovin&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Steven Foy&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Duke University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project compares test-taking performance between adults with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyper Activity Disorder) who are explicitly exposed to stereotype threat on the basis of their condition to adults with ADHD who have not been explicitly exposed to stereotype threat. Comparisons will be made with non-ADHD-affected persons to determine the difference, if one exists, between normative test anxiety and medicalization-based stereotype threat. The effect of a frequently-provided test-taking accommodation for persons with ADHD - extra time to complete the questions - will also be experimentally evaluated to determine the extent to which it might offset stereotype threat.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;If stereotype threat negatively impacts test-taking performance among persons with ADHD, this will provide evidence for one way in which the labeling component of medicalization may harm patients despite the possible benefits involved with having a diagnosis to which counter-normative behavior may be attributed.</AbstractNarration>
