<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to extend existing activities of the Antarctic Geospatial Information Center (AGIC) to also include Arctic activities. The Polar Geospatial Information Center (PGIC) will provide geospatial support for science and operational activities at both poles while also providing access to new data sources. AGIC has an existing infrastructure, experienced staff, and a working relationship with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) that can be efficiently expanded to support the U.S. Arctic Research Program. PGIC will provide three important functions for the polar science and operations communities: access to sub-meter, high-resolution satellite imagery for the Antarctic and Arctic for funded research proposals as well as logistics support; expertise to process, analyze, and create products from this imagery and other geospatial data; and development of short courses to teach geospatial techniques and use of visualization software. The foundation to support Arctic and Antarctic activities will be a mosaic of sub-meter resolution satellite images: High-Resolution Commercial Imagery Collection of the Poles (HIPOLE). While maps and geospatial data exist for much of the Arctic and Antarctic, use of these GIS data is often hindered by a lack of experience with necessary tools or datasets. PGIC would address this issue by providing GIS and remote sensing methodology workshops and guidance to U.S. polar researchers, along with expertise and access to unique datasets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This activity will support a broad segment of the polar community with a high-resolution geospatial data, will provide expertise to aid in its analysis, will train researchers in its use and, will disseminate the geospatial products of researchers.</AbstractNarration>
