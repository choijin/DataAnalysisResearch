<AbstractNarration>This grant supports a program of two experiments at Jefferson Lab which will use the parity-violating asymmetry in the scattering of polarized electrons to search for evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. The experiments are the ongoing Qweak measurement and a proposed new experiment for the 12 GeV era at Jefferson Lab, the MOLLER experiment. The first will provide a measurement of the proton's weak charge to 4% precision, and the second will make a 2.3% measurement of the weak charge of the electron. The two results will be complementary, as they are differently sensitive to possible parity-violating new physics, and both have a projected reach for new physics of this kind at the few TeV scale. The grant supports the PI as well as three graduate students, as well as undergraduate students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal broader impact of this project is graduate and undergraduate student education. The grant supports three graduate students as well as one undergraduate student; other undergraduates will be involved as well via the senior research projects that are required of all William &amp; Mary physics majors. The PI served on a panel that reviewed the "Standards of Learning" for physics in K-12 education for the Commonwealth of Virginia, and helped to develop a related online resource textbook, and will partner with local schools to help implement the revised standards.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have made the first measurement of a certain fundamental property of the proton, known as its weak charge. The weak charge dictates the strength of one form of the interaction of the proton with the neutral carrier of the weak force, the Z-boson.  The measurement was made at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, using the technique of high-precision parity-violating electron scattering from the world's highest power cryogenic liquid hydrogen target.    Comparison of the measured value of the weak charge with its precisely predicted value from the Standard Model of particle physics allowed us to make a sensitive search for long sought-after "new physics", which would be outside the scope of the Standard Model. Our initial result is in excellent agreement with the Standard Model prediction. Sufficient data were obtained -- and are presently being analyzed -- for a much higher precision result, which will allow us to probe for new physics at mass scales in the multi-TeV range.   By combining our result for the proton's weak charge with the results from related experiments which studied parity violating interactions of atomic electrons with heavy nuclei, we were also able to extract the first experimental determination of the neutron's weak charge, which is also in good agreement with the Standard Model expectation.  Also as part of this grant we continued development of a new proposed experiment at Jefferson Lab, which will make an analogous measurement of parity-violating electron-electron scattering. This will enable a very precise determination of the electron's weak charge, and will provide a complementary search for physics beyond the Standard Model.  Six PhD students and several undergraduate and high school students received training in experimental nuclear physics while conducting research on these projects.
