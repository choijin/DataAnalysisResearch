<AbstractNarration>GOALI/Collaborative Research: Antenna-Coupled ALD-Enabled Metal-Insulator-Insulator-Metal Diodes for High Responsivity and High Resolution THz/Infrared Focal Plane Arrays&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a new class of room temperature metal-insulator-insulator-metal tunnel diode detectors and monolithically integrate them within novel miniature antenna focal plane array configurations for high resolution and high responsivity THz/infrared imaging as well as energy harvesting. The approach is to enhance nonlinearity of the diodes up to 30THz by using dual tunnel junctions and employ a system level design by addressing issues of antenna-diode impedance mismatches, compact antenna size, inter-element electromagnetic couplings, and bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits:&lt;br/&gt;The program is focused on challenges associated with system-level integration of antenna coupled metal-insulator-insulator-metal diodes for high performance THz/infrared imaging. Metal-insulator-insulator-metal diodes offering sensitive detection of radiation up to 30THz will advance the synthesis of ultrathin dielectric materials and nanofabrication. The critical goals of high resolution and high responsivity will be achieved through novel approaches in antenna miniaturization, non-uniform array layouts, and compact impedance matching networks. Ultra-wideband imaging and energy harvesting will be accomplished with novel broadband arrays and computational electromagnetics modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes will impact a broad range of applications including environmental, biomedical, material science, homeland security, and renewable energy. The effort is well aligned with synergistic research in the area of medical THz imaging and infrared renewable energy at both universities. The industry partnership will allow to broadly disseminate research results beyond the academic community. The project will provide a system level design opportunity to graduate students, impact the curriculum at both universities, and leverage ongoing programs to attract underrepresented students to engineering.</AbstractNarration>
