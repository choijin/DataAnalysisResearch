<AbstractNarration>The possibility of developing new paradigms for electronics and information technology has motivated world-wide interest in spintronics, which is based on manipulating the intrinsic spin of charge carriers in solids to develop new, efficient functionalities for high-speed, low-power devices and circuits. The goals of the present research effort, involving close collaboration between groups at the University at Buffalo (UB) and the Ruhr Universitaet, Bochum (RUB), are: to develop a full understanding of the basic physics of the spin-orbit (SO) interaction in quasi-one-dimensional systems in InAs-based heterostructures; to discover new spin-related phenomena; and to explore opportunities for developing novel spintronic devices. Strong SO coupling effects originate in the lack of inversion symmetry in the structures, which can be controlled by growth or by application of an external electric field. The narrow fundamental gap and large spin-orbit splitting of InAs also play a strong role. The two main research activities are: 1) photoresponse and absorption studies of electric-dipole spin resonance in Quantum Hall edge channels in InAs quantum wells; and 2) electrical transport, magnetotransport and electric-dipole spin resonance studies of lithographically fabricated quantum wires in similar InAs-based heterostructures. Results from the two systems will be compared and similarities and differences will provide deeper insight into the fundamental spin physics of these systems.  Terahertz and low frequency experiments as a function of electric and magnetic fields will provide essential information on the interplay of the fields and the SO interaction in these structures. The detailed understanding derived from this coordinated effort should allow tailoring complex one-dimensional structures, for example, combining short quantum wires with quantum Hall edge channels in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer for spin-dependent coherence measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MWN funding will support a closely coupled experimental research and education program, between the US and German groups. Collaborative theoretical and materials growth (molecular beam epitaxy) efforts also support this work. The two groups have common interests in the physics of these structures and complementary expertise. The advancement of fundamental knowledge through this program will impact the fields of spintronics and quantum information processing. Graduate students directly involved in these studies will receive a unique broad, multidisciplinary education in basic physics, materials science, and nanofabrication, as well as cultural education through the regular exchanges of students and the PIs. Undergraduate students will be provided with a research experience abroad via training and independent study at UB, and a one month early summer visit to our partner's laboratory at RUB.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The main goals of this project were to measure the so-called g-factor of electrons in low dimensional semiconductor structures, and to explore the way these values are enhanced over that of the free electron. The g-factor determines the energy difference between the two possible spin orientations of an electron in an applied magnetic field, and thus the "tunability" with field of this energy separation. Two mechanisms contribute to the effective g-factor: 1) the spin-orbit interaction, which couples a single electronÆs intrinsic spin with its orbital motion, and 2) complex interactions among the many electrons in a sample, which arise from the Coulomb repulsion of the charged electrons, the spin-dependent part of which is called the "exchange" interaction. Both mechanisms can lead to significantly enhanced values of the g-factor (factors of 10 to 100).

We investigated two quasi-two-dimensional structures, one based on thin (3.5 - 4 nanometer) layers of the narrow-energy-gap semiconductor InAs, and the other based on a thin layer (6.1 nanometers) of another narrow-gap semiconductor, HgTe.  In the InAs-based samples we found that the g-factors are about ten times that of the free electron in magnitude, and that more than half this enhancement is due to the exchange effect.  We also observed large decreases in g-factor when the magnetic field was rotated away from the normal to the sample plane, by as much as a factor of three at an angle of 80 degrees.  Again, both spin-orbit and exchange effects contribute to this decrease, as shown by theoretical calculations of our collaborator at UB.  Mercury Telluride is a narrow-gap semiconductor with a large spin-orbit interaction, which in bulk form has an unusual "inverted" energy band arrangement.  Thin layers of HgTe surrounded by HgCdTe undergo a phase transition at a critical thickness. Below this thickness the layer has a "normal" energy band arrangement, while for larger thicknesses it has the inverted structure.  Close to the critical thickness there is a region over which the HgTe is an insulator, but the layered structure develops narrow, electrically conducting channels at the interfaces: this is the so-called topological insulator phase. In addition, the structure of the energy bands is unusual, and such that electrons behave as if they had essentially zero mass.  This is in contrast to typical semiconductors for which electrons can have a much smaller mass than that of the free electron, but not zero mass.   We explored the energy-momentum relationship of electrons in a sample with HgTe thickness very close to the critical thickness. We found that the theoretical model and parameters developed for low energies fit results remarkably well at the high energies of our measurements for the most part.  However, the g-factor, which is 30-35 times larger that that of a free electron, is also significantly larger than predicted by the model.  Quantitative knowledge of these effects is important for electronic devices in a field of research called spintronics.  Such devices...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
