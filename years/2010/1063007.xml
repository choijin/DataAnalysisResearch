<AbstractNarration>This three-year REU Site program builds on the substantial research strengths at the University of Maine.  The focus on sustainable forest bioproducts is highly topical and of great global importance in the area of sustainable energy alternatives.  Ten US undergraduate participants will conduct research advancing their knowledge of the field in general and one of the thematic elements in detail, specifically: 1) sustainability and life cycle analysis, 2) feedstock extraction/modification, 3) process control and sensing, 4) nanomaterial production and utilization, and 5) new product development.  In addition the program includes an international component whereby, six Chilean students on a mutual exchange with six US students will participate in this program. Ongoing relationships exist between the University of Maine and Chilean faculty in Forest Resources and Engineering disciplines at the University of Chile in Santiago, the University of Bio-Bio in Concepcion, Chile and the University of Concepcion-UDT.  The international component will allow students to learn the nuances of technical practices in the forest products industry in Chile, and discuss business, marketing, technology and environmental issues.  At the end of the summer, REU student final presentations will be held at the University of Concepcion-UD in the format of a research conference.  The entire conference will be streamed to the US so that the U of Maine based research teams can participate.  Through participation in this REU Site program students will be better prepared to collaborate with international scholars and will develop a broader international perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site will specifically recruit minorities through extensive use of existing linkages with primarily minority serving institutions. All participants on this award will be non-UMaine students. The involvement of students in exciting research in the area of sustainable energy alternatives enhances the likelihood that they will consider post-graduate study and broaden the base of the Nation's technical manpower. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EHR/EPSCoR).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Summary  As the leader in the development of Maine's forest-related products and economy, UMaine was uniquely positioned to offer this REU Site opportunity in Sustainable Forest Bioproducts.  This REU Site provided more than thirty undergraduate students with a ten week summer research experience over the past 3 years, leveraging the focus areas of the UMaine Forest Bioproduct Research Institute (FBRI).  Students conducted research advancing their knowledge of the field in general and one the following thematic elements in detail; i) sustainability and life cycle analysis, ii) feedstock extraction/modification, iii) process control and sensing, iv) nanomaterial production and utilization, and v) new product development.  REU funding provided stipends and professional development activities for 30 undergraduates over three years. Additional non-NSF REU funded students participated, including six Chilean studnets on a mutual exchange with six US students, thereby broadening the impact of the REU Site program.  Students were mentored by one of 12 Faculty, all of whom are senior personnel in the FBRI, or at the University of Concepcion-UDT.  The REU culminated with an annual field trip to Chile, involving a research conference where participants presented their work to the Chilean faculty and students. In addition, the field trip included extensive tours of the Chilean forest operations and bioproducts industry-with an emphasis on best practices that complemented those of the US.  A unique set of evaluation and assessment tools were employed throughout the REU program that allowed tracking of student performance both vertically and temporally, thus enabling feedback to students and the program alike.  Intellectual Merit  The focus of the REU on sustainable forest bioproducts is highly topical and of great global importance. Additionally, it built upon substantial research strengths at UMaine. Combined, the participating faculty have mentored over 230 undergraduate students in research and co-authored some 53 publications with undergraduates.  Students and faculty were exposed to an international element which built upon existing research collaborations with Chilean colleagues.  As such, an understanding of the global importance of the research endevour, especially as it relates to sustainable forest bioproducts, was obtained.  Further, participants and research mentors received responsible and ethical conduct of research training through a 2 day intensive workshop.  Broader Impacts  Participants developed and utilized new knowledge to address energy issues impacting society in an ethical manner. The REU Site specifically recruited minorities through extensive use of existing linkages with primarily minority serving institutions.  Results were disseminated via campus, national and international presentations, and through journal articles and symposia.  REU students worked alongside middle-school teachers to create curricular modules that teach STEM principles to middle school children employing the concept of sustainable forest bioproducts as a vehicle.  Participants presented to and interacted with the FBRI and University of Concepcion-UDT faculty, thereby broadening both their and the faculties experiences.  Society benefited as participants disseminated their findings, impacting middles school education, obtaining a broader understanding of research ethics, and further, enrolling in graduate school to advance their careers.  Finally, the international community benefited as the REU participants presented their findings to our Chilean colleagues, while learning of the parallel research performed at the University of Concepcion-UDT.
