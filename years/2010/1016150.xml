<AbstractNarration>Iterative methods for large non-linear systems of coupled equations are often prohibitively expensive.  Such systems frequently result from discretizations of static nonlinear partial differential equations, presenting practitioners with a computational efficiency "bottleneck". &lt;br/&gt;However, in many applications (from robotic navigation to photolithography, seismic imaging, computational geometry, optics, differential games, and segmentation of images) the direction of "information flow" can be used to successively eliminate or at least significantly decrease the coupling of equations, resulting in efficient (often non-iterative) numerical methods.  The related notion of "causality" provides an a priori unobvious yet natural ordering of the elements of computation.  The primary investigator and his collaborators have previously introduced such causal algorithms for problems in anisotropic &amp; hybrid deterministic control and for approximations of geometrically stiff invariant manifolds.  Currently, the primary investigator develops efficient algorithms for a wider class of "structurally causal" stochastic problems on graphs and in continuous domains.  This includes important special types of uncertainty &amp; stochasticity as well as optimal control problems with multiple length scales.  The investigator and his colleagues also use approximations of Lagrangian manifolds to build efficient methods for recovering multivalued solutions of nonlinear first-order PDEs -- a problem of high practical importance in dispersive waves computations, multiple-arrival seismic imaging and tomography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real-time answers to many important practical questions depend on availability of robust and efficient numerical methods for the corresponding partial differential equations.  What is the minimum safe distance for the aircraft collision avoidance?  How should an "idle" ambulance be routed in between emergency calls?  Which trajectory is optimal for a rover traveling on the surface of Mars?  The prior numerical techniques help one answer these questions, but only under unrealistic/idealized conditions: a single criterion (e.g., energy-optimal trajectories only), a known terminal time, a single reliable map of the terrain, etc.  The PI's current work makes a difference in incorporating multiple criteria (e.g., time versus energy versus money) and uncertainty (when will the next emergency call be received?) into the decision making process without excessive computational costs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported development of new and efficient methods for robotics, computational gemoetry, optimal control, transportation engineering, and seismic iamging. The key idea behind our efficiency gains was to exploit the concept of "causality"  -- a property naturally present in many continuous problems, but frequently lost (or under-utilized) when those problems are solved approximately on a computer.   Our methods make it possible to incorporate more realistic features into optimal control problems with only moderate increases to the overall computational cost. What's the best way to route an idle ambulance in between the emergency calls (to minimize the expected waiting time of the first caller) ? What is the best path for a robot avoiding prolonged contiguous exposure to an enemy observer?  What driving directions would maximize the probability of an early arrival while also guaranteeing the arrival before some hard deadline?  How should one plot the path for a sailboat given the statistical information on changing wind patterns? Our recent work provides practitioners with efficient tools to answer these questions.   Seismic imaging practitioners deal with challenging inverse problems that utilize large sets of input data.  Our development of efficient and parallelizable "forward solvers" for Eikonal, HJB, and double-square-root-Eikonal equations will improve the current state-of-the-art tools for traveltime tomography.    Our work on Anytime planning algorithms for robotics enables online re-planning in dynamically changing environments.  Our multiobjective planner on graphs enables practical improvements in autonomous robotic systems navigating in complex urban environments.  Our work on pedestrian flow modeling is expected to improve the algorithms available to traffic/environmental engineers (e.g., for planning evacuation procedures). The award resulted in 5 refereed conference proceedings papers and 9 journal papers (3 of which are still under review).  This work was performed in collaboration with 7 graduate students at Cornell University, 2 postdocs (at UC Berkeley and MIT), the members of the Texas Consortium on Computational Seismology (at UT Austin), and the staff of the United Techologies Research Center.  All junior participants have been trained in the state of the art of numerical methods for optimal control and were encouraged to present our work at major conferences.  They have delivered a total of 14 such presentations at 9 different conferences in the period covered by this award. Simplified versions of several ideas developed in these projects are now incorporated into numerical analysis, mathematical modeling, and PDE courses taught by the PI at Cornell University.
