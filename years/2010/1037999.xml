<AbstractNarration>This planning grant proposal is to advance a very unique and promising collaboration between two institutions well-known for creating innovative approaches to computer supported collaborative activities.  The University of Maryland Human Computer Interaction Laboratory is teaming with Carnegie Hall's educational outreach program to explore and develop prototype tools for social musical interaction.  The project will also explore promising technologies for testing of social interactions through music with the aim of establishing informative metrics.  The overall goal is to discover new directions for future research in an emerging area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of our grant have been three-fold:  1- Scholarly Publication  Last June, we presented to an international audience of researchers who think about education and new technologies how they might consider designing new social networks to highlight cultural awareness.  The result was a paper included in the ACM Digital Library:  Walsh, G., Brown, Q., Druin, A., &amp; Amos, C. (2011). Social networking as a vehicle to foster cross-cultural awareness. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children. (Ann Arbor, Michigan, 2011)     2- Revision of a National Outreach/Education Program  Carnegie Hall's Weil Music Institute has revised the Cultural Exchange Program (http://www.carnegiehall.org/Education/Cultural-Exchange/)  based on our work with them and it is now funded with such support from Sony, MetLife, and US Dept. of State. This research funding from NSF has helped an online community blossom with hundreds of students from India, Mexico, and NY City sharing music, culture, and new ideas about learning.     3- Continued Research in this area  We continue to analyze the rich data in the Carnegie Hall online community as it evolves and changes with new participants and new activities.  It is research we expect will continue to influence educational outreach programs both here in the US and abroad.   We are also leveraging this research in our newest NSF CyberLearning grant (received Fall 2011).  We are now developing an online community with school librarians in Washington DC to support elementary school students' development of their STEM identity.  This has already resulted in another publication that is now in press for School Library Quarterly: "Reimagining the Role of School Libraries".      In all, this small NSF grant has been leveraged in so many wonderful ways to impact new scholoarly research and international educational outreach programs.
