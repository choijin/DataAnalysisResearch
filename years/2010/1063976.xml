<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit: <br /> The research investigates the fact that the spontaneous emission rate of a laser is affected by its surrounding environment. This effect is particularly important when optical modes are sustained in a very small cavity. We developed and characterized metallo-dielectric-semiconductor lasers with submicron size in all three dimensions. Those cavities, which can function at room temperature, are a very good vehicle to study the Purcell effect with the ultimate goal to achieve lasing without threshold. To achieve this goal we designed, fabricated and tested a novel nanoscale continuous wave coaxial metal-dielectric-semiconductor laser that utilizes Purcell effect to operate without threshold at telecommunication wavelength (see primary image). According to classical laser theory, in a nanolaser, too many of the photons would give off their energy as they strike the metal parts of the cavity&rsquo;s walls. Consequently, the device wouldn&rsquo;t support the degree of spatial and temporal coherence needed to spark amplification inside the cavity and emission of a coherent beam. We got the photons moving in the right direction by formulating the device as a coaxial waveguide: in this case, a metallic rod surrounded by an indium-gallium-arsenic-phosphide semiconductor ring that is coated in metal. To form the lasing cavity, the waveguide is capped at both ends with low-index dielectric plugs. One plug, made of silicon dioxide coated in silver, forms a totally reflecting mirror; the other plug, which allows the pump beam to enter and the laser light to escape, is filled with air. This setup is sufficient to ensure that the laser cavity can emit energy only in the transmission mode wherein the amount of light amplification is always high enough to overcome energy losses from the cavity itself. The laser emitted coherent beams when excited by a pump source with an incident power of only 720&nbsp;picowatts (see additional image). The metallic coating around the semiconductor ring serves as a heat sink. Because of the lack of threshold, these devices can be modulated much quicker than the existing lasers, and can thus become a backbone for future communication devices.
