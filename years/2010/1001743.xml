<AbstractNarration>The Atlanta Lecture Series on Combinatorics and Graph Theory is a series of three mini-conferences hosted jointly by Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia State University. As the various areas of combinatorics and graph theory have matured, many new techniques and ground-breaking results have been established. Often these break-throughs are relevant to other areas of mathematics or other disciplines. Techniques and results in combinatorics and graph theory have greatly impacted such fields as computer science, bioinformatics, transportation and communication network theory, topology, algebra and computational matrix theory to name just a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas to be covered by these conferences include, but are not limited to extremal, algebraic and probabilistic combinatorics and graph theory, as well as structural and topological graph theory. These interdisciplinary meetings will focus on the interplay of results across areas including extremal graph and hypergraph theory, random graphs, structural graph theory, topological graph theory, poset theory, probabilistic combinatorics, domination theory and graph algorithms. It is expected that the conference will also promote deeper collaborations among researchers from the surrounding region, as well as build both the knowledge base and set of potential collaborators for participating young researchers and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

The primary goals of the series were to enhance collaborations among researchers in the southeastern United States and focus on the most recent progress in combinatorics, graph theory and their applications.  Each conference featured an invited distinguished lecturer as the leading expert in these areas.  These lectures inspired and provided opportunities for young researchers and graduate students to interact with distinguished senior researchers.  These interactions contributed to the intellectual merit of the conferences.  The objective of the conferences was to provide opportunities to strengthen collaborations among researchers and institutes within the southeast region of the United States. This area hosts more than one-third of the graph theorists in the US and a considerable number of combinatorialists. The institutes hosting these conferences have very diverse backgrounds.
