<AbstractNarration>Abstract: The objective of this research is to develop highly efficient carbon nanotube (CNT) based chemical sensors through in-situ identification and manipulation of defects in the CNT conduction channel. These defects play a central role in CNT electrochemical sensitivity but there has been no rigorous study of how specific defect types and/or distributions affect actual CNT-based devices. The approach is based on a unique and highly integrated process involving micro-Raman spectroscopy, electron microscopy, numeric modeling and microenvironment electrical characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research tackles one of the principle roadblocks to the enormous potential of CNT-based chemical sensors. The intellectual merit includes: (1) the development and evaluation of low-cost CNT-based chemical sensors with improved analyte sensitivity, efficiency and selectivity; and (2) the advancement of nanometrology by combining both fundamental material and device characterization techniques with numerical modeling. This comprehensive three-pronged approach has never been employed to systematically examine CNT conduction channels in actual working devices. The proposed research will provide an in-depth understanding of how these defects affect the performance of working nanodevices and enable a new methodology for characterizing nanoelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The various research activities of this project will involve minority undergraduate students and girls from local K-12 schools through NSF-sponsored LSAMP/REU and Oregon Saturday Academy programs to enable students to learn research skills and to join a competitive workforce in the future. The research findings will be disseminated broadly through journal publications, conference presentations, seminars, and the PIs? websites.</AbstractNarration>
