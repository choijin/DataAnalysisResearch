<AbstractNarration>Wind erosion is a widespread process in both coastal and desert environments where sandy substrates are subject to persistent wind action. The most common aeolian dune landform associated with wind erosion in partially to semi-vegetated sandy terrains is a blowout (e.g., a bowl-shaped depression). Research on blowout evolution and morphodynamics is very limited. Dunefield destabilization following some degree of climate change, in many cases, probably starts with blowout development, and our knowledge of how this occurs, the controls exerted by factors such as rainfall and drought, regional wind velocities, vegetation cover, sediment supply and animal/human disturbance is exceptionally poor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professors Patrick Hesp from the Department of Geography and Anthropology at Louisiana State University and Paul Gares from the Department of Geography at East Carolina University will examine how, and why blowouts are initiated in the Cape Cod region, at what rate blowouts evolve from small to very large forms, what controls the size and morphology of blowouts, what are the thresholds of vegetation cover, wind velocities, surface moisture, and sand wetness that trigger blowout dune development, and control subsequent evolution. A wide range of instruments including cup and sonic anemometers, wind vanes, smoke bombs, sand traps, erosion pins and ground based lidar will be used to measure instantaneous and mean wind velocities, erosion and deposition patterns, and medium term dune changes. An analyses of all aerial photography from the 1940s to present will be conducted to examine dune blowout initiation, seasonal and decadal changes and compare this data with long term climate data to investigate the role of climate in driving dune blowout initiation and development. The data gathered from the aims above will allow a better understanding of (i) the role of climate in blowout initiation and/or stabilization, (ii) the evolutionary stages of saucer and bowl blowouts, and (iii) the typical flow structure and erosional and accretional processes in blowouts of different morphologies. Finally, the data will assist the development of computational and/or physical models of resulting flow and sediment transport dynamics in blowouts, particularly saucer and bowl types. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few studies have ever been conducted on the dynamics of blowouts, yet they are one of the most common aeolian (wind-shaped) landforms in coastal and desert dunefields. This research will provide answers on how and when, and where the blowouts develop. It will improve our understanding of the relationships between climate change and blowout genesis, and will provide a better understanding of how dunes might respond to climate change. It will also improve our understanding of the spatial variation of the turbulent wind flow over complex terrain, and it will contribute to a greater understanding of planetary dune forms. Three graduate students will be trained in aeolian research, geomorphology and instrumentation, and several undergraduate students will be trained in fundamental and applied research techniques. In addition, results will assist management agencies (e.g., Federal parks) because this research will facilitate the development of tools to better manage coast lines, especially in regions experiencing coastal erosion and sea level rise. Results will also be disseminated to the public via a series of posters and booklet on dunes, dune evolution, dune ecology, and the intrinsic value of dunes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Blowouts are ubiquitous features of many of the world?s dune fields, forming as winds scour the dune surfaces.  Starting as small depressions they can evolve into large parabolic forms with long trailing arms, and high migrating central ridges.  In this research we examine how and why blowouts are initiated, using Provincelands dune field at the northern end of Cape Cod as our field laboratory.  We focus on the rates at which blowouts evolve from small to very large forms, the controls on the size and morphology of blowouts, the thresholds of vegetation cover, wind velocities, surface moisture, and sand wetness that trigger blowout dune development, and control subsequent evolution. We utilize data gathered in specific study blowouts to better understand the role of climate in blowout initiation and/or stabilization, to determine the typical airflow structure in blowouts of different morphologies, and to develop computational and/or physical models of resulting flow and sediment transport dynamics in blowouts.  This project observed airflow patterns in saucer blowouts and the topographic changes in and around blowouts over a 5 year period (2011-2016). Airflow was monitored in 5 different experiments at 4 different blowouts conducted in either fall or spring when meteorological conditions were favorable and when vegetation cover would be minimal, which would facilitate the use of laser scanners to survey the topography.  Findings show that small saucer blowouts develop on the leeward side of dune ridges as a result of complex flow patterns that develop as air passes over the ridge.  The small saucers expand both laterally and vertically, and that ultimately results in a ridge breach.  Notching of the ridgeline suddenly facilitates sediment transfer from the windward side of the ridge to the leeward.  New flow patterns associated with the opening produce erosion zones on the backslope, and large amounts of sediment are redistributed across the landscape.  Lobes and stringers of sand are deposited on the leeward side of the dune and often a sand ramp provides a transport route for even the coarsest sediment to deposit outside the bowl.  The results of the research indicate the development, expansion and subsequent breaching of the incipient blowouts has consequences beyond the actual feature.  Sediment transport encompasses a larger section of the dune landscape and impacts local wetland ecosystems.  Deflation of the blowout basin to the water table could also lead to the formation of a swale wetland community and offers a source of freshwater for animals.  Areas on the lee of the dune experience large sediment accumulation, which buries sections of vegetated dune and habitat  This project has proven to be an excellent opportunity for students to experience geomorphological field research and to gain expertise with sophisticated aeolian instrumentation and topographic surveying practices.  Overall, the project has involved a dozen graduate or undergraduate students, some of which have moved on to other graduate programs.  Other students have found jobs thanks to the scanning experiences they have had.  A secondary impact of this project has been the development of a Terrain Analysis Laboratory at East Carolina that provides the facilities in which students can practice the processing of the field gathered data using state of the art software.  Equipment assembled in this Laboratory and the experience gained by our students have led to participation in a wide range of research and educational opportunities not only in earth science but in such fields at archaeology, maritime history, geology, and architecture.
