<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Understanding species coexistence continues to be a fundamental goal in ecology with direct relevance to applied fields such as biodiversity conservation, resource management and restoration. For the practitioner of prairie restoration, knowledge of the different modes of coexistence and their relative importance in developing prairies would be valuable for guiding restoration prescriptions pertaining to site preparation, planting methods, invasive species control and management of disturbance regimes. This project initiates a long-term manipulative field experiment in eastern Kansas designed to evaluate multiple modes of species coexistence and plant community development, including the contributions of niche differentiation, functional similarity of species, spatial structure and initial community states in regulating native species establishment, diversity and species turnover in developing prairie restorations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The project will contribute to the development of the University of Kansas Field Station (KUFS) and complement ongoing research and education initiatives at KUFS in grassland ecology. The PI will continue to facilitate involvement of underrepresented groups through participation in KU student minority programs and provide training for two new PhD students. Undergraduates will participate as student hourly field assistants, KU independent study researchers and REU students. The project will also be utilized by students enrolled in KU Ecology courses and by AP Biology students at Lawrence High School.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Our findings to date show that the extent to which native plant species are spatially aggregated together or segregated from each other at the time of planting has important implications for initial prairie plant establishment and community structure within the developing restorations. We found that spatially uniform plantings of species led to greater overall prairie plant establishment and reduced abundance of problematic weed species compared to plantings where species were arranged into single species patches.  These findings indicate that spatial effects during the first five years of restoration were mediated largely by competitive interactions between the desired prairie species and the weed community, rather than through interactions among the prairie species.  Continued monitoring of our experimental restorations will evaluate the long-term consequences of initial spatial structure on community development s as the weed community diminishes and as interactions among the native prairie species intensify.  Our project has provided broader impacts to society by informing methodologies for the restoration of native plant communities, by facilitating the training, professional development and research of undergraduate and graduate students, by providing opportunities for public education and outreach, and by fostering research collaborations with other ecologists and ecological research networks around the world.
