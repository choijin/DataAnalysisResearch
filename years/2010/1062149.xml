<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;At the request of the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Research Council will establish the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Science Review panel to identify and summarize the high priority science conducted on Antarctica and the surrounding Southern Ocean that will demand attention over the next two decades. The committee will build upon the work of other organizations to: summarize scientific achievements in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean&amp;#894; identify changes to anticipated types and scope of scientific programs for the U.S. in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean over the next two decades; examine appropriate opportunities for international Antarctic scientific collaborations&amp;#894; report any new emerging technologies that could enhance the U.S. ability to meet science priorities; and recommend broad logistical capabilities that, from a science perspective, should be improved. The Panel will deliver its report within 10-12 months of formation. The outcomes of this study will provide input to a companion blue ribbon panel review assessing logistical needs for the USAP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This activity will help ensure that USAP research needs are met in the future. The NRC will ensure diversity in committee membership as well as workshop participants. The resulting report will be disseminated widely.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Future Science Opportunities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean     At the request of the National Science Foundation and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) under the auspices of the National Research Council formed the Committee on Future Science Opportunities in Antarctica and Southern Ocean to identify and summarize the important science conducted in Antarctica and the surrounding Southern Ocean that will demand attention over the next two decades. The Committee built upon the work of other organizations to summarize scientific achievements in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, including those completed during the 2007-2009 International Polar Year and commented broadly on physical infrastructure needs and emerging technologies that will be important moving forward. The CommitteeÆs report was designed to help inform a companion Blue Ribbon Panel review, which will recommend future directions for the logistical planning and operations in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean to support the types of science deemed most important over the coming decades.     The major output of the CommitteeÆs work was a report entitled "Future Science Opportunities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean." The CommitteeÆs report identified important future research directions in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, which emerged in two overall themes&mdash;global change and scientific discovery&mdash; and were framed as a series of eight overarching questions that will drive research over the next 20 years. The major recommendations of the Committee were that the United States should help lead the development of an Antarctic and Southern Ocean observation network with data integration and support the development of scientific modeling of the Antarctic region. The committee also recommended that the United States take advantage of several critical opportunities in collaboration, education, and technology/infrastructure.     The intellectual merit of this activity was derived from its capacity to advance knowledge in Antarctic and Southern Ocean science well into the future. The broader impacts of this study include the guidance given to the enhancement of infrastructure needed to support Antarctic science and ensure that, over time, our significant investments in Antarctic science benefit society. NAS has used, and will continue to use, its tools (e.g., Office of News and Public Information, Congressional Affairs, National Academies Press, websites) to ensure broad dissemination of the CommitteeÆs report both within the United States and internationally.
