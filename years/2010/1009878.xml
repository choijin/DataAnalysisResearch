<AbstractNarration>Dr. McGraw and his collaborators will undertake an observational and instrumental effort to create a series of standard stars whose flux (energy received per second) is accurately calibrated.  The project will include modifications to the Astronomical Lidar for Extinction, an NSF-funded effort to use light scattering from lasers to measure the transmission properties of the atmosphere.  The main goals of the project are to implement the new instrumentation to measure the extinction in the atmosphere to accuracies below 1% (including variations with time, direction, and wavelength), and to obtain simultaneous measurements of candidate standard stars with a spectrophotometric telescope calibrated with standard photodiodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques and instruments developed by this project would have a broad impact to the community, particularly if the instrumentation is duplicated and adopted by other observatories.  This would increase the number of useful nights at major facilities by providing better atmospheric corrections, and would address calibration issues for projects such as surveys for dark energy.  There will also be an extensive effort in workforce development, especially by including undergraduates in several different phases of the effort.  This would target students at the University of New Mexico, a major Hispanic-serving institution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report  Progress towards understanding our universe depends upon astronomical measurement accuracy.The need for accuracy increases as more spectacularly capable ground- and space-based telescopes are brought into service, and data from each are compared, perhaps to determine the magnitude of a distant supernova or the dimming of a star occulted by a planet. Accuracy simply means the ability for two instruments to measure the same thing, the brightness of a star, for example, and get the same answer to within random, but statistically reproducible measurement errors. Accuracy allows astronomers to compare measurements from different sources and repeatably obtain the same result.  Our research resulted in two instruments which, when working together, allow calibration of stars to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Primary Optical Watt Radiometer (POWR), the best conceivable radiometric reference standard for all of astronomy.  The first instrument is the Astronomical Extinction Spectrophotometer (AESoP), shown in appended Figure 1. This spectrometer measures the optical spectrum of a star, which is accurately placed on an array detector (CCD) that has been calibrated to POWR through a two-step NIST transfer standard process.The second instrument, the Facility Lidar Atmospheric Monitor of Extinction (FLAME) accurately corrects the spectrometer observations for the variable transmission of Earth's atmosphere, historically the largest source of error in standard star calibration. FLAME in operation is shown in Figure 2.  Intellectual Merit: Standard stars defined by AESoP, supported by FLAME, will provide the measurement accuracy to address today's most significant problems. Well-recognized examples:  Accurate distances to supernovae that map the accelerating universe energized by the dark energy that constitutes about 70% of the total mass of the universe Accurate distances to Cepheid variable stars used as "standard candles" for investigating the motions and masses of nearby galaxies and clusters of galaxies which appear to host dark matter, the currently unknown source of mass that contributes about 25% of the total mass of the universe Accurate measurement of the sizes and composition of Earth-like planets orbiting other stars   NIST-traceable standard stars will make space- and ground-based observations directly comparable, enabling more fundamental scientific investigations using provably relaible data from various sources.  Broader Impacts: Broadly-based, successful education is a primary impact of our research. The primary example is the student success resulting from this grant. Of the six undergraduate students supported, including women, Hispanic and American Indian individuals, all are continuing in STEM fields with bright futures in fields that they find engaging and about which they are enthusiastic. Four of these six individuals are now in graduate school pursuing PhD degrees.

All of these students acquired experience in the design, construction, control and debugging of "student sized" instrumentation. These are rather unique skills that make experience with our research group more valuable for them and for future employers.  Instruments built for astronomicalresearch can be used to accuratley measure the wavelength- and time-dependent atmospheric absorption and scattering by clouds, aerosols, water vapor, ozone, and other persistent and transient atmospheric constituents, and with extension into the near infrared, direct measurment of the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. These data are useful both for atmospheric physics and quantitative global warming investigations.  Replicated versions of FLAME can be used to measure atmospheric extinxtion for ground-based telescope...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
