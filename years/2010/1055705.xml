<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Wei Zhang of the University of Colorado Boulder is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research to study a novel class of 3-D cage framework materials (CFMs) that can be readily functionalized and modified. The proposed novel strategy would enable efficiently encoding both dimensional (pore size/distribution) and functional information (guest recognition, sensing, catalysis, etc.) into the final frameworks, thus allowing ready access to a variety of CFMs with precisely controlled pore size and surface functionality in a modular fashion. The aims of the proposed research include (a) synthesizing, characterizing, and evaluating new 3-D organic cage molecules as building blocks for construction of porous functional frameworks, (b) studying highly efficient dynamic covalent chemistry that can provide ready access to 3-D functional organic materials with novel properties and applications, and (c) elucidating the structure-function relationship of the new cage frameworks in molecular separation and chemical sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Wei Zhang of the University of Colorado Boulder is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research to study a novel class of 3-D cage framework materials (CFMs) that can be readily functionalized and modified. The proposed research will open many new possibilities for developing novel organic-based nanostructured framework materials that can be used for a number of important applications, such as gas separations (e.g., carbon capture), chemical sensing, and heterogeneous catalysis. Such applications are important for many industrial and environmental goals. The proposed work will also be a platform for providing new opportunities for outreach, education, and minority involvement on multiple levels, including development of a new campus-wide Materials &amp; Nanoscience (M&amp;N) training program. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in multidisciplinary research involving organic, inorganic, materials chemistry and nanoscience.</AbstractNarration>

A powerful aspect of our approach is the modularity, enabling efficient encoding of both dimensional (pore size/distribution) and functional information (guest recognition, sensing, catalysis) of individual cage molecules into final frameworks.   On the road to develop more rigid molecular cages through alkyne metathesis, we have developed a series of highly active and robust molybdenum(VI) carbyne alkyne metathesis catalysts containing multidentate ligands. For the first time, we introduced the podand motif into alkyne metathesis catalyst design. Our catalysts have shown a broad substrate scope and enabled metathesis of multiple challenging substrates, thus opening many possibilities for constructing novel 2D and 3D ethynylene-linked functional molecular architectures with high efficiency.  With our highly active metathesis catalysts in hand, we successfully constructed a series of novel, highly rigid, ethynylene-linked molecular cages (including an interlocked one) in one step from readily accessible precursors.  Among them, a porphyrin-containing cage was found to be an excellent receptor for fullerenes, forming C60@COP complex, which efficiently binds to single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) surface to form a novel type of donor&ndash;acceptor nanohybrids for light-harvesting. The porphyrin cage also shows an unprecedented high selectivity in binding C70 over C60 (KC70/KC60 &gt; 1000), which enables successful separation of C70 from a C60-enriched fullerene mixture through the "Selective Complexation-Decomplexation" strategy. A series of ethynylene-linked porous polymers were also synthesized through alkyne metathesis, which exhibit high surface area and narrow pore size distribution.  23 papers have been published. Invited talks were given at the American Chemical Society (ACS) National Meetings (2011-2015), the 20th International Symposium on Olefin Metathesis and Related Chemistry (ISOM-20, 2013), the 9th International Symposium on Macrocyclic and Supramolecular Chemistry (ISMSC-9, 2014), and the 16th International Symposium on Novel Aromatic Compounds (ISNA-16, 2015).  The knowledge gained in this research opens new possibilities for developing novel organic functional materials (e.g., molecular cages, polymers, targeting gas adsorption and molecular separation applications) by utilizing dynamic covalent chemistry, and it has been integrated into undergraduate- and graduate-level courses. This grant supported four Ph.D. students (one underrepresented female). Eight undergraduate students and three high school students worked on various aspects of these projects.
