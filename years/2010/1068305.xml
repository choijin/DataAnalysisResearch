<AbstractNarration>The focus of our research is to investigate nuclear-hadronic dynamics with a particular emphasis on its relation to quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of quarks and gluons. Of particular interest is studying the role of chiral symmetry, which is one of the basic symmetries of QCD. The effective field theory named chiral perturbation theory offers a systematic and practical framework to translate the symmetries of QCD into those of hadrons, particles that actually constitute atomic nuclei. The proposed research makes extensive use of this formalism. To describe those phenomena that are at present beyond the applicability of chiral perturbation theory, models are used that approximately reflect the symmetries of QCD and that can be applied to complex nuclei. Specifically, it is proposed to study: eonsequences of nuclear chiral perturbation theory as applied to few-nucleon systems; effective-field-theoretical estimation of radiative corrections for weak processes in few-nucleon systems and systematic improvements of the existing theoretical treatments of the muon-deuteron capture reaction and neutrino-deuteron reactions; nuclear chiral perturbation theory applied to inelastic reactions involving rather high energy-momentum transfers; and neutrino-deuteron reactions beyond the pion-production threshold. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effective field theory approach is known to be highly useful in our attempt to relate the properties of atomic nuclei to the underlying dynamics of the quarks and gluons. Our investigations not only deepen the understanding of nuclear-hadron physics but also have important bearing upon nuclear astrophysics and search for physics beyond the standard model. Our study has particularly close connections with the on-going and future neutrino experiments that are meant to look for signals for non-standard physics. The budget allows us to hire a post-doctoral fellow and an undergraduate student to join our research effort.</AbstractNarration>
