<AbstractNarration>Does a second language influence how bilinguals process their native language? The current project examines this, specifically focusing on the way that bilinguals interpret the meanings of words. This project capitalizes on the prevalence of words that can be translated in more than one way across languages. For example, the English words "watch" and "clock" are both translated into Spanish as "reloj". Preliminary research suggests that these words are thought of differently by bilinguals and monolinguals. Therefore, this project tests whether bilinguals consider word pairs like "watch-clock" to be more or less related than monolingual speakers do. Such subtle differences between bilinguals and monolinguals in the meanings they assign to words have consequences for comprehension and production, and also can inform our understanding of the interconnectivity between the two languages of bilinguals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To examine such cross-language influences, the current project employs two methods that allow researchers to examine language processing as it unfolds on a very rapid timescale: eye-movement tracking and brain activity monitoring, which both provide an index of how (or whether) processing is disrupted. In one experiment participants will be presented with English sentences in which, on some trials, a word will be replaced with a word that shares its Spanish translation (for example, "John wore the clock on his wrist"). Bilinguals' and monolinguals' reading behavior of such sentences will be compared. If two words that share a translation become more similar to bilinguals, their reading behavior, as indexed by eye movements, should show reduced disruption to the anomaly compared to monolingual English speakers. In a second experiment, bilinguals will be presented with pairs of words that either share a translation or do not, while their brain responses are recorded. Increased relatedness is expected to facilitate processing of pairs that share a translation compared to pairs with different translations, for bilinguals but not monolinguals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The current study examines language processing by bilingual speakers, and highlights two important ways in which bilinguals differ from monolingual speakers in their interpretation of the meanings of words. The first is that of specific cross-language influences, in that knowledge of another language influences the meaning similarity of words in a single language. In particular, the results show that Spanish-English bilinguals treat two senses of an ambiguous English word (e.g., dinner date vs. expiration date) as more similar in meaning when each of these senses is translated into a different word in Spanish compared to senses of ambiguous English words captured by a joint translation (e.g., both the military and the mathematical senses of the English word operation are captured by 'operaci&oacute;n' in Spanish). Such cross-language influences demonstrate the interconnectivity of the bilingual lexicon, and show that even when bilinguals process words in only one of their langauges, their knowledge of an additional language inevitably influences processing. The second effect is not limited to specific/local cross-language influences but rather stems from a more general influence of bilingualism on semantic processing. In particular, English monolinguals, English-Spanish and Spanish-English participants completed an eye-tracking study in which they were to silently read English sentences that varied in their sematnic anomaly. The results show that whereas reading in the non-native language was associated with slower reading (longer fixations and fewer skips), bilingualism was associated with fewer regressions, suggestive of reduced need for semantic specificiation by bilinguals, and more tolerance for ambiguity in meaning. Together, these findings highlight ways in which bilingual speakers differ from monolingual speakers of both of their languages. &nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/26/2013<br>      Modified by: Tamar&nbsp;Degani</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
