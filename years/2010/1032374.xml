<AbstractNarration>Ocean acidification has been identified as a top priority in oceanographic research, and is a topic of broad societal relevance because of the potential impacts on ocean ecosystems and link to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This award funds a workshop aimed at enhancing interaction among researchers studying the chemical, biological, and physical consequences of past carbon cycle perturbations and their effects on the oceans. The key topics to be addressed are: 1) Physico-chemical changes in the paleocean, 2) Biological consequences of ocean acidification, 3) Confidence in biogeochemical proxies, 4) Suitable time intervals and study locations, and 5) Future goals of paleocean acidification. Participants will cover a broad range of disciplines in Cenozoic paleoceanography and marine carbonate chemistry, and also include researchers with specific expertise in one or more of the focus areas of the workshop. The workshop will stimulate the integration of the geological with other aspects of NSF's newly launched Ocean Acidification program. The results of the workshop will be published in the scientific literature, and the organizers will work with science journalists to disseminate information about ocean acidification to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The oceans act like a sponge to draw down excess carbon dioxide from the air; the gas reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid, which over time is neutralized by fossil carbonate  shells on the seafloor. But if CO2 enters the oceans too quickly, it can deplete the carbonate ions that corals, mollusks and some plankton need for reef and shell-building. That is what is happening today in response to anthropogenic fossil fuel burning.     This grant allowed a team of researchers from five countries to get together for a 3-day workshop, to discuss and review the evidence for ocean acidification over the past 300 million years of Earth history.  Four major extinctions occurred during this vast period of time, some of which have been suggested to be associated with ocean acidification and global warming.     The major outcome of this grant is a study published in the journal Science, which summarizes the evidence for ocean acidification for each of these extinctions and some smaller events. To bear resemblance to modern ocean acidification, the review emphasizes that a paleoevent needs to be of a duration shorter than ~10,000 years.
