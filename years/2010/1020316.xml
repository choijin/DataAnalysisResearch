<AbstractNarration>Research on student learning has developed separate progressions for scientific argumentation, explanation and scientific modeling.  Engaging Learners in Scientific Practices develops a learning progression that characterizes how learners integrate and interrelate scientific argumentation, explanation and scientific modeling, building ever more sophisticated versions of practice over time using the three common elements of sense-making, persuading peers and developing consensus.  The learning progression is constructed through improvements in students' performance and understanding of scientific practice as measured by their attention to generality of explanation, attention to clarity of communication and audience understanding, attention to evidentiary support, and attention to mechanistic versus descriptive accounts. The project is led by researchers at Northwestern University, the University of Texas, Wright State University, Michigan State University, and the BEAR assessment group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two cohorts of 180 students each are followed for two years from 4th to 5th grade in Illinois and two cohorts of 180 students each are followed for two years from 5th to 6th grade in Michigan   The elementary school students will work with FOSS curriculum units modified to embed supports for scientific practices.  Two cohorts of 500 middle school students are followed for three years from 6th to 8th grade as they work with coordinated IQWST units over three years.  The outcome measures include analyses of classroom discourse, pre- and pos-test assessments of student learning, and reflective interviews grounded in students' own experiences with practices in the classroom to assess their growth across the dimensions.  The BEAR team is responsible for validation and calibration of the frameworks and instruments, and design of the scheme for analysis of the data.  Horizon Research performs the formative and summative evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will produce an empirically-tested learning progression for scientific practices for grades 4-8 along with tested curriculum materials and validated assessment items that support and measure students' ability in the scientific practices of explanation, argumentation and modeling.  In the process of development, an understanding is gained about how to design and test this learning progression.  The framework is articulated on a website for use by other researchers and developers.  The project also builds capacity by educating several graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A central strategy for improving science education in the U.S. is to involve K-12 students in the actual practice of building and using scientific knowledge, rather than learning about the science that others have figured out. Learning to engage in science practices, such as developing a scientific argument from evidence, constructing scientific explanations, and developing general scientific models, is challenging for students. This project focused on characterizing what students need to learn in elementary and middle school science classrooms in order to engage successfully in these science practices. The project investigated how students? participation in science practices can become more sophisticated over time, enabling students to build more complex scientific knowledge and use that knowledge to explain more complex scientific phenomena.  The project investigated changes in students? scientific knowledge building work in several longitudinal studies. The project followed several cohorts of students from grades 5 to 6, and followed a cohort of middle school students through three years of middle school, from grades 6 to 8. The project followed students as they worked with science instructional material designed to support them in science practices such as argumentation, explanation, and modeling. These materials presented students with occurrences in the natural world that provided a context for students to explore and develop scientific idea in physical, biological or earth science, such as water evaporating and condensing, odors traveling through air, climate variations with geography and seasons, and growth and changes in populations of living things. The project studied how students learn to develop causal scientific explanations, general scientific models, and evidence-based scientific arguments, and examined how these students became more sophisticated in their performance of these practices over time and across different areas of science. The project also examined teacher and student interactions in classrooms to identify the factors that influence students? participation in these science practices.  The intellectual merit of the project focused on how students could learn to engage more effectively in science practices over time, resulting in the following contributions:  The project developed a framework for characterizing how student participation in scientific practices can become more sophisticated scientifically while also being meaningful to the classroom community of the teacher and students (rather than simply an arbitrary series of steps to perform by rote).  The project developed a model of students? underlying understanding of science practices that can guide their engagement in these practices, including (a) the type of answers scientists develop to address scientific questions; (b) how science ideas should addresses a range of related questions; (c) how science justifies and decides between competing ideas; and (d) how scientific communities use and refine their knowledge. This model was effective across different science strands (biology, physical sciences, earth science). The project developed a collection of rubrics to assess the sophistication of students? causal (mechanistic) accounts, and used this system to assess how students? explanations became more sophisticated over time. The project identified classroom factors that influenced how students participated in science practices.    The broader impacts of this work include:   Providing teachers and teacher educators guidance about how to support students in science practices through NSTA articles, books, and workshops based on the projects? findings. Providing curriculum developers design guidance for supporting students in science practices in instructional materials from K to 12 based on project findings.
