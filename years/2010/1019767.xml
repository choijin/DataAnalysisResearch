<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt; The intellectual merit and the goal of this activity is not, primarily, to predict the structures of biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids but, rather to improve the potential functions and algorithms to be able to gain an understanding of how inter-residue interactions determine the three-dimensional structure of, for example, a globular protein and the pathways from the unfolded polypeptide chain to the final folded (native) conformation (the protein folding problem).  For such an understanding, use is made of a physics-based approach, i.e., one based solely on the global optimization of a free energy function based on potential energy and on recently-introduced entropy effects (including the role of the solvent) without the use of secondary-structure predictions, homology modeling, threading, etc. The main focus of this project is the extension of the united-residue (UNRES) methodology to treat protein-DNA and protein-protein enzyme-substrate complexes.  To accomplish this there will be the final development of UNRES, the treatment of various environments with UNRES, treatment of protein structures at the all-atom level, the development of a coarse-grained model of nucleic acids, the treatment of protein-nucleic acid and protein-protein complexes, the development of sampling and analysis algorithms and the validation of UNRES and nucleic acid-UNRES protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the project are that the theoretical approach will provide a basic understanding of the conformational thermodynamic, and folding properties of bio-macromolecules and their interaction with each other and will provide training, not only for the co-workers carrying out this research, but also for several postdocs and visiting scientists working together with these coworkers.  A web server (CheShift), available at http://cheshift.com to enable NMR spectroscopists to obtain theoretical C(alpha)-13 chemical shifts to validate their structures, is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is receiving co-funding from the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A protein is assembled as a growing chain of amino acids in a unique sequence on an organ in the cell known as a ribosome.  The sequence of amino acids is determined by the sequence of the elements of the DNA in the cell.  As the growing chain of amino acids comes off the ribosome, it must fold into a unique three-dimensional structure in order to express its biological activity, for example as an enzyme.  In nature, a protein wants to fold to achieve the three-dimensional with the lowest possible energy, as a structure with a biological function.  If the chain does not fold into the correct three-dimensional structure, the resulting mis-folded protein cannot express its proper biological activity.  Futhermore, misfolded biologically-inactive proteins collect as masses on neurons of brain cells, and lead to various diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease.  My research, carried out with several postdocs, with NSF support, is focused on the assumption that the chains of amino acids should avoid misfolded structures.  We carry out the folding process by computing the energies with which the amino acids interact with each other along the chains to fold to the correct structure which should have the lowest energy.  Clearly, it is essential that these computations will yield correctly-folded proteins only if the energies are determined by correct physics.  Therefore, the heart of this research is based on physics to obtain the proper energies with which the amino acids of the chain interact with each other.  A related aspect of my research is to disrupt the aggregates which bind to the neurons in the brain, so that the neurons can recover their biological function and overcome the aforementioned diseases.  Enzymes are used, in theoretical computations to disrupt the aggregates that are blocking the neurons.  The results of these computations, i.e., disruption of aggregates by enzymes, are supported by related experiments carried out by my colleague in the Biology department of our medical school in NYC.  Finally, several of my postdocs have played an important role with experimental demonstrations of physical phenomena for school children and their parents and teachers.  During Outreach programs we performed several chemical experiments for 23 K-12 children and their parents in the Science Center in Ithaca, NY.  Because of the young age of the children, we consulted with employees of the Cornell Center for Materials Research, and chose a series of interesting and engaging but safe experiments, most of which could be done at home with the supervision of their parents.  The experiments included chemical experiments showing catalysis effects (genie in a bottle, elephant toothpaste and volcano).  Additionally, experiments were performed with dry ice, which can be observed in photographs.  Sublimation of dry ice is a great example of the physical reaction of a direct transformation of solid CO2 to the gaseous state, which is harmless and clearly visible to the audience.  These experiments are illustrated in photos 1-6.       Last Modified: 07/11/2016       Submitted by: Harold A Scheraga]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
