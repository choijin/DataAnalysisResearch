<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Joseph Dinnocenzo of Rochester University, to provide fundamental mechanistic insight into the reactivities and reaction mechanisms of group 14 cation radical intermediates. The goal of this work is to elucidate the mechanism(s) for fragmentation reactions of aryltrialkyl-silane, -germane, -stannane, and -plumbane cation radicals.  Professor Dinnocenzo will also develop methods for determining the stereochemical outcome of nucleophilic substitutions on group 14 cation radicals, and investigate the fragmentation mechanism(s) of oligosilane cation radicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research include training opportunities for students, using orbitals and bonds to drive research in organic synthesis resulting in new chemical transformations.  Potential application of this work lies in the field of polysilane photoresists.  Undergraduate participation in this research will be year-round through an established REU program at the University of Rochester.  Dr. Dinnocenzo is actively recruiting from underepresented groups to his laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
