<AbstractNarration>Hurricane Katrina and the breaking of the levees brought national and international attention to Louisiana and the surrounding areas' infrastructure. This dissertation investigates the significance of technology and labor in the making of New Orleans, southern regional commodities, and infrastructure. The project focuses in particular on engineers' use of technology to manage laborers in undertaking the public works projects of New Orleans, including the construction of levees and waterways, railroads, and waterworks. Many of these laborers were enslaved men and women; this project brings their experiences to the forefront. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is based on archival sources such as personal narratives, legislative, municipal, and penitentiary records. These sources situate technology and labor within the context of historical changes in the rationalization of work. The project contributes to technology studies by centering the experiences of men and women in slavery within the social and technological construction of public works to facilitate the production and distribution of commodities and urban infrastructure. Here, the use and experience of technologies literally produce a region. They also shape the practices and meanings of freedom, work, and identity. This dissertation transforms scholarship on technology users, showing how research findings change when conditions beyond markets and consumers are examined.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding from the National Science Foundation allowed Darla Thompson, the graduate student supported by this grant, to undertake archival research in Louisiana that was crucial to the completion of her dissertation. She worked in several archives located at Tulane University, the Williams Research CenterÆs Historic New Orleans Collection, the State Law Library, the New Orleans Public Library, and the Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge. With the help of archivists and research librarians at these institutions, she was able to locate a range of resources documenting New Orleans and LouisianaÆs development from 1805 to 1861.  This dissertation is a social and cultural history of the technologies of control, containment, and punishment that shaped the labor and lives of slaves. By focusing on a range of technologies, Thompson shows how slaves lives, from their individual bodies in punishment collars or chains, to a broader systemic level of modern institutions like the penitentiary and state public works, were shaped by both slavery and technology. Thus, taken together, the people, tools, machines, practices, and institutions, formed a broad system of containment and control that yoked together ancient and modern forms of punishment. Whether slaves were on plantations, urban municipal chain gangs, in the state penitentiary textile factory, or laboring to clear navigational channels for the state, they were enmeshed within a system of labor and punishment focused on the building and maintenance of infrastructure, as well as the production and distribution of local and national commodities.  By analyzing the history of slaves enmeshed within a socio-technical system of control and containment, the dissertation contributes to historical scholarship in the fields of technology and slavery. This work adds to scholarship on materiality and the history of technology, by exploring from the perspective of slaves, the material experience of wearing iron collars. With its emphasis on chain gangs, iron collars, incarceration and public works labor, the dissertation also contributes to literature that demonstrates how the use of tools, machines, ideologies, and practices problematize narratives of modern technological improvement.  The dissertation contributes to the general historiography on slavery in Louisiana by focusing on pre-Civil War chain gang labor in New Orleans and by situating the state penitentiary in Baton Rouge within the context of the consumption, production, and distribution of local and national commodities. The dissertation also brings insights from technology studies to the history of U.S. slavery. By framing iron collars as technologies that shaped the lives of slaves, slaveholders, and others who relied upon their labor, the dissertation challenges historians and others to think about technology more broadly, as involving more than tools and machines.  Thompson has presented parts of her findings at the Gensler Symposium on Feminism in a Global Context at Middlebury College, Cornell University, the Louisiana State University, and annual meetings for the National Council for Black Studies, the Society for the History of Technology, and the Society for the Social Studies of Science.  The dissertation will be completed in the fall of 2013.          Last Modified: 10/01/2013       Submitted by: Darla J Thompson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
