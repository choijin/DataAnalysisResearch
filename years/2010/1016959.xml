<AbstractNarration>This project explores fundamental performance and design issues for unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) communication. It focuses on communication over the public Internet, which is the sharing of widely distributed resources, which are typically owned by different entities, and which typically involve end users' computers acting as both clients and servers.    But the analysis also ranges beyond the scope of the Internet, to the ecology of people and devices connected to the Internet. The project contributes to our ability to measure, design, control, and understand the explosion in P2P communication that is already underway.  There are exciting possibilities on the horizon for more interactive user generated content, interactive gaming, online interactive instruction, and applications to come.   Peer-to-peer communication is likely to significantly alter the structure of the Internet.  There is a tension between the open, uncontrolled aura of P2P systems, and reliability and security concerns.   By providing a better understanding of the capabilities of P2P mechanisms, this research enhances the value of the future Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators study basic aspects of P2P systems in a variety of contexts.  These aspects include: strategies of peer selection and piece selection, push vs. pull, proactive vs. reactive, effects of heterogeneous link and host speeds, the impact of incentive mechanisms, effects of network topology--in particular clustering and reduction of inter-ISP traffic, delay, and coding.   The contexts include file transfer, live streaming video, video on demand, and delay tolerant interactive systems. The approach is to devise and analyze models capturing various combinations of the above aspects and contexts.   The investigators quantify fundamental performance limits, and develop tractable performance analysis and design methods.</AbstractNarration>

The contexts include file transfer, live streaming video, video on demand, and delay tolerant interactive systems.   One contribution was to identify and quantify a potential problem in peer to peer file dissemination systems called the missing piece syndrome. The problem is that, even if the  statistics of the system are symmetric in the pieces, there can be symmetry breaking, with one piece  becoming very rare. If peers depart after obtaining a complete collection, they can tend to leave before helping other peers receive the rare piece.  We found that the problem is less severe if peers exchange files over multiple swarms.   Another contribution has been to devise new algorithms and performance evaluation models which  leverage peer to peer scaling with statistical methods for rank aggregation.  This research builds on preliminary work of R.L. Cruz (INCN, January 2013). Our results, involving model formulation, new algorithms, a performance upper bound and simulations.   The goal is to provide a way for peers to collect and collaboratively filter content in a scalable way, in a distributed system.   The problem combines aspects of distributed caching and content distribution with statistical inference methods.    Among the algorithms for peers to decide what items to download we have devised and evaluated two at the extremes.   One involves all peers saving all rating information they receive and running a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm.  This performance of this algorithm in simulations has virtually no gap to the upper bound, but it is computationally intensive.   The other algorithm, we call the direct recommendation rule involves peers making download decisions based only on the personal ratings of the peers from which they download.  While very simple, the rule implicitly takes advantage of belief propagation and works remarkably well.   For peer populations with possibly diverse interests and community structure, a slightly more elaborate rule called the nearest stored preference vector rule, is shown perform well.
