<AbstractNarration>Medical devices historically have been monolithic units -- developed, validated, and approved by regulatory authorities as stand-alone entities. Yet modern medical devices increasingly incorporate connectivity mechanisms that offer the potential to integrate devices via network/middleware technology into larger systems of cooperating devices. This NSF-FDA Scholar In Residence research project supports interaction by this NSF-supported academic research team with the FDA Center for Device and Radiological Health (CDRH), as well as with a team from the Center for Integration of Medicine and Technology  and a team from the University of Pennsylvania on this problem.  The goal is to move beyond early industrial medical device integration efforts that focus on streaming device data into electronic health records and integrating information from multiple devices into single customizable displays.  The objective of the project is to support frameworks that coordinate the actions of groups of cooperating devices to potentially realize "closed loop" scenarios.  This work is expected to automate clinical workflows by controlling networked devices as they perform cooperative tasks.  The project builds on an open source Medical Device Coordination Framework (MDCF) that has been developed under prior NSF funding. The MDCF includes (a) middleware for integrating medical devices and EHRs and (b) a model-based development environment that could be used to quickly implement medical device coordination applications enabling a "systems of systems" paradigm for medical devices as described above.  The MDCF already includes support for rapid development of component interfaces for medical devices, displays, coordination logic, and clinical decision support modules. This study extends the MDCF for rapid development of requirements documents, hazard analysis, and correctness claims associated with quality assurance techniques including testing, static analysis, and formal verification of coordination applications and their components.  The FDA currently classifies conventional medical devices according to their criticality, but no such scheme exists for device coordination applications. This study is developing a criticality classification scheme for device coordination applications that will provide a structure for regulatory oversight.  The study also is providing infrastructure for rapid development of coordination application assurance cases using safety cases an approach that uses semi-formal notations for structured arguments to document and provide evidence that safety claims for a system are satisfied.</AbstractNarration>

Modern medical devices increasingly incorporate connectivity mechanisms that offer the potential to integrate devices via network/middleware technology into larger systems of cooperating devices.  Initial integration efforts in industry focus on streaming device data into electronic health records and integrating information from multiple devices into single customizable displays.  However, there are numerous clinical motivations for moving beyond this to consider frameworks that coordinate the actions of groups of cooperating devices to realize "closed loop" scenarios, automate clinical workflows by controlling networked devices as they perform cooperative tasks, and even automatically construct and execute patient treatments.   Many challenges presently exist that are preventing this vision of systems of coordinated medical devices from being realized. To provide a research foundation for addressing these challenges, in previous NSF-funded work, Kansas State University and University of Pennsylvania researchers have developed an open source Medical Device Coordination Framework (MDCF).  The MDCF includes (a) publish-subscribe middleware for integrating medical devices and EHRs and (b) a model-based development environment that could be used to quickly implement medical device coordination applications (apps) &ndash; enabling a "systems of systems" paradigm for medical devices as described above.  The MDCF conforms to the ASTM 2761 "Integrated Clinical Environment" (ICE) architecture. Working with clinicians from the Center for Integration of Medicine and Technology and researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, the MDCF development environment was used to build several device coordination applications that were demonstrated at academic conferences and an industrial trade show.  In this NSF FDA Scholar-in-Residence project, a research associate with Kansas State University worked with FDA engineers to develop a prototype development environment for designing and implementing clinical apps.  Several clinical apps including smart alarms for pulse oximetry monitoring and a safety interlock for patient-controlled analgesic (PCA) pumps were used in the evaluation of the work.  The app development environment is based on the SAE standard Architecture and Analysis Definition Language (AADL).  Using AADL, apps were built from components with precisely defined interfaces.  Using the Behavioral Language for Embedded Systems with Software (BLESS), pre/post-conditions and invariants were specified for interfaces, functional behaviors of components were specified, and behaviors were proved to be compliant with interface specifications. AADL was specifically designed to support architecture modeling of systems built on top of safety-critical avionics busses.   Thus, the entire modeling framework works well with the underlying publish-subscribe middleware used in the MDCF.  Moreover, many of the built-in property sets that AADL provides for specifying non-functional properties including quality of service, timing, criticality carry over nicely to support medical device coordination apps.  Based on this experience, general templates and a methodology was proposed for defining ICE apps using AADL.  Regarding broader impacts of the work, the interactions and discussions with FDA engineers led to several academic papers on how (a) artifacts such as requirements documents should be organized to support regulatory submissions for ICE apps and (b) regulatory guidance might be written to support regulatory oversight of ICE apps.
