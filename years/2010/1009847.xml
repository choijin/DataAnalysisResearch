<AbstractNarration>This work builds upon the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) for which the principal investigator had previous support from the NSF. Now the most massive proto-cluster clumps found in that survey are investigated with advanced observational facilities at the highest possible angular resolution from near-infrared through cm-wavelengths These observations are used to learn how massive stars and clusters form in the Milky Way as well as in other galaxies. Understanding the formation of massive stars is a necessary piece in a complete picture of galactic structure and evolution. The knowledge about massive stars is also important in other areas of astronomy, e.g., these stars produce heavy elements through nucleosynthesis, and they play a role in the growth of Active Galactic Nuclei. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two major mechanisms have been proposed for massive star formation: Competitive accretion from a cluster of interacting clumps and isolated collapse of massive cores in a high pressure environment. In this work it is addressed if massive stars form as isolated systems, or if they interact with sibling stars and compete to accrete from their parent clump. This work also leads to a better understanding of the role of feedback such as outflows and UV radiation on subsequent star formation in the clump. Other questions addressed by this work are what determines the number of stars formed and the upper stellar mass-limit, and what conditions lead to unbound OB associations versus gravitationally bound clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The observations target the Galaxy's most massive star-forming regions at high spatial resolution and will use the Apache Point Observatory (APO), the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA), the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA), the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and adaptive optics on telescopes such as Gemini. A large amount of data is already available and a significant part of the program is for new observations with the most advanced instruments and telescopes. Several of these instruments have been developed with funding from the NSF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target list includes the two nearest active, high-luminosity sources, Orion A and Cepheus A, where several of the observing methods have been demonstrated and evidence of significant dynamical interactions has been discovered.&lt;br/&gt;This project involves a large team of researchers which strengthens the academic network infrastructure. Two graduate students work on their doctoral theses as part of  this project, and there are opportunities for more graduate- and undergraduate student participation. The graduate students will also be actively involved in the outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A s part of this work the principal investigator implements an undergraduate research program at Sommer-Bausch Observatory (SBO) in Boulder. This introduces physics and astronomy undergraduate students from the University of Colorado to photometric monitoring of young stars in the closest star-forming regions that are sufficiently un-obscured to permit observations at visual wavelengths with the 24" SBO telescope.  Stunning images are expected from this project which find use in popular talks at Fiske Planetarium and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, and which are to be disseminated via the internet and Fiske planetarium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aims to distinguish between competing theories of massive star formation; competitive accretion from a cluster of interacting clumps and monolithic collapse of massive cores in a high pressure environment.    The analysis of Galaxy's most massive star-forming regions were based on the 1.1 mm Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) and the 60 to 500 mm Herschel Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL).     Adam Ginsburg (2013, ApJS, 208, 14) completed the l = 1.1 mm V2.0 BGPS Version 2 reduction pipeline. FITS files and updated source catalogs have been released to the public (http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/BOLOCAM_GPS/).      Beam-matched observations of the 2 and 6 cm transitions of formaldehyde of BGPS clumps seen as absorption against background continuum emission from the cosmic microwave background or continuum emission are sensitive to the volume density of the gas along the line-of-sight.    Much of the absorption toward the HII regions sampled were found to arise from very dense molecular gas with n(H2) &gt; 105 cm-3.      Young massive clusters (YMCs) that represent the high-mass end of Galactic cluster and OB association formation contain more than 104 Solar masses in stars.  The Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy contains several compact clouds with masses larger than 105 Solar masses and sizes less than a few parsecs with properties thought to be suitable for formoimg a YMC.   A search for such massive proto-cluster clumps in the Northern Galactic plane found none (Ginsburg et al. 2012, ApJ, 758, L29 ).  YMCs in the Galactic plane may form over time from the merger of smaller, co-eval clusters dragged in by converging flows.  If massive proto-cluster clump exist in the Galactic disk, their pre-star-forming phase must be shorter than 0.5 million years.     Almost all recent and ongoing star formation in the Central Molecular Zone occurs in an elliptical ring of gas and dust with a radius af about 100 pc orbiting the Galactic center (Molinari, Bally, Testi et al. 2011, ApJ, 735, L33).    While most of the dense molecular gas which makes up the CMZ is located at positive longitudes and positive radial velocities, the majority of 24 mm sources detected by Spitzer are located in  the interior of the 100 pc ring  and at negative longitudes, and avoid the dense CMZ gas.   The star formation law found for nearby galaxies may not apply to the CMZ.    Gas at Galactic longitudes higher than 0.9 degrees is mostly devoid of star formation despite its high density.    The large amount of gas above the threshold density suggested by Lada, Lombardi, and Alves (2010, ApJ, 724, 687) suggests that the star-formation relations  that require a modification that takes into account additional parameters such as cloud line-widths and escape speed.     Bressert et al. (2012, ApJ, 758, L28) argue that in the presence of ionization feedback from massive stars,  high star formation efficiency  required for form a gravitationally bound open star clusters requires that the gravitational escape speed be larger than  the 10 km/s, the sound speed in photo-ionized gas.   Thus, photon-ionization feedback will not stop star-formation by blowing out the parent cloud;   star formation can continue until converts more than 30% of the parent clouds mass into stars,  sufficiently high SFE to leave behind a bound open star cluster.   Clumps which fail to have a sufficiently large escape speeds will tend to form expanding associations.      Cara Battersby used radio interferometry to provide evidence for distributed massive star formation along converging filaments.  John Bally joined a team to use the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to observe a compact 105 Solar Mass clump in the Central Molecular Zone, finding that despite satisfying the Bressert et al. (2012), it is currently NOT forming a young massive cluster.      Near-infrared images of massive star-forming complexes near the Sun (within 2.5 kpc) were obtained with the wide-field NEWFIRM...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
