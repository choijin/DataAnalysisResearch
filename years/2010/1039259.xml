<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of a Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometer (LC ESI-MS) at Hiram College. The new LCMS system provides a unique way to elucidate the structure of molecules in complex experiments, and will help faculty at Hiram College to identify fatty acids in biological samples (plasma &amp; insects), detect secondary plant metabolites, analyze large chlorinated compounds, and differentiate metabolic profiles of wild-type and mutant Xenopus.  The research projects at Hiram College are at the forefront of their respective fields and will be used as a training ground for undergraduates both in classroom courses and independent research projects.  The LCMS will be used as part of a collaborative program at Hiram College, "Research in the Classroom," that allows students to experience real world research problems as part of their coursework.  Such an approach fosters independent thought within each student in the classroom as they conduct their research in the field or in the lab.  Results from the studies conducted with the LCMS will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
