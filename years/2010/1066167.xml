<AbstractNarration>This NSF award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program supports work to develop effective stem cell technologies to repair damaged bone by gaining insight into the heterogeneity of bone marrow-derived, human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) at the cellular and molecular levels.  MSCs are a promising source of adult stem cells for bone formation (osteogenesis) and are composed of a mixture of highly regenerative and more lineage-committed cells.  At present, the underlying heterogeneity of MSCs is generally not considered in the development of cellular bone therapies with implanted MSCs and molecular therapies to augment bone formation by MSCs.  This project challenges the current approach by suggesting that the extent of osteogenesis in a heterogeneous MSC culture is a function of its cellular composition and molecular crosstalk among the cell populations.  At the cellular level, an objective of this project is to develop a method to enrich highly regenerative MSCs to enable consistent and rapid production of effective MSC therapies to treat bone defects and other disorders.  At the molecular level, computational modeling will be employed to resolve a network of Wnt pathways essential to bone formation and, in so doing, identify new pharmacological agents to enhance the effectiveness of MSCs to repair damaged bone.  These research objectives are integrated with educational objectives to provide interdisciplinary training for graduate students through a unique bioengineering curriculum and collaborative research; interest high school students in science, technology, engineering and math through outreach programs sponsored by Tulane University; include underrepresented groups in these endeavors, and broadly disseminate project results to students, scholars and the public at large.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are being harnessed to develop a broad range of cellular therapies to regenerate damaged tissue.  A current barrier to realizing the therapeutic potential of these adult stem cells is the intrinsic heterogeneity of MSC cultures, which results in substantial variation in the effectiveness of MSC therapies.  Past research to identify biomarkers to resolve MSC heterogeneity was largely unsuccessful because the indeterminate composition of the overall MSC culture obscures variation in biomarker expression.   Using a quantitative systems approach, the PI and her research group successfully identified cell-surface proteins as biomarkers that select for specific cell populations in heterogeneous cultures of MSCs harvested from human bone marrow.  One set of biomarkers isolates highly proliferative multipotent MSCs; the other, MSCs at an early stage of aging.  The key to this success was to separate the complex system of heterogeneous MSCs into groups with similar function using innovative technologies developed in the PIÃ†s laboratory.  Patterns in biomarker expression were clearly evident in these well-defined cell groups.   The cell-surface proteins identified in this project are among the first biomarkers to resolve MSC heterogeneity.  In particular, this research identified the first cell-surface marker of an aging phenotype for any type of stem cell.  These biomarkers are under investigation to elucidate new signaling targets to regulate MSC function.  Moreover, the biomarkers will enable rapid and inexpensive enrichment of MSC populations for the production of MSC therapies with consistently high efficacy. The enrichment strategies developed for this project are relevant to a variety of MSC therapies given the broad range of regenerative properties of these adult stem cells.   The broader impacts of this study extend to other types of stem cells because all stem cells are intrinsically heterogeneous. This project developed human resources by (1) forging a new collaboration among the investigators and supporting the research training of a postdoctoral fellow, (2) providing interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students through a unique bioengineering curriculum and collaborative research, and (3) fostering the interest of middle-school students in stem cell technology with hands-on laboratory tutorials.  Through this and other outreach activities, project outcomes were broadly disseminated to students, scholars and the public at large.
