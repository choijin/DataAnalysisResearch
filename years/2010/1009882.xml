<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: M31 Satellites Past and Present&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 1010039, Puragra Guhathakurta, University of California-Santa Cruz (lead)&lt;br/&gt;AST-1009882, Steven R. Majewski, University of Virginia Main Campus&lt;br/&gt;AST-1009973, James Bullock, University of California-Irvine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a comprehensive study of the formation and evolution of the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of Andromeda (M31). These satellites within the Local Group include the least luminous galaxies known and they can be explored to test ideas about star formation in the smallest dark matter halos and at the earliest times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extensive data sets on the resolved stellar populations of M31 satellites are combined with state-of-the-art galaxy models in order to learn how the dynamical -, merger -, assembly -, star formation -, and chemical enrichment histories of the current and past M31 satellite systems fit together in the context of the general paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation. The data for M31 are compared to the satellites and halo population of the Milky Way galaxy for which were previously studied by the investigators. The Milky Way and M31 are both spiral galaxies but have different populations of satellite galaxies for which an explanations needs to be found. The additional data for M31 are important for evaluating solutions to the ?missing satellites problem? in Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (CDM) simulations, where the number of subhalos is predicted to be higher than the number of observed satellites. So far the Milky Way is the only system for which the comparison to models can be made which will change when the results of this study are available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three principal investigators have a standing collaboration and they have initiated the SPLASH (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo) survey with previous support from the NSF. The methods and techniques used here are well established in this collaboration. The SPLASH survey uses the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) on the Keck II telescope and the 4-m telescope with Mosaic CCD wide field Imager at Kitt Peak National Observatory. The survey extends to study red giant branch stars in more satellite galaxies of the Andromeda system. The group has already 139 DEIMOS masks (about 20,000 spectra) and spectroscopy of M31 red giant candidates selected from the imaging data. The goal is to observe another 135 DEIMOS masks to obtain spectra of more than 100 member red giant stars in each of the known and any newly found dSph satellites of M31. Further spectra are thought for about 3,000 stars in M33, a low-luminosity disk satellite interacting with M31; and about 1,000 stars in the NE shelf which is tidal debris from a past M31 satellite associated with the Giant Southern Stream in M31.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One part of the work combines spectral and photometric diagnostics to isolate M31 red giants efficiently. Further there are measurements of precision stellar velocities to derive velocity dispersions in dwarf galaxies and tidal streams, which are both kinematically cold subsystems. Measurements of elemental abundances from moderate resolution co-added spectra tare used o constrain the chemical enrichment/star formation histories of M31 satellites. Theoretical models are used to determine the dark matter mass of each dwarf satellite galaxy in M31 to place the observations within a cosmological framework. This will give more data to decipher how the evolution of the Milky Way and M31 can be described in the context of Lambda-CDM cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work provides another data set for a galaxy system to test Lambda-CDM cosmologies. This will have a broad impact on other fields. The DEIMOS-derived chemical abundances are of interest for stellar population studies community. The new analytical methods developed here provide a foundation for similar studies of resolved stars in other stellar systems, including more distant galaxies to be targeted with the next generation of telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students are participating in the research activities and graduate students work on parts of this project for their theses. This will help to train the next generation of scientists. The researchers make efforts to speak in K-12 classrooms and to reach out to underrepresented high-school and undergraduate students. Research results about the well-known large spiral galaxy Andromeda are well suited to be incorporated into public lectures and presentations which are given by the team members on a regular basis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The sponsored project is a comprehensive study of the formation and evolution of the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), both past and present. These satellites include the least luminous galaxies known and they can be explored to test ideas about star formation in the smallest dark matter halos and at the earliest times, as well as how large galaxies grow by the cannibalization of these systems.  This project is foused on looking at the present family of M31 dSphs, which are future victims of M31 cannibalization, as well as the stars in the halo of M31, which represent an amalgam of previous cannibalizations of former M31 dSphs.   As part of this project, extensive data sets on the resolved stellar populations of M31 satellites as well as the M31 halo are combined with state-of-the-art galaxy models to learn about the dynamical merger/assembly and chemical enrichment histories of the current and past M31 satellite systems and how they fit together within the context of the general paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation.  The data for M31 are compared to the satellites and halo population of the Milky Way galaxy -- two systems that are both spiral galaxies but have somewhat different populations of satellite galaxies for some reason.  Prior to this work, the Milky Way was the only system for which a detailed comparison of satellites to models could be made.  The three principal investigators have a standing collaboration initiated as part of the SPLASH (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo) survey with prior support from the NSF. The methods and techniques used here are now well established and focused on spectroscopic data collected with the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) instrument on the Keck II telescope, following up on the selection of M31 red giant star candidats identified through photometric surveys with the KPNO 4-m telescope and Mosaic CCD wide field Imager at Kitt Peak National Observatory.  Whereas previously SPLASH focused on M31 halo field stars, the current project sought to extend that work to red giant branch stars in satellite galaxies of the Andromeda system, as well as over even larger radial coverage of the M31 halo.  The latter data have the additional advantage that they enable measurement of the transverse motion of the M31 system, an important datum for understanding the future of the Local Group.  By the end of this grant we had nearly doubled the number of M31 spectra in the SPLASH database, and photometrically covered 72 different fields with large area, three filter imaging.  A number of analyses of the chemical and kinematical content of the M31 halo field and the dSph satellites were undertaken with these data.  These results were unique because the new spectra and photometry collected for this funded project allowed us to sample the stellar halo of M31 to 120 kpc with the largest sample of stars to this radial extent for any galaxy (including the Milky Way).  Moreover, the UVa group took advantage of this large angular coverage to measure the transverse motion of M31 with a precision comparable to that of other methods used to derive this very elusive parameter.  Knowing the M31 motion in full 3D gives insights into the internal dynamics of the Local Group, specifically M31's orbit about the Local Group barycenter and the future M31 merger with the Milky Way.  In addition, we used the extensive photometric data we obtained of the M31 satellites, guided by the extensive database of spectroscopically confirmed stellar members, to conduct the most comprehensive assessment of the photometric properties of the M31 satellites, including new assessments of their shapes, sizes and distances.   The research was driven to a large part through undergraduate and graduate student involvement. Students were involved as meaningfully as possible in all stages of the project, from planning proposals, data acquisition, data analysi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
