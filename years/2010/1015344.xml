<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health issue, and the emergence  of multiple drug resistant (MTR) strains has decreased the efficacy of traditional  front-line drugs, increasing the length and cost of treatment, and the urgency  for eradication.  Traditional therapy involves frequent high doses of multiple  drugs which dissolve and are distributed throughout the body, but this method  of drug delivery is inefficient in many ways. With the development of nanoparticle drug delivery systems it is now possible  to build customizable particles which carry thousands of molecules and specifically  deliver drugs to a target site, limiting systemic distribution.  However, the administration  of nanoparticle formulations remains a developmental challenge.  The objective of  this research is to develop a carrier, which incorporates nanoparticles in "fruit  jello" architecture.  The carrier particles are to designed to efficiently deliver drug via  inhalation to the lungs, the site of infection in a majority of TB cases, and subsequently  dissolve away, leaving behind the nanoparticles, to be taken up into infected cells. This research brings together groups with individual expertise that synergistically fit  together to contribute to the fields of both particle engineering and drug delivery. The  PrudÃ†homme laboratory at Princeton University specializes in particle engineering on the nano scale using a novel process called Flash NanoPrecipitation.  The Chan research  group at the University of Sydney has expertise in the spray drying of pharmaceuticals  suitable for inhalation. The collaboration under this EAPSI funding to combine nanoparticles and mannose matrix phases via spray freeze drying to create inhalable carriers for  nanoparticles is a new area of research collaboration between the groups. This initial stage of research explored the use of mannose, an inexpensive simple sugar,  to form carrier particles by rapidly freezing a liquid spray over in a cryogenic fluid.   The frozen droplets were dried by lyophilization and characterized to determine the  fraction of the inhaled dose that is delivered to the lungs.  The two significant findings from  this research were (1) the amount of the powder administered to the lungs can be tailored  by controlling the amount of mannose in the aqueous droplets during the freezing step  and (2) as high as 60% of the test dose had the appropriate properties for lung delivery,  which implies improved localization of anti-TB drugs at the infection site over traditional  oral administration.  The next steps for this research are includes the administration  of the carriers, loaded with nanoparticles, to investigate toxicity and evaluate gained  therapeutic advantages in an animal model. Increased international travel dictates that even developed countries must be prepared  for the incidence of MDR-TB, which makes this research timely for both under developed  nations, which requires minimizing the cost of each dose, as well as in the US and Australia,  where  limiting the duration of therapy has major implications in the associated cost of  health care. The drivers are different in the different contexts, but the need for the  innovative research sponsored by this EAPSI grant is substantial in either case.
