<AbstractNarration>The objective of this activity is to provide support for up to ten students from U.S. universities to attend the 2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems (ICWITS).  The conference will be held August 28 - September 3, 2010 at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu, Hawaii. Three IEEE societies, AP-S, MTT-S, and ComSoc, are co-sponsoring the conference.  The conference agenda includes five plenary sessions and over 20 technical sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The conference will provide a unique forum for leading researchers from different disciplines to meet and discuss a future vision for the wireless technology and define integrative approaches for addressing future research challenges.  Topics covered by the conference include microwave devices, and components, antennas, propagation, and communications technologies such as digital signal processing, networking protocols, and networking infrastructure. Graduate student participation is very significant as they represent the future leadership in developing this technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Support for conference participation is open to U.S. students who are currently enrolled in a Ph.D. degree program through a nation-wide competition.  Submission to the travel support competition from underrepresented minority students and women is encouraged.  Student participation at the conference will help with maintaining and fostering a pool a trained engineers and scientists in microwave engineering, antennas, and wireless communications. The conference proceedings will be published and distributed on CD and also posted on the IEEE Xplore. This will help with the broader dissemination of the information presented and topics discussed in the conference.</AbstractNarration>
