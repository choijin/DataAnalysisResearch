<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop roll-to-roll processing of highly efficient, thin film photovoltaics on inexpensive polycrystalline substrates.  The innovation lies in an architecture that yields near-single-crystalline thin films even on polycrystalline substrates.  This innovation will be combined with the benefits of hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) for Si film deposition.  A key objective of this project is to demonstrate a high-rate HWCVD process for epitaxial Si layer on single-crystalline-like templates to fabricate high-efficiency solar cells on metal substrates.  A strong emphasis will be placed on minimizing sources of defects and developing a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of these parameters on structural, electronic and photovoltaic properties of epitaxial thin film heterostructures.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a viable solution that enables high efficiency and low manufacturing cost without using scarce materials in Photovoltaics devices.  In addition to commercial potential, a strong understanding of the mechanisms of epitaxial growth, grain boundaries, and defect generation and propagation is expected to be derived from this work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit of Project:  The objective of this project was to identify, investigate and control key elements of science to enable roll-to-roll processing of highly efficient, thin film photovoltaics (PV) on inexpensive polycrystalline substrates. Thin film solar cells offer the advantage of low-cost fabrication, but have not yielded the higher efficiencies of single crystalline cells.

This innovation was combined with the benefits of hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) for Si film deposition. The benefits of HWCVD include scalability, efficient raw materials use, high deposition rate and low process temperatures.  The following major technical successes were achieved in this program  Buffer layers with good crystalline quality and biaxial texture were successfully grown on metal substrate at the University of Houston. Intermediate buffer layers with crystalline quality and biaxial texture adequate for silicon growth has been demonstrated at the University of Houston. Silicon epitaxy by HWCVD was achieved on germanium terminated Hastelloy metal substrates by Ampulse Device processing of epitaxial silicon on metal foils was developed and optimized and solar cells were fabricated and tested by Ampulse.   Broader Impacts/Commercial Potential of Project:  Solar energy has the potential to meet the entire global energy consumption, but solar electricity is still 5 to 10 times more expensive than fossil-derived electricity and constitutes only about 0.1% of total source of all energy produced. Current solar cell manufacturing processes suffer from energy-intensive and high manufacturing costs or low efficiencies or employ scarce materials. Our project of thin film PV on single-crystalline-like flexible metal substrates is a viable solution that enables high efficiency, low manufacturing costs (&lt;$0.50/W) and does not use scarce materials. This project addresses the nationÆs energy crisis but also environmental concerns and in particular, CO2 emission.  In addition to commercial potential, a strong understanding of the mechanisms of epitaxial growth, grain boundaries, and defect generation and propagation were derived from this work and would have a broad impact beyond this project. Furthermore, this project has shed light on mechanisms of intricate interplay among materials structure and the governing photovoltaic thin films properties.
