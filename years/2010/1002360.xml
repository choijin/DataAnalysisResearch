<AbstractNarration>The Advancing Women in Automation, Robotics, and Engineering (AWARE) Summer Camp targets girls ages 10 to 14 (5th through 8th graders). For one week, these girls come to this campus to learn about automation, robotics, and engineering through a variety of group discussions, teachings, industry speakers, hands-on laboratory activities, and competitions. Camp participants take field trips to regional industries and a local university, emphasizing the cooperative roles for industry and education in advancing the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. Previous research shows a need to start recruiting women at an early age to enter into a typically male-dominated, non-traditional career. A marketing campaign, in collaboration with regional school systems, is being launched in order to increase female participation in these fields. A mentoring program developed during summer camp is continued throughout the school year among participants and mentors. The project enhances the partnerships among regional educational institutions and industry. It improves diversity in STEM-related fields by promoting and advancing the interests of girls and women in robotics, automation, and engineering. The results of the summer camp, as well as the results from the marketing campaign, are disseminated via workshops, conferences, publications, and websites to other community colleges, high schools, and middle schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

A.W.A.R.E. Camp Staff included instructors, mentors, and industry professionals.  Participants also interacted with women in industry during activities such as Robot Building, Group Discussions, and Team Building Exercises. Perhaps, most influential were the six camp counselors, who assisted the campers in Picocricket Programming, SnapKit Circuit Building, Robotic Games, and Programming an Industry Robot.  Erica, a returning counselor, is a 2011 Pitt Community College graduate with an AAS in Architectural Technology.  She is planning on pursuing her Bachelor's of Science degree in Construction Management at East Carolina University.  Upon completion of her BS from ECU, Erica then has plans a move to Charlotte, NC for a career or possibly continuing her education at UNC-Charlotte in Civil Engineering.   Iesha will graduate this year with an AAS in Electronics Engineering Technology.  She has furthered her education at PCC by earning her Computer Technology Certificate and Automation/Robotics Certificate.  Upon graduation from Pitt Community College, Iesha plans on working as a Biomedical Technician in a hospital where she will repair hospital equipment ranging from heart monitors to x-ray machines. Synora is a Junior Bio-Process student enrolled at East Carolina University.  Synora was chosen to participate in the Armed Forces' Student Environmental Trainee Engineering internship program at Fort Bragg.  She has always dreamed of being an engineer and plans to pursue a Master's Degree in the future and hopes to work with an on-base Engineering Division someday. Sara is a first year student in the Architectural Technology Program at Pitt Community College.  Sara has shown an interest in structures since her childhood years and chose to currently pursue her education at PCC followed by applying to North Carolina State University.  Through her education, she has found a passion for building design and functionality.  She aspires to practice as an architect someday. Kristin is currently enrolled at ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
