<AbstractNarration>A Parallel Reconfigurable Observational Environment (PRObE) supports research on future supercomputing architectures. PRObE provides a needed and unique infrastructure to the low-level systems research community to study scaling (number of threads, nodes, and processors per node) and other challenges facing future supercomputing architectures. This infrastructure fills a well known significant long standing research facilities gap in the nation?s capabilities by creating a very large shared resource for systems and low-level research that allows fault injection, power control, controlling the entire resource down to the hardware, and providing direct hands on control of the resource. &lt;br/&gt;The unique capabilities of PRObE open up new opportunities for research and hands-on experimentation that is was previously not feasible in the academic community. Using PRObE the low level systems research community is developing an improved understanding of the systems-level challenges for high-end computing, and the creating effective techniques to address them.  PRObE creates new research opportunities for the academic community that has the significant potential to have a transformative impact on future supercomputing architectures.  &lt;br/&gt;PRObE  provides an internship program and an annual summer school for hands-on training for visiting students on HEC systems using the Probe testbed.  The proposed effort includes special attention to students from underrepresented groups, incorporating populations local to the New Mexico location.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed infrastructure has the potential to facilitate the development of advances in basic knowledge required for the US to maintain its leadership positions in computing systems, data-intensive cloud computing, and data center automation.</AbstractNarration>
