<AbstractNarration>In all living organisms, the biosynthesis of DNA (during cell division or chromosome repair) requires four building blocks, collectively called deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). Chemically, the dNTPs (also called deoxyribonucleotides) are phosphorylated derivates of the four corresponding deoxyribonucleosides (deoxyguanosine, deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine and thymidine). The biological synthesis of dNTPs is absolutely dependent on an enzyme (ribonucleotide reductase, RNR), which reduces ribonucleotides to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides. This reaction is essential for the de novo synthesis of DNA, and so RNR is an essential enzyme in virtually all organisms. The activity of RNR and the expression of the genes encoding the two subunits of the enzyme are tightly regulated. These regulatory mechanisms ensure that the cell is provided with a balanced supply of the four dNTPs, and that the pool of dNTPs is matched to the requirements of DNA synthesis and repair. Bacteria typically produce more than one type of RNR. For example, in the model bacterial species Escherichia coli, there are three RNRs: NrdAB requires molecular oxygen and is essential for growth under aerobic conditions; NrdDG is oxygen-independent and essential for anaerobic growth; NrdEF is expressed in response to various stresses and may be required to supply dNTPs for DNA repair processes. The genes encoding these three enzymes are all subject to negative regulation by a transcriptional repressor designated NrdR. It is believed (though not proven) that NrdR represses expression of the RNR-encoding genes in response to high levels of dNTPs. Thus, NrdR is likely to be a key component of a homeostatic feedback loop, in which production of the RNRs is down-regulated when cellular dNTP concentrations are high. In this project, the mechanism of the E. coli NrdR protein will be investigated. The affinity of NrdR for different nucleotides and deoxynucleotides will be measured, and their effects on the DNA-binding activity of NrdR evaluated. Structural properties of NrdR, and the complex that it forms with DNA from the promoter regions of the RNR-encoding genes will be investigated by electron microscopy and by X-ray crystallography. The contribution that NrdR and other factors make to the regulation of expression of NrdEF by oxidative stress will also be explored. Collectively, these studies will lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of NrdR, and the role that it plays in controlling the expression of the genes encoding RNRs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will further understanding of a fundamental biological process, that is the biosynthesis of the monomeric precursors of DNA, an essential prerequisite to chromosome replication and cell proliferation. The research will involve the training and teaching of post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate researchers. Undergraduates will have opportunities to participate directly in laboratory research, by taking credit-bearing research courses, and through participation in Institute-funded research opportunity programs. There will also be opportunities for high school students participating in summer semester research opportunity programs. The principal investigator participates in programs aimed at establishing mentoring relationships with high school teachers and students, and programs that mentor and provide research experiences for microbiologists from underrepresented groups, and will develop outreach activities in a local elementary school. Results of the research will be published in international peer-reviewed journals, and will be disseminated at national and international conferences. As appropriate, results will also be published in non-technical literature and online, and will be disseminated to the broader community with the help of the UT Dallas Office of Communications. Graduate and undergraduate students will attend meetings of professional societies, and will present oral and poster communications of the results of their research. The Texas Branch of the American Society for Microbiology is extremely active, meets twice a year, and provides a supportive environment in which graduate and undergraduate researchers can present their results and network with peers and other academic scientists. Graduate students will be encouraged to participate in the teaching of undergraduates and high school students, by acting as Teaching Assistants in undergraduate courses and as mentors in the lab.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are enzymes found in all organisms and are required for the reduction of nucleotides to deoxynucleotides.  As such, RNRs provide the building blocks for DNA replication and repair, and so are essential for life.  At least three biochemically distinct families of RNR have been described; members of these families differ in their cofactor requirements and reaction mechanisms.  Interestingly, amongst bacteria, it is common for members of a species to express multiple RNRs from different families.  In the few cases that have been studied, it seems that the potential to express distinct RNRs provides the organism with the ability to adapt to different nutritional environments.  Thus, the question of how the expression of the different RNRs is regulated assumes particular importance.  This project used the well-characterized bacterium Escherichia coli as a model for understanding the regulation of expression of the genes (called nrd) that encode RNRs.  E. coli expresses three RNRs encoded by genes designated nrdAB, nrdDE and nrdHIEF.  Only one protein is known to regulate expression of all three RNRs, that being a regulator of transcription designated NrdR.  Despite being widely distributed amongst bacterial species, relatively little was previously known about the mode of action of NrdR.  A model described in the literature posits that NrdR down-regulates (represses) transcription of the nrd genes in response to elevated levels of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP).  Thus, a product of the RNR catalyzed reaction serves to lower the expression of the nrd genes, which is an intellectually satisfying negative feedback loop.  Despite the physiological reasonableness of this model, there is rather little direct evidence that provides experimental support.  For the first time, we have reported a method for the purification of NrdR protein that does not contain bound nucleotides.  This apo-protein provided us with a platform to test experimentally the nucleotide binding properties of NrdR.  We determined that dATP and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bind to NrdR in a manner (described as negative cooperativity) that ensures that neither nucleotide can fully saturate the protein.  Further, ATP and dATP bind to NrdR with approximately equal affinities, and the binding of one nucleotide to NrdR stimulates the binding of the other.  These findings provide a satisfactory explanation for the ability of NrdR to bind both ATP and dATP in the cell, where the concentration of ATP is approximately 100-fold higher than the concentration of dATP.  We assayed the ability of different NrdR preparations to bind to DNA fragments from nrd promoter regions containing NrdR binding sites.  These experiments showed that DNA binding (and, therefore, repression) by NrdR is abolished by either ATP or dATP, but not by the corresponding nucleotide and deoxynucleotide monophosphates (AMP and dAMP).  Thus, our data point to a more nuanced and complex regulation of NrdR activity than had previously been assumed.  Specifically, NrdR activity is regulated by phosphate number (ATP and dATP abolish activity, AMP and dAMP do not) rather than by ATP versus dATP.  However, our evidence indicates that monophosphates do not bind to newly synthesized NrdR in the cell.  We speculate that an as yet unidentified cellular event stimulates the conversion of NrdR-bound triphosphates to monophosphates, accompanied by an increase in DNA binding affinity and down-regulation of the nrd genes. This model is significantly more complex than those previously suggested for the mode of action of NrdR.  Our work has moved the field forward significantly, and provides ideas and opportunities for future research activities.  Research outcomes were reported in the scientific literature and at regional and international conferences.  Three PhD students contributed to the project development and accomplishments.  These students received research training and education ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
