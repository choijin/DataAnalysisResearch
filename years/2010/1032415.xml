<AbstractNarration>1032415&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very small (nano- to micrometer scale) geometric features on the surface of certain materials can cause thermal radiation emission or absorption to have pronounced directional and wavelength variations. Such tailored surfaces have been studied and their characteristics predicted and experimentally verified. In the design of important radiating devices, however, it would be useful to first identify the desirable directional and wavelength characteristics needed for a particular application, and subsequently determine the surface texture and device geometry that will provide these characteristics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research comprises an inverse mathematical problem, with well-known mathematical difficulties. These difficulties will be addressed resulting in a design method for indentifying specific micro- and nano-scale surface structures that will provide desired directional and spectral radiative emissive and absorptive properties. Therefore, the fundamental research to be performed is to develop inverse analysis methods that can be applied at the micro-nano scale, and to demonstrate that such methods can be validated through comparison with experiment and applied for practical use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: A robust inverse design method for optimizing radiative properties has important applications including but not limited to improving the efficiency of solar collectors, photovoltaic arrays, lighting and radiant heaters. The research will support a post doctoral student as well as graduate and undergraduate researchers. The results can be incorporated into graduate courses and texts in radiation heat transfer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research carried out under this grant developed tools for finding the best nanoscale surface structures to absorb incident radiation.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The optimization methods developed were applied to two practical problems.  First,      surface structures were predicted for photovoltaic (solar) cells that      would increase the absorption of sunlight to produce more solar cell      output while simultaneously reducing the absorption of the infrared part      of sunlight that produces unwanted heating. One set of optimized layered      structures was produced and tested with good agreement between predicted      and measured solar absorption (see figure).  Second,      structures were predicted for imprinting onto very thin layers of silver      on the surface of commercial window glass. These nanostructures were      optimized to retain good visibility through the glass while either      reflecting or trapping the infrared part of the solar energy. This allows      energy conservation during periods of building heating or cooling.    Five journal articles and 14 meeting presentations plus two patents resulted from this research, and three graduate students received their advanced degrees while supported through the program. In addition, three undergraduates took part in the research, gaining valuable insight into research procedures and piquing their interest in graduate school.  BROADER IMPACTS: Successful commercialization of the practical application of the research performed under this grant can impact production and conservation of renewable energy. The improvement in efficiency of solar cells can lead to their wider application, particularly in uses where cost is a secondary factor such as in space power generation. The use of improved energy conservation above that found even in standard energy-conserving commercial glass can be a major factor in energy conservation, since commercial building energy use is a major portion of energy consumption.
