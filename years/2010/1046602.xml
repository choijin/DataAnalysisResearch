<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project evaluates a completely new low cost/high efficiency generator system called Q-Gen? Portable for use in portable recharging devices.  The Q-Gen? Portable will recharge handheld electronic devices (laptops, cell phones etc) without requiring the grid or a fuel source.  In addition, an initial analysis suggests that utilizing QM Power actuators and generators in a combined renewable energy recharging system called Q-Stor? Portable has the potential to further reduce the human input requirements for even superior recharging capability and dramatically improve the commercial viability of non-fuel renewable energy portable power generation systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are responsive to the fact that high energy prices and usage have accelerated the growing global demand for energy efficient products and low cost energy generation.  QM Power?s generators can be used to significantly increase the efficiency and power density of all commercial and consumer electric generator applications including portable power, auxiliary power units, transportation alternator systems, renewable and non-renewable electricity generation platforms (impacting over $1 trillion a year in electricity generation).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ QM Power possesses a breakthrough patented technology that uses permanent magnets in a novel yet simple design that significantly increases the power density, reliability and efficiency of electric motors and generators. In the Phase I project QM Power conducted research and development on a high efficiency, high power density generator technology called Q-Gen&trade; for commercial application in a rechargeable, portable power device.  Research conducted under the project established the scientific merit of the Q-Gen&trade; technology.  Findings will be widely shared with the scientific community via white papers and symposia.  Commercialization of the technology will greatly benefit the public by enhancing the utility of mobile electronics devices.  The last several years have witnessed the proliferation of mobile computer devices such as smart phones, tablets and laptops with high power requirements. There is an accelerating trend to offer users smaller, handheld devices with converged applications such as voice, data, audio, picture and video.  Total sales of mobile computer devices are expected to reach over $300 billion by the end of 2014, with smart phones and tablets experiencing the strongest growth.   However, the drive to reduce the weight and size of mobile devices while increasing their computing power is directly at odds with adding more battery power.  Essentially, mobile devices have become increasingly power hungry while advances in battery energy density have not kept pace.  As a result, the length of use, mobility, and ease use of these devices have been hampered.   During Phase I of the project, QM Power analyzed the Q-Gen&trade; technology for use in consumer electronic portable recharging devices.  The project results met and, in some cases, exceeded Phase I goals.  Results demonstrated that the Q-Gen&trade; system will achieve up to a 70% weight and/or size reduction compared to conventional generators used in manual recharging systems, and up to a 30% efficiency advantage, significantly reducing human user input and effort.   QM PowerÃ†s management team has extensive experience with bringing similar technologies to market.  Members of the team possess experience establishing and operating manufacturing facilities, and managing strategic partnerships, marketing channels and sizable labor forces.  QM Power plans to integrate Q-Gen&trade; into a multi-purpose portable auxiliary power system called PoD&trade; (Power-on-Demand).  The QM Power PoD&trade; will dramatically improve the commercial viability of non-fuel renewable energy portable power generation systems and enhance the utility of mobile electronics devices.
