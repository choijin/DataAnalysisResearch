<AbstractNarration>The American Physiological Society (APS) will hold a conference on Global Change and Global Science: Comparative Physiology in a Changing World," scheduled for August 4-7, 2010 in Westminster, CO. This will be the first conference of any type to focus on the effects of global climate change on animal physiology. Comparative and evolutionary physiologists are uniquely trained to contribute to our understanding of the effects of changing environmental conditions on animals, and, therefore, help predict the complex consequences of anthropogenic climate change for humans and ecological communities. APS will administer a travel award program for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from groups underrepresented in science in order to provide opportunities to learn about this field of investigation, interact with established investigators, and to participate in workshops on career development in comparative physiology.</AbstractNarration>
