<AbstractNarration>While vast regions of the ocean can be treated accurately within the framework of eddy-resolving ocean models integrating simplified equations, there are comparatively small regions in which rapidly-evolving three dimensional motions are important not only for local but also for   large-scale dynamics, thereby playing an important role in the multi-scale dynamics of both coastal and global oceanic flows. The flow dynamics in these small regions are complex enough not to permit an accurate approximation by simple parameterizations, but rather demand solution of the full set of equations. The objective of this project is to build a modeling framework which can handle both energetically active motions and large scale general circulations simultaneously. This research-education project is an orchestrated effort of a collaboration synthesizing expertise in both mathematics and oceanography. The blend of mathematical, computational, and geophysical expertise of the project team is central to the success of this endeavor. It is also essential to the truly interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students, who will be involved in all the stages of a research project: Modeling, mathematical analysis, discretization, validation, computation, and data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To model these challenging oceanic flows, a truly multi-scale modeling framework that will employ the computationally intensive Boussinesq equations only in the small regions of intense mixing and the computationally efficient primitive equations in the rest of the fluid domain is needed. The inherent multi-scale nature of the oceanic flows  considered, however, makes the development of such a modeling framework challenging, both mathematically and computationally.  Indeed, one needs to address outstanding open questions, such as, the mathematical bridging of two different systems of equations, the interfacing of computational meshes of vastly varying resolutions, the quantification and modeling of uncertainty in this complex framework and the modeling of oceanic flows over a range of scales where forward and backward energy cascades coexist.  This new framework comprises several significant mathematical and computational developments: (i) a new multiphysics/multiresolution modeling approach based on domain decomposition that will allow an appropriate treatment of highly varying mesh resolutions and the interfacing of the non-hydrostatic and hydrostatic flow regimes; (ii) a novel spatio-temporal  filtering methodology that provides an elegant mathematical approach for bridging two different sets of equations by creating a spectrum of intermediate models filling the gap between the two sets of equations in terms of computational efficiency and physical accuracy; (iii) new modeling strategies for the uncertainty in the system generated by the inherently stochastic nature of the Boussinesq-primitive equations coupling; and (iv) state-of-the-art turbulence modeling for an appropriate treatment of the markedly different turbulence character of the  Boussinesq and  primitive flow regimes by taking advantage of the mathematical nature of approximate deconvolution approaches.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We developed several models for the numerical simulation of the quasi-geostrophic equations, which are describing the large scale wind-driven ocean flows.  We also put forth models for the numerical simulation of the Boussinesq equations, which are modeling transport and mixing in three-dimensional ocean flows.  A particular emphasis was posed on the treatment of stratification, which is an important feature of ocean flows.  A thorough numerical investigation of these new models revealed that they are accurate, stable, and computationally efficient.  We also performed a rigorous analysis of the numerical methods employed to discretize the new models.  As a result of these studies, ten journal papers were published or submitted.  This research has been instrumental in the career development of four graduate students.  Two of them got their PhD degrees.  The third one got a MS degree and is currently working on his PhD (anticipated defense date - May 2015).  The fourth student is working on his MS degree (anticipated thesis presentation date - May 2015).  All the students performed both theoretical and computational studies, and worked on mathematical modeling, code development, numerical simulation and error analysis.  Our work contributes to significantly more efficient computational modeling of wind-driven large scale oceanic flows.  It also makes possible the appropriate treatment of complex computational domains.  The techniques and results developed in this project  contribute to the better scientific understanding of nonlinear systems, as well as the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. Oceanic flows are of particular importance, as they are intimately related to the ocean's role in climate dynamics. The research of this complex, nonlinear and multiscale system is not only scientifically challenging but also practically important.
