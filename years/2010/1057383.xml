<AbstractNarration>The Robert and Virginia Rausch Helminthological Collection (RHC) is one of the largest parasite collections in the Western Hemisphere and is primarily focused on Arctic and sub-Arctic biomes.  It is an irreplaceable resource that documents emerging disease organisms and provides a significant baseline for studies of national interest, including effects of global climate change on fragile northern ecosystems. However, it is an orphaned collection that is in serious jeopardy of total loss without rapid curatorial intervention.  This project, centered at the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico (UNM), will provide personnel, materials and logistical support to insure conservation and permanent housing of RHC specimens. Specimen records, ledgers, and original field notes will be electronically captured, verified, and disseminated broadly via the ARCTOS online database to maximize utility and visibility of the collection.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on substantial institutional investment and programmatic emphasis in parasitology, diversity of disease organisms, and specimen-based biology at UNM, and provides direct benefit to faculty and students as an education and training resource.  Once secured, the RHC will provide unique historical and geographic baselines for bio-monitoring, human health, and global climate change studies.  Ultimately, federal support will make this valuable resource available to scientists world-wide via online resources and enhanced access to high-quality specimens and data.</AbstractNarration>
