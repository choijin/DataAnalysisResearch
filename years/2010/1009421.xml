<AbstractNarration>AST-1008213/1008353/1009421&lt;br/&gt;Chatterjee/Kaplan/Bower&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies of the time-variable sky at various wavelengths have revealed a vast range of unexpected phenomena, some of which have had enormous scientific impact, such as radio pulsars and gamma-ray bursters.  At radio wavelengths, large-scale and sensitive examinations have been lacking, and large regions of discovery space remain unexplored.  This project will detect and characterize transient and variable sources in the archival record of the Very Large Array (VLA), a large existing resource spanning 30 years, obtained with the most sensitive interferometric telescope in operation today.  The algorithms, software pipelines, and expertise developed in the process will be applied to new observations with the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA), and they will provide an algorithmic portal to the next generation of wide-field, high sensitivity surveys with new telescopes.  The university collaboration will work with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory to (i) develop and deploy automated software pipelines on local copies of the VLA archive, (ii) construct algorithms to detect and classify transient and variable radio sources in the archive, (iii) conduct multi-wavelength follow-up observations of sources of interest, and (iv) develop a statistical description and a deeper understanding of the physical processes underlying the radio transient sky.  This study will find many new examples of known classes of transient sources, allowing for quantitative analysis, and is likely to discover as-yet-unknown source classes, thus building to a fuller characterization and deeper physical understanding of the dynamic radio sky.  The target population includes at least brown dwarfs, low mass stars, nearby extra-solar Jovian planets, neutron stars, X-ray binaries, micro-quasars, radio supernovae and orphan radio afterglows of hidden gamma-ray bursts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next generation of radio telescopes is now under construction or development, promising a quantum leap in sky coverage, sensitivity, and data rates.  By developing, testing, and deploying algorithms and software pipelines on archival data, this research is an essential step toward handling those new large surveys, especially since it will test the operation of software pipelines in real-time radio astronomy applications.  It will also train graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in this burgeoning field, and involve undergraduate students in hands-on research.  Outreach activities with high school students and the general public will show how the 'unchanging' heavens are in fact dynamic, full of upheaval, violence, and mystery.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the discovery and characterization of energetic and variable radio sources.  These extreme sources probe physics at high energy density and in high temperature plasmas.  Potential sources of radio emission are from black hole systems, neutron stars, magnetic eruptions on the surfaces of stars, and planetary magnetic fields.    Highly variable radio sources are very rare.  Our research program sought to discover new events and to characterize the rate at which events occur.  We did this primarily through analysis of existing data from radio telescopes.  We searched through that data very thoroughly in order to identify an new radio sources that may have appeared or disappeared.  We found no such sources in the course of this research.  This is surprising and sets some strong limits on a number of interesting classes of events.  Our work covers timescales from milliseconds to decades.   We also explored and studied several individual transients that were discovered through their X-ray properties.  Two of these sources are known as tidal disruption events.  These occur when a star passes close to a massive black hole in the center of a galaxy.  The star is destroyed by the gravitational field of the black hole.  The gas that is ripped from the star heats up as it approaches the star, leading to X-ray emission.  We find two instances of radio emission that also occurs with these events.  The radio emission occurs when a relativistic jet of plasma is ejected from the system.  We still don't understand why the jet is created in some tidal disruption events but not in all of them.  In our first system, the radio emission appears promptly after the X-ray flare.  In the second system, the radio emission appears nearly a decade later.  The other radio transient that we have studied is a newly discovered neutron star that appears to be bound to the black hole in our Galactic Center.  This neutron star was discovered through a large X-ray outburst and subsequently identified as a pulsar, a kind of neutron star with periodic radio emission.  This pulsar is only a fraction of a light year away from the black hole and is the first pulsar found this close to the black hole.  We have been characterizing its properties in order to demonstrate whether it is bound to the black hole and to understand the population of pulsars in the region.  Pulsars in close orbits to the black hole could provide powerful tests of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.  Our results from the surveys and from individual objects are helping us to plan new surveys with more powerful radio telescopes that have just begun to operate, or will become available in the coming years.  The search for radio transients also produces techniques that are of general interest for the problem of anomaly detection, i.e., finding a needle in a haystack.  This work supported the training of an undergraduate student, a graduate student thesis, and two postdoctoral researchers.
