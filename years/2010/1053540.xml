<AbstractNarration>The grant supports student travel for about twelve students to attend the 2010 ACM conference on Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE 2010), to be held November 7-11, 2010, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Funds are requested to support the travel, meals, and lodging for student volunteers. The students will attend portions of the conference and serve as student volunteers. Attention will be paid to financial needs and under-represented groups. The opportunity to attend one of the premier conferences in Software Engineering is intended to provide experiences that may encourage students to pursue higher degrees in computer science research.</AbstractNarration>
