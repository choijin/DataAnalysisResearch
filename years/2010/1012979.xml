<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program supports Professor Vladimir B. Birman of Washington University for a project that will explore the application of Brønsted acids to catalytic, asymmetric acyl substitution reactions, such as enantioselective O- and S-acylation and enantioselective alcoholysis of chiral acyl donors. The two basic modes of activation that will be applied to several classes of acyl donors are acid-assisted acyl transfer catalysis and direct Brønsted acid catalysis using axially chiral phosphoric acids.The acyl transfer catalysis will utilize primarily achiral carboxylic acids in combination with amidine-based enantioselective acylation catalysts previously developed in the Birman laboratory. These studies will lead to the development of new methods for the nonenzymatic kinetic resolution (KR), dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR), desymmetrization and deracemization of several classes of substrates. The availability of a simple transition state model will be helpful for introducing students to the basics of asymmetric catalysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Vladimir B. Birman will work in a topical area called asymmetric organocatalysis that is having considerable potential impact in both industry and academia. The research will lead to a better understanding of non-covalent interactions in the chemical community. The broader scientific impact, for process development outside of academia, could be quite significant. Graduate and undergraduate students will be provided more diverse training in synthetic organic chemistry. The recently developed protocol for the DKR of 4-aryl-azlactones is operationally simple, utilizes easily obtainable starting materials and catalysts, and presents an opportunity to discuss many fundamental concepts of organic chemistry. This makes it an ideal candidate for incorporation into the undergraduate laboratory curriculum at Washington University. These steps will further improve the quality of the graduate and undergraduate programs in chemistry at Washington University and help build its strength as one of the leading research institutions in the Midwest.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many organic compounds are chiral, i.e. exist in the form of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers. The two enantiomers of the same compound have identical physico-chemical properties, but often display different bioactivity. This phenomenon becomes especially important in the case of chiral pharmaceuticals, since "the wrong" enantiomer of a drug may have lower activity or even undesirable side effects. Therefore, there is considerable interest in developing methods for preparing chiral compounds in enantiopure form. Asymmetric catalysis is the most attractive approach to accomplishing this goal, because (a) it produces one of the two possible enantiomers preferentially (enantioselectively), thus reducing waste and obviating the difficult task of separating enantiomers and (b) it utilizes only small amounts of a chiral catalyst, rather than stoichiometric amounts of chiral auxiliaries or resolving agents.   Research in the Birman group revolves around asymmetric catalysis. Their efforts are directed towards the design and development of new and more effective chiral catalysts that enable asymmetric catalytic transformations, understanding at the molecular level how these catalysts work, and devising  new applications of existing catalysts.    Thus, over the period covered by this NSF award, students in the Birman group have  (a) pioneered the use of chiral phosphoric acids in enantioselective acyl substitution reactions by devising a new method for the synthesis of enantiopure amino acid derivatives;  (b) developed and explored a number of new applications of amdine-based catalysts (ABCs) previously discovered in the Birman group;  (c) carried out computational studies shedding light on the mechanism by which ABCs achieve their enantioselectivity, and  (d) achieved a concise enantioselective total synthesis of a natural product with promising biological activity (potential treatment for renal fibrosis).   In the course of these studies, Prof. Birman has trained 5 Ph.

He has also given annual science demonstrations in front of students of elementary public schools in Saint Louis providing them with a learning experience in entertaining form and hopefully sparking their interest in science at an early age.
