<AbstractNarration>Studies of the evolution of microbes under controlled laboratory culture conditions have led to fundamental advances in our understanding of microbial adaptation and have also served as a valuable tool for engineering microbes with desirable properties. The visualizing evolution in real-time (VERT) method uses genetically identical but differently colored (fluorescent) bacterial cells to identify when adaptive evolution has occurred in laboratory cultures. The goals of this CAREER project are 1) to develop VERT as a method to study the evolutionary dynamics of microbes during laboratory evolution using the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli), 2) to utilize VERT for engineering complex properties of microbial systems, by applying it to the engineering of E. coli for enhanced tolerance to a biofuel (1-butanol), and 3) to determine the genetic processes underlying the evolution of E. coli by determining the changes in genomic structure and gene expression that occur in response to 1-butanol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: VERT will be developed into an educational tool by 1) developing web-based modules, including a documentary, for the broad public dissemination of information about the development and application of this technology, 2) involving high school and undergraduate students (particularly women and minorities under-represented in science and engineering) in the research, thereby training future scientists and engineers, and 3) using VERT to illustrate and teach the process of evolution to high school and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  The goal of this CAREER proposal was to develop the visualizing evolution in real-time (VERT) method as the central tool for a program on in vitro evolution that integrates both research and education.  In vitro evolution of microbial systems has led to the fundamental understanding of microbial adaptation and has also served as an invaluable tool for strain engineering.  In most cases, however, the evolving population is heterogeneous, containing multiple adaptive mutants that co-exist and compete for expansion, resulting in complex evolution dynamics.  There is a lack of methods to detect the expansions of adaptive mutants in real-time during in vitro evolution, and thus the existing work using adaptive evolution have mostly neglected the evolution dynamics in the population.  In this project, we developed VERT to use different colored cells that are otherwise isogenic to identify when adaptive events occur via the visual expansion and contractions of fluorescently labeled subpopulations during adaptive laboratory evolution.  We successfully demonstrated its initial application in evolutionary engineering of E. coli using tolerance to the biofuel, 1-butanol, as a test case.  The results led to the identification of a new mechanism of n-butanol tolerance in E. coli involving decreased activity of the transcription factor Fur, which led to the increased activity of the BasS/BasR two-component system, which led to changes in the lipopolysaccharide composition.  We also identified several transporters involved in n-butanol tolerance.  Interestingly, we also identified an incompatibility between the adaptive mechanisms for n-butanol tolerance between the two independent lineages (GFP and YFP) within the same evolving population, demonstrating a case of divergence in adaptive mechanisms within one evolving population.  We also developed and applied VERT in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Candida glabrata.  In S. cerevisiae, we applied VERT as a new method for more rational ramp-up schemes during evolutionary engineering and applied this to increase tolerance of yeast to corn stover hydrolysates.  In C. albicans, we applied VERT to gain a better understanding of evolutionary dynamics during emergence to antifungal drug resistance; and found that the evolving population remains heterogeneous and that acquisition of drug resistance does not come with a fitness cost in most cases.     Broader impacts:  This work involved the participation of graduate students (4 Ph.D. and 3 M.S.), undergraduate students (18 total), and 2 high school teachers, the majority of whom are female or from underrepresented minority groups.  Their involvement in this project contributed to their professional training and growth as scientists and engineers.  Results from this work were broadly disseminated via peer-reviewed journal publications and presentations at conferences, workshops, and seminars.  In addition, the significance of adaptive evolution in human health (antibiotic drug resistance and cancer) and in biotechnology (strain development) were included in the course curriculum of core Chemical Engineering course taught by the PI.
