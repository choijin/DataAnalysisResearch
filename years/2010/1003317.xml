<AbstractNarration>The Community College of Baltimore County, in partnership with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County plans to implement a comprehensive strategy to offer supplemental technology training for teachers in Project Lead the Way (PLTW) schools. The PLTW training approach offers pre-engineering coursework for middle and high school teachers to deliver an activity-based, project-based, and problem-based learning (APPB) curriculum. Content includes authentic experiences in engineering, biomechanics, aeronautics and related subjects. The ATE PLTW Professional Development project is designed to supplement the current Core Training for middle and high school teachers in seven states (MD, NY, OH, CA, SC, IN, TX, WI). Three Master Teachers and/or Professors and one Coordinator from seven PLTW affiliate universities will be trained to provide two one-day professional development workshops for teachers in their region. The affiliate universities include Rochester Institute of Technology, Sinclair Community College, San Diego State University, University of South Carolina, Purdue University, University of Texas at Tyler, and Milwaukee School of Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The professional development includes Fischertechniks, Revit, MD Solids and Autodesk Inventor software and applications systems. Project deliverables include a train-the-trainer implementation model, PLTW training at seven affiliate universities, revision of the trainer and PD curricula, and dissemination of the model nationally in conjunction with PLTW headquarters. A variety of methodologies will be used to evaluate the project's impact on student learning, teacher competence and confidence in teaching PLTW, the training curriculum and accompanying Fischertechniks manual, and the most effective approach for implementing the PLTW training model.  The comprehensive evaluation plan also addresses the compliance of professional development with industry needs and standards and dissemination processes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By expanding the training on a national level using a train-the-trainer approach, this project may have considerable impact on pre-engineering education and has the potential to reach students currently underrepresented in engineering education programs. The popularity of PLTW nationally ensures that an enthusiastic pool of educators is available to participate in the training. It is anticipated that over the life of the project, 80 middle and high school teachers per year will be trained by each affiliate university, resulting in an overall impact of 1,433 teachers and 36,000 students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Through the National Science Foundation (NSF) ATE Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Professional Development grant, teachers from across the country received training in technical software and applications used in PLTW and other engineering-related classes.  The training, conducted between Fall 2010 and Spring 2015, was based on a model developed and piloted by The Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) in response to requests by PLTW teachers and school administrators for additional training.  A train-the-trainer program was developed to implement the Maryland professional development (PD) model in other parts of the country. The Maryland Coordinator and content experts trained and collaborated with their counterparts from PLTW Affiliate Universities in eight other states, gathering input and feedback on lesson plans and assessments, and developing new subject matter as changes were made in the PLTW curriculum. The full-day training sessions for Inventor (three levels), VEX with ROBOTC, fischertechnik (2 levels), Revit, digital electronics and civil engineering topics, reinforced and built on knowledge gained during intensive two-week PLTW summer core training programs.  The PD was designed to build teacher confidence and to make them better instructors resulting in increased student performance and teacher retention.  Although PLTW assists teachers throughout the year via their online Virtual Academy, the PD results show that teachers experience substantial gains in knowledge and confidence from attending face-to-face training sessions with expert trainers.  Through the grant, a total of 213 training sessions were conducted in nine states with an attendance of 2,203 teachers (teachers were counted each time they attended a session).  Teachers took a pre- and post-assessment and completed a survey each session.  Increases in pre-to-post scores generally ranged between +30 and +45 pts on a 100 point scale with lower increases being due to higher mean pre-assessment scores which limited the possible range for improvement.  Of the teachers attending the training, 80% taught high school and 20% middle school; and 33% were female.  On the online survey, teachers highly rated each aspect of the training. On a scale of 1 to 5, mean responses ranged from 4.22 to 4.82 for: pace of training, registration process, instructor responsiveness, interactions with other teachers, amount of material covered, use of technology, training facilities, and instructor knowledge.  Teachers also felt well prepared to integrate what they learned into their teaching (4.20 rating) and felt they needed more training (4.23 rating).  Results of participant interviews, observations, and focus groups conducted by the grant external evaluator mirrored the positive quantitative survey results.  Teachers frequently indicated that the PD had increased their knowledge and confidence in working with the software applications, and that it had provided them with new ideas and resources for teaching the PLTW curriculum, making them more effective teachers.  The PD also generate a support environment through which participants seek to maintain their connections after the training is over. Skilled engineering technicians are a critical part of the nationÆs high-tech workforce.  In 2013/14, the scope of the grant was expanded to increase the number and diversity of high school students pursuing two or four-year degrees in engineering technology by aligning high school curriculum with college-level engineering technology programs.  CCBC worked with International Technology and Engineering Educators Association (ITEEA) and a team of educators to revise the Engineering by Design&trade; (EbD) high school curriculum used by many secondary schools throughout the U.S. to align with CCBCÆs Introduction to Engineering Technology course (EGNT 101).  Upon successful completion of a fundamental technology course, and EbDÆs Advanced Design Applications (ADA) and Engineering Design (E...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
