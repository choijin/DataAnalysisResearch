<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this SCIART research is in developing practical syntheses of polymers for stone consolidation that possess "nano-to-macro" length scales similar to that of natural stone. By  utilizing both nano (POSS, 1nm-10nm) and macroscopic length (polymer) scales in a conservation and consolidation system, a continuation of length scale and properties with those in natural stone can be achieved thus strengthening the stone. POSS silanols show the ability to coordinate a large number of chemical compounds; however their interaction with natural stone surfaces is poorly understood. For POSS silanols, we seek a fundamental understanding of the POSS-silanol/stone interfacial interactions -- an understanding that may lead to the design of high performance stone consolidants -- particularly for calcium carbonate stones where state-of-the-art sol-gels fail. A novel approach to stone consolidation is developed using POSS-silanol/thiol-X systems (where X represents an -ene, (meth)acrylates, vinyl ethers, etc.) which can be applied to stone as liquid monomer resins (improving depth of penetration) and cured via frontal photopolymerization (FPP). From this approach, the PIs seek to develop structure-property relationships of the POSS/thiol-X materials such that critical parameters, i.e. the glass transition temperature, modulus, CTE, and index of refraction can be matched to a particular stone type. The role of POSS-silanol on interfacial adhesion and POSS/thiol-X resins on surface energy, water vapor transport, and porosity are of fundamental importance and will be elucidated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treatment of stone deterioration is a complex process that must take into consideration the stone composition and structure, the nature of the polymeric treatment, the  interaction between stone and treatment, and the long term effects on the heterogeneous matrix created by the treatment on stone. It is the aim of this work to develop an advanced stone conservation approach based on POSS-silanol polymer systems designed to improve stone consolidation and water repellency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal implications of the research will range from the development of fundamental understanding of polymer interactions with stone surfaces to the ultimate realization of new materials technology for the conservation of America's cultural heritage. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will provide a unique opportunity for graduate and undergraduate polymer science students to experience direct interaction and collaboration with 1) an industrial leader in nanomaterials (Hybrid Plastics) and 2) the only preservation research and technology center (National Center for Preservation and Training Technology, NCPTT) within the U.S. National Park Service. A significant outreach and dissemination plan involves K-12 hands-on polymer science activities directed at conservation of cultural heritage items and the development of webinar/podcast to broaden awareness of the grand challenges facing conservation scientists and disseminate the results of this research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mitigation of stone deterioration is a complex process that must take into consideration the stone composition and structure, the nature of the polymeric treatment, the interaction between stone and treatment, and the long term effects on the heterogeneous matrix created by the treatment on stone. The primary aim of this work was to develop an approach to stone conservation based on new polymer materials designed to improve stone consolidation and water repellency.  The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development of light-curable polymer resins that 1) exhibit improved adhesion with stone surfaces and 2) display extreme anti-wetting behavior for fluid repellency.  In the first approach, resins were designed to contain polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (POSS) silanol derivatives capable of interacting with the inorganic composition of stone surfaces.  This approach was extended using bioinspired concepts by incorporating chemical functional groups &ndash; i.e. catechols &ndash; found in the marine mussel. Mussels use catechols as a primary component of their adhesive plaques that allow these organisms to strongly adhere to almost any surface.  Catechols, when incorporated into light-curable polymer adhesives, were found to exhibit strong adhesion to a variety of surfaces, including various types of stone.  In the second approach, light-curable polymer resins were designed to exhibit superhydrophobic wetting properties to serve as water repellent treatments for stone and other materials.  The superhydrophobic wetting state is typically manifested on surfaces exhibiting a combination of low surface energy and an appropriately designed hierarchically structured surface comprised of dual-scale textures (typically nanometer scale features superimposed on underlying micrometer scale features).  To achieve this wetting state, a spray-deposition process was developed to deliver resins containing silica nanoparticles and reactive siloxane precursors that could be cured by exposure to light to capture the hierarchical morphology.  The surfaces displayed excellent anti-wetting behavior in contact with water, and show promise as water repellent treatments for a variety of applications (Figure 1).  In general, using funds provided by this NSF grant, have provided strategies to improve the adhesion and wetting properties polymeric treatments for cultural heritage items.       The broader impacts of this project include the training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.  The project also provided training for an NSF REU student from the University of Buffalo, and an Alliance for Graduate Education in Mississippi (AGEM) REU from Alcorn State University.  Importantly, through the interactions with an industrial partner (Hybrid Plastics) and a government lab partner (National Center for Preservation Technology and Training), this project has trained a cadre of scientists that are experienced in polymer science and cognizant of the challenges faced within conservation science.  This unique skill set will help bridge the gap in human resources by providing a workforce with the skills necessary to address cross-disciplinary problems in materials and conservation science.  Outreach activities have helped to educate the public &ndash; particularly K-12 students &ndash; about the importance of cultural heritage science and strategies to help preserve cultural heritage items by mitigating the degradation of stone using new polymer-based materials.  This project has resulted in peer-reviewed publications that have been disseminated in high quality journals in the polymer field.
