<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims at developing laser&lt;br/&gt;photoacoustic spectroscopy (LPAS) sensor for continuous, real-time measurements of&lt;br/&gt;hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), and other air pollutants such as Carbon monoxide, nitrogen&lt;br/&gt;oxides, and sulfur dioxide. The intellectual merit of the activity lies in the creation of a new a&lt;br/&gt;operationally simple, low cost, robust, compact, ruggedized field-deployable and affordable&lt;br/&gt;ambient air and stationary source pollution sensor that is capable of real-time measuring&lt;br/&gt;multiple pollutant and toxic compounds simultaneously. The instrument will use the newly&lt;br/&gt;advanced quantum cascade laser (QCL) or interband cascade laser (ICL) absorption to&lt;br/&gt;accurately quantify multiple chemical compounds within a short period of time (~ 40 to 60&lt;br/&gt;seconds) with a precision of sub parts per billion.&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are expected to be within numerous areas&lt;br/&gt;including: 1) Air toxic measurements, such as ambient air and stationary source pollution&lt;br/&gt;monitoring, industrial hygiene monitoring, confined space monitoring and process emission&lt;br/&gt;monitoring, etc. 2) Global atmospheric monitoring of air toxics, air pollutants, greenhouse gases,&lt;br/&gt;and trace species. 3) Military applications. Besides the environmental and industrial application,&lt;br/&gt;many other military applications including detection of Chemical Warfare Agent (CWA),&lt;br/&gt;explosives, TICs, can make use of the devices developed in this project. Potential customers&lt;br/&gt;include the EPA, NOAA or NASA for environmental monitoring, DoD for detection of IED&lt;br/&gt;(JIEDDO), the DHS for detection of explosives and scanning of luggage (TSA), etc.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcome of the Phase I work establish the feasibility of this optical technique for sensitively detecting air toxics and other air pollutants, and provide the design of the prototype optical sensor.  In this SBIR phase I project, we are happy to report that we have achieved the three objectives stated in our phase I proposal and established the feasibility of the analyzer.  The main objective of this NSF SBIR project is to develop a ruggedized laser photoacoustic spectroscopy (LPAS) gas analyzer for continuous real-time measurements of multiple gases/chemical components. Figure 1 shows the schematic of the LPAS sensor.  The measurement of the concentration of various gases including environmental pollutants and toxic gases is of increasing importance.  People exposed to toxic air pollutants at sufficient concentrations and durations may have an increased chance of getting cancer or experiencing other serious health effects.   In addition to the impact to human health, persistent toxic air pollutants are of particular concern in aquatic ecosystems because the pollutants accumulate in sediments and bio-accumulate in tissues of animals at the top of the food chain to concentrations many times higher than in the water or air.  In comparison with the current available fixed gas analyzers on the market, such as Non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy (NDIR) analyzer, the proposed sensor will be able to provide much higher sensitivity (sub-parts-per-billion level).    In our Phase I project we have conducted experiments using the LPAS sensor in real-time in the presence of interference. Multiple chemical compounds such as Benzene, Formaldehyde, Dimethyl Methylphosphonate (DMMP), Acetaldehyde, and other atmospheric compounds such as water vapor, carbon dioxides were measured.  We were able to demonstrate the ppb level of sensitivity for some of the measured compounds that have strong absorption in the wavelength range of the low power (40mW) Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) used.   To measure the target chemical concentration, interference, especially water vapor plays an important role in determining the sensor performance in the field.  Using the Phase I LPAS sensor, we show the impact of the interferents to the performance.  We developed a simulation model of air that contains a number of constituents.  We have developed a preliminary spectral pattern recognition algorithm to decompose the multi-component spectrum using spectral libraries for interferents and targets.  This algorithm has been tested in Phase I.   A spectral library of the HAPs identified by US EPAÆs Clean Air Act's list is compiled to a database based upon the quantitative, vapor phase, infrared spectral data published by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), the quantitative infrared database published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).   We also included the infrared spectra of the regular interferent species in atmosphere and other air pollutants based upon the High Resolution Transmission (HITRAN) molecular spectroscopic database.  This library is implemented in the multi-component analysis algorithm.  Based on our experimental results and the simulation model, further performance improvement, i.e., to reach sub-parts-per-billion level of sensitivity, can be easily achieved by increasing laser power, implementing æsmart gridÆ technology, changing to stronger absorption line, and reducing floor noise.  Preliminary design of Phase II prototype has been conducted.  Our Phase II sensor will be based on our laboratory LPAS instrument that has already demonstrated successful in the Phase I research.  A rugged prototype sensor will be built in Phase II and tested in open environments.       Last Modified: 08/10/2011       Submitted by: Guangkun Li]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
