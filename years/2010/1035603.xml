<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a prototype programmable microfluidic laboratory-on-chip that concurrently executes assays (chemical algorithms) in an on-line fashion. A chemist specifies an assay (chemical algorithm) using a text-based language. Assays arrive at the device in real-time and an operating system/virtual machine running on an attached microcontroller interprets them. The approach is to develop a software simulation infrastructure for the laboratory-on-chip and to build the operating system/virtual machine on top of it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this activity is due to the fact that no type of runtime support system has yet been proposed for microfluidic devices. The key challenges to be solved in this project include: deadlock-free deterministic and adaptive routing algorithms; real-time constraints for routing droplets in the system; routing wash droplets for decontamination; scheduling assay operations on the devices; congestion estimation; and fault diagnosis and recovery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impact, advances in laboratory-on-chip technology will improve public health worldwide and lead to significant advances in clinical diagnostics and medicine. Laboratory-on-chips are commercially available from established companies such as Agilent Technologies as well as startup companies such as Advanced Liquid Logic, Silicon Biosystems, and Ayanda Biosystems; thus, the economic impact of this research is tremendous. The University of California, Riverside is a Minority-Serving Institution. The PI is committed to the introduction of laboratory-on-chip technology in both undergraduate and graduate education and will make every possible effort to recruit underrepresented minorities (including women) at the graduate and undergraduate level to work on the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the design and implementation of programming languages for cyber-physical digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs). A DMFB is an emerging laboratory-on-a-chip (LoC). Compared to traditional benchtop chemistry methods, LoCs offer the benefits of miniaturization and automation, while DMFBs in particular offer programmability through an electrical control interface. A cyber-physical DMFB goes one step further by integrating sensors into the device substrate: the sensors provide real-time feedback to the host PC that controls the DMFB. Cyber-physical integration enables the specification and execution of miniaturized biochemical reactions that include real-time decision-making based on sensory feedback. This project developed a programming language, compiler, and operating system for cyber-physical DMFB technology, and validated the systemÆs ability to execute biochemical reactions that provide real-time feedback through software simulation. The most extensive simulation results demonstrated successful execution of several probabilistic methods for the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), which performs DNA amplification as a preprocessing step in a wide variety of widely used biochemical reactions, such as DNA sequencing.     Intellectual Merit     The key intellectual contributions of the project are as follows:  -       Development of a programming language (syntax, execution semantics) suitable for cyber-physical DMFBs  -       Novel algorithms for scheduling, placement, and routing on cyber-physical DMFBs that are fast enough to execute in real-time while providing good quality solutions.  -       A droplet routing algorithm that trades off the speed of droplet transport to minimize total energy consumption while adhering to timing constraints.  -       A pin assignment scheme that reduces the cost of a cyber-physical DMFB (number of control signals; number of printed circuit board layers) without sacrificing general-purpose programmability.  -       Successful demonstration, via software simulation, of several non-trivial feedback-driven biochemical reactions.            Broader Impacts     The project successfully achieved the following broader impacts.     Benefits of cyber-physical DMFB technology to society: This technology is expected to lower the barrier to usage of potentially lifesaving microfluidic chips in industry (e.g., medical diagnostics, point-of-care testing, drug discovery, etc.), and increase the productivity of the existing user base (academics and biomedical researchers in industry). Using the proposed platform, virtually any user will be able to obtain and quickly program a cyber-physical DMFB for applications such as diagnostics and therapeutics, which can help patients and save lives. Future research will lead to the development of systems in that could perform massively parallel analysis of virtually any relevant form of forensic chemistry.     Advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning: This project provided training opportunities for X Ph.D. students, Y M.S. students, Z undergraduates, and one high-school student.  Several of these participants co-authored peer-reviewed publications with the PI to report the results of the research effort, and attended international conferences and symposia to present their results. Seven of undergraduates that Dr. Brisk has mentored have joined the Ph.D. program at UCR, and the PI is advising six of them. Nine publications resulting from this project were co-authored by UCR undergraduates, and two were co-authored by the high school student.     Enhance infrastructure for research and education: This project has led to international collaborations with DTU Compute (The Technical University of Denmark) and National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, and an interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers in the Material Science department of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The PI has developed two software pack...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
