<AbstractNarration>The investigator proposes to study the distribution of Selmer groups in a family of abelian varieties, by building on the observation (made with Eric Rains) that the p-Selmer group of an elliptic curve is an intersection of maximal isotropic subspaces in a locally compact quadratic space.  The goal is to construct a random model that will yield structural explanations for the behavior of the package consisting of prime power Selmer groups, Shafarevich-Tate groups, and Mordell-Weil groups, and then to justify the model by proving as many of its predictions as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is part of an extensive research program begun by the ancient Greeks, to understand the solutions to equations when the variables are required to be rational numbers (ratios of whole numbers or their negatives).  It will provide insight into the nature of solutions to degree 3 equations in 2 variables: although this is the simplest case not yet understood, an understanding of it has eluded researchers for over a century.  The investigator will also continue work on two graduate textbooks on the subject of rational solutions to equations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI's research largely centers on the problem of finding solutions to polynomial equations (like y^2 = x^3 + 17) in which the solutions are required to be rational numbers (fractions such as -3/5).  Such questions have interested mathematicians since the time of the ancient Greeks, but some of the most basic questions remain unsolved.  Attempts to answer them have led to the creation of new fields of mathematics that eventually found applications in data transmission and cryptography; the PI does not work on these applications directly, but on the mathematics underlying them.  For plane curves such as the one above, it is known that even when there are infinitely many solutions, they can all be constructed by geometric processes starting from finitely many, but nobody knows how many starting solutions are required.  The PI and his coauthors developed a heuristic predicting that for most such curves, at most 21 starting solutions are required.  For certain higher degree equations, the PI and his coauthor Stoll proved that most of them have only one rational solution, answering a question implicit in a famous paper of Faltings from 1983.  The project also led to advances in the understanding of the Nelder-Mead algorithm, a 1965 method widely used in the sciences for optimizing a function when one does not have a formula for the function.  The PI and his coauthors showed that under suitable hypotheses the method succeeds in converging to the optimum value, justifying the use of the algorithm.  Towards education of the next generation, the PI completed a graduate-level textbook "Rational points on varieties" and made it freely available for download from his website.  Four Ph.D. students were involved in the research of this project.  Their involvement has led to their own research, leading them to complete their degrees; all four are now working for academia and other educational organizations.
