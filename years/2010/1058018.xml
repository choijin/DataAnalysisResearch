<AbstractNarration>The PI requests MRI RAPID funding to acquire an YSI, Inc. Portable Seakeeper, which is a fully contained and automated underway sampling system. The YSI Portable Seakeeper has an integrated differential GPS for geo-referenced water sampling and the following sensor capabilities: Turner Designs C3 with crude oil sensor; optical dissolved oxygen; temperature; conductivity; turbidity; chlorophyll fluorescence; pH; and blue-green algae. The proposed instrument will provide an opportunity to: measure the spatial and temporal distributions of near-surface hydrocarbon solute and associated water quality indicators in the estuary; characterize the modulation of spatio-temporal distributions of near-surface hydrocarbon solute by local and remote forcing; estimate the residence times of hydrocarbon solute in the estuary relative to local and remote forcing; and formulate the constitutive relationships between near-surface hydrocarbons and water chemistry. A total of 36 surveys will be conducted, yielding a total of 144 transects. These surveys will be augmented by complimentary projects in the estuary that will describe the role of the ship channel on stratification and transport of submerged hydrocarbons and evaluate biological responses by sentinel benthic and pelagic species to the oil spill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested instrument is to be used primarily in the field, but it will also be used in the University Of South Alabama Department Of Civil Engineering's environmental water chemistry laboratory to expose undergraduate and graduate students to state-of-the-art instrumentation, data collection, and data analysis in the context of answering specific scientific questions. Both undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom come from underrepresented populations, will have an opportunity to apply the scientific method to a unique and dynamic problem of local significance, thereby deepening their experience in the STEM curricula. In addition, knowledge created by the proposed research will enhance the curriculum development and enrichment of elementary, middle, and high school students in&lt;br/&gt;Mobile County through the Mobile Area Education Foundation (MAEF).</AbstractNarration>
