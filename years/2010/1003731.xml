<AbstractNarration>In order to meet the growing economic need for computer information technicians in central Indiana, Ivy Tech is enhancing an existing computer information technology curriculum to conform to National Security Telecommunications and Information System Security 4011 standards.  Graduates are prepared to be Microsoft Certified Information Technology Professional Server Administrators with a security emphasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ivy Tech is partnering with local industry and the Moraine Valley Community College Regional Center of Excellence in Cyber Security and Forensics.  The enhanced curriculum is designed to prepare students for immediate employment as computer security specialists as well as for articulation to a baccalaureate degree in computer security.  Expected outcomes include new faculty expertise and curricular materials suitable for adoption at other community colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report Adaption and Implementation of a Cybersecurity and Cyberforensics Curriculum in a two-year Community College  Ivy Tech Community College, Indianapolis, IN  Ivy Tech Community College is a statewide community college system in Indiana with a centralized statewide administration, 14 major regional sites comprised of 30 separate campuses. This allows for the dissemination of curriculum and identified best practices developed in one regional site to the remaining educational sites and campuses.  The administration and staff at Ivy Tech recognized the need to strengthen the Computer Security program offered at our institution. Ivy Tech Community College enlisted the Center for System Security and Information Assurance (CSSIA), a National Science Foundation/National Resource Center, for assistance.  Two major objectives were identified. First, the curriculum would be updated and enhanced to meet the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems SecurityÆs (NSTISS) 4011 Certification.

This successfully completed all major and secondary objectives outlined in the original grant.       Last Modified: 04/24/2012       Submitted by: Mike Hall]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
