<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to build a new software infrastructure for&lt;br/&gt;continuing research on compiler optimizations for tensor computations.&lt;br/&gt;Motivated by the successes of the model-driven search-based&lt;br/&gt;optimization approach of the Tensor Contraction Engine (TCE) and the&lt;br/&gt;polyhedral model-based transformations, an optimization infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;is being developed that combines the key aspects of the TCE and the&lt;br/&gt;polyhedral models and provides the flexibility to continue research on&lt;br/&gt;optimizing and automatically parallelizing tensor computations for&lt;br/&gt;parallel and/or distributed computations for any machine architecture,&lt;br/&gt;including multi-cores and GPUs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This novel optimization framework has potential for high payoffs in&lt;br/&gt;enabling future research and eventually in generating high-performance&lt;br/&gt;code for an important class of quantum chemistry codes and other&lt;br/&gt;tensor computations.  After further research, it will become a&lt;br/&gt;valuable tool for reducing the time to develop high-performance&lt;br/&gt;applications in several areas of science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computers have made dramatic strides in speed over the last fewdecades, but unfortunately the ease of programming parallel computershas not made much progress. As computers have increased in achievableperformance, making it feasible to accurately model more complexphenomena, the time and effort required to develop the software hasbecome the bottleneck in many areas of science and engineering. Thedifficulty of developing high-performance software using the availablelanguages and tools is being recognized as one of the most significantchallenges today in the effective use of high-performance computers.   Previously, through funding from NSF and DOE, we have engaged in acollaborative project with quantum chemists on developing a programtransformation system to automatically transform a high-levelspecification of computations (expressed as complex tensor-contractionexpressions) into optimized parallel programs. The application domainof the Tensor Contraction Engine (TCE), electronic structuresimulation, is one of the key underlying technologies for advances inbasic energy sciences.   We have developed a software infrastructure for continuing ourresearch on compiler optimizations for tensor computations.  Motivatedby the successes of the model-driven search-based optimizationapproach of the TCE and the polyhedral model-based parallelization ofPluto, we have developed an optimization infrastructure in the ROSECompiler and experimented with different optimization approaches.   The project has trained several graduate and undergraduate students.The frontend of the TCE is currently being ported at Pacific NorthwestLaboratories to a tensor equation interpreter that is expected toreplace the prototype TCE in the NWChem quantum chemistry suite.
