<AbstractNarration>Fossils provide the fundamental evidence of human evolution.  Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania is one of the most fossiliferous and important sites for vertebrate paleontology and human evolution in East Africa.  Much of the past and current research conducted at this site focuses on the stone tools and modification of bones found in excavations.  This project differs from that and benefits science by focusing on the paleontology thereby contributing to knowledge of both the skeletal biology of human ancestors that lived in this region across the last two million years. In addition, the project focuses on collecting and identifying animals that are not recovered in human accumulated excavations, and as such adds information about the communities of animals that shared the landscape with them.  With NSF funding the researchers are conducting three field seasons focused on recovering fossils.  The field approach follows a highly systematic survey and collection protocol, and includes mapping of fossils and landscape features with high resolution satellite imagery.  The second research component of the project is the compilation of a database of all of the fossils collected to date from Olduvai Gorge.  This site was first discovered by scientists in 1911 and fossils have subsequently been dispersed to various collections around the world with no central database.  The database significantly improves the ability of other scientists to access these collections, and enables the Tanzanian government to care for this world heritage collection.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also includes workshops for K-12 teachers in Arusha, Tanzania.  These are coordinated with the successful K-12 workshops run by the University of California's Museum of Paleontology, opening up cross-cultural opportunities for teachers in California as well as in Tanzania.  The research also provides international collaboration and training of graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

We compiled an on-line database of approximately 10,000 fossils collected from Olduvai Gorge, representing the first relatively comprehensive inventory of this irreplaceable record of evolution.

As such, our new collections improve the stratigraphic context for those earlier collections as we can compare which animals are found in which horizons, more confidently intuiting where fossils with uncertain provenience were likely discovered. While we recovered a bone from the forearm of one of our ancestors who lived 1 million years ago, our more important scientific discovery is the extensive collection of fossil animals living at Olduvai at 1.9 million years ago, the earliest part of the geological record at Olduvai. This is the time period during which our genus, <em>Homo</em> evolved, and a time period at the Gorge for which we knew the least about (as these oldest sediments are not well-exposed in most parts of the Gorge).
