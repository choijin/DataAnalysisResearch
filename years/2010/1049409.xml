<AbstractNarration>This project will evaluate the impact and evolution of microbial communities impacted by the ongoing Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  The project involves a collaborative team that brings together strengths in all the requisite areas.   Dr. Pam Morris is a highly qualified marine microbiologist and Dr. Joe Suflita is an expert in the microbiology of hydrocarbon-impacted microbial communities. This is a timely and cutting edge application of the latest types of analyses that will combine microbial metabolomic and metagenomic approaches to provide meaningful answers regarding the response of the microbe communities in question. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will take advantage of on-going sampling efforts on-site and have already organized the appropriate arrangements to have the samples collected in a manner conducive to the proposed microbial work.  To do this, the PIs are working closely with two national/federal laboratories on this effort: Dr. Terry Hazen (US DOE Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and Dr. Richard Coffin (Naval Research Laboratory).  This will allow sampling of both contaminated in-plume and coastal sediment samples, as well as uncontaminated control samples.  Thus, the project will bring to bear very high-tech approaches in a manner that will have direct ecological relevance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is now considered the largest offshore spill in U.S. history.  This project will generate important information on the impacts of the spill on specific natural microbial systems.  As such, it is an unfortunate, yet useful, experimental opportunity to develop solid scientific understanding of such events. The project should help provide the knowledge required for fact-centered policy decisions regarding exploration and drilling enterprise.  This is a new collaboration between investigators from two EPSCoR states (South Carolina &amp; Oklahoma), and brings together their complementary expertise.  The PIs each have long histories of training and education at all levels.  Though the short timeline precludes some of the normally anticipated activities, the PIs will endeavor to find research opportunities, especially for undergraduates, to participate in the research.  Clearly, such a research experience could prove both exciting and influential.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was the largest in the history of the U.S.  More than 6 million barrels of crude oil were estimated to be released into the Gulf of Mexico (GoM).  This study sought to examine the metabolic fate of the oil as influenced by anaerobic microorganisms in ultra-deep sediment regions.  Initial literature reports suggested that seawater microorganisms were able to respond to the massive influx of oil by aerobically biodegrading the component hydrocarbons. Such processes would likely help mitigate the impact of the oil on GoM ecosystems.  However, we suspected that the consumption of oxygen by these organisms would eventually exceed its supply, particularly in sediments.  We looked for evidence that the microbial communities were changing in oil-impacted sediments and producing characteristic metabolites associated with anaerobic hydrocarbon decay relative to a background area that was not impacted by the spill. More specifically, we extracted and analyzed genetic material from microbes residing in oil-impacted GoM sediments and compared the findings with the background sample using the same procedures.  Such metagenomic analyses help provide a census of the organisms in an environment and an indication of what kind of genes they possess.  However, while detectable, not all genes are expressed. Evidence for actual gene expression helps lend powerful insight into how microbial communities may be functioning.  Therefore, we combined the metagenomic results with the extraction and mass spectral analyses of diagnostic metabolites.  Such analysis provides a chemical fingerprint of microbial metabolism and we specifically focused on evidence for anaerobic hydrocarbon decay.  We found that areas close to the well blowout site were significantly different than the background areas.  Specifically, the sediment samples nearest to the spill were enriched with hydrocarbon-degrading anaerobes. These anaerobic microbial communities also harbored the genes specifically associated with anaerobic hydrocarbon metabolism.  Finally, the signature metabolites associated with the anaerobic biodegradation of alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons were three times higher in areas closest to the spill sites, relative to the background area. These findings are the first to confirm the importance of anaerobic microorganisms in ultra-deep GoM sediments as major determinants of the fate of the oil spilled during the Deepwater Horizon accident. It also illustrates the value of interdisciplinary research to deduce another, and different, mechanism for the natural attenuation of spilt contaminants.
