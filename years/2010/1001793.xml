<AbstractNarration>We propose a conference, titled From A=B to Z=60, in honor of Doron Zeilberger's 60th birthday to be hosted by the mathematics department of Rutgers University and DIMACS (Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science).  Both the DIMACS center and the mathematics department of Rutgers University are located in Piscataway, New Jersey.  The goal of this conference, in addition to honoring and celebrating the work of Zeilberger, is to serve as a gathering place for those working in classical combinatorics, experimental mathematics, and other areas of combinatorics not based on graph theory.  We surely expect that significant collaborative work will result from the proposed conference and that students will make some valuable contributions in addition to valuable contacts.</AbstractNarration>
