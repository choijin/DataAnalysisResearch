<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Science Masters Program (SMP) award develops bioscience professionals trained in Regulatory Affairs (RA) at four California State University (CSU) campuses.   It will build on and broaden current Bioscience programs through a highly efficient design delivering new RA training online with courses drawn from a well-respected M.S. program.  It will result in new RA specializations in five Bioscience programs: biostatistics, biotechnology, computational sciences, environmental biotechnology, and biomedical physics.  These areas are in high demand in the growing bioscience and biotechnology industries and fill significant workforce needs of industry and government employers in high growth sectors in the state.  The program has unique educational aspects: an integrated RA emphasis and an infrastructure that supports course sharing and promotes interdisciplinary research projects in the five Bioscience programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will broaden the participation of talented US citizens in biology, biotechnology and the physical science master's programs. Focus will also be directed to include more underrepresented students and veterans through comprehensive recruitment strategies, a pipeline design involving early industry internships for minority students, and student support.  The project will enhance the infrastructure for masters education and research, including industry facilities and instrumentation, through the strong collaboration with corporate partners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project is a California State University (CSU) system wide initiative, a transformative model for extension of Science MasterÆs Programs (SMPs) enabling them to meet workforce demands with specialized professional study. While traditional æplusÆ courses in Professional Science MasterÆs (PSM) programs have been in management and business, the design is aimed at creating additional sets of professional courses that provide new concentrations for students in the range of professional Bioscience masterÆs programs nationally. The project is coordinated by San Diego State University (SDSU), which has led the CSU PSM initiative. The PI is Director of a new interdisciplinary SMP integrating biology and physics &ndash; a program in Biomedical Physics that addresses the significant workforce demand in this field. It includes co-PIs and Faculty Liaisons on four CSU campuses, all Directors of well- respected science MasterÆs degree programs that will establish new Bioscience Regulatory Affairs (RA) specializations. The project is a high priority for the CSU system, reflecting its commitment to workforce development, and includes academic and technology coordination roles for the ChancellorÆs Office.     Twenty two students were chosen as NSF awardees from across three campuses and in different areas of specialization in bioscience (San Diego State University: Biomedical Physics, San Jose State University: Biotechnology and CSU East Bay: Biostatistics).  The curriculum of the science masters programs was designed so that students took courses in the bioscience area of specialization in addition to courses in regulatory affairs.   In addition to regulatory affairs course work, students were also encouraged to identify and integrate regulatory guidelines in the research work.  The program also actively sought industry collaborations and the directors of each program directed students to internship starting in the summer after the first year.      The students graduating from these programs either directly entered the workforce in regulatory affairs and or research (e.g., from San Jose State University), as junior physicists (e.g. from San Diego State University).  Some graduates also went on to residency and PhD programs (Biomedical Physics).  Students found the additional courses relevant to the bioscience field and preliminary analysis showed that the science masters students were more competitive in the next phase of their career.      A series of research reports were submitted by students who were funded in the last reporting period.  These reports highlight the integration of regulatory affairs in the research internships and show the broad range of guidelines across different fields of bioscience.  These reports will be uploaded to the SDSU medical physics website to provide access to the bioscience and larger community.
