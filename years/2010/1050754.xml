<AbstractNarration>Almost all animal eyes follow a few and relatively well-understood functional plans.  Only rarely is an eye discovered that diverges fundamentally from known types, yet such exceptions frequently lead to exciting new discoveries in visual system function.  The principal eyes of the Sunburst Diving Beetle larvae (Thermonectus marmoratus) are among the most bizarre and strangely organized eyes in the animal kingdom, yet the larvae are extremely successful at capturing prey.   How does the unorthodox visual system facilitate efficient prey capture?  Anatomically, the eyes are characterized by multiple layered retinas, one of which is sensitive to green light whereas a second, deeper retina is sensitive to UV light.  It was recently discovered that this visual system operates with truly bifocal lenses, an organization never before demonstrated in an animal; this finding leads to the possibility that each retina receives its own sharp image.  Moreover it has become clear that these bifocal lenses use an interesting optical asymmetry that allows the animal to see each of the two images more clearly.  This project will use histological and optical techniques to investigate the physical and optical organization of lenses and will use physiological measurements to determine how light excites individual photoreceptors.  Throughout the project, several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained, and outreach activities will include science experiments at local schools.  A broader impact on the society at large is expected from a better understanding of the design principles of these bifocal lenses, principles that potentially could lead to improved designs of commercial bifocal and multifocal systems and the development of novel materials.</AbstractNarration>

Much can be gained from understanding such new optical and neural organizations, both to get valuable insights into fundamental biological phenomena, and to uncover design principles that are useful for engineering approaches.

This setup is also suitable to measure eyes and image the retina of a wide variety of other invertebrates while they are alive, and will become an important more general tool for vision science.        This project thus far has generated 10 peer-reviewed publications, which includes the publication of teaching materials for an undergraduate neurophysiology laboratory.  The research project was the basis of training eighteen undergraduate and seven graduate students as well as one post-doctoral researcher, and we used aspects of our science in a variety of outreach activities that demonstrated the importance of basic science to the general public.
