<AbstractNarration>This EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award will develop a strategy of making the concrete more environmentally friendly by using it as adsorbent to remove Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), therefore offsetting the NO2 emissions originating from cement production and various other sources.  NO2 emissions can cause various environmental and health problems. They contribute to formation of acid rain, atmospheric particles and various other toxic substances resulting in health problems, visibility reduction, eutrification and global warming. One of the most prominent results of NO2 emissions is formation of ground level ozone, which is produced in the reaction of NO2 with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. When formed, it causes adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strategy of using both fresh and aged concrete for NO2 removal offers a significant potential to transform the way the waste concrete is disposed of and recycled. It also brings together such disciplines as structural materials, materials engineering, surface science, environmental chemistry and atmospheric science in an innovative and synergetic manner.</AbstractNarration>
