<AbstractNarration>Hydrothermal circulation in the upper part of the igneous (volcanic) seafloor feeds submarine hot springs that support vigorous biological communities and causes an exchange of chemical elements between the rocks and sea water the affects the chemistry of the oceans in important ways, yet understanding these hydrothermal systems has been hampered by the difficulty of measuring heat flow and fluid flow. Heat flow blankets developed by one of the proponents of this projects are designed for deployment on bare rock, and thus hold the potential of providing improved and more detailed heat flow values. This deployment of heat flow blankets in combination with magnetic gradiometer and high-resolution bathymetry data seeks to characterize hydrothermal circulation at the RAVEN in detail. In additional to developing a heat flow method and contribution important new data to the field, broader impacts of this work include student participation, and outreach through teaching and public lectures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this program were to further a complete understanding of hydrothermal circulation within mid-ocean ridge spreading centers that would allow for better estimates of global heat flux from oceanic crust, and  the chemical flux due to  crust-ocean interactions.   We utilized a multi-disciplinary approach, including heat flow using thermal blankets, magnetic anomalies over a tight survey grid over a portion of the Endeavour axial valley floor, a Jason hull mounted near-bottom CTD inventory of bottom water temperature anomalies and a numerical modeling approach using this new data as boundary conditions.  The numerical modeling effort from this study consisted of generating numerous 2-D grids at various resolutions, designed to allow for the free exchange of fluids between the ocean and underlying crustal aquifer. we tested various permeability distributions within the oceanic crust, and compared modeled seafloor heat with data gathered during our research cruise.  The model results show that various sub seafloor permeabiliy distibutions are capable of generating seafloor heat flow patterns similar to observational data. This work demonstrates that observed seafloor heat flowin the vicinity of the Raven field on the Endeavor Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge is best explained by "mixed" hydrothermal fluid flow - both deep and shallow.
