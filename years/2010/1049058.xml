<AbstractNarration>This project, supported by the joint NSF-DOE-USDA Climate Research Investment on "Decadal and Regional Climate Prediction using Earth System Models", and funded by the Division of Chemistry Special Projects Program, will develop an integrated inter-disciplinary program to focus on Asia, its climate, air quality, and impact on humans that will include connections with hydrology, ecosystems, extreme weather events, and human health.  The approach is to create a team that will identify key scientific questions and develop a plan for future studies and to establish the research facilities to address chemistry and climate issues facing Asia, including the impact on humans.  Analyses of the model results and satellite data will give fine-scale (10-50 km) information on connecting climate change with air quality.  In turn, the air quality and climate change information will be used to estimate the vulnerability of humans to these changes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include providing to the science community present-day and future anthropogenic and biogenic emissions over Asia at less than 10 km resolution, a model system framework for investigating science questions addressing chemistry and climate over Asia, and a plan for future science studies as well as the training of students and postdoctoral researchers and dissemination of the research results through publications and conference presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will advance our knowledge on the interactions of chemistry, including particles, with climate and the vulnerability of humans to these changes in Asia.  The project, which is focused on one of the most highly populated and economically dynamic regions in the world, will provide a framework for detailed studies of interactions between the earth system and humans.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Asia is one of the most highly populated and economically dynamic regions in the world, with much of the population located in growing mega-cities.  It is a region with significant emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols and other pollutants, which pose high health risks to urban populations.  Emissions of these aerosols and gases increased drastically over the last decade due to economic growth and urbanization and are expected to rise further in the near future.  As such, the Asian continent plays a role in influencing climate change via its effluent of aerosols and gaseous pollutants.  Asia is also susceptible to regional changes in climate caused in part by interactions between aerosols and clouds, which potentially can have serious implications for freshwater resources.      To foster collaborations between atmospheric scientists and scientists assessing the impacts of air quality and climate on agriculture, human health, and the vulnerability of various human populations, two workshops were held.
