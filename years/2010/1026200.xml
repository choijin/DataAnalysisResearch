<AbstractNarration>PI:  Rod A. Wing (University of Arizona)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs:  Scott A. Jackson (Purdue University), Manyuan Long (University of Chicago), Carlos A. Machado (University of Maryland), and Michael J. Sanderson (University of Arizona)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborators:  O. Panaud (University of Perpignan, France) and D. Weigel (Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Germany), Doreen Ware (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory), Qifa Zhang and Sibin Yu (Huazhong Agricultural University, China), Bin Han (National Center for Gene Research, China), Marco Wopereis (Africa Rice Center (WARDA), Benin), Mathias Lorieux (International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Columbia, and Georgia Eizenga (DB NRRC, Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit.  Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) feeds more people than any other crop.  As the rice-dependent population is expected to double in about 25 years, breeders are faced with the enormous task of doubling rice yields with less land, water, and fertilizers, and on poorer soils.  It is therefore critical that the scientific community unites to provide the tools and biological/evolutionary insights required to meet future needs.  The project's long-term goal is to exploit 15 million years of evolutionary diversification and adaptation that have been locked in the genomes of wild and domesticated Oryza species, to both improve cultivated rice and address fundamental questions in evolutionary and comparative genomics. To accomplish this goal the project will first generate a set of publicly available genomics resources for the genus Oryza including:  i) physical maps for three wild relatives of cultivated rice and the closely related outgoup species Leersia perrieri;  ii) complete sequences for the short arms of chromosome 3 of these species;  iii) complete reference genome sequences for O. barthii (the wild progenitor of West African cultivated rice), and O. punctata (a wild species that will serve as the evolutionary outgroup the eight AA genome species--the species group containing O. sativa);  iv) gene and small RNA expression data sets for 11 Oryza species and L. perrieri;  and v) DNA polymorphism data sets across the AA genome phylogeny.  The project will integrate these new resources with 5 to 8 forthcoming new Oryza reference genome sequences to create the most comprehensive within-genus comparative genomics platform for any plant system. The project will interrogate this comparative genomics platform to discover key evolutionary events and characterize the forces that led to the formation of 24 Oryza species with 10 different genome types.  Specific research areas that will be addressed include: analyses of structural variation, phylogenomics, population genomics, genome evolution and the origin of new genes, and the role of transposable elements in genome evolution.  Libraries, genome sequences and their annotations will be accessible via public databases and repositories, such as the AGI BAC/TEST Resource Center (http://www.genome.arizona.edu/orders/), NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and Gramene (www.gramene.org).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts.  This project will have broad impacts at several levels, including basic and applied research communities, postdoctoral/graduate/undergraduate and high school student training and mentoring, community outreach, and K-5 children and their families. For basic/applied research communities, the project will enhance and develop a genus-level resource as a platform for accessing new traits and alleles that is unparalleled in the plant world.  This transformative platform can be used to address fundamental hypothesis-driven questions as well as provide essential tools to improve the world's most important food crop.  The project will provide training and mentoring to postdoctoral scientists, graduate/undergraduate students and high school students interested in genome evolution, plant breeding, and careers in academic and corporate science.  Finally, the project will develop a biannual "Plant Science Family Night" program, targeting K-5 students and families, to get children and their families excited about plants and the role plant science plays in ensuring a safe, sustainable, and secure food supply for our planet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Oryza Genome Evolution Project created the highest quality within-genus comparative genomics data set for higher eukaryotic systems with genomes &gt;100Mb in size to date.  Key findings of the OGE project are:  1) A single species phylogeny, supported by over six thousand single-copy orthologs, places the "crown" age of the AA clade at ~2.5 million years, implying a remarkably rapid diversification rate (~0.50 net new species/MYR) that is comparable to spectacular island adaptive radiations in plants. However, in Oryza this was accompanied by wide circumtropical dispersal rather than the extreme local adaptation typical of island radiations.  2) Radiation of the Oryza was also attendant with extensive introgression, particularly between the South American O. glumaepatula and African AA species, findings that underscore the semipermeable nature of Oryza species boundaries, at least within the AA genome species.  3) Many novel genes and gene families emerged in the Oryzeae tribe by a variety of mechanisms, including de novo origination from ancestral intergenic non-coding regions and gene recombination from existing protein-coding genes. As a group, new gene families show higher lability, reduced coding length, and higher rates of evolution compared to ancient families. Along with lincRNA genes, members of new families were more likely to localize to repetitive regions of the genome, suggesting a possible role of transposable elements and reduced meiotic recombination in their origin.  4) The turnover rate of LTR-retrotransposons within the AA genome lineage was found to be one to two orders of magnitude faster than that estimated for flies and mammal, respectively.  5) Analysis of insertions and deletions (indels) across six AA Oryza genomes revealed a significant bias towards deletion mutations, similar to metazoan lineages. Detailed analysis of O. glaberrima and O. barthii population resequencing data revealed that most indels are polymorphic, and few are fixed, thereby revealing one of the consequences of domestication on indel evolution.  6) Discovery of thousands of candidate disease resistance genes revealed an overabundance of heterologous gene pairs organized in head-to-head fashion, greatly extending support for the integrated decoy model of disease resistance function.  The methods used and the findings discovered will lead the path to new discoveries in genome evolution in general, as well as the identification of new traits and genes that can be used to help solve the 10-billion people questions &ndash; i.e. how to feed 10-billion human inhabitants by the year 2050.  Our work serves as a model for other plant and animal genome projects world-wide. The OGE project demonstrated that reliance on a single reference genome for a single species or genus is insufficient to understand the theoretical and practical consequences of genome evolution. It also showed that genome quality is critical, especially for the study new gene evolution, repeat dynamics and phylogenomics.
