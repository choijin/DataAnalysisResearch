<AbstractNarration>Cherokee, a severely endangered language according to the UNESCO Language Vitality Scale of Intergenerational Language Transmission, is unique among Iroquoian languages in that it alone exhibits lexical tone. Functioning together, tone and vowel length in Cherokee provide the only acoustic cues that distinguish large sets of words. Yet, there are no available resources of corresponding audio and written examples of Cherokee tone and related vowel length for language learners, teachers, or researchers to refer to. The overall goal of this project is to represent both tone and vowel length for each of 9,000 entries in the existing Cherokee Electronic Dictionary on three writing systems: the International Phonetic Alphabet, the historic Sequoyah Cherokee Syllabary, and a commonly used "Near Phonemic Alphabet." Other outcomes include: recorded recitations of each entry by different speakers to present a range of gender and phonetic detail, training for Cherokee speakers and advanced second language learners in documentary linguistics, and the development and pilot testing of materials and lessons that use the electronic dictionary to teach tone in Cherokee language classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will make available the largest searchable dataset on Cherokee prosody in existence, aiding researchers in measuring phonetic characteristics, describing distribution patterns, and testing theories of tone while providing Cherokee language learners a tool for improving their pronunciation and knowledge of the linguistic character of Cherokee. The resulting product may serve as a model for the creation of a documentary linguistics rooted in the expression of an Indigenous community's language and culture, illustrating that language work does not necessarily have to be framed through English.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cherokee NationÃ†s portion of the Cherokee Tone and Vowel Length project was accomplished with three trainees (Dennis Sixkiller, David Crawler, Candessa Tehee) and Principal Investigator, Durbin Feeling.  Initially, the Project began with ten fluent speakers of the language and ten language learners.      Members of the project participated in a two year training with a series of workshops conducted by Principal Investigators from Cherokee Nation, University of Kansas, and University of Oklahoma.  The Project started with the trainees learning to recognize differences in tone and vowel length of a variety of Cherokee words.  The words came from a variety of printed books such as the Cherokee-English dictionary, Song book, and other sources.      Dr. Dylan Herrick, a phonetician from the University of Oklahoma, Department of Linguistics made extensive use of computer analyses of Cherokee words.  The computer software displayed a graphic analysis of every word.  The analyzed words showed every movement of sound whether it was going down, up; whether it was a mid-tone, high-tone, low-tone, super-high tone, or "slurring up or down".       The second part of the training came from working with Barbara McAlister, former Opera singer from within the ranks of the Cherokee people.  These Outcome workshops were successful as the trainees began to relate tone and vowel length to the varying pitch sounds of the very songs the Cherokee sing today and the slurring and staccato style of pronunciation of some Cherokee vowels.  The analysis of Cherokee words is ongoing.       Last Modified: 03/20/2014       Submitted by: Durbin D Feeling]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
