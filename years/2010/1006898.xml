<AbstractNarration>The proposed projects examine the geometry and dynamical properties of the outer automorphism group of a free group, Out(F), and its ompanion, the Culler-Vogtmann Outer space CV.  The first project furthers Behrstock, Bestvina and Clay's investigation of the asymptotics of intersection numbers for free groups and its implications to the dynamics of Out(F) on certain simplicial complexes analogous to the curve complex.  The second project further develops Clay and Pettet's new construction of fully irreducible automorphisms.  This has applications for the third project where Clay and Pettet will begin to explore the thin part of the Outer space with the asymmetric metric.  The fourth project aims to show that nonvirtually abelian subgroups of Out(F) satisfy "uniform-uniform'' exponential growth.  The final project proposes to involve undergraduates in examining the structure of subcomplexes of the curve complex for a surface.  Together with undergraduates, Clay will create a computer program for studying free groups that assembles several classical and established algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graph is a collection of points connected by edges.  Graphs with the same number of "holes" can be considered themselves as points in a space, called Outer space.  The shape of this space is well-known, but its geometry is not.  One surprising geometric feature that is known is that the space is asymmetric, meaning traveling between two points may take longer in one direction than the other.  This notion is very natural to anyone who has hiked up a mountain.  This project involves an analysis of the asymmetries of Outer space.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Humans are naturally attracted to symmetry, be it a regular hexagonal pattern in a honeycomb, a clever rhyme scheme of a poem or the beautiful tilings in the Alhambra. Symmetry is what draws us to an object, makes us want to investigate it further and gives us pleasure once we have unlocked its mysteries and origins. A group is a mathematician's tool for defining, studying and understanding symmetry. Groups can be defined and studied algebraically; they are set endowed with an operation (like addition) and usual algebraic manipulations apply. Doing so turns a blind eye to the wonderful geometry that permeates group theory.  This research studies groups by examining how their natural geometric structure influences their algebraic structure and how algebraic properties are manifested geometrically.  Among the significant discoveries funded by this award are:  A robust construction of quasi-isometrically embedded right-angled Artin subgroups of mapping class groups.  The Thurston-type of the elements in said subgroups was described. An algorithm that detects full irreducibility of a free group outer automorphism. That the quantitative aspects of the negative curvature of the curve complex of a surface is independent of the surfaceÃ†s topology. Rationality of stable commutator length for certain elements of Baumslag-Solitar groups.  For such elements, it was determined exactly when an extremal surface exists. An analysis of certain quasi-morphisms led to a robust and optimal statement regarding a lower bound of stable commutator length for well-aligned elements in tree actions.  This work answered a question of Danny Calegari and Koji Fujiara.  This was further used to show that stable commutator length is either 0 or at least 1/12 in nonsovable Baumslag-Solitar groups. A simple comprehensive argument showing that, except in a few obvious cases, mapping class groups and right-angled Arin groups are not commensurable.  Additionally, right-angled Artin groups were shown to not be commensurable with the general linear group, the outer automorphism group of a free group and various other related groups and subgroups.       A portion of this research done under this award was in conjunction with undergraduates, providing one-on-one training and mentoring.
