<AbstractNarration>The development of eco-friendly high performance thermoelectric nanocomposite material is the key for large-scale applications of thermoelectricity. The Mg2(Si,Sn) compounds not only exhibit good thermoelectric properties but also comprise of non-toxic and abundantly available elements with high chemical and thermal stability. This award supports travel for research  discussions between senior participants and students at Clemson University (Clemson, SC) and Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China) on the thermoelectric properties of Mg2(Si,Sn) nanocomposites. The results emanating from these research discussions are expected to provide guidance for developing collaborative research efforts for designing thermoelectrically favored microstructures and for thermoelectric properties optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this activity is very pertinent to our overall energy needs in the future, as the US currently is responsible for one fourth of the world?s energy usage and China?s energy demands are growing rapidly as the standard of living is increasing throughout the country. The students participating in this activity will become more aware of global energy needs.</AbstractNarration>

These help students, both at the graduate and undergraduate level, gain a better understanding of the primary and secondary effects (e.g., of electron-phonon, electron-defects, interface scattering etc.) in a nanocomposite material, identify new questions and design new experiments to further address these questions. They also gained deeper understanding and insight from each otherÆs experimental expertise and approaches to this cutting edge research; and become more aware of future global energy needs.
