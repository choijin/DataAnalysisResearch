For instance, previous interpretations of environmental conditions of black shale deposition centered on applying modern analogs of coastal upwelling or ?Black-Sea type? silled basin topographies.  However, a superestuarine circulation model has been proposed recently to explain the abundant and widespread Paleozoic black shale deposits of Midcontinent North America. It is the purpose of this research project to use an interdisciplinary approach to investigate paleoceanographic conditions during the deposition of Pennsylvanian cyclothems of Midcontinent North America and to test the ?superestuarine circulation hypothesis?. This work is a comprehensive data-model synthesis study and geochemical proxies (strontium and oxygen isotopes of biogenic apatite; bulk major- and trace-element abundance data, TOC-TIC-S concentrations, and petrographic data) will be compared to biofacies distribution patterns and to results of numerical ocean circulation models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding provides research opportunities for undergraduates at several universities and will support one PhD thesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             During the Pennsylvanian, 310 million years ago, global rises and falls in sea level related to glacial events in the southern hemisphere produced a series of short-lived flooding events alternating with subaerial exposure across Midcontinent North America.  Each of these cycles of sea level change deposited a regular series of sandstones, terrestrial shales, coals, marine limestones, and marine organic-rich black shales. The origin of the organic-rich black shales. potential sources rocks for oil and gas, has been difficult to interpret, for they accumulated during the time of highest sea level when organic productivity was apparently highest, but were deposited in anoxic (low oxygen) bottom water.  Although these black shales are thin, just a few feet thick, many of them stretch for hundreds of miles across the Midcontinent region, from Oklahoma northward into Iowa and eastward into Illinois.              For this project, we chose three of the most widespread black shale units for high-resolution analyses of their geochemical attributes and the distribution of conodonts, a common Pennsylvanian microfossil.  The objective was to collect sufficient information to create a regional model of water circulation, biological productivity, and climate during the time of deposition of the black shales.  The three shales studied represent different episodes of black shale deposition separated in time by a few million years.  This permits one to view the black-shale depositional setting at different points in time, which allows comparisons to be made to discover common features versus unique attributes of black shale environments at different times.               The geochemical research, conducted by collaborators on this project, focuses on specific chemical compounds that occur in different forms depending on the environmental conditions of shallow surface water, deep bottom water and sediments during deposition.  The geochemical attributes reflect the chemistry of water and sediments eroded from surrounding land areas, the climate, the biological processes occurring during deposition, and the water circulation patterns that facilitated the creation of low-oxygen bottom waters that enhanced the preservation of organic matter in the black shales.               Conodonts are phosphatic microscopic mouth parts (&lt;1 mm) of an extinct small marine organism that flourished during the Pennsylvanian.  Previous work has suggested that different major groups of conodonts occurred in regular spatial (geographic and stratigraphic) patterns apparently related to variations in water chemistry (salinity, oxygen level) as well as water depth and distance from shore.  A general model of conodont life distribution relative to water depth and water circulation patterns had been inferred based on the conodonts' spatial distribution.  However, this model had yet to be rigorously tested against other interpretations of environmental settings.  In this project, a comparison of the distribution of conodonts, which sensed the environment as living animals, was to be made directly with geochemical data from the sediments in which they are preserved, and measure chemical attributes of the environment. The conodonts were subdivided into the smallest taxonomic groups possible to detect the slightest changes in ecological parameters. Comparison of conodont distributions versus geochemical datasets allows one to determine areas of agreement, suggesting that the environmental parameters have been resolved.  It permits identification of areas of disagreement, where environmental interpretations derived from the conodont distribution differ from those indicated from the sediment geochemistry.  Either the conodont model or the geochemical model, or both, may require adjustments.        Results show that at the most general level, the conodont distributional and geochemical models produce compatible interpretations.  During the height of sea level, estu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
