<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award aims to examine the active-layer morphology of polymer solar cells in unprecedented detail to develop a basic understanding of the structure formation process.  Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy will enable elemental mapping at nanometer length scales, while grazing-incidence X-ray scattering will provide statistical measures of the morphology.  The combination of these complementary techniques makes the identification of the critical material parameters governing non-equilibrium structural evolution possible.  It is hypothesized that polymer semiconductor/fullerene mixtures can be described as polymer solutions; thus, the crystallization kinetics of conjugated polymers in concentrated solutions will be studied as model experiments.  Insights from the combination of structural data and device data will lead to structure-function relationships relevant to polymer solar cells.  Furthermore, methodologies to promote anisotropic crystal growth and control nucleation will be explored as strategies to control the morphology.  The combination of basic knowledge regarding the morphological evolution and widely-applicable strategies for mesostructure control will enable the development of high-performance devices by easing the implementation of novel materials in polymer solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics, or polymers, are ubiquitous in society.  This is a result of the many intriguing properties of polymers.  The proposed work aims to take advantage of some of these properties: the ability to absorb light, conduct charges, and spontaneously form an internal structure at nanometer length scales, or about 1/10,000 the width of a human hair.  The combination and optimization of these properties will enable sunlight to electricity conversion and the fabrication of polymer-based solar cells.  The strategy for achieving the proposed work is centered on developing a basic understanding of the polymer properties which govern the structure-formation process and ordering phenomena.  Integrated undergraduate research and educational activities are proposed to improve retention of undergraduate students and encourage the pursuit of advanced degrees.  An emphasis will be placed on underrepresented groups to improve diversity in both undergraduate and graduate student populations.  This includes developing new interactions with Penn State satellite campuses, which in some cases lack post-bachelor degrees but boast diverse student populations, in an effort to highlight undergraduate research opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mixtures of organic semiconductors may serve as the active layer in flexible devices capable of harvesting energy, driving displays, or sensing the environment.  The ability to mix multiple components together can yield multiple functionalities, if the microstructure can be controlled.  This project focused on examining the complex interplay between mixing of the components and crystallization of the individual materials comprising blends.  Overall, this award led to twenty one peer-reviewed publications (18 published, 3 under review), three PhDÆs, one MS, and over ten research experiences for undergraduates.   A main accomplishment of the work is centered on elucidating the role of mixing on charge transport in organic semiconductor mixtures.  Electrical transport through model amorphous blends of conjugated polymers and fullerenes were examined, and we found that charge mobilities are governed by the percolation of fullerene molecules if the polymers and fullerene were miscible, but once phase separation occurs charge mobilities are proportional to the volume fraction of the conducting phase (in this case, fullerene).  As a consequence, we predicted that an optimum miscibility exists for polymer/fullerene mixtures used in solar cells, where too strong phase separation prevents charge photogeneration and complete miscibility disrupts charge transport.  This prediction has been confirmed by others.   We have also found that the crystallization of the polymer governs the nanoscale morphology in polymer/fullerene mixtures.  This behavior is relatively universal for high-performance materials, such that the active layer of many different polymer/fullerene mixtures exhibits a similar morphology.  Therefore, a paradigm for achieving high-performance in polymer/fullerene solar cells is to use polymers with self-limiting crystallization, where crystallites are limited to about 10 nm in two directions but the third is allowed to grow.  This fibril-like morphology creates both high amounts of interfacial area for charge photogeneration, but also creates percolating pathways for charge extraction.    The project leveraged the description of the morphological evolution in polymer/fullerene mixtures used in organic photovoltaics to explore strategies to control the morphology.  Control of processing conditions, including zone annealing, can control crystallization and therefore the final morphology in polymer/fullerene blends.  Furthermore, we have developed fully conjugated block copolymers, where self-assembly leads to nanoscale structures and control of the morphology in the active layer of organic photovoltaics.    Another outcome of this grant has been the development of electron microscopy tools for the study of conjugated polymers.  We have demonstrated the utility of core-loss (200-1000 eV) energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy, where you couple spectroscopy and microscopy to enhance the contrast of polymeric systems.  Furthermore, we have demonstrated that this technique can be extended to excitations at energies of a few eV, such that imaging is sensitive to the valence chemical structure of the materials comprising the blend.    Educational efforts have focused on providing opportunities for undergraduate students, mentoring of students from underrepresented groups, and promoting recruitment and retainment of students in engineering.  We developed a program where Engineering student ambassadors visit First Year Seminar engineering courses to deliver messages from Changing the Conversation, a publication by the National Academy of Engineering.  The hypothesis is that altruist messages are more appealing to students, and therefore can enhance both recruitment and retention.
