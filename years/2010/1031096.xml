<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this travel grant is to support 10-15 graduate students from the United States to participate in the 11th IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Net working (IEEE WoWMoM), to be held in Montreal, Canada on June 14-17, 2010.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;IEEE WoWMoM is a high quality conference and is the premier technical forum dedicated to addressing state-of-the-art challenges and directing future directions in wireless mobile multimedia networking. Participation in this conference provides the students an opportunity to interact with peers and more senior researchers, thus having the opportunity to be exposed to leading edge work in the field of wireless and mobile multimedia networks. The support of this grant enables the participation of the US-based students who would otherwise be unable to attend IEEE WoWMoM 2010.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The student selection process will consider the following: 1) students from groups traditionally underrepresented; 2) students from universities that traditionally lack funding to support graduate student attendance at conferences; and 3) students who will present their papers during the conference. Priority will be given to the graduate students from underrepresented groups, such as women, African American, Hispanics, and Native American students, and from universities that lack financial resources.</AbstractNarration>
