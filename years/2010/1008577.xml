<AbstractNarration>The motivation for this project is to understand the Galactic distribution of dense molecular gas associated with high-mass star formation regions and to characterize the protostellar and proto-cluster evolution of dense molecular clumps. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is a spectroscopic follow up of about 8000 sources discovered with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS). The determination of fundamental parameters (such as sizes, masses, and luminosities), of these regions requires the knowledge of accurate distances. Here kinematic distances are measured with a spectroscopic survey comprised of simultaneous observations of the gas molecules HCO+ and N2H+ with the Heinrich Hertz Telescope toward the entire BGPS catalog sample. The kinematic distances are derived using a newly developed probability density function methodology which enables the characterization of the clump mass function and the mapping of the clumps onto the plane of the Galaxy. The evolutionary states of BGPS clumps will be probed by combining information from extant mid-infrared, far-infrared, millimeter, and radio continuum surveys with new observations of dense molecular gas. These data are needed to better understand the formation, evolution, and Galactic distribution of high-mass star forming regions in the Milky Way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The derived velocities, kinematic distances, and a database of dense molecular clump properties and evolutionary information will be released to the scientific community and enhancing the BGPS archive. The database will be useful for planning efficient follow-up programs with Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the Expanded Very Large Array (eVLA) in the coming decade. This project has a strong participation of graduate and undergraduate students and will help to train the next generation of astronomers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goals of this grant were to characterize the physical properties of a large, statistically significant, sample of dense regions that are current and future sites of star formation within the Milky Way Galaxy.  We used the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), the first large-scale survey of the Galactic plane (over 200 square degrees) at millimeter wavelengths.  Cold dust grains (typically 10-20 K) emit radiation at millimeter wavelengths that can be detected with bolometer cameras on ground-based radio telescopes.  The BGPS catalogued over 8400 dense, dusty clumps within the Galaxy.  In detail, our goals were to characterize the physical properties (size, mass, etc.) of these newly discovered objects, and to characterize the evolutionary stages of the clumps (i.e. which objects are likely future sites of star formation and which objects are currently forming stars) to compare their physical properties.  We first determined the distances to these objects by observing the emission from molecules within the dense clumps and using the Doppler shift with knowledge of how the Galaxy rotates.  We carried out the largest targeted survey of dense molecular gas to date, using the Submillimeter Telescope of the Arizona Radio Observatory.  Over half of the BGPS clumps were detected in a dense molecular gas tracer (Schlingman et al. 2011 and Shirley et al. 2013 ApJ).  To determine the gas kinetic temperature of a subsample of these clumps, we observed a sample of over 1500 clumps in transitions of ammonia using the 100m Green Bank Telescope operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.  There is an ambiguity in determining the distance to objects that are in directions that are within 90 degrees of the Galactic center.  Each velocity corresponds to a near and far distance, resulting in large uncertainties in derived physical properties.  We developed a new technique based on Bayesian inference to quantify the probability that each source lies at a given distance from the Sun (Ellsworth-Bowers 2013 and 2015a).  The technique uses the Galactic coordinates of the objects, a smooth physical model of the dense gas in the Milky Way, and a comparison to absorption seen at mid-infrared wavelengths (8 microns) from the publicly available Spitzer Space Telescope survey of the Galactic plane (GLIMPSE) to develop "priors" to discriminate near and far distances.  The resulting Distance Probability Density Functions (DPDFs) permit proper accounting of distance errors for deriving physical properties.  The typical BGPS clump has a size of 1 parsec , mass of a few hundred solar masses, and is consistent with being gravitationally bound (Schlingman et al. 2013, Svoboda et al. 2016).  The distribution of masses has a high-mass power-law slope that is intermediate between that of larger molecular clouds and individual stars (Ellsworth-Bowers et al. 2015b).   The face-on map of the Galactic diskÆs mass surface density based on BGPS dense molecular cloud structures revealed the famous high-mass star-forming regions W43, W49, and W51 to be prominent mass concentrations in the first quadrant (Ellsworth-Bowers et al. 2015b).  Within the region from 10-65 degrees in the first quadrant of the Galaxy, BGPS sources were sorted into evolutionary stages by comparing to existing Galactic plane surveys from the near-infrared through the radio (Svoboda et al. 2016).  This analysis identified the largest, most robust sample (&gt; 2200) to date of massive starless clumps candidates.  These objects represent the earliest phase of massive star formation.  The lifetime of the starless phase was found to depend inversely on the mass of the clumps with most starless clumps having lifetimes that are longer by a factor of a few than the average free-fall times of the clumps.  Many physical properties (such as size, gas kinetic temperature, and mass) show increasing trends when ordered by increasing luminosity of the different evolutionary indicators.
