<AbstractNarration>Traditionally, there has been an isolation of responsibilities of&lt;br/&gt;physical layer (PHY) and higher layers of the network stack leading to&lt;br/&gt;severe inefficiencies in bandwidth-limited wireless&lt;br/&gt;networks. Remedying these inefficiencies requires rethinking and&lt;br/&gt;redesigning wireless protocols such that higher layers and PHY work in&lt;br/&gt;synergy. This project explores three schemes under the PHY-Informed&lt;br/&gt;Networking (PHY-IN) framework. 1) Carrier Sense Multiple Access with&lt;br/&gt;Collision Notification (CSMA/CN) mechanism detects and aborts&lt;br/&gt;collisions, breaking away from the existing collision avoidance&lt;br/&gt;(CSMA/CA) based schemes such as 802.11. 2) Constellation BAsed Rate&lt;br/&gt;(CBAR) adaptation scheme jumps to the best feasible rate suitable for&lt;br/&gt;a varying channel. 3) Remap scheme permutes bit-to-subcarrier&lt;br/&gt;assignment for a retransmission to improve the chances of its success.&lt;br/&gt;The PHY-IN framework has the potential to impact the landscape of&lt;br/&gt;future wireless networking protocols. Apart from mentoring both&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate students into independent researchers, this&lt;br/&gt;project, involving an EPSCoR university and a research lab, will also&lt;br/&gt;help broaden the participation and industry collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
