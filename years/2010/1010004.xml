<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to research problems on the intergalactic medium (IGM), quasar evolution, and galaxy formation by analyzing the spectra of close quasar pairs.  The existing dataset, comprised of over 100 pairs, enables a wide range of exploration in this grant period, including 1) Investigating the thermal history of the IGM at redshifts of 2 to 3;  2) Providing the first robust measure of the transverse proximity effect on scales of a few hundred kpc to several Mpc; and 3) Studying the physical state of the halo interstellar medium in the massive, high-redshift galaxies that host luminous quasars.   The program will assess the chemical abundances, ionization state, density, and kinematics of the gas at impact parameters of tens to hundreds of kpc from bright, redshift 2 to 4 quasars. These observations will inform the processes of massive galaxy formation and the nature of quasar feedback at high redshift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate students recruited from a Hispanic Serving Institution, graduate students, and a postdoc, and public outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the Quasars Probing Quasars (QPQ) project, we have explored the physical environment of the universe's most luminous sources: quasars -- super-massive black holes that are actively accreting gas from their surroundings.  WIth our novel experiment, we studied the nature of the gas enveloping the quasar's host galaxy.  Contrary to previous theoretical prediction, we discovered a massive reservoir of cool gas, enriched in heavy elements (e.g. carbon, silicon).  Remarkably, this gas reservoir exceeds that observed for any other population of galaxies in our Universe.    The funds enabled the collection of high-quality spectra on the Keck, VLT, and Magellan telescopes.  These data are now being leveraged to study the gas in the cosmic web, in particular the thermal history of the majority of our baryons.    With these funds, our international collaboration has assembled a team of researchers from undergraduate students to senior faculty.  The junior members have been trained in data analysis, data collection, experimental design, scientific writing, and oral presentation.  In collaboration with Hartnell College, we drew undergraduate researchers from traditionally under-represented populations to give them a first experience in scientific research.  The lead scientists have presented their main findings at a series of international conferences and have presented distilled versions to the public in general lectures and classrom presentations.  The primary publications from this award and related data products may be found here: http://qpqsurvey.org/.       Last Modified: 09/22/2015       Submitted by: Jason X Prochaska]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
