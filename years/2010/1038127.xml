<AbstractNarration>This collaboration among TCUP colleges Cankdeska Cikana Community College Community &lt;br/&gt;College, CCCC, Ft. Berthold Community College, FBCC, Turtle Mountain Community College , &lt;br/&gt;TMCC, and Sitting Bull College, SBC, and North Dakota State University, NDSU, is the &lt;br/&gt;culmination of more than 11 years of active engagement in STEM education on the reservation, &lt;br/&gt;including a year-long academic sabbatical at TMCC by an engineering professor.  It supports a &lt;br/&gt;tribal college vision of expanded life-choices for reservation residents that could provide more &lt;br/&gt;technical competency for tribal decision-making, infrastructure improvement and the &lt;br/&gt;opportunity for personal and tribal advancement without loss of cultural heritage.  For NDSU &lt;br/&gt;the benefits would include expanded participation of culturally diverse students, shared &lt;br/&gt;fulfillment of the 1862/1994 land grant mission, improved faculty-student communication and &lt;br/&gt;interaction and expansion of the talent pool entering STEM professions.  The heart of the &lt;br/&gt;proposal is the interaction of tribal high school, tribal college, mainstream University and &lt;br/&gt;engineering profession stakeholders to facilitate the recruitment, education and support of &lt;br/&gt;tribal students to acquire and hone the skills that will allow them to enter the engineering &lt;br/&gt;profession or contribute in some other fashion to their communities and the nation.  The &lt;br/&gt;proposal will accomplish this vision by impacting students through interactions with faculty/ &lt;br/&gt;staff, curriculum and supporting functions/agencies.  All of this will be accomplished in a &lt;br/&gt;culturally supportive fashion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College (NHSC) is located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in northwest North Dakota, home of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation.  With a one-year extension, the PEEC: 2+2+2+Infinity: Pipeline for Tribal Pre-Engineering to Society (PTiPS) grant was awarded to NHSC on September 1, 2010.  NHSC is proud to report the following objectives have been met during the grant period:  1.  Establishment and institutionalization of an Associate of Science in Pre-Engineering. The degree was launched during the first year of the grant.  It contains culturally relevant course material and puts focus on both local and global engineering projects and design.  2.  The graduation of one student with an A.S. in Pre-Engineering from NHSC, with three additional students' on track to graduate Spring 2017.  An articulation agreement and the successful transfer of five Pre-Engineering students, within cohorts, to North Dakota State University to complete their Bachelor of Science in Engineering, with three additional students transferring in Fall 2017.  Cohorts included students from each of the four tribal colleges participating in PEEC.  Each cohort worked together in completing classes, performing engineering projects, and creating a family support system which assisted in the successful transfer of students from the tribal college environment to the main stream university.  3.  The expansion of research, project management, and engineering design opportunities for NHSC's Pre-Engineering students.  Because of the addition of the A.S. degree in Pre-Engineering, students were able to complete comprehensive research, project management, and engineering design projects during our summer engineering camp at North Dakota State University.  Projects included research, project management, engineering design, oral, and written presentations.  4.  The contribution to local engineering needs on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation through Engineering Internships and Work Study.  Students participated in summer engineering internships with local firms and/or with outside firms working on local engineering projects.  Students worked for the Mandan Hidatsa Arikara (MHA) Nation Tribal Office of Natural Resources, working under Professional Engineers, on a variety of environmental and civil engineering projects for the MHA Nation.  In addition, students worked on local road construction projects designed to improve traffic flow and reduce traffic fatalities on the Fort Berthold reservation, which sits in the Bakken oil region, with Civil Engineering firms.  Students also worked with a local satellite site of a major U.S. Aerospace Manufacturing company, Northrup Grumman located in New Town, ND, which assists with the local economy by providing steady, high-paying jobs to Fort Berthold residents.
