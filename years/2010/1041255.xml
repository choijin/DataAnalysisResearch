<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Northern Arizona University (NAU) to establish an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) program. NAU is an institution with a strong reputation for training Native American students as well as students from other underrepresented backgrounds. The NAU-URM program will provide research experiences in biology to four cohorts of scholars starting in fall 2010 and continuing through summer 2014. Each cohort will be comprised of at least seven students who will be trained by faculty mentors involved in cutting-edge research. Scholars will be matched with mentors based upon their individual interests because experience has shown that matching students with the right mentor is critical to inspiring Native American students to pursue advanced degrees. URM scholars will have a wide variety of research projects from which to select. Some examples include: (1) biological responses to uranium contamination on the Navajo Nation; (2) ecological responses to climate change using an elevation gradient as a proxy for climate; (3) developmental responses of amphibians to endocrine disruptors in the environment; (4) effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on the structure of soil food webs; and others. Scholars in the NAU-URM program will be selected based on their potential to succeed in graduate programs in the biological sciences, and their personal statements, past experiences, academic performance, and letters of recommendation. The NAU-URM program will provide undergraduate scholars one to three years of independent research mentored directly by faculty and a year-long research methods seminar. The program assures the success of scholars through integrating four levels of advisement and mentoring: faculty mentors, peer mentors, URM program staff, and NAU student services. In addition to research, students have access to a strong support system in the university and receive training in effective written and oral communication. Scholars are encouraged to present their research findings at national and international meetings, and co-author publications in peer-reviewed journals. URM program staff will monitor scholars' experiences through regular assessments of their research progress and academic progress. The goal is to get URM scholars to gain admission into highly competitive graduate programs in the biological sciences. The success of the program will be measured by the student accomplishments and their career outcomes.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The ultimate goal of our Undergraduate Research Mentoring (URM) Program <em>Life Sciences Strengthened by a Spectrum of World Views</em> was to increase the diversity of the workforce in the life sciences. To accomplish this goal we provided 12-month research fellowships to 36 undergraduate students at Northern Arizona University (NAU). Many of the URM Fellows successfully competed for fellowship awards for two or sometimes three years, so the grant provided the equivalent of 50 years of student support. Thirty of the URM Fellows (83%) were from underrepresented backgrounds, including: Hispanics, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, African Americans and also a first generation college student, a returning student (veteran), and a single mother. Our 25 faculty mentors came from a diversity of academic units at NAU including Biology, Forestry, Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, Psychology, Center for Microbial Genetics and Genomics, and also the US Geological Survey and the Arizona Game and Fish Department.&nbsp;</p> <p>All of the URM Fellows&nbsp;received one-on-one research training from their individually selected faculty mentors. Also, the Fellows gained valuable training through our <em>Foundations of Research</em> class (ENV 499) that was taught by our URM Coordinator Dr. Anita Antoninka. The course was designed to help the URM Fellows learn and practice essential research skills and also gain general life skills. The weekly class meetings helped build a collegial community among the URM Fellows, and these relationships often stimulated very effective peer mentoring among the students. Throughout the academic year the <em>Foundations of Research</em> course helped the URM Fellows learn how to:</p> <ul> <li>Access and critically read scientific literature</li> <li>Design experiments </li> <li>Prepare a research prospectus</li> <li>Prepare and present a scientific poster </li> <li>Prepare and present a scientific talk</li> <li>Peer review written and oral presentations</li> <li>Prepare a professional resume&rsquo;</li> <li>Apply to graduate schools or professional programs</li> </ul> <p>At the end of each spring term, URM Fellows presented their research in poster sessions at the UGRAD research symposium at NAU. Every fall term they give oral presentations at our annual URM research symposium to an audience of URM alumni, families, faculty and NAU administrators.&nbsp; Twenty-three URM Fellows have presented their work at other regional, national or international research conferences. Nine Fellows successfully acquired additional research funding through internal NAU undergraduate research programs.</p> <p>By all measures, the URM Program: <em>Life Sciences Strengthened by a Spectrum of World Views </em>was successful in enhancing the diversity of people in the life science career pipeline. At least seven URM Fellows have co-authored papers with their mentors in peer reviewed publications, and at least three more are currently in preparation. Out of 36 URM Fellows, four are currently completing their BS degrees, five have completed MS degrees, seven are in MS programs, five are in PhD, or PhD/MD programs, and two are in PA school. In addition, another eight URM alumni are currently working in STEM-based careers, including STEM education, and jobs at agencies such as the Center for Disease Control, the US Forest Service, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service.</p> <p>Three factors contributed to the success of the URM program at NAU. First, each student was carefully matched to a faculty mentor based upon the student&rsquo;s interests. Our goal as URM administrators was to generate win-win associations. This helped assure that both the student and the faculty mentor would work to their full potential in a research partnership. The student provided the labor and the faculty provided the expertise.&nbsp; Second, weekly meetings of the URM research course and social events throughout the year-long program helped generate strong friendships among the Fellows. This supportive network of peers was especially important for underrepresented students who may not have strong bonds with other groups on campus. Finally, NAU faculty have a strong tradition of hosting undergraduate students in their research laboratories, and their dedication to training undergraduate students is at the heart of our success.</p> <p>The combination of NSF funding, willing research faculty and a diverse student body created a highly successful URM program at Northern Arizona University. Research mentoring is a two-way street. The mentor and the student set research goals and they usually successfully achieved these goals. Frequently, much more was achieved than research progress and the exchange of scientific knowledge. There was also an exchange of world-views that often benefited the faculty mentor as much or more than it benefited the URM Fellow. Although it is difficult or impossible to quantify, an important outcome of our URM program was that it revealed a broader spectrum of world-views to both the faculty mentors and the URM Fellows. This expanded perspective may help to strengthen the life sciences both now and in the future.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/24/2016<br>      Modified by: Nancy&nbsp;C&nbsp;Johnson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041255/1041255_10021079_1479959602678_URM2014-2015cohort--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041255/1041255_10021079_1479959602678_URM2014-2015cohort--rgov-800width.jpg" title="URM cohort from 2014 - 2015"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041255/1041255_10021079_1479959602678_URM2014-2015cohort--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="URM cohort from 2014 - 2015"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">URM gathering 1st row: Jeremy and Julia Antoninka, 2nd row Adrianna Nimer, Anita Antoninka, Alma Solis, Jocelyn Garcia, Annie Dyer, 3rd row: Solan Watts, Nancy Johnson, back row: Emmett Tsosie, Mariah Ashley, Harlan Tso</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rick Johnson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nancy&nbsp;C&nbsp;Johnson</div> <div class="imageTitle">URM cohort from 2014 - 2015</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041255/1041255_10021079_1479959842099_NancyFaytheAradhana2015--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041255/1041255_10021079_1479959842099_NancyFaytheAradhana2015--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Undergraduate research mentoring at Norther Arizona University"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041255/1041255_10021079_1479959842099_NancyFaytheAradhana2015--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Undergraduate research mentoring at Norther Arizona University"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">URM Researcher Faythe Duran with mentor Nancy Johnson and graduate student Aradhana Roberts</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rick Johnson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nancy&nbsp;C&nbsp;Johnson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Undergraduate research mentoring at Norther Arizona University</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041255/1041255_10021079_1479960022163_FaytheDuranandClareKazanski2014--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041255/1041255_10021079_1479960022163_FaytheDuranandClareKazanski2014--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Collecting soil samples for URM research at Northern Arizona University"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041255/1041255_10021079_1479960022163_FaytheDuranandClareKazanski2014--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Collecting soil samples for URM research at Northern Arizona University"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Faythe Duran and Clare Kazanski at the Arboretum at Flagstaff research site</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rick Johnson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nancy&nbsp;C&nbsp;Johnson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Collecting soil samples for URM research at Northern Arizona University</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041255/1041255_10021079_1479960346667_ScottAndersonandMartinaTingley2011--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041255/1041255_10021079_1479960346667_ScottAndersonandMartinaTingley2011--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Faculty mentor and URM Fellow at the annual URM Research Symposium"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1041255/1041255_10021079_1479960346667_ScottAndersonandMartinaTingley2011--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Faculty mentor and URM Fellow at the annual URM Research Symposium"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Professor Scott Anderson and URM Fellow Martina Tingley at the URM Research Symposium 2012</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rick Johnson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nancy&nbsp;C&nbsp;Johnson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Faculty mentor and URM Fellow at the annual URM Research Symposium</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
