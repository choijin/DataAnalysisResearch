<AbstractNarration>1005327&lt;br/&gt;Dhawan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro (ISBI) is a forum for researchers particularly interested in the computational and modeling aspects of biomedical imaging. It emphasizes methodologies that have the potential to be applicable to multiple imaging modalities and to imaging at different scales. Topics include physical, biological and statistical modeling of biological and anatomical structures, image formation and reconstruction, computational and statistical image analysis, visualization, and image quality assessment. The meeting aims to facilitate cross-fertilization of methodologies between different imaging modalities and scales, with applications ranging from the nano, molecular and cellular levels through small-animal imaging to macroscopic and whole-body clinical systems. Whereas many medical imaging meetings focus on particular modalities, ISBI includes a diversity of methodologies applied to biological and anatomical imaging modalities, either emerging or well established. Applications of interest include gene expression mapping, drug discovery and delivery, molecular imaging, functional brain mapping, computational neuroanatomy, cardiovascular imaging, and cancer imaging. A principal goal of ISBI is to connect methodologies with important biomedical applications, from microscopic to macroscopic scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; ISBI 2010, to be held April 14-17, 2010, in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, will be the seventh in a series of meetings cosponsored by two IEEE societies: the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) and the Signal Processing Society (SPS). The inaugural ISBI meeting was held in July 2002, and subsequent ones in April 2004, 2006, 2007, May 2008, and June-July 2009. The success of the previous ISBI meetings bodes well for the future of ISBI. The success of ISBI and its impact on the field, and indeed the future of the field itself, relies on training young investigators to work with state-of-the-art sophisticated computational or modeling tools and on informing the researcher community of the latest progress in medical imaging protocols and modalities. In addition, the inherently interdisciplinary nature of the biomedical imaging field means that no single professional organization has the majority of potential participants as its members. In this context, the tutorials series, covering very diverse topics and offered on the first day of the symposium, is an important component, which has been very popular in previous ISBI meetings. This project will fund to support the participation and attendance at the symposium by US based young investigators (students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty).</AbstractNarration>

The symposium supports a tradition of cross-fertilization between different imaging communities an integrative approach across all observation scales.     ISBIÆ10 Technical Program     There were two parts to the technical program: 1) the contributed part that was the result of the call for papers, and 2) the invited part for which the speakers and papers were solicited.     Most of the publicity and interaction with the participants was web-based. The symposium had a website, http://www.biomedicalimaging.org/. The authors submitted their papers electronically and later registered on the web; this part of the process was handled by CMS. The symposium program was available electronically and a pocket guide was distributed at the meeting.

To summarize the main facts and highlights of ISBI'10:  In total 640 papers were submitted of which 340 were accepted For the first time all submitted papers received 4 rather than 3 reviews Being one of the most selective ISBIs (53% acceptance) the program was of high quality For the first time a best student paper competition was organized (3 papers awarded) The invited program consisted of 4 tutorials, 4 plenaries, and 8 special sessions In total 497 people registered for the symposium The social program included two social events       There was a strong participation of students in tutorials and student paper competition. 91 students attended ISBI. 22 students/Post-Docs applied for financial support. 10 travel grants were provided to US-based young investigators (students and postdoctoral fellows) who presented contributed papers at the meeting. Selection of recipients was made by the symposium chairs based on application and support letters and reviewer ratings of their papers. Ten students/post_docs were funded from the NSF grant to reimburse travel expenses:    In conclusion, the meeting ISBI 2010 was a success with respect to quality of papers, distinguished speakers and student participation.
