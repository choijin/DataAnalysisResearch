<AbstractNarration>Wave coherence influences a broad range of physical phenomena, ranging from the propagation of ocean waves or the transmission of light through interstellar clouds, down to the motion of individual electrons in nanoscale electrical circuits or the transmission of photons through optical fibers and other waveguides. They generate a rich variety of interference phenomena, such as enhanced backscattering, weak and Anderson localization or effects of higher-order coherence such as quantum noise, bunching and anti-bunching of particles. These effects are well understood for noninteracting fields, however treating wave interferences in nonlinear media or in presence of interactions is a formidable task. The main goal of this research is to develop analytical and computational tools to investigate the dynamics of nonlinear quantum and wave coherent systems. Nonlinearities as well as the notion of localization and wave interferences have analogies with interacting electrons in disordered or complex environments, an intensively investigated problem in condensed matter physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is forecast that the methodology developed in the research will find a broad range of applications and trigger novel theoretical investigations towards nonlinearities in a wide class of complex quantum systems, in condensed matter, molecular and statistical physics, as well as in the mathematics of dynamical systems, chaos theory and fluid dynamics, and constitute a stepping stone for the development of new theoretical approaches in a wide class of nonlinear complex quantum systems. The research furthermore has the potential to help construct more powerful microlasers with enhanced designs and performances, with applications in biosciences, communication or information technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have a strong educational component, where undergraduate and graduate students will be exposed to front edge scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
