<AbstractNarration>The funding from NSF will provide partial support of participant travel to the American Physical Society, Division of Fluid Dynamics, 63nd Annual DFD Meeting 2010 in Long Beach, CA November 21- 23, 2010. This is the largest international annual meeting of fluid dynamicists in the world, with 1800 anticipated attendees. The meeting has been successfully run for over sixty years. The chief intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in virtually every sub-discipline of fluid dynamics. The broader impact will be to increase participation of students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the meeting and pay associated costs. Preference is given: (i) to those presenting talks at the meeting, (ii) to students, (iii) to applicants from other than US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Russia, (iv) to those who have not received such an award in the past, and (v) to no more than one applicant from a given research advisor. Since the awards are meant to supplement participant travel funds, not to cover these entirely, the committee takes into account the travel budget entered on the application. Special effort is made to achieve diverse participation from underrepresented groups in engineering, including women and members of minority groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fluid flow is of fundamental scientific interest, and it is of incredible importance in engineering (planes, cars, biomedical devices, manufacture of advance materials).  This past year, the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill was analyzed by scientists using the tools of fluid mechanical analysis.  The annual meeting of the Americal Physical Society, Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting brings researchers from around the world working across a broad range of fluid mechanical disciplines to together, and it therefore provides an perfect venue for exposing young reasearchers to the breadth and richness of this field.  This NSF award funded the travel of graduate and undergraduate students from US institutions to attend.  20 travel grants were awarded to the top applications from the 365 applications we received.  There they saw talks on splashes, ocean circulation, the gulf oil spil, fluid mechanics representations in movies, blood flow, sound generation by jets, and a myriad of other topics.  They also had the opportunity to interact with internationally known researchers from the United States as well as from over 25 countries around the world.  The full program from the meeting can be seen via the link http://www.dfd2010.caltech.edu/index.html.  A highlight of the meeting are the fluid flows visualized in the Gallery of Fluid Motion.  The spectacular beauty flowing fluids can be viewed at  http://pof.aip.org/gallery_of_fluid_motion/2010_gallery.  All winners also presented their own fluid mechanics research results at the meeting.       Last Modified: 05/15/2011       Submitted by: Jonathan B Freund]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
