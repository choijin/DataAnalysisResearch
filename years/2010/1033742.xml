<AbstractNarration>1033742&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal for a bottoms-up engineering of bone tissue focusing on engineering cortical bone, the major load bearing component of bone. This approach contrasts with the current  state-of-the-art that focuses on creating highly porous cancellous bone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work proposes a creative approach that combines ideas from modular assembly of small tissue building blocks to form large constructs, nano-structured scaffolds, and tissue culture to cellular engraftment upon these structures. The educational broader impacts of the proposed work are graduate student education and research, the development of underrepresented groups, the engagement of a local community college, the inclusion of high school student research activities, and course development.</AbstractNarration>

Barbara and Julie participated in summer research at Stevens as well as received international research experiences in Prof. Henk Busscher&rsquo;s lab at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) in Netherlands. We have also provided research experiences to 4 students (Sherilyn Nunez, Iroshi Seneviratna, Kaylee Saltos and Chandni Sharma) under the ACS-SEED program.

As the quantitative measures of the intellectual products/publications, the project has 1) produced 4 journal papers, 3 manuscripts in submission, and 3 book chapters; 2) generated data used for 2 U.S. provisional patent applications (one has led to the NSF-Icorps award and NSF/STTR award), 3) led to more than 20 invited talks to international and national conferences, institutions and companies, and 4) 14 conference presentations (3 by graduate and 4 by undergraduates).
