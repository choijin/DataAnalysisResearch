<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI organized a U.S.-Asian Workshop on Random Dynamical Systems, held at the Nanjing Normal University, China,June 22--25, 2011. The goals of this workshop were to nurture high quality scientific activity, to develop and strengthen international mathematical collaboration, and to stimulate the interest of U.S. graduate students, postdocs, junior mathematicians  in the area of  random dynamical systems.  Dynamical systems in engineering and science are often subject to uncertainties.  Taking stochastic effects into account is of central importance for developing mathematical models of complex dynamical systems under uncertainty. This subject is developing very rapidly, and is penetrating deeply  into other  scientific and engineering disciplines.  Intellectual  merit of the proposed activity Mathematics is becoming increasingly collaborative. The solutions to the important problems of mathematics  require input from a diverse group of researchers, usually  from different countries, and rapid progress  requires an organized collaborative effort such as this proposed workshop.  Broader impacts of the proposed activity: This workshop is the second U.S.-Asian workshop on Random Dynamical Systems. It served as a venue for developing  communication and establishing collaborative research among research groups from U.S., China and Europe.  As a result, many scientific collaborations have been started between European and Chinese researchers and their American counterparts. Moreover, broader discussions around Education occured during this friendly venue. This is a very good forum  for learning about other world views and experiences.
