<AbstractNarration>This project will characterize the massive star population of the nearby, star-forming galaxies of the Local Group in order to provide critical tests of stellar evolutionary theory. Current models, while successful in some areas,  severely overestimate the lifetimes of the most massive yellow supergiants at high metal abundance ("metal" refers to elements above helium in the periodic table). This project will examine massive stars in several Local Group galaxies, where metallicities differ by a factor of 20. A key goal is to measure mass-loss rates to see how the rates depend upon metallicity.  Mass loss largely controls the evolution of massive stars, determining whether a star of 40 solar masses (for example) evolves to a yellow supergiant, red supergiant, and/or a Wolf-Rayet star.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data obtained here will permit critical tests and improvement of the latest evolutionary models. Undergraduate students from Northern Arizona University and Wellesley College will have the opportunity to undertake research as part of this project. Finally, spectra obtained in the present proposal will be made available to other researchers, to enable studies of (for example) the interstellar gas in these galaxies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Massive star are extremely rare, but they have a disproportionate effect on their environment. They manufacture most of the carbon and oxygen atoms in the Universe.  Their spectacular deaths as supernovae trigger the formation of the next generation of stars. Without massive stars, the sun might not have formed, and carbon-based life would be impossible.   Our proposal has been aimed at understanding how massive stars evolve as a function of the initial composition (metallicity).   Theoretical models of stars contain many approximation and simplifications.  Without feedback from observations, our theorist colleagues cannot know which of these are good enough, and which of them are limiting the accuracy of their calculations.  And, understanding massive star evolution is not only of interest in its own right, but is essential in other areas of astrophysics, such as population synthesis, the study of what kind of stars make up a distant galaxy.      Our approach has been to discover the relative numbers of types of evolved massive stars in the nearby star-forming galaxies of the Local Group as these galaxies span a range in initial composition. Our work has been published in 18 peer-reviewed papers and 10 conference proceedings and abstracts.  We have been privileged to work closely with theoreticians at the Geneva University, who are among the leaders in massive star evolutionary models, allowing us to substantiate where the models work well, and identify where the models fail.  At the same time we make our findings available to others, allowing other theory groups to benefit from this research.   Here are some of the most important highlights of our efforts:   1. We carried out complete surveys for Wolf-Rayet stars in M31 and M33.  These studies revealed that the evolutionary models do a relatively good job of predicting the relative numbers of the two types of Wolf-Rayet stars at lower metallicities, but fail at higher metallicities.  One possible explanation for the discrepancy would be if mass loss in binary systems was a significant path to forming Wolf-Rayet stars.  We were able to eliminate this possibility by determining that the fraction of binaries among our sample were the same at low and high metallicities.  2. We began a modern search for Wolf-Rayet stars in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.  These galaxies have always been the linchpins for studies of Wolf-Rayet stars, as we thought our knowledge of their Wolf-Rayet populations were complete.  But our survey found many additional Wolf-Rayet stars, and, most interesting, discovered an entirely new type of Wolf-Rayet star.   3. Our previous work had shown that there was a serious problem with the evolutionary models of massive stars in that they predicted many more high mass yellow supergiants than lower mass yellow supergiants, which was contradicted by our observations.  In 2011 the Geneva group made several improvements in their calculations, and our subsequent work demonstrated that these changes had worked in solving the problem.   4. Our most interesting discovery, and the one that has attracted the most attention from the public, has been the discovery of the first Thorne-Zytkow object.  These are "hybrid" stars, in which a neutron star has been swallowed up by a red supergiant.  Such an object can produce extremely rare proton-rich elements, such as Molybdenum, and it had long been theorized that such TZOs were the primary source of such elements. The only problem was that in forty years no one had discovered such an object.  As part of study of the massive stars in the Magellanic Clouds, we discovered a red supergiant that showed most of the expected characteristics: after forty years of searches, we believe we have found the first observational evidence for the existence of TZOs.  These studies have provided rich research opportunities for undergraduates and early-career scientists, many of whom are women, a group underrepresented in the physical sci...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
