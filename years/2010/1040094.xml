<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) with support from the Chemistry Division and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Professor Xueqing Song and Isadora J. Posey from the University of the District of Columbia, Vadim D. Knyazev from the Catholic University of America and Paul Sabila from Gallaudet University will acquire a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer that will be shared among the three institutions. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as organotin research; initial stage pyrolysis of polymers; synthesis of quinine-derived natural product-like compounds; monitoring pesticide and other hazardous chemical wastes; and chemical composition of biogas production in an anaerobic digestor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a wide range of areas including organic and organometallic synthesis, natural products synthesis, analytical chemistry, environmental science, biochemistry, and chemical engineering.  Moreover, the presence of the shared NMR will stimulate additional competitive research requiring this tool and catalyze new multi-disciplinary collaborations involving researchers in several disciplines at these campuses. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and be used by large numbers of students underrepresented in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of the District of Columbia has provided the proper housing and environment for the Bruker AscendTM 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The spectrometer, accessories, and a HPCWIN Four (4) Windows host workstation have been installed in the new UDC NMR Laboratory.  Additionally, a remote workstation has been installed in a teaching laboratory at each of the partner institutions, Gallaudet University, The Catholic University of America, and UDC.  The PIs have been collaborating on the development of policies for usage and maintenance of the spectrometer to best serve the interests of teaching and research.   Several Research projects have been initialized at the three collaborating institutions, including "Novel Ionic Triorganotin(IV) Complexes as Possible Bactericides and Fungicides"(UDC), " Monitoring of Glyphosate and its degradation residue by phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy"(UDC), "Synthesis of organotin macromolecules for semiconducting electronic devices"(UDC), "Synthesis and characterization of beta-cyclodextrin complexes"(UDC), "Kinetics of the initial stages of pyrolysis of polymers" (Catholic), and "Synthesis of quinine-derived natural products-like molecules" (Gallaudet). Data collected in these research projects by the new instrument have resulted in six publications and several in preparation.  As a result of further collaboration between UDC and CUA, a new project "1H NMR-based metabolic profiling of anaerobic or aerobic metabolism" between Dr. Xueqing Song (UDC) and Dr. Frankin Portigual (CUA) was initiated in summer 2013.
