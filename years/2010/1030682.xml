<AbstractNarration>Nanomechanical Material Size Effects Using an In-Situ, &lt;br/&gt;On-Chip Test Platform&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accurate measurement of material strength at small scales is of critical importance in the design and manufacture of reliable nano-scale devices.  Statistical representations of strength for many nano-scale materials require large numbers of high-precision, repeatable strength tests executed on a platform that is practical to use.  The objective of this project is to not only allow large numbers of accurate small-scale strength measurements, but to also advance the understanding of size-related strength effects in specimen sizes down to the nanoscale.  To achieve this goal, we will extend the capabilities of an on-chip micro/nanoscale testing platform, allowing the rapid testing of large numbers of specimens of a variety of materials with the capability of in-situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be a collaborative project led by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), partnering with Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  This project will build upon current research at CMU and SNL, supported by Sandia, for initial test platform development.  Furthermore, this project will leverage access to unique fabrication facilities located at Sandia, Albuquerque.  The PIs will collaborate with NIST researchers who are developing complementary testing approaches and unique localized strain measurement techniques.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research lies in its unique study of nanoscale size effects, which will quantify and provide a fundamental understanding of size-dependent strengths.  Coupled with in-situ SEM observation and stress mapping techniques available at NIST, the proposed research will explore the nature of nanoscale material strengths in a way that has not been achieved to date.  It will also offer, for the first time, a fundamental basis for designing micro/nanoscale components, fully exploiting the statistical nature of material strengths.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The greatest broader impact of the proposed research will be its development and application of a precision-calibrated testing platform for in-situ observation and testing of large numbers of specimens of nearly any material that can be deposited on polysilicon in thin film form.  Despite being the subject of considerable research effort, micro/nanoscale tensile testing techniques have not been developed that allow the high-precision testing of large numbers of specimens.  This will be a breakthrough in the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and micro/nanoscale materials testing communities, impacting the development of new micro/nano-scale products.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As structures become smaller, their strength tends to increase.  It is important to quantify this strength increase for optimum design for micro- and nanoscale structrures.  However, testing the strength of structures just a few micrometers in size requires special test methods.  Interpreting the results enables the understanding of new phenomena.   In this work, we developed two new platforms to test strength size effects.  In order to mimic real micromachined structures as closely as possible, the platforms were made entirely by surface micromachining methods by Sandia National Labs in Albuquerque, NM.  The first is shown in Fig. 1(a) and it was used to test a brittle material &ndash; polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon).  This material is used to make widely available commercial products such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and microphones.  It tends to fracture due to flaws at its surfaces, which arise at intersections of grain boundaries.  The flaws act as stress concentrators and can be considered to be cracks in a fracture mechanics formalism.  In order to gain information on strength size effects, both tensile bars and notched specimens were designed. In the latter, the strength is locally increased at the notch root.   Example specimens are shown in Fig. 1(b).  An optical metrology was used that enabled us to make nanometer-scale displacement measurements.   Results for the different specimens are shown in Fig. 2, where the probability of failure is plotted against the applied stress.  Here the largest sample has higher failure probability at a lower stress.  The smallest specimen has almost twice the strength.  Failure curves based on statistical theory and on details of the stresses in the notched samples were developed, and predicted the failure probability well according to a goodness of fit measure.  Another important result is that there is a lower bound strength of about 2 GPa, about four times the strength of medium carbon steel.   This implies that even though billions of these samples are made commercially, none will fail mechanically.  Another aspect of the proejct was a collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  NIST used the polysilicon test platform to calibrate applied stress in polysilicon samples, and also to locally map stress in polysilicon microgrippers, where it is important to avoid failure.  The second platform was made to test aluminum thin films, which are also widely used in commercial products exhibit some ductility.  Special attention was paid to the following:  (i) how the sample was gripped through microgrippers, (ii) a method to shunt all heat developed in the thermal actuator away from the specimen, and (iii) out-of-plane deflections of the Al sample which rested on top of the platform instead of inside it.   Previous studies indicate that thin film metal strength increase as thickness decreases.  The current work corroborated that result.  Importantly, a new result is that strength increases by 50% as length decreases from 200 micrometers to 50 micrometers.  Transmission electron microscopy was used to directly image defects in the specimens stretched to failure.  Localized defects correlated with lower ductility in such samples.     This award supported the Ph.D thesis work of two students.  A course on "Experimental Micro- and Nanomechanics" was also developed and taught through in support of this award. Outreach included student travel to Sandia National Labs to participate in a national competition on design of micromachines.
