<AbstractNarration>A Platform for Internet Innovation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The architectural stability of the Internet was crucial in fostering the development of new applications and networking technologies by giving the former a stable base upon which to build and giving the latter a fixed set of requirements to support. However, in recent years this architectural stability has become a liability, as there are areas of increasing importance ? most notably inadequate support of security and availability, lack of adequate mechanisms for privacy, mobility, middleboxes, and data-oriented functionality ? where the original Internet architecture falls short.  The persistence of the Internet's architectural deficiencies is not because they are intellectually intractable, but because they are beyond the reach of incrementally deployable changes.  Based on this observation, the research team takes a different approach than recent clean-slate designs, focusing not on a new fixed architecture but instead on providing a platform to enable architectural innovation through incrementally deployable changes, without massive disruption in the infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;In this research project, the research team focuses on the ?hardware-defined functionality? challenge and proposes a ?platform for innovation? that allows the network infrastructure to support new architectures without changes to the underlying hardware. In particular, this approach will enable forwarding hardware to support a wide range of alternative designs.  In addition, so that changes can be introduced alongside the current design, hardware will also be able to support multiple designs simultaneously. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed platform will use a newly developed paradigm called Software-Defined Networks (SDN), currently embodied in the OpenFlow and NOX projects. OpenFlow is an open hardware forwarding interface. NOX is an open-source software platform that provides global abstractions to network management software and in turn communicates the decisions made by this software to the individual forwarding boxes.  This effort will provide a solid foundation for more general SDN designs that are open, comprehensive and can meet long-term needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will also explore and demonstrate applicability of the SDN approach including abstractions and programming model for different domains of network use. These include enterprise, WAN, home, and wireless. To demonstrate the ability of the proposed platform to support innovation in radically new network mechanisms, the research team will deploy prototype novel architectures on SDN. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed approach would allow the use of known approaches and design proposals currently available in the literature to address many of the Internet's current problems, as these solutions would be incrementally deployable, without major disruption to the underlying infrastructure. Furthermore, current commercial efforts to address Internet?s deficiencies are disjointed, proprietary, and tailored for short-term needs. The next generation of SDN technology provides a solid basis for coordinated, long-term efforts to address critical needs in areas of security, mobility and support of content-centric application and services. More importantly, the proposed approach would allow the Internet to meet future requirements as they arise through incrementally deployable modifications, relieving network designers of the burden of predicting what these future requirements might be.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed technologies and protocols to make networks more evolvable, as well as easier to manage and secure.  The outcomes of the project included:  An exploration of how Internet transit is priced, and how different pricing structures can make consumers better or worse off.  In particular, our SIGCOMM 2011 paper demonstrated the benefits of tiered pricing in the Internet transit market. The design of two new systems that were built on the Internet's existing interdomain routing protocol, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), that improve network systems' resilience to failure as well as the throughput and latency of Internet services.  This research resulted in two released systems, and publications in two top-tier conferences (ACM SIGCOMM and ACM SIGMETRICS). The application of Software Defined Networking (SDN) to improve problems in interdomain routing, in the form of a Software Defined Internet Exchange Point (SDX).  The initial SDX design and implementation appeared in ACM SIGCOMM, the premier publication venue for networking research, and the system is now being deployed both on the GENI testbed and on Internet2.   Over the course of the FIA project, we have explored problems both within the context of the current interdomain routing system (with BGP as the basis for exchanging routing information) and assuming the possibility for a re-design of interdomain routing around a more programmable substrate (relying on the deployment of SDN-capable switches at Internet exchange points).  Our work has resulted in the release of several major software systems, some of which are now being deployed in production and commercial networks.
