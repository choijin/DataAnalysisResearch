<AbstractNarration>The Problem-solving Examples with Narration for Students (PENS) project is creating and assessing instructional materials that target one of the central skills required for success in the STEM fields: problem-solving.  Instead of focusing solely on the refined end product of problem-solving or written solutions, students are instructed on how to focus explicitly on the problem solving process, with particular attention paid to self-regulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make what is essentially an internal thought process explicit, students and instructors record think-alouds that are then included in mathematics, chemistry, physics and teacher preparation courses to support teaching STEM problem-solving.  To assist students in actively learning how to problem solve through the analysis and interpretation of these recordings, a rubric has been created and integrated into class activities.  Through these activities students are better able to plan, monitor and adjust their work as they solve complex, real-world problems. Raising student efficacy in problem-solving may help otherwise competent students see STEM disciplines as positive career options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think-alouds are recorded using the Livescribe Pulse smartpen, a ball-point pen with an embedded computer and microphone.  When used with Livescribe Dot paper, the pen records and synchronizes pen strokes and audio to create a pencast.  Once uploaded to the Internet, users see an animation of the written work that displays the writing in real time with synchronized audio.  Pencasts, and associated keywords identifying topic, problem characteristics, and solution features, are listed in a searchable database and available to students, instructors and researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Problem-solving Examples with Narration for Students (PENS) Project created and assessed instructional materials that target one of the central skills required for success in the STEM fields: problem-solving. Too often, textbooks and instructors present algorithms as a substitute for genuine problem-solving.  To solve problems, students must be able to think independently, create solutions that do not resemble previously seen examples and check for errors. These skills can be described as self-regulation or self-monitoring.  For someone to self-regulate his/ her thoughts, they must first be articulated.  The process of articulating oneÆs thoughts forces one to evaluate and refine them.  For this reason the PENS project utilized a think-aloud protocol, where students and teachers described every thought and decision as they solved a problem.  Using novel technology, Livescribe smartpens, these solutions were recorded and analyzed.  In mathematics, chemistry and physics courses, students would share their recorded solutions with their peers as well as with their instructor.  The students could then use the feedback that they received to improve their problem-solving.  As the project progressed, these recordings were added to a searchable database and utilized as authentic examples in later courses.  Class activities and grading rubrics were designed around the ACE-M framework- Analyze the problem, Create a plan, Execute the plan and Monitor your thought process throughout a solution. While similar to models espoused by Polya and others, ACE-M brings the self-monitoring/ regulation to the forefront.  Because of the increased time spent learning problem-solving and verbalizing thoughts, PENS instructors found that their students were adept at solving more complex problems than previous students.  Across all of the disciplines, students reported that the PENS and ACE-M activities helped them.  At the end of each semester, approximately 85% of introductory physics and Calculus students reported that they utilized the ACE-M process and found it helpful. The Calculus 1 students who credited ACE-M as reason for their success had course grades that were almost a full letter grade higher than those who didnÆt cite ACE-M.  Calculus 1 students were able to realize the benefits not only in that course, but also the next one, where they had different instructors. It was observed that students who had been taught with PENS and ACE-M had a higher course grade in calculus than those who were not exposed to PENS and ACE-M in Calculus 1 (3.09 vs. 2.81).  The techniques that the students learned transferred to a different course and helped the students be more successful.  Similarly, the 78% of the introductory physics students reported a beneficial transfer of their newly acquired problem-solving skills to other courses. On an end-of-the-semester survey, 71% physics students reported self-monitoring/ regulating their thinking more frequently than at the start of the semester.

In PENS introductory physics courses, Force Concept Inventory normalized gains were significantly higher than they were in pre- PENS courses (taught by the same instructor). (0.54 versus 0.37).  Throughout our project, we disseminated PENS and ACE-M materials and methods to the local K-12 teaching community through an in-service professional development program. The students who were taught by the trained teachers were more likely to enroll in a 12th grade math course (95% vs 78%) and reported a higher problem-solving self-efficacy than those who had not been introduced to ACE-M.  As a result of the research done, many conference presentations and workshops were given and several manuscripts were prepared. The manuscripts not only describe the PENS activities, but also new insights into how students self-regulate their problem-solving. Through ou...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
