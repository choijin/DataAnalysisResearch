<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Malliavin Calculus and Stochastic Analysis, to be held March 19-21, 2011, at the University of Kansas, will bring together many top players in stochastic analysis and probability theory, two interconnected branches of mathematics at the crossroads of theoretical and applied math. The topics covered will include some of the most important recent developments, noted because of their intrinsic beauty and intriguing new structures, as well as for some exciting potential for new statistical procedures which may improve our understanding of many fields from climate science, to telecommunications, to quantitative finance. The conference will attract many graduate students and recent Ph.D.s, who will benefit greatly from interaction with the many top researchers present at the conference, exposing them to the state of the art in their fields, creating career-lasting contacts, and helping develop their peer networks. This meeting is of special significance to the world of stochastic analysis, as an hommage to the recently departed Paul Malliavin and his extraordinary work and influence, and as a tribute to David Nualart, arguably the greatest disseminator of the Malliavin calculus, one who has influenced scores of researchers over several generations, and continues to inspire in the same way.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was for a 3-day international conference in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Kansas, on the topic of Malliavin calculus and stochastic analysis (the word "stochastic" denotes random phenomena which are difficult to predict but nonetheless follow specific rules.)  These are cutting-edge research topics in the mathematical sciences, at the confines of mathematical analysis (e.g. the study of functions,  such as those encountered in Calculus and beyond) and probability theory (the study of the rules that control random events, such as the movements of the stock market). The motivations for research in these areas are to better understand the complex objects of study so that we may best advise practitioners on how to use these objects as building blocks for the mathematical models they need to create to understand their own fields.  For instance, at this conference, it was reported that the Malliavin calculus, a technique by which one can understand the variations of complex random systems with respect to their underlying basic random motions, can also be used to judge the risks that these systems present, particularly to find lower bounds on best case scenarii, and to find out how stable these systems' statistics can be when averaged over many samples, even if the samples are highly correlated. These findings are pathbreaking, and have already proved useful in parameter estimation in statistics, in studying stochastic models in heat transportation and in polymer growth, and even in understanding the finance behind carbon markets, as we learned at the conference.  Many other topics were also covered, too many too count, and the overall conclusion is that the Malliavin calculus and stochastic analysis have a great deal to offer applied science, in any area where complex random phenomena are too complicated to model in full detail, but can be understood in their aggregate form.
