<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is realization of Networked Mobile Assistive Systems (NMASs) that allow people to receive physical assistance and rehabilitation treatments anywhere, at any time with feedback regarding adequacy and appropriateness of training. The approach taken will consist of two major elements: a body-sensor network and a highly reliable wireless network. Most of the data acquired from a body-sensor network and the algorithms for the control of mobile power assistive devices will be stored on a host server, and users will access the system with any portable computer while receiving appropriate assistance and rehabilitation treatment. The networked systems will also allow doctors to observe the stored information without compromising the important, sensitive personal interactions between the provider and the patient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research will contribute to the improved quality of life for physically impaired people (young or old) who have problems with community mobility and specific gait limitations. It will also provide a powerful tool to physical therapists in the treatment of patients. The project team consists of two PI's from Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science and a consultant from Physical Therapy. This team uniquely links engineering with clinical applications. The interdisciplinary research opportunities will be made available to engineering students and students in physical therapy. The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at the University of California, Berkeley provides a unique environment and opportunity to the team to interact and share research findings with other researchers and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is an Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) Project jointly funded by ENG/CMMI and CISE/CNS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed at building a networked mobile assistive system (NMAS) that integrated a physical assistive device, a high-speed and real-time wireless network, and a body sensor network. The NMAS would greatly improve gait rehabilitation performance and make the training more convenient for both patients and therapists. Major outcomes of this project include:  A wireless gait monitoring system was integrated to comprehensively analyze gait abnormalities. The system included several inertial sensors and a pair of shoes with pressure sensors,. A user interface was developed on both laptops and mobile devices (e.g., iPad) to provide useful and intuitive feedback to patients during rehabilitation training. A human subject study (with twenty-four patients) was conducted to validate the effectiveness of visual feedback during rehabilitation training. A human kinematic model was built to predict human joint movement, analyze walking abnormalities, and enhance safety of rehabilitation training. A compact rotary series elastic actuator (cRSEA) was developed to provide active walking assistance to a userÆs knee joint during gait training and in daily life. An RT-WiFi real-time and high-speed wireless network was built as the infrastructure for wireless control of the cRSEA. Various control algorithms were investigated to achieve precision motion control of the cRSEA under complex network environment.   The research findings above set up a solid foundation for in-home gait rehabilitation with remote monitoring. Sensory devices made the disease diagnosis and gait evaluation more convenient and accurate. Visual feedback made the gait training more motivating and the cRSEA could provide active assistance if the patients could not fulfill the desired training task.
