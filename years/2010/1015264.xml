<AbstractNarration>Unassisted brittle shear failure and frictional sliding are restricted to depths in Earth of less than ~50 km because of the strong inhibition of frictional sliding by increasing pressure and the reduction of flow stress due to increasing temperature with depth. Nevertheless, earthquakes occur to depths approaching 700 km and the physics by which such failure can occur remains incompletely understood. These earthquakes occur in subduction zones; understanding of the fundamental processes by which they occur can provide important information about mantle convection and about the distribution of water within the deeper portions of our planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental and seismic evidence is now very strong that intermediate-depth earthquakes (~50-350 km) are initiated by dehydration embrittlement of hydrous phases in the subducting oceanic lithosphere. There is also abundant experimental evidence that large volumes of H2O could be transported from the surface to great depths within subducting slabs by hydrous (and nominally anhydrous) phases.  In this project the PI will examine the evidence that supports the former and calls into question the latter and will propose to answer three critical questions that are relevant to both.  Those questions are: (i) What is the minimum amount of antigorite serpentine that is necessary to enable the dehydration embrittlement instability? (ii) How does dehydration embrittlement of antigorite really work? That is, what are the physical mechanisms activated by generation of small amounts of hydrous fluid that lead to a shearing instability even when breakdown of antigorite leads to a negative volume change (densification)? (iii) Are earthquakes in the mantle transition zone consistent with dehydration embrittlement and, if not, does that indicate that subducting slabs are essentially dry below 410 km? The PI proposes to answer these questions with high-pressure experiments and analysis of the run products by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoSIMS, and a variety of spectroscopic techniques (e.g. FTIR, Raman, EELS, etc.). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This proposal addresses problems that are fundamental to the geology and geophysics of subducting lithosphere and therefore will have impact on a very broad spectrum of the solid-earth sciences, including seismology, geochemistry, mantle petrology and geodynamics. It also will have impact on the surficial Earth sciences through its relevance to Earth's water cycle. In addition, it potentially will have impact on materials science through elaboration of the underlying mechanisms of phase-transformation-induced shearing instabilities.  It further will add to the numbers of highly educated Earth Scientists, providing graduate and undergraduate students with hands-on use of sophisticated analytical equipment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Earthquakes deeper than about 50km cannot initiate by overcoming friction like shallow ones because the normal stress on an existing or potential fault is so high that the rock will flow at a lower stress.  Nevertheless, earthquakes are known to occur to about 700 km in subduction zones. Since the 1960s, the leading contender for the mechanism responsible for intermediae-depth earthquakes (50-350km) and perhaps deeper, has been embrittlement caused by dehydration of serpentine in mantle rocks.  Serpentine is produced by hydrous alteration of olivine at shallow depths.  About 20 years ago, we discovered in my laboratory the probable mechanism responsible for earthquakes at depths of 350-700km (Green and Burnley, Nature, 1989; Green et al., Nature, 1990), a mechanism that has recently been strongly supported by seismic experiments in multiple subduction zones. About 10 years ago, we turned our attention to fleshing out understanding of dehydration embrittlement as a mechanism for intermediate depth earthquakes and showed that such dehydration is a viable earthquake mechanism at those depths (Jung et al., Nature, 2004; Zhang et al., Nature, 2004).   A natural question that arose from these results was: "What is the minimum amount of serpentinization of mantle rocks necessary to trigger the faulting instability during dehydration?"  The goal of this grant was to answer that question.  During the period of this grant, work in another experimental laboratory obtained results conflicting with ours; they found that shear zones develop during dehydration of pure serpentine but no instability was produced, hence in nature this phenomenon could not yield an earthquake.  We thus modified our goal to include the question: "How much serpentine is sufficient to quench the instability?"  We have now answered both of these questions:  Mantle peridotite with more than 4% serpentine alteration but less than about 65% will fail be faulting during dehydration under stress.  Peridotite with 4% or less serpentine alteration is strong but ductile; the water and nanocraystalline solids produced during dehydration are insufficient to trigger faulting.  However, when peridotite is sufficiently serpentinized to become a rock with relict olivine and other phases "floating" within a matrix of serpentine, the inherent softness of serpentine dominates the rheology and faulting does not occur during dehydration.  The much slower deformation rates and lower stresses in nature are likely to modify both of these numbers to further restrict the range of serpentine contents that trigger the instability when they dehydrate but there can be no doubt that moderate amounts of serpentinization can lead to a faulting instability during dehydration.  We are currently writing up these results for submission to a prominent scientific journal.  More broadly, this project will have significant impact on a wide variety of studies of subduction zones and mantle convection.  In the pursuit of these results, the project supported one graduate student as well as undergraduate assistants, thereby providing them the exciting opportunity to participate in investigations at the frontier of science.
