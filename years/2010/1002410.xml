<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EPS-1002410 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:  Nanotechnology from Basic Science to Emerging Applications: &lt;br/&gt;   Institute for Functional Nanomaterials (IFN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Puerto Rico&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Award would strengthen academic research and education in nanoscience and technology in the institutions of higher education in Puerto Rico.  Establishing partnerships among research universities and four-year colleges in Puerto Rico and training of junior researchers and students at all levels is among the primary focus of the RII program. Efforts to translate basic research results into commercially viable products and transfer of the know-how to nano, bio technology related businesses and start-up companies in Puerto Rico would be pursued. This RII project aligns well with Puerto Rico?s Science and Technology Policy and is expected to lead to the economic development in the commonwealth and increase its competitiveness at the national and international level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Research focus is on experimental and computer modeling studies in interdisciplinary areas of nanoscience and technology. The work involves cutting edge research for the development of novel nanomaterials and nanostructures with potential applications in bio-nanotechnology, water remediation and CO2 sequestration, logic and memory devices for use in information technology, and devices for efficient light harvesting. Collaborations among scientists and engineers from five institutions of higher education in Puerto Rico as well as strategic partnership with five universities on the mainland, four national laboratories/facilities and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Texas are included. The RII project would build the necessary expertise, resources and workforce in Puerto Rico to enable significant advances in the chosen areas of research. The RII program would create intellectual property through the research projects, use testbeds to evaluate potential commercial viability, and partner with private sector to bring the technological innovation to commercialization stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The implementation of the RII projects has a high potential to impact environment, energy, and nano-bio-medicine related applications. The program would lead to the creation of a Multidisciplinary and Multicampus Institute of Functional Nanomaterials in the University of Puerto Rico System. The facilities and expertise available at this Institute would serve the biotechnology and nanotechnology industries in Puerto Rico. The RII program has a strong workforce development plan that includes a broad range of activities for the educational training of junior researchers, technicians, and K-20+ continuum. The University of Puerto Rico System has a large enrollment of Hispanic students in the nation and by targeting minority participation in the research and educational activities this RII program would contribute to increasing the diversity of the nation?s science and engineering workforce. The public-private partnerships for technology transfer as well as outreach programs to engage and educate the public on nanoscience and technology innovations would help build a knowledge-based economy in Puerto Rico.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Intellectual Merit    The Institute for Functional Nanomaterials (IFN) targeted four Nanoscale Science and Technology (NST) transformative research areas with high potential for innovation. Building on a previous award, the four Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs) of the IFN have produced, matured and continue to identify major research projects that are transformative in nature.  Over the lifetime of the award, the IFN has produced 443 peer-reviewed publications and 22 patents (12 awarded; 10 pending), and has leveraged over $50M in additional funding for the jurisdiction.  Some of the highlights of the research (by IRG) are described below:     IRG1 synthesized, modified, and characterized a broad range of nanomaterials for drug delivery, tissue regeneration, cancer treatment, and others applications to address challenges in bioengineering and medicine.   Compatible nanomembranes were developed  as frameworks for tissue regeneration. Other platforms were developed to enhance the amount of time the drug is viable in the body through combinatorial methods. These platforms  moved forward technologies such as photodynamic and hyperthermia therapies.  However, they cannot be effective if they do not reach the area of interest or if there are no appropriate machines to use them in the clinical setting. For this purpose, efforts also focused on investigating new routes for improved nanoparticle delivery and targeting for various types of cancer including ovarian and colon cancer.   In addition, engineered solutions were developed to facilitate the use of these technologies in the clinic.    IRG2 investigated nanostructured electronic materials for applications beyond Si technology, in order to increase packaging density, speed, and reduce power consumption. New promising materials were fabricated in testbeds into next generation information storage and logic devices.  The device fabrication was carried out in conjunction with external collaborators.    IRG3 addressed key challenges in the area of chemical and environmental remediation by combining expertise in synthesis and characterization of nanoporous materials, adsorption, catalysis, bio-electrochemistry, environmental chemistry, and computational chemistry. In particular, the group aims at developing solutions to address: (1) removal of CO2 from light gas mixtures, storage and conversion, (2) removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from water sources, and (3) recovery of water from human waste and subsequent production of energy in closed-volume applications. The comprehensive combined experimental-computational strategies include collaborations with key partners from academia, federal government, and industry to eliminate gaps related to advanced materials characterization, and design of remediation technology with higher readiness levels as well as innovation.    IRG4 developed prototype photovoltaic devices based on nanostructured ferroelectric semiconductors, taking advantage of the spontaneous electric polarization of these materials for the separation of the nascent electron-hole pairs as light is absorbed. Their approach was to hybridize the conventional bismuth iron oxide ferroeletric material with silicon in order to increase the bulk conductivity by 1000-fold.  The prototype photovoltaic cell consisted of the hybridized ferroelectric material prepared by spin-coating with indium tin oxide as the top electrode and graphene as the bottom electrode. The photovoltaic device exhibits a short-circuit current of 0.75 mA and an open-circuit voltage of 0.45 V under standard 1.5 AM illumination, which are promising device characteristics for harvesting indoor light.    Broader Impacts    Workforce Development, Broadening Participation and Diversity    A key element of the IFN?s mission was to develop a competitive hub of NST as a foundation for future growth.  The IFN plan included development of young faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate and undergraduate students. Over the course of the award, the IFN was instrumental in the hiring of 12 new faculty (4 male, 8 female, 7 underrepresented minorities) and hosted 46 (33 male, 13 female, 17 underrepresented minorities) postdoctoral researchers.  In addition, 65 graduate students (37 male, 28 female, 17 underrepresented minorities) affiliated to the IFN received their doctoral degrees, and an additional 125 undergraduates (62 male, 63 female, 121 underrepresented minorities) participated in cutting-edge research.    External Engagement/Public Outreach:  Since its inception, the IFN has played a catalytic role in bringing the topic of nanoscience and nanotechnology to the public.  The process for disseminating IFN research, included a variety of outreach activities that reached members of communities who are usually unaware of these research activities, with the purpose of enhancing public understanding and increasing interest in learning and careers in STEM.  These activities included: "Nanodays" activities; interactive conferences about nanotechnology topics and research offered at local schools; a Science-Art competition; diverse teacher workshops; and creation of new educational materials related to nanotechnology.  These activities allowed the IFN external engagement activities to reach over 40,000 people over the lifetime of the award.
