<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support a consortium (workshop) of approximately 12 promising doctoral students from the United States and abroad, along with 5 distinguished research faculty.  The event will take place on Sunday, October 24, immediately preceding and in conjunction with the Twelfth ACM SIGACCESS Conference (ASSETS 2010), to be held Monday-Wednesday, October 25-27, in Orlando, and sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computers and Accessibility.   The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research outcomes and innovations in software and technology designed to address the special needs of persons with disabilities and older adults.  Researchers and developers from around the world in  both academia and industry will meet to exchange ideas and present their latest work on the design and use of mainstream and specialized assistive technologies relating to speech, motor, hearing, and vision impairments, cognitive limitations, emotional and learning disabilities, and aging.   More information about the conference may be found at http://www.sigaccess.org/assets10. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key component of building this community is through its youth.  The ASSETS 2010 doctoral consortium will provide an opportunity for graduate students from diverse backgrounds (computing, engineering, psychology, architecture, etc.) to come together and explore their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of the PI and a panel of other distinguished experts in the field, so that they can appreciate the broader spectrum of research and development approaches to assistive technologies and universal usability, and also experience the community in which they can pursue their endeavors.  Student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the consortium, and will receive constructive feedback from the faculty panel. The feedback is designed to help students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to related research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Thus, the consortium will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at assistive technologies and universal access, will promote scholarship and networking among new researchers in this emerging interdisciplinary area, and will also expose these promising young researchers to a larger community.  A session has been set aside during the main conference to allow doctoral consortium participants to present to the entire conference, and one student from the doctoral consortium will be selected to deliver the closing plenary presentation.  The organizers will take special steps to promote participation from institutions with relatively large numbers of students from underrepresented groups.   An evaluation of the consortium will be conducted, and the results made available to the organizers of future such events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The doctoral consortium will help expand the participation of young researchers pursuing graduate studies in this field, by providing them an opportunity to gain wider exposure in the community for their innovative work and to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community.  It will further help foster a sense of community among these young researchers, by allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.  The organizers will also take special steps to promote participation from institutions with relatively large numbers of students from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF Award supported a Doctoral Consortium event held at the ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility (ASSETS) in October 2010 in Orlando, Florida. Research on computers and accessibility has important societal benefits, in particular for people with disabilities. Topics of research in this area include: assistive technologies for people with various disabilities (vision, hearing, movement, memory/cognitive, learning, communication) or older adults with impairments, accessibility of websites, formal evaluations of computer accessibility, mobile technologies, communication technologies, education software for students with disabilities, and other topics.  Computer research in this area can enable people with disabilities to live more independent, productive, and happier lives.  At the Doctoral Consortium event, twelve graduate students studying computer accessibility and who were in the early stages of their doctoral programs gave presentations of their research at the conference and received detailed feedback and mentoring from a panel of distinguished faculty researchers in the field of computers and accessibility.  In addition, the participating students presented their research in poster form at the main conference to gain further feedback and professional interaction with the broader researcher community.   The intellectual merits and broader impacts of this project were intertwined.  The goal of the event was for these promising young researchers to interact with experts outside of their university, to gain important feedback on their research directions, and to learn about career paths within academia and industry related to computer accessibility for people with disabilities.  By supporting the professional development and educational goals of promising young researchers interested in this field of research, the Doctoral Consortium event at the ASSETS conference is an important investment in the future of this beneficial technology.   The students who participated in the event were invited to submit a research paper about their work for publication in the January 2011 issue of the ACM SIGACCESS Accessibility and Computing.
