<AbstractNarration>This project is to investigate impacts of changes in storm track dynamics on the recent rapid reduction in Arctic sea ice extent and volume. The increase of storm intensity and frequency result in enhanced high-frequency synoptic-scale variations and feedbacks in the Arctic climate system, and may make an integrative contribution to the basin-wide sea ice reduction. The project studies build upon previous work, and combine model simulations with satellite products and in situ observations to integrate and delineate physical causes of sea-ice mass balance changes in the context of storm-induced air-ice-sea interactions. This research will bridge synoptic-scale weather activities and large-scale climate variability and changes. The expected outcome includes assembled schematics linking storm-induced synoptic-scale variation with recently observed rapid loss of Arctic sea ice mass. Changes in sea ice concentration/extent, thickness/volume, and heat budget terms at the air-ice-sea interface that follow the motion of identified storms will be compiled. The project also has important broader impacts across the scientific community and in the general public. A Ph.D. graduate student will be trained to join the next generation of climate researchers. The project outcome will be integrated into graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 student lectures, and aid policymakers to make wiser and more economical decisions.</AbstractNarration>

The Arctic ice extent/coverage has been decreasing at the rate of 1.47x106 km<sup>2</sup> per decade, ice thickness has been thinning at the rate of 1.7 cm per decade, and correspondingly the Arctic has been losing its ice at the rate of 1693 km<sup>3</sup> per decade in September.

The implication was that if seasonal cloud amounts did not change the way they had, surface warming would have been even greater than what was observed. In contrast, the recent extension of APP-x through 2015 shows that the central Arctic Ocean has warmed significantly over the last 1.5 decades such that the overall effect for 1982-2015 is winter warming rather than cooling, with a weak cooling in the Siberian region. It was demonstrated that changes in ice concentration and cloud cover played major roles in the magnitude of Arctic surface temperature trends.
