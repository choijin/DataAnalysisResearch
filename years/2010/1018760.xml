<AbstractNarration>Many physical and logical networks, including the Internet, World Wide Web, and future ubiquitous wireless networks, have enormous size that can be regarded practically infinite. For example, the World Wide Web is estimated to have over 50 billion web pages. The huge networks are also extremely heterogeneous, both physically and in their technical/social usage. They are expected to eventually merge into a complex, global socio-technical infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand  and reason  about the  enormous  socio-technical networks, including  methods  for  designing/optimizing  them, the traditional network analysis and  modeling approaches are   insufficient, due to their limited scalability. Simulation is only feasible up to a limited network size.  Conventional analysis methods, such as teletraffic theory, queuing network analysis etc., also quickly lose scalability in huge networks. At the same time, modeling and analysis is still indispensable, since one may not be able to  experiment with various new  solutions  via  large  scale practical  deployment, due to prohibitive cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This situation, in which one deals with networks of practically infinite size, has  naturally led to the emergence of novel analysis and modeling approaches. They can generally be characterized as having a more abstract, "bird's eye" view of the network and often relying on asymptotic analysis on the mathematical side. This project focuses on network models that describe and analyze the network using the mathematical methodology of random graph models. A large and diverse set of such models have been proposed and analyzed, but there is a lack of unified methodology. This methodological gap is what primarily motivates this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The project will fill the above described methodological gap and will develop general methods that can usefully apply to many different network models. Specifically, the project will pursue the following directions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Exploring connections and implications among model properties that are valid for large classes of network models, not just for a single model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Finding methods that provide useful model-independent bounds and approximations for various properties within large model classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact     &lt;br/&gt;The project will strengthen the cross-fertilizing effect between networking and graph theory, in particular, the theory of random graph models, potentially impacting both fields. The PI has experience in both areas, which provides an ideal position to generate meaningful interaction to overcome current limitations. The educational side of the project also has a non-conventional component: beyond integrating the subject into graduate courses, the project will include student competitions to motivate students for developing creative new modeling ideas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal discipline of the project, as shown by the name of the Program under which it has been funded, is Network Science and Engineering. The motivation for the project has been two-fold:  1) The emergence of huge, practically infinite networks, such as the Internet and the World Wide Web, makes traditional approaches inadequate for describing these networks, due to the lack of scalability of most traditional approaches. For example, the frequently used methodology of queuing theory does not scale to huge networks.  2) Some networks show phenomena that does not easily fit into usual network models. For example, random and rapidly changing wireless network topologies are hard to capture and characterize in traditional ways.  The project has a number of results and outcomes, as part of its intellectual merit:  - We have developed a mathematical method to handle network modeling situations, in cases when the idealized modeling assumptions are not precisely satisfied. We are able to bound the resulting 'output deviation'  in terms of the 'input deviation',  where the latter represents the deviation from the ideal modeling assumptions. Interestingly, the bound has a certain universal nature, independent of the particular input/output mapping. This has allowed us to successfully analyze how resistant are certain sophisticated network models to perturbations.  - We have worked on harnessing the power of visualization to achieve a better understanding of complex network topologies, such as the topology of the World Wide Web.  -  We have developed and analyzed optimization methods that can be helpful in network design; focusing on topology optimization.  - We have compared the physically defined and the graph abstraction based descriptions of wireless network topologies. We proposed a general graph model that has a certain universal nature, unifying the physical and the graph abstraction based nework topology models. We have proved that it is able to capture any network topology model in a simple, unified way, no matter how complicated physical assumptions serve as its basis. Furthermore, it allows continuous transitions between arbitrary models, by adjusting some parameters.  - We have investigated methodological questions regarding metrics that play an important role in networks. Two fundamental examples are:    (1) The unified formal representation of various, arbitrarily complex, route metrics. In this context we have proved that any various, possibly very complex, route metric can be captured by a relatively simple unified representation.    (2)  Embedding points of a discrete metric space into more traditional geometric spaces. We have proved that, under certain technical conditions, it is possible to embed the points of a finite metric space into a more traditional geometric space, such that the dimension of the target space remains constant, no matter how many points we want to embed, and, at the same time, the distortion of distances is kept arbitrarily low. Such embeddings can help in the simplification and/or analysis of complex network models.  - We have analyzed a conjecture of ours, which asserts that in a general, comprehensive network topology model, that we call Abstract Geometric Random Graph, there is a ubiquitous positive correlation property among the random links. We have found a proof of the conjecture for an important and large class of network models. At the same time, we found counterexamples for other model classes. It raises the interesting issue for future research: which factors cause our general correlation property to hold or fail, depending on the considered model class? We conjecture that the positive correlation feature can somehow characterize the spatial, geometric nature of the model. If this indeed holds, it could lead to a very interesting connection: capturing what it means to be a spatial, geometric model, via a purely probabilistic approach. Such a formal relationship between spatialit...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
