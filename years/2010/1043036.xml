<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding for a two-day workshop on cross-disciplinary investigations in imaging and image analysis.  This workshop will bring together representatives from US and foreign academic institutions representing a variety of disciplines engaged in imaging and imaging analyses.  The workshop envisions large-group keynote presentations by prominent researchers and break-out sessions on specific topical areas.  One goal of the meeting is to facilitate education, training and informational exchange among multiple scientific disciplines including humanities, arts, social science, science, and computational researchers to address related research challenges for which image and imaging analysis is both a means and end (visualization, virtual spaces, et al.)   The organizations planning the event include the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), the University of Illinois School of Art and Design, and the Institute for Computing in Humanities, Arts, and Social Science (I-CHASS) as well as individual stakeholders in the broader community.</AbstractNarration>

Humanists, social scientists, artists, and archivists were paired with computer scientists and information technology specialists at the workshop in order to present complementary views on topics related to imaging and image analyses of historical artifacts.  The workshop was organized as collaboration between the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), the Institute for Computing in Humanities, Arts, and Social Science (I-CHASS), the University of IllinoisÃ† School of Art and Design, and the Center for Digital Humanities (CDH) at the University of South Carolina.

Key to our discussions during the workshop was a revelation of the different emphases and approaches to similar processing problems, across the domains of commercial, non-profit, and educational research.

Others focus more on the processing of already acquired data, such as in automated paragraph detection, historical map scale estimation or authorship attribution to artistic hand from manuscript illustrations. For still others, most of the research could be found in devising new ways of retrieving and browsing the data, as in the matching of ancient maps onto contemporary topographical datasets in Google Earth.
