<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Fort Valley State University (FVSU) in Fort Valley, GA, that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 8 students, during the summers of 2010-2013. This award is also supported by the HBCU UP program in the Division of Human Resource Development (HRD) in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) and the Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO). This REU program will provide hands-on research opportunities for undergraduates in the area of plant biotechnology and genomics. A major goal is to offer the research experience to students from underrepresented groups. Students will be selected based on their interest, career goals, and academic achievement. Program participants will carry out independent research projects under the direct supervision of a faculty mentor. In addition to research, students are engaged in bi-weekly journal club and laboratory group meetings, seminars, and field trips. Students will develop their written and verbal communication skills, and will present their findings at an end-of-program symposium as well as submit written abstracts of their work. Workshops on research ethics, graduate school admission, and career options are also included in the program. Students also engage in social activities that promote interaction with faculty, FVSU students, visiting scientists, and fellow REU participants. Housing, a stipend, and meal and travel allowances are provided. Students will be encouraged to present their work at national meetings. This REU program is intended to encourage students to pursue careers in science and to foster their participation in research. Members of underrepresented minority groups and students from colleges with limited research opportunities will be encouraged to apply. Program effectiveness is assessed through student exit surveys, including the use of the REU common assessment tool. More information and application materials are available by contacting Dr. Sarwan Dhir, at dhirs0@fvsu.edu or 478-825-6887, or visiting http://biotech.fvsu.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Fort Valley State University (FVSU), an 1890 co-educational institution serving a student community consisting of over 90% African-Americans, proposes to continue a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in biotechnology now in its 13<sup>th</sup> years. The primary focus of the REU program is to encourage and facilitate pursuit of STEM research and professional career and services, assist students with interests in science-based careers to appreciate the nature of research. Additional objectives include: <strong>1)</strong> introducing students to a diversity of biotechnology, <strong>2)</strong> preparing students for independent research, <strong>3)</strong> Fostering self-confidence and team-working ability in observation, recording, and interpreting data, <strong>4)</strong> providing opportunities for oral and written communication of research findings, and career guidance. &nbsp;Since the program began in 2001, total of 108 undergraduates participated in REU-site: 79 female (73%) and 29 male (27%), including 82 African Americans (76%) and 26 racial/ethnic minorities- Hispanic (not Puerto Rican)/Puerto Rican and Native-American Indian- 24%).&nbsp; As a REU program requirement, and to improve scientific communication capabilities, 108 participants made 124 oral/poster presentations at 14 different STEM scientific meetings in 10 states including Puerto Rico and 2014 International Biotechnology meeting in Dubai. Several of them have published work as co-authors. Feedback from the participants confirmed that by 2014, more than 102 out of 108 REU participants had earned degrees in biological sciences. Fifty eight of the participants pursued graduate degrees at 12 institutions in 10 states and other 39 pursued careers that ranged from homeland security and the pharmaceutical industry to federal research institutions. As a springboard to graduate and professional education, this program has proven quite successful with emphasis on the demographic composition of the program. Now and in future FVSU will strive to maintain the diversity and balance representation.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/05/2015<br>      Modified by: Sarwan&nbsp;Dhir</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
