<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a semantic foundation, cross-layer system architecture and adaptation services to improve dependability in instrumented cyberphysical spaces (ICPS) based on the principles of "computation reflection". ICPSs integrate a variety of sensing devices to create a digital representation of the evolving physical world and its processes for use by applications such as critical infrastructure monitoring, surveillance and incident-site emergency response. This requires the underlying systems to be dependable despite disruptions caused by failures in sensing, communications, and computation. The digital state representation guides a range of adaptations at different layers of the ICPS (i.e. networking, sensing, applications, cross-layer) to achieve end-to-end dependability at both the infrastructure and information levels. Examples of techniques explored include mechanisms for reliable information delivery over multi-networks, quality aware data collection, semantic sensing and reconfiguration using overlapping capabilities of heterogeneous sensors. Such adaptations are driven by a formal-methods based runtime analysis of system components, resource availability and application dependability needs. Responsphere, a real-world ICPS infrastructure on the University of California at Irvine campus, will serve as a testbed for development and validation of the overall ?reflective? approach and the cross-layer adaptation techniques to achieve dependability. Students at different levels (graduate, undergraduate, K-12) will be given opportunities to gain experience with using and designing real-world applications in the Responsphere ICPS via courses, independent study projects and demonstration sessions. Students will benefit tremendously from exposure to new software development paradigms for the ICPSs that will be a part of the future living environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The CYPRESS (CYber Physical RESiliance and Sustainability) project explored novel approaches  for dependability and resilience in instrumented cyber-physical spaces (ICPS) where physical spaces have been instrumented with "intelligence" through heterogeneous sensing, actuation and communication mechanisms.   CYPRESS, a joint three-year project between SRI International (SRI) and University of California Irvine (UCI), exploited a reflective "observe-analyze-adapt" (OAA) architecture in which an ICPS has a model of itself, its objectives, and its effects on the environment; the ICPS achieves dependability objectives through adaptation using runtime application of formal analysis methods. The proposed dependability techniques are cross-layer in nature and range from combining multiple networking and messaging technologies to adaptive sensing, data cleaning and information fusion. Intellectual Merit Outcomes:  Detailed Case Study Development using a High-rise campus building instrumented with sensors for a surveillance related application &ndash; the surveillance scenario morphs into a situational awareness application when there is a fire in the building. ICPS Modeling and State Management techniques to understand and model the multinetwork environment in an ICPS network to study the dependability of the communication network. Specific networks that were modeled in this environment include WLAN (802.11 access point), 802.11 adhoc, mesh networks, Zigbee, DTN and 3G networks.  The project involved development of network analysis techniques to address fault tolerance and performance requirements as well as techniques for query aggregation of network state information in the three-tiered Multinetwork INformation Architecture (MINA) system. Multiple ICPS Infrastructure Resilience Techniques were explored and developed including:  (a) Exploiting multiple access networks:  through MINA, a middleware platform that collects network state information from heterogeneous networks (overcoming lower level protocol related constraints) and provides management functions to address resource provisioning, fault analysis and power management, etc. (b) Leveraging Mobile Data Collectors event-driven mobile sensing in ICPS where the trajectory of the mobile node is not fixed, but dictated by the evolution of events in the space.  We formulated this problem as Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (DVRPTW) and designed a two -step method with heuristics VRPTW.                  c) Micro-Scale Energy Harvesting to enable sustainable sensor data collection algorithms in instrumented spaces given. We developed an adaptive Quality and Harvesting aware sensing technique (QUARES) energy harvesting management framework, QuARES, which exploits an applicationÆs tolerance to quality degradation to adjust application quality based on energy harvesting conditions.  (d) Using Compressive and Collaborative Sensing ARchitecture for Mobile Phones: as an additional method to support resilient situational awareness. The techniques are incorporated in SenseDroid,  a scalable compressive and collaborative mobile sensing framework for efficient collective understanding of users, contexts, and their environments using mobile smartphones.   ICPS Information Dependability Techniques studied include:  (a) Adaptive Actuation methods to balance the tradeoffs between event accuracy and event capture through the design of a lightweight real-time scheduler to enable actuation.  (b) Entity Resolution and Semantic Data Cleaning mechanisms: Using  surveillance as a driving application, this effort aimed to improve information resilience through semantics to enhance entity resolution tasks, e.g.  accurate person identification for each subject that occurs in a video shot.
