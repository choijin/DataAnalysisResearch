<AbstractNarration>The Illinois State University REU offers an eight-week summer research experience for 8 pre-service and 4 in-service secondary mathematics teachers. Participants will explore research topics in discrete mathematics with emphasis on experimentation, formulation of researchable questions, careful reasoning and justification, and clear, precise reporting. An added emphasis will be placed on the development of lesson plans in discrete mathematics to be used in secondary school classrooms.  The main objective of the project is to provide research opportunities for the participants, helping them become highly qualified teachers who can meet the national demands for increased student proficiency and who can adapt to the changing needs of our technological society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This experience aims to fill a gap in current preparation of future mathematics teachers and addresses a national need for highly qualified teachers. Program content will help participants develop a 'big picture' of mathematics while the problem solving and discovery approach will allow them to experience learning in ways that align to current recommendations for mathematics instruction. Ultimately, teachers with a knowledge of and appreciation for mathematics research have the opportunity and ability to promote and develop mathematics as a potential career path for talented high school students. This program will continue to target minority and female students, typically underrepresented in mathematics research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of the Illinois State University (ISU) REU project as proposed was to:   Provide research opportunities for prospective and practicing secondary mathematics teachers, helping them become highly qualified mathematics teachers who have an understanding of what mathematics is and how it is discovered and communicated. The PIs believe that such a research experience will help instill mathematical confidence and enable the participants to help their future students understand, think about, reason with, and engage with rich mathematical ideas.    Additional objectives included:  Showcasing positive teaching role models through exceptional teacher mentors and by teaming experienced secondary teachers with prospective teachers in researching discrete mathematics topics; and  Guiding participants at both levels in the creation of lesson plans promoting deep understanding and critical reasoning in the exploration of mathematical topics that can be suitable for high school classrooms.   The expected outcomes of the ISU REU as proposed are detailed below. The first two outcomes relate specifically to the main objective of the project (providing research opportunities for pre-service and in-service teachers), and the next two outcomes relate to the additional objectives listed above. The expected outcomes include:  The development of "teacher-scholars"&mdash; pre-service and in-service teachers and prospective teachers who have experienced scholarship in mathematics in an exciting setting that emphasizes the interconnections among theory, procedures, and applications, and who "develop habits of mind of a mathematical thinker". A number of research publications authored jointly by the undergraduate pre-service teachers, the in-service teachers, and the faculty involved in the project. Lesson plans developed by the "teacher-scholars" that (a) reflect a pedagogical emphasis on deep mathematical thinking; (b) demonstrate how advanced mathematics topics in discrete mathematics are reflected in or may become part of the high school curriculum; and (c) provide an opportunity for high school students to experience "doing" mathematics. Partnerships between university researchers and high school mathematics teachers that entail common goals (e.g., better motivated and prepared high school and undergraduate students, and continuing dialogue about mathematics research).       Activities and Accomplishments:  Each of the ISU REU 2011-2013 cohorts of 12 participants worked on three or four research projects in combinatorics. During the 2013 program, the participants also planned and executed a week long math research camp for 12 high school students from the Chicago Public Schools (CPS). The PIs sought to expand the participants' views of mathematics as a dynamic endeavor, to provide opportunities for mathematical discovery, and to enhance their content knowledge and their pedagogical content knowledge. Specifically, as they delved into new discrete mathematics topics through exploration, conjecturing, reasoning and communicating, the participants:  Worked in groups and experienced learning that occurs through the sharing of ideas; Used technology to assist in the exploration of mathematics (e.g., C++ and Java programs) and to typeset their assignments and results (e.g., LaTeX and Beamer); Developed teaching lessons that can allow them to bring fresh ideas into the high school classroom and allow high school students to encounter mathematics in a more active way; Investigated how high school students develop generalizations;  Conducted a week long Mini REU for 12 high school students from the Chicago Public Schools; and Reflected on their experiences and on how these might translate to a high school setting.   The participants were exposed to a wide range of research topics and were encouraged to dig deeply into more than one potential research problem. All of the problems were deemed significant by the PI and had portions that were ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
