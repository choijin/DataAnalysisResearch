<AbstractNarration>Oglala Lakota College (OLC) proposes to extend and enhance its capability to &lt;br/&gt;deliver the first two years of a Bachelor of Science degree program in engineering. This &lt;br/&gt;capability will be developed through a Pre-Engineering Education Collaborative (PEEC) &lt;br/&gt;established with the College of Engineering at the South Dakota State University (SDSU) and the &lt;br/&gt;South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT), and is referred to as the &lt;br/&gt;OLC/SDSU/SDSMT PEEC (OSSPEEC). The project will establish collaborative offerings of &lt;br/&gt;gateway and bottleneck courses that occur in the first two years of engineering curricula coupled &lt;br/&gt;with on-reservation hands-on laboratory and service learning experiences on the PRR that will &lt;br/&gt;increase Native American student retention in pre-engineering and engineering programs across &lt;br/&gt;South Dakota. A major result of this project will be the establishment of a complete two-year pre- &lt;br/&gt;engineering curriculum at OLC, which will enable our students to enter any four-year &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate engineering program at the junior level. Further, this project will make an &lt;br/&gt;additional unique or radical step in the transformation of classical engineering education at the &lt;br/&gt;state colleges participating in the collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;We propose to collaborate to develop and offer the courses required for an integrated two-year &lt;br/&gt;pre-engineering program at OLC and to increase the success of OLC transfer and other Native &lt;br/&gt;American students at SDSU and SDSMT through shared research, internship experiences, and &lt;br/&gt;community building in the third and fourth years of an engineering program. The project will be &lt;br/&gt;unique in the United States in that during the collaborative process of building OLCs pre- &lt;br/&gt;engineering capacity, OLCs faculty and students will be helping to transform the concept of the &lt;br/&gt;first two years of the engineering curriculum at SDSU and SDSMT. This will occur through the &lt;br/&gt;integration of project based service learning and undergraduate research projects on the Pine &lt;br/&gt;Ridge Reservation, which will involve professors and cohorts of students from SDSU and &lt;br/&gt;SDSMT. Also, these projects will cultivate closer ties among our institutions and OST Tribal &lt;br/&gt;Agencies through collaborative summer research and internship opportunities on the Pine Ridge &lt;br/&gt;Reservation that will lead to the development of future collaborative NSF research proposals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With the goal of bringing pre-engineering and engineering to Native American and Native Hawaiian students, the National Science Foundation funded what became known as the PEEC (Pre-Engineering Education Collaborative) program. Last year, Paul Boyer joined 33 other authors to tell the story of PEEC in book form. The PEEC project spanned four states: Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin, and it included 17 colleges and universities. The seven-year, ongoing project included five Native Hawaiin serving community colleges and six Tribal Colleges, and each partnered with at least one of six mainstream universities. The resulting PEEC book, with editors from the South Dakota PEEC, brought together 34 advisory council members from 16 of the 17 PEEC institutions to provide guidance for the 34 authors. The editors and authors hope that readers of the book will gain insights to help foster the intent of the unique PEEC program long into the future, particularly including Tribal and Native colleges.

Throughout the duration of this award, SDSM&amp;T worked closely with OLC and SDSU to increase capacity at OLC, where they offer a pre-enigineering program based on constructivist teaching principles and design throughout the curriculum.

Students in the program present the results of their research at state-wide venues such as the NSF EPSCoR Student Research Symposium at the state capitol, and several have gone on to present at national venues such as the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) national conferences.
