<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The past few decades have accumulated mounting evidence of profound anthropogenic effects on fundamental biogeochemical processes across the planet, especially in coastal environments that support a diverse array of highly productive ecosystems including coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and estuaries. The ecological significance of seagrasses is largely due to the remarkable degree of adaptation they exhibit to a submerged aquatic existence. Despite numerous successful adaptations, however, seagrasses have high light requirements that make them vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbances. The paradoxical vulnerability results largely from their high reliance on dissolved aqueous CO2 for photosynthesis. The potential for rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations to have significant warming impacts on the global climate has long been recognized, but the potential impacts of the "other CO2 problem", also known as ocean acidification, have only recently begun to be appreciated. As with other impacts of climate change, the increased concentrations of dissolved aqueous CO2 [CO2 (aq)] in the oceans of the world will elicit both negative and positive responses among organisms, ultimately potentiating ecological losers and winners. This project will explore the response of eelgrass to increased CO2 (aq) within the context of a warming coastal ocean using a combination of manipulative experiments, physiological/biochemical investigations and mathematical modeling. The investigators hypothesize that rising CO2(aq) will increase the high temperature tolerance of plants by improving the Q10 response of photosynthesis relative to respiration, thereby leading to higher growth rates, improved survival of vegetative shoots at high temperature, and even flowering output and seed production. This project will investigate the key relationships between environmental parameters that have both negative (ocean warming) and positive (ocean carbonation) impacts on the light requirements and dynamics of carbon balance in these critically important marine angiosperms. By focusing on Chesapeake populations growing near the southern limit of eelgrass distribution on the Atlantic coast, the investigators  will gain predictive insight into how climate change may alter the geographic distribution of this critically important species in other coastal environments that may be subjected to less temperature stress but similar levels of ocean carbonation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This work will provide training in plant physiology and biochemistry to the co-PI, Dr. Victoria Hill and will support the dissertation research of at least two graduate students over the course of the 4-year study. Collaboration with the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center will facilitate the development of educational interpretation and programming from this project that will be specifically targeted to the 650,000 to 700,000 people that visit the Aquarium each year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Collaborative Research: Impact of Climate Warming and Ocean Carbonation on Eelgrass (Zostera marina L.)  PI - Richard C. Zimmerman, Old Dominion University  PI - Victoria J. Hill, Old Dominion University  PI - W. Mark Swingle, Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center  This project was initiated in 2011 and involves a significant collaboration between Old Dominion University (ODU), the primary scientific leads, and the Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center (Aquarium), providing the field site and technical expertise with marine water systems. The Aquarium's primary role involved construction of an outdoor aquatic experimental faciltiy constructed on Aquarium property adjacent to a natural saltwater body, Owls Creek. The facility includes: twenty 600 gallon fiberglass experimental tanks; one 9,000 gallon head tank: pumps, air blower and water recirculation system; a portable laboratory; a dedicated electrical system; and a perimeter fence. The experimental tanks were installed on a 2,000 sq.ft. raised platform in an area with unrestricted access to natural sunlight. A large crane was utilized to place the head tank and portable laboratory on site. Plumbing and electrical work completed the installation process and the experimental facility was ready for operation in 2012. Throughout the project, maintenance and repair for the facility's water recirculation system and infrastructure was the Aquarium's responsibility.  Control of the CO2 environments in each aquarium using pH stats provided excellent separation of experimental treatments, while still allowing the natural variation in CO2 driven by changes in the Owls Creek source water from heating (season and diurnal), salinity (affected by rainfall) and metabolic activity of the system. Long-term experiments conducted at the experimental facility quantified the effect of CO2 availability on eelgrass response to summertime temperature stress. Shoot survival, size, reproduction, growth rate, and sugar content all increased in response to elevated CO2 in a manner consistent with short-term responses measured previously using individual leaf segments. There was no evidence that photosynthetic capacity or resource allocation was down-regulated in response to long-term CO2 elevation. However, light harvesting capacity, as measured by leaf pigment content and optical properties, responded to high CO2 in a manner similar to the effect of high light availability. Experimental quantification of the impacts of CO2 availability on whole plant survival and growth were incorporated into the bio-optical model, enabling predictions of combined impacts of ocean acidification and climate warming on the future distribution of eelgrass in the Chesapeake Bay. In addition to the eelgrass experiments that form the core of this project, the facility has also been used by ODU colleagues to investigate the impacts of climate change on the development and regulation of marine biofilms and soft-shell clams. Additional experiments to explore the impacts on eelgrass transcriptomic responses, dissolved organic carbon production and sediment biogeochemistry are planned for the future.  Aquarium education specialists worked with ODU graduate students to develop and implement climate change programs for various audiences. Education programs and tours of the facility were offered to the general public during the summer months when students were actively collecting data and conducting system maintenance, often talking to more than 100 visitors on any given day. ODU faculty and students conducted enrichment trainings for Aquarium docents and general volunteers as part of their ongoing education. A Curosity Cart was developed that allowed educators to conduct programs and lead hands-on activities illustrating the potential effects of increased CO2 on ocean waters and marine organisms. The eelgrass project was also incorporated into the Aquarium's Mentoring Young Scientists (MYS) program. MIddle school ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
