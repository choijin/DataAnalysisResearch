<AbstractNarration>The primary aim of this proposal is to deepen our understanding of several classes of regular cell complexes through the study of their face numbers.  Specifically, research on this project will involve the use of algebraic, geometric, topological, and combinatorial methods to attack fundamental enumerative questions involving balanced and flag simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, simplicial manifolds and pseudomanifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell complexes provide a convenient way to build various shapes from smaller and simpler blocks, such as from pyramids or cubes. A natural question is: What restrictions on the number of building blocks are imposed by specific shapes? Variations of this question (e.g., What is the minimum number of blocks required?) have practical importance when one wants to represent or store such a structure in a computer.</AbstractNarration>

Polytopes are high-dimensional analogs of polygons (examples include high-dimensional cubes and pyramids), and a polytope is called centrally symmetric if it is symmetric about the origin. It is well-known that the boundary of a polytope we are looking for is a simplicial complex.

One unexpected outcome of this project is a joint work of the PI with Maria Chudnovsky, Gil Kalai, Eran Nevo, and Paul Seymour where we establish a bipartite analog of the celebrated WagnerÆs theorem characterizing planar graphs.  Classical rigidity was successfully used (by Kalai and others) to find lower bounds on face numbers of triangulations of high-dimensional spheres, and more general spaces (such as manifolds and pseudomanifolds). One of our motivations in developing bipartite rigidity theory is its potential use in the study of face numbers of cubical complexes and more general cell complexes.     Broader impacts:  the PI is supervising graduate students, serves on the editorial board of the Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics,  and co-organizes various international conferences and workshops. She also co-organizers the Combinatorics seminar at the University of Washington.   This grant supported the PIÆs and her graduate studentsÆ talks at conferences and workshops as well as several research stays. It also allowed her to bring visitors to the University of Washington, which in turn allowed the PI and her current graduate student to start new international research collaborations.
