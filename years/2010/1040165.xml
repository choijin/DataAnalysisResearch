<AbstractNarration>This NSF MRI award funds the acquisition of a Time Correlated Single Photon Counting&lt;br/&gt;(TCSPC) fluorescence lifetime system to expand the research capabilities at Kennesaw State University. The TCSPC instrument allows measurement of excited fluorescent molecules in systems that contain a mixture of species with different lifetimes, and will be used in studies such as cellular signaling, enzyme catalysis and control, and cellular stress response. The instrument would be used by students in research and in courses, enhancing student recruitment into science and providing them training in advanced technologies. The results of the research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>

Selected for reprint in a special FEBS J virtual issue, Molecular Enzymology)  Nitric oxide is produced from the amino acid arginine in a reaction that requires molecular oxygen and electrons from NADPH, the most common source of electrons for biosynthesis, and electron delivery to the catalytic site is the controlled step.      We have now collected a great deal of data on the signaling nitric oxide synthase isoforms nNOS and eNOS. Briefly, because of their very different fluorescence lifetimes, we can now distinguish three types of conformations: input conformations in which the cofactor FMN gets electrons from NADPH via the cofactor FAD, output conformations in which FMN donates electrons to a heme cofactor at the site of nitric oxide production, and a series of æopenÆ states in which FMN is not associated with other cofactors. The open state resembles free FMN, with a lifetime of ~4.3 nanoseconds. Interactions with FAD (input state) and heme (output state) reduce the lifetimes to 80 picoseconds and 800 picoseconds in those states.    Calmodulin binding speeds up the transitions between these states, leading to changes in the distribution of states within the conformational manifold because not all transitions are equally affected. CaM activation of NOS favors the output and open states at the expense of the majority input state. This provides a paradigm for NOS activation, and in addition gives us a powerful probe to study the effects of other regulators on the enzymes.
