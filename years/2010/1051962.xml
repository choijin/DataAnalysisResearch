<AbstractNarration>The genetic blueprint of a cell is encoded in its DNA, which is organized into chromosomes within the cell nucleus. Cells with the same DNA but different functions are distinguished by the parts of the blueprint each uses to build the cell.   These decisions are influenced by physically anchoring specific unused parts of the chromosomes to the membrane of the nucleus by an unknown mechanism. The overall goal of this research is to test the hypothesis that two recently identified fission yeast proteins, Lem2 and Man1, provide a "docking site" for the recruitment of unused DNA to the nuclear periphery, which is essential for the organization of chromosomes in the nucleus and the segregation of chromosomes as cells divide. This will be accomplished by removing the Lem2 and Man1 proteins from cells, and assessing the consequences by monitoring the position of specific chromosome regions in the nucleus and the ability of cells to segregate their chromosomes during meiosis.  High-throughput genetic analysis will be used to identify components of the larger network within which Lem2 and Man1 function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeast is an ideal organism in which to study chromosome organization because it is a simple experimental organism in which microscopy, molecular biology and classical genetics can be used to address this complex problem. These approaches are ideally suited to the mentoring, education and training of undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, including women and other groups underrepresented in the sciences, five of whom will carry out these studies.  The scientific impact of this work will be an understanding of the basic mechanistic principles governing nuclear organization and chromosome segregation that are essential for fungal, animal and plant cells.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit     Cells are the building blocks of all plants, animals and fungi and despite the diversity of these organisms, their cells have a very similar basic organizational plan: they are surrounded by a cell membrane and their interiors are divided by internal membranes into compartments within which specialized functions are carried out.  One of these compartments is the nucleus, in which the chromosomes (the genetic material of the cell) are surrounded by the membranes of the nuclear envelope that separates them from the rest of the cell. The nuclear envelope of all eukaryotes has several known interrelated functions: it is a physical barrier between the chromosomes and other cellular structures, it is a selectively permeable barrier between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm and it is an organizational scaffold tethering proteins and specific chromatin domains to the nuclear periphery.     Inside of the nucleus, the chromosomes are not randomly distributed like a bowl of spaghetti. The non-random organization of chromosomes in the nucleus is due, in part, to a set of proteins enriched at the inner surface of the nuclear membrane that interact directly or indirectly with specific regions of the chromosomes. This organization influences several critical nuclear functions, including the regulation of transcription (the processes by which certain genes serve as templates for protein synthesis), DNA repair (which corrects mutations) and recombination (the exchange of genetic material during reproduction). Certain chromosomal domains are enriched at the nuclear periphery, most likely by association with proteins tethered to the membrane that organize the chromatin into loops that extend into the nuclear interior.     The Lem2 and Man1 DNA-binding proteins, which are embedded in the inner layer of the nuclear membrane, stabilize the membrane and enrich the telomeres (the ends of chromosomes) and other poorly transcribed (heterochromatic) chromosome regions near the nuclear periphery.     The overall goal of this proposal was to test a model in which Lem2 and Man1 govern telomere distribution during the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles by means of their ability to localize heterochromatin and/or heterochromatin-interacting proteins to the inner nuclear membrane. In non-dividing cells, the chromosomes are decondensed but in preparation for cell division, they are released from the periphery, and condense into the mitotic configuration in which they are separated into the daughter cells at mitosis or meiosis.     During this funding period the Sazer laboratory accomplished the following: discovered a role for two inner nuclear envelope-localized DNA interacting proteins in the maintenance and/or establishment of chromosomes in their active, decondensed state; discovered a set of genetic interactions that challenge the current model of the functions of individual proteins in the multi-protein telomere-anchoring complex in both mitosis and meiosis; and analyzed our experimental results within an evolutionary cell biology context, lending insight into those aspects of nuclear structure relevant to understanding the evolution of organelles, nuclear organization and open and closed mitosis. This evolutionary perspective is likely to make important contributions to answering longstanding questions regarding the fundamental organizational principles of eukaryotic cells, particularly the nucleus.     Broader Impacts     A graduate student, a post-doctoral fellow, several Rice University undergraduate students and two recent college graduates carried out the studies supported by this award. Four of them are women, two of them are soon to begin Ph.D. programs, and one of them is now in medical school.  All are authors on published or soon to be published papers describing their work.  The results of this study have also been disseminated in oral presentations at meetings and seminars to topic specific, general and interdisciplinary...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
