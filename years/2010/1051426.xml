<AbstractNarration>This is the second meeting of Slavic and US geoscientists to be help September, 2010 in Kiev, Ukraine. The topics covered will be broad in scope and concerns multiscale geodynamics of crustal, mantle and core dynamics from various perspectives. Mineral physics of all pressure ranges, numerical modeling of dynamic processes and computational seismology will be on the table. The meeting will also cover some new developments from GPU and multi-core computing as well as large dataset management. This meeting will provide the chance for junior scientists from USA to interact with Eastern European scientists from Ukraine and Russia and other countries.</AbstractNarration>
