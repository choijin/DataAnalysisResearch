<AbstractNarration>Work conducted under this project seeks to determine the underlying mechanisms responsible for the development and propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a large-scale pattern of precipitation and atmospheric circulation anomalies which forms in the Indian Ocean and propagates slowly eastward.  The MJO is associated with droughts, floods, and tropical cyclones (including hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico).  The research is primarily organized around experiments using an atmospheric general circulation model which has been modified to produce credible MJO simulations.  The work will be guided by the hypothesis that the MJO is a moisture mode which is destabilized by wind-evaporation feedback (occurring under westerly wind conditions), which propagates eastward through horizontal moisture advection, and in which the essential dynamics are regulated by the processes that control the tropical moisture field.  The modeling work is complemented by analysis of wind and precipitation from moored buoys in the Indian Ocean and satellite observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will have broader impacts due to the large societal impacts of the MJO and the practical utility of information which contributes to the development of a predictive understanding of the MJO.  The project will also include graduate student training and postdoctoral support, thereby developing the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Understanding how and why heavy and organized tropical precipitation occurs is one of the greatest challenges in the tropical meteorology field today. Our lack of understanding limits not only our ability to simulate and predict tropical weather such as hurricanes and intense tropical downpours that affect parts of the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coasts, but it also affects our ability to forecast weather across the United States, since what happens in the tropics has far-reaching affects across the rest of the globe. This dependence is demonstrated strongly during times such as this year when El Nino in the tropical Pacific is influencing weather across the globe in places such as the United States. Our NSF project was designed to foster improved understanding and simulations of a particular type of organized tropical precipitation called the Madden-Julian oscillation, or MJO for short. The MJO is a large region (e.g. size of Australia) of organized precipitation that moves eastward across the tropics and causes the weather to shift from rainy to dry to rainy again every 40 days. The MJO affects extreme hurricane activity (such as Hurricane Katrina), U.S. West Coast flooding events, drought, and heat waves and cold spells across the United States. Weather forecasting and climate models have traditionally had trouble simulating this phenomenon. Our project has forged a much deeper understanding of the MJO, and has provided guidance on how our forecasting and climate models need to be modified to produce better simulations, which is critical for predicting extreme events that can affect life and property across the United States.
