<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a photoresist system that is compatible with a much wider range of materials than traditional photoresists, allowing for the patterning of advanced semiconducting polymers and small molecules on existing photolithographic equipment. Through Phase I project, Orthogonal has improved its fluorinated photoresist system by making two new materials with lower manufacturing cost and enhanced performance. In this Phase II project, the patterning of the widely used conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) and similar acidic materials will be studied. Multiple approaches will be taken to continuously improve the performance of the new photoresist materials. The scalability of one or both photoresist materials to large quantities will be investigated by addressing the major issues that may be challenging to the scale-up, including dealing with heat generation and finding a suitable initiator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to enable the large-scale manufacturing of organic electronic devices by leveraging the existing photolithographic infrastructure currently used in the industry. The availability of the new photoresist materials in large quantities and consistent quality will help meet the performance and volume demands of organic electronic industry, which is expected to grow rapidly once a scalable and high-yield manufacturing technique is available.</AbstractNarration>

Manufacturers can immediately adopt this technology since it does not require major new investments in infrastructure, a distinct advantage over new techniques such as inkjet printing which require new equipment to be purchased.  Orthogonal is enabling an information rich environment and new experiences for end consumers and represents the shortest path for display manufacturers to revitalize and expand their business.
