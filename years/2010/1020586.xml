<AbstractNarration>Aggression between species is extremely common and, when it causes divergence of traits, can contribute to biodiversity. This project brings together theorists and empiricists from the United States and Mexico to investigate the role of interspecific aggression in evolutionary diversification. The project will develop and test theory to predict the evolutionary consequences of territorial aggression between species of Hetaerina damselflies. These brightly colored insects provide a tractable model in which the effects of interspecific aggression can be distinguished from those resulting from other processes. The project will use field experiments to inform and refine a detailed model of the workings of aggressive interactions in damselflies and will test this model against patterns of geographic variation in behavior and coloration and molecular measures of species divergence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will unify previous work on species interactions and their roles in the creation of biodiversity and will develop a formal model framework to guide future research on the evolutionary consequences of interspecific aggression. The project will provide interdisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students and includes strong international collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
