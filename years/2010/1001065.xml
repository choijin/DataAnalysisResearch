<AbstractNarration>1001065&lt;br/&gt;Kumpathy&lt;br/&gt;Milwaukee School of Engineering &lt;br/&gt;IRES: Collaborative Research in Materials and Biomedical Applications of Rapid Prototyping with the Non-Ferrous Materials Technology Development Center (NFTDC), Hyderabad, India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) Professor Subha Kumpathy will launch a three-year International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program with Dr. K. Balasubramanian, Director of India?s premier national center, the Non-Ferrous Materials Technology Development Center (NFTDC) in Hyderabad, India.  Each year, 4 undergraduate science and engineering students from the Milwaukee area will conduct six weeks of inter-disciplinary research in materials and biomedical applications of rapid prototyping with lead-mentor Balasubramanian and other researchers at NFTDC's state-of-the-art facilities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core research focuses on rapid prototyping for biomedical applications and links materials science with cutting-edge bioengineering for practical applications. The foreign research team and host site have strong core research programs and first-rate facilities to support the proposed work.  Students will be engaged in engineering research, rapid prototyping techniques, advances in materials, processing and characterization, biomedical devices and development, interdisciplinary group sessions and seminars, PowerPoint presentations and research posters, all of which is expected to culminate in publishable research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international component is coupled with integrated pre- and post-activities at the MSOE home campus.  Upon return from India, IRES participants will interact with faculty and students to share their research and cultural experiences on-campus. The project is expected to enhance long-term collaborations with Indian colleagues in biomedical and other cutting-edge applications of rapid prototyping.  Additionally, offering undergraduates the chance to explore innovative and creative approaches to biomedical applications will serve as an impetus to their continued involvement in research after IRES as well as provide opportunities for global research that they otherwise would not have considered.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) Site at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) has proven to be an ideal model for a good global research experience.  Projects under this grant (OISE-1001065) involved 12 students, 4 foreign mentors at Non-Ferrous Materials Technology Development Centre (NFTDC), Hyderabad, India, 2 U.S. PIs (Kumpaty and Kamara), and multiple research and industrial partners from outside MSOE.  In addition to the use of an interdisciplinary research environment and direct involvement with the advisors, the communications skills of IRES participants have been enhanced through development of project abstracts, final research papers, participation in poster sessions, and PowerPoint presentations at the end of IRES program, and by direct participation in regional or national conferences.   The demographics of the 12 participants shows our commitment to diversity: Minorities and others (25%); Women (50%) and Non-MSOE (25%).  While the four students that participated in summer 2013 will be completing their undergraduate in 2013-14, the remaining eight are gainfully employed or in graduate school.  All of them see the need to be in graduate school within a year or two.  Two are in graduate school: one pursuing a MasterÆs degree in medical informatics and another, a Doctor of medicine degree.  Nora Huang (2011) began her employment at Baxter Healthcare in June 2013 one week following graduation as a Senior Engineer in the Product Standards and Safety Marks Engineering Department.  The IRES program has made the difference in her placement at such a high level of competence and the same is true for all other participants.   Brett Steffen (2012) cites IRES as a critical piece in being selected over many accomplished peers for an industry position with Rexnord Technologies.   The direct measure of the success of IRES Site can be illustrated through at least 16 publications/ presentations during the grant period.  Considering the fact that the participants are undergraduates, this phenomenal success is noteworthy.  Jennifer Anderson said: "being able to complete a paper as well as getting accepted to the BMES conference" was her most shining accomplishment.  She stated, "IÆve never had the chance to present something like this and I think it will be a great experience" and confirmed the same after attending the conference.  The broad spectrum of forums- Biomedical Engineering Society, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, National Conference on Undergraduate Research, Rapid Product Development Association of South Africa and such- indicates the value of the research being completed under the IRES Site. While summer 2013 participants, Jenna and Ben worked on project in collaboration with Greatbatch Medical, the other two, Brad and Courtney worked on the laser formed samples that were received from the University of Johannesburg, South Africa.  Thus the IRES touched on three continents, Asia, Africa and North America.  Besides the publications, the PIs have seen a significant growth in the synergy that resulted directly from the IRES collaboration.  Companies involved were Johnson and Johnson and Greatbatch Medical.  Other Universities that had collaborated include University of Louisville, National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India and the University of Johannsesburg, South Africa.    Examples of typical post-experience comments are: "I liked the classes that we took at NFTDC. They were very valuable and taught by very knowledgeable people. We were lucky that they took the time to share their knowledge with us." "The cultural experience, the welcoming of everyone both at NFTDC and at our apartment, and also the information learned at NFTDC stick out for me." This program is the first instance of focused research for the participants, and so learning to do research is a major accomplishment of this IRES Site.
