<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Harvard Forest that will provide research training for 11 weeks for 9 students during the summers 2010-2014. This award is also supported by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) program. The Harvard Forest Summer Research Program in Forest Ecology will enhance the ability of students to undertake interdisciplinary research and work with teams of researchers to collaborate on cutting edge projects. Teams of students and mentors will work to integrate empirical data with analytical and statistical models to investigate the impact of climatic changes on forest ecosystems. The research results will contribute to the development of practical forecasts of 21st century environmental change in New England and the eastern U.S. areas, and quantify the degree of uncertainty in these forecasts. Results are disseminated widely in senior theses, oral and poster presentations at regional, national, and international meetings, and in peer reviewed publications. In addition to their own research, students attend weekly research seminars and participate in workshops focusing on professional development including choosing and applying to graduate school, preparing scientific talks and papers, engaging in the discussion of the ethical conduct of research, and writing about science for general audiences. The program will actively recruit a diverse group of students from cultural and ethnic groups that are traditionally underrepresented in scientific careers. Applicants are selected based on an essay, letters of recommendation, and expressed interest in specific projects. There is no minimum GPA or prerequisite course requirement. An evaluation plan will assess participants' (1) acquisition and enhancement of scientific research skills; (2) satisfaction with the REU educational experience; and (3) post-program plans for education and scientific career development.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2010-2014 Harvard Forest REU Site program hosted 402 undergraduates working in multidisciplinary research teams to answer pressing environmental questions, guided by mentors in the fields of ecology, engineering, computer science, biogeochemistry, and conservation. All students presented their research findings in a final symposium open to site scientists and the public. In addition to their research projects, students also participated in research seminars, field trips, and professional development workshops to broaden their ecological knowledge, deepen their engagement in research ethics, build their skills in data analysis and science communication and  explore STEM education and career options.    The total Harvard Forest REU student cohort across 5 years &ndash; 63students &ndash; was a diverse group, including 51% from cultural and ethnic groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. Students communicated their research results widely, in senior theses; oral and poster presentations at national meetings; and in peer-reviewed publications.  Two notable research projects focused on ecosystem responses to decline of eastern hemlock, a foundation tree species of eastern North American forests. In the summer of 2012, a team of students and mentors examined the impacts of forest change as the eastern hemlock declines due to a widespread invasive insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid.  They focused on three sets of animals: ants and spiders, small mammals, and ungulates (moose and deer). Each student led his/her own independent project with guidance from research mentors, but the students often conducted field and laboratory work together, benefitting from mentoring at multiple scales. The student team presented their research findings in a collaborative research presentation entitled "Biotic change in eastern hemlock forests."  In the years following the summer REU experience, one student from this team was awarded a scholarship to present his findings at 2 national conferences: the Annual Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science National Conference, and the NSF-supported Emerging Researchers National Conference in STEM.  In 2014, another group of undergraduates and mentors studied new dimensions of the ecological impacts of eastern hemlock loss, including changes in vegetation structure and amphibian diversity.  Their data revealed myriad of changes in the hemlock forest, including changes in light availability, abundance of deadwood, salamanders as forest health indicators, rodent foraging behavior, and ant dynamics.  Two students from this group presented their research findings at the 2014 The National Conference of the Council of Undergraduate Research (CUR) on the Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU). Futhermore, some of the findings from that summerÆs research led to a student co-authored paper in the international peer-reviewed journal, Ecological Indicators.  After the summer program, the majority of students remained part of the Harvard Forest community, staying connected through social media, the Harvard Forest blog (http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/blog), and well-attended social events at national meetings.  Longitudinal surveys of studentsÆ educational and career outcomes show that 80% of Harvard Forest Summer Research Program students pursue degrees in STEM, and 50% of these students continue in higher education as graduate students.
