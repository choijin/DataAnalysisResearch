<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of New Orleans (UNO) and Southern University New Orleans (SUNO) to establish an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) program. The program will provide two-year research experiences in biology to four cohorts of scholars, starting in the fall of 2010 and continuing through summer 2013. Each cohort consists of four students (three from UNO and one from SUNO) who will be trained in research in biological sciences. URM scholars will be able to select from a wide range of research projects including conservation genetics, ecology, phylogenetic systematics, physiological and evolutionary ecology, molecular physiology, molecular biology, microbiology, and biochemistry. URM scholars will participate in individual research experiences, a stepwise educational program, and tiered mentoring. The major goals of the project are (1) to provide a diversity of opportunities for research in biology, (2) to offer a range of different faculty role models that can be matched to meet student needs and interests, (3) to provide a structured program beginning with general training in research methods, followed by hands-on research ultimately culminating in the presentation of research results, and (4) to provided a tiered mentoring process.  URM students will conduct independent research mentored by faculty, and will participate in  enhancement activities such as seminars, a foundational course in Basic Research Tools, and weekly lab meetings. Students will be mentored in communication skills development and will present their research results in a departmental research symposium, and will be encouraged to present at national or regional scientific meetings.  Participants will be selected based individual applications, interviews, and successful completion of one semester of freshman biology. A formative evaluation to monitor the effectiveness of project implementation, and a summative evaluation to assess the quality and impact of the project in reaching its program goals will be conducted.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our URM program was designed to increase the participation of African-Americans and Hispanics, under-represented groups in biological sciences, to prepare them for graduate school.  This was a cooperation between the University of New Orleans (UNO) and Southern University of New Orleans (SUNO). As SUNO is an HBCU, our partnership with this institution allowed our program to reach the broadest group of under-represented students as possible. The close proximity between our campuses (less than 1 mile apart) enabled students who were taking classes at one institution to easily participate in a research experience or meetings at the other.  Our project goals were:  (1) Increase studentsÆ awareness of the diversity of opportunities available in scientific fields; (2) Increase retention of undergraduate science majors from the freshman year through graduation; (3) Increase studentsÆ confidence and preparedness to pursue a career in a scientific field; (4) Increase the number of students who pursue graduate studies and careers in scientific fields.  Two types of evaluation were conducted for this project: (1) a formative evaluation to monitor project implementation and provide ongoing feedback to the project management team, and (2) a summative evaluation to assess the impact of the project in reaching its stated goals and objectives. The external evaluator determined that we met all four of the goals of the project.  Seventeen students were chosen to participate in this program (13 from UNO and 4 from SUNO).  The participants were 59% African American and 41% Hispanic.  The gender breakdown was 35% males and 65% female, and about 53% were first generation college students.  All students who completed the program (94%) are on track to graduate by 2016. The average 6-year graduation rate for all students who started in 2010 at UNO was 34%, showing the remarkable success of these Science majors to graduate in less than 6 years.  Two of our students participated in post-baccalaureate programs offered by the NIH in order to give them more experience in high-powered research before they start graduate school.  One student completed an MS degree at UNO and one is in progress. Two students are currently enrolled in PhD programs; one at the University of Florida and another in Biomedical Sciences at Sanford Berman in LaJolla, CA.  One student is in medical school.  Three of the students are currently working in their professional field of choice.  One just started an accelerated Nursing program.  Some of cohort 3 and 4 are near completion of their BS and planning their next career step once they graduate in 2016. Most of the goals of this last cohort are related to the medical field (medical or PA school) and graduate school.  All students who participated at least a year in the program presented their research at local, regional or national conferences (37 presentations at conferences by the 16 students).  Three of the students were co-authors on two journal publications, and we expect that at least one or two more may be co-authors of publications from their work in the URM program.
