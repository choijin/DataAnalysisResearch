<AbstractNarration>In order to build useful predictive space weather tools it is necessary to understand the most critical nonlinear dependencies among observed plasma and electromagnetic field variables in the coupled solar wind/magnetosphere system. This project will develop and apply information-theoretical tools such as mutual information, cumulant-based cost, transfer entropy and redundancy as information-dynamical measures of causal dependencies to understand: (1) the underlying dynamical response of the magnetosphere to the solar wind, (2) solar wind-magnetosphere coupling functions, (3) the information horizon and predictability of dynamics in the magnetospheric system, and (4) causal dependencies responsible for the recurrence time of magnetic substorms.  This nonparametric, statistical approach assumes no intrinsic underlying dynamics. Information gained from the cumulant-based information flow can be used to guide the development of a variety of space weather tools. As a specific example of the application of the statistical methods, the project will evaluate energetic electron flux at geosynchronous orbit, the stretching of the magnetotail and magnetospheric power flux into the auroral zones.  These results will make it possible to estimate a predictability horizon, which will indicate the maximum "look ahead" for which the space weather can be predicted. Information-dynamical measures will also be used to identify causal variables derived from solar wind data that maximize the information content about the magnetospheric response. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods and techniques that will be used in this project do not presuppose an underlying dynamics and hence they will work across a wide range of areas in the Sun-Earth system. Detection of the most important nonlinear interactions in the systems will be used to identify the most important causal physical processes and will aid development of physical models and predictive capabilities for understanding severe space weather. The project include training of an undergraduate or beginning graduate student on the basic concepts in nonlinear dynamics with applications to space weather.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 1.  Solar wind drivers of the outer radiation belt  Using information theory, our study showed that the previous finding of the solar wind density correlation with radiation belt electron flux (Je) with a one day lag can actually be attributed at least partly to the anticorrelation between solar wind density and velocity and the correlation between solar wind velocity and Je.  If we removed the effects of solar wind velocity, the information transfer from the solar wind density to Je peaks at 0 day (&lt; 24 hr).  We conclusively showed that solar wind velocity is the main driver.  Solar wind density transfers only about 36% as much information to Je as the solar wind velocity does.  We ranked 10 solar wind parameters based on the amount of information transfer to Je.  We showed that the triangle distribution in the radiation belt electron vs. solar wind velocity scatter plot [Reeves et al., 2011] can be understood better when we consider that Vsw and nsw transfer information to radiation belt electrons with 2 days and 0 day (&lt; 24 hr) lags, respectively.      2.  Substorm dynamics   Using information theory, we evaluated causal relationship between external and internal triggers and substorm onset. We determined that northward turning of the IMF provides little information about substorm onsets and is therefore not a causal factor.      3.  Aurora powers  The electron aurora powers complete or nearly complete the entire substorm cycle in about 5 hr, two hr before substorm onset to three hr after.  The monoenergetic electron aurora shows starts increasing about 1 hr before onset, which may correspond to substorm growth phase.  This implies that among the aurora powers, monoenergetic electron power may hold the most promise for predicting or determining substorm trigger (see item #2 above).  This will be investigated further.  In contrast, the signature of growth phase is not so clear in the diffuse and wave aurorae. The amplitude of the variation of the ion aurora power is smaller than those for the electron aurora powers.     4.  The nonlinearities in the magnetospheric dynamics   We identified nonlinearities in magnetospheric dynamics using mutual information and higher-order cumulants as discriminating statistics.  For this study, we used Dst as a proxy for the magnetospheric state.  Our finding suggests that nonlinear behavior in Dst may be used to infer solar wind interfaces, and it also suggests that the velocity interfaces can produce a strong nonlinear response.  Our result identifies the driver as well as periods of strong nonlinear behavior and provides additional evidence that may help clarify the previously unexplained finding that energetic electrons are associated with increased solar wind velocity (and not pressure).  We suggest that solar wind velocity drives shear instabilities on the magnetopause that couple nonlinearly to the inner magnetosphere.     5.  Fast flow dynamics  We examined the dynamics of fast flows in the magnetotail using THEMIS observations.  Fast flows are believed to be bubbles, which are flux tubes having lower density or entropy (PVg) [perhaps resulting from reconnections] than neighboring flux tubes.  The bubbles then travel earthward at high speed, roughly 400 km/s or higher, due to the plasma instability or the buoyancy force.  We examined several cases of fast flows in the THEMIS observations.  In some cases, the fast flows would earthward travel earthward as long as the neighboring flux tubes have higher entropies, consistent with Birn et al. [2006; 2009] simulations.  However, we found some cases that do not conform to this scenario.  It is not clear what causes this deviation.              Last Modified: 10/14/2016       Submitted by: Simon Wing]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
