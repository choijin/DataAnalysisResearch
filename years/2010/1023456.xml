<AbstractNarration>Doctoral student John H. Shaver (University of Connecticut), supervised by Dr. Richard Sosis, will undertake research on human cooperative behaviors and the redistribution of resources to others. Why humans give away useful resources, such as food and material possessions, has been of longstanding interest to anthropologists. Considerable research has examined the ability of anthropological models to explain resource transfers in the context of food sharing, labor, foraging, warfare and other domains of social behavior. The proposed research aims to extend these empirical findings and examine an economic system where contributions to public feasting and redistribution events are common. Specifically, this project will evaluate the ability of five social science theories to explain why individuals donate to collective pools for feasting and redistribution in a traditional society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in three rural villages located on the southern coast of Vanua Levu, Fiji. Quantitative and qualitative methods will be employed and data collection will include: quantitative data on resource transfers associated with redistribution feasts, demographics, fertility, and household economics, and qualitative data on norms associated with feasts, the relative prestige of village members and their willingness to come to the social assistance of other village members. &lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;This research is important because it will improve our understanding of the relationship between institutional context and human cooperative behavior. Understanding human motivations for cooperation and how institutions influence human cooperation are crucial for explaining such wide-ranging phenomena as warfare, environmental conservation, and public health-care. This research also supports the education of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

This increase in the consumption of kava also required an increase in the production of kava, which comes at the expense of more productive economic labor.   Wesleyan Methodist missionaries first arrived in Fiji in 1835 and the overwhelming majority of ethnic Fijians today are devoutly Methodist; however, fieldwork indicated that traditional ancestor beliefs and associated beliefs about "tradition" are still very salient in structuring day-to-day life for many Fijians. Research found that individuals vary in terms of how much influence they believe their ancestors have in their lives, and the strength of their traditional beliefs in ancestors is negatively correlated with the strength of their Christian beliefs. Male participation in nightly kava ceremonies, ceremonies which grew out of the pre-Christian religion and contain references to supernatural belief in the ancestors, was found to be negatively associated with Christian religiosity and observed Christian ritual practice.

The study of how populations vary in their commitments to different institutions is both important and timely. Understanding cultural institutions, their origins, spread, and how competing ones are reconciled are topics of increasing significance as globalization continues to force groups to confront and navigate new and diverse cultural institutions.
