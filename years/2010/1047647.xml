<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding to assist US-based graduate students and junior faculty to travel and attend the 29th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS-2010), which is to be held in New Delhi, India on October 31-November 3, 2010. The support requested in this proposal will enable the participation of students and junior faculty, especially those from under-represented groups, who would otherwise be unable to attend SRDS-2010.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The grant was used to provide travel awards to PhD students studying in US universities for attending a premier IEEE conference in the area of reliable distributed systems. The conference was the 29th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS) and it was held in New Delhi, India on November 1-3, 2010. The field of the conference is important and becoming even more so considering how much of our critical infrastructure consists of distributed hardware and software components --- think our power grid, the air traffic controller, or the web services that support internet commerce. It is important to be able to run these applications in a reliable and secure manner, in the face of faults, both unintentional and intentional (or malicious). The travel awards gave an opportunity to budding scientists in this field to attend an important forum for discussion of this topic. The students all actively participated in the forum, including presenting their own authored papers at the conference. A total of 8 awards were granted, 5 of which covered all the expenses for the students, and 3 of which covered the registration for the conference. The institutes from which the student awardees came were University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, North Carolina State University, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Duke University, Purdue University, and University of Buffalo. <br /><br />I interacted with all the seven student attendees to SRDS (one of the eight awardees was unable to attend in person and his paper was presented by his advisor from Duke University). I was enthused to see that they appeared to be genuinely enjoying both the technical sessions and the environment and the cultural milieu in which the conference was being held. The conference was being held in a shared use facility, called the India International Center, which had a large green space and many buildings, where several activities were going on. There was also a library on the premises. As a result, the students had the opportunity to sample the similar and the distinct ways in which business is carried out in India. For example, the organizers of the conference had arranged for small buses or taxis to pick up the students from the hotels where they were staying and bring them to the conference venue, a practice we are not used to in the US. As another example, while enjoying lunch on the green lawns, the students saw birds perched on ledges close to where they were sitting. Some of them also went into the library on the campus and saw the Indo-centric collection at the library.<br /><br />For the technical sessions, there were many attendees from Indian institutions, mainly academic but also a fair share from software industries, the latter being dominated by IBM. In terms of raw numbers, with 25 full papers, there were 145 attendees, 52 from overseas and 93 from India. I saw most of the student awardees interacting with the Indian participants and I joined in a few of these conversations. I believe that through these conversations, the students got some idea about how software is taught and practiced in India. They had all doubtless heard and read of the booming high technology sector in India, and I would like to think that this trip, facilitated by the travel award, helped personify the heard and the written words.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is a fair estimate that without the travel funding, many of the students would not have made it to the conference. Travel to India was expensive considering that this was the beginning tip of the winter season when tourism to India heats up. The total amount of the grant enabled us to give full funding to 5 of the students and partial funding to 3.
