<AbstractNarration>The overarching question that Scale, Consumers and Lotic Ecosystem Rates (SCALER) will address is: How can small-scale ecological experiments be applied to understand the behavior of entire ecological systems? Funds are provided to address:: 1) How should measures of fundamental properties of streams and effects of animals on those properties be scaled up to predict ecosystem characteristics of stream networks. 2) How do patterns of scaling compare across the wide array of ecological systems (from tundra to tropical forest) that occurs across North American? The SCALER experiment will be done in tropical forest, temperate mountainous forest, prairie, northern boreal evergreen forest, and tundra areas. Streams in each of these five areas will be examined at scales of centimeters to 10?s of meters in small, medium and large streams.  Rates of stream metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration) and nutrient uptake will be measured as well as the way these rates respond to animal exclusions (used to mimic loss of animal diversity in streams). These local results will be linked to the scale of watersheds and regions by modeling. Watershed scale predictions will be verified by broader, but less intensive sampling. Mechanistic explanation of how ecological measurements and experiments in streams can be scaled to watersheds will be provided. This scaling will be characterized in each of the five areas across the continent to explore how scaling differs across natural habitats.  The knowledge that will be generated by this project is essential to quantify controls on stream ecosystem processes as well as to manage human impacts on entire watersheds. The experimental and modeling results will be relevant to general ecology because few nested, and experimental and theoretically coupled scaling experiments have been undertaken in any environment. Results will inform those involved in conservation, management, and restoration of freshwater resources. Resource managers will gain a quantitative rationale and framework to link local measurements to regional patterns. The highly collaborative team will train six graduate students, five post doctoral students, and mentor three early career faculty members. Additional collaborations will be encouraged to collaborate and perform similar projects at additional sites through workshops related to the objectives and research design.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The boreal forest is the largest intact forest ecosystem on Earth, and as such and key biome in the functioning of the Earth system.  The boreal forest stores a large proportion of Earth?s reactive carbon in terrestrial vegetation and soil.  Much of this soil carbon is bound in permafrost, which is subject to thawing and loss with global warming, and is likely to be released to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4, and exported to the oceans via stream and river flow over the next few centuries.  Coupled to this release of carbon, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are also stored in permafrost and undoubtedly will be lost in stream flow.  Central to this release and transport of carbon and nutrients is the movement in streams.  The Scale, Consumers and Lotic Ecosystem Rates (SCALER) project was a continental-scale experiment designed to address a simple but fundamentally complex question.  What is the best way to use measurements that are typically taken at very local (small) scales in stream ecosystems and expand them to understand and predict regional and continental scales processes that are of most interest to policy makers and resource managers?  The SCALAR project had five collaborative research sites distributed across the United States, from Puerto Rico to Arctic Alaska, to capture a broad suite of environmental conditions.  At each SCALER research site, we established six experimental stream reach sites with measurements at each site nested at two scales (microhabitat and reach), linked to watershed models.  Extensive sampling at additional locations was used to characterize watershed-scale patterns of nutrients in stream networks at particular moments in time.  Intensive measurements of metabolism, nutrient uptake, and responses to consumer exclusion were measured over longer periods of time at each site in each biome.  From the boreal forest, the SCALAR project provided valuable understanding about the spatial variation in nutrients, organic carbon, and in-stream primary production and respiration throughout stream networks.  Our previous research had shown that the chemistry of streams in the boreal forest was quite variable, and at least part of the variation was coupled to the distribution of permafrost.  Our research from SCALAR has allowed us to expand those findings to better understand the role of stream channel structure, hydrology, and location within a stream network.  Through our broader collaboration on the SCALER project, we have been able to contribute to broader syntheses from this continent-wide project.  A key outcome has been the coupling between stream geomorphic processes and ecosystem functioning across biomes.  For many biomes, the classic relationships used to describe stream geomorphology were only weakly supported statistically, however, many of the relationships were effective for describing stream channel morphology in the boreal forest streams.  Understanding these couplings between stream channel structure and ecosystem functioning are central to extrapolating findings from research at a few sites to broad, regional understanding of the functioning of stream networks.
