<AbstractNarration>Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) now permeates most computing activities.  The penetration of this technology in the daily lives has resulted in common users relying on its effectiveness and reliability.  The mass marketing of multicores and general-purpose graphics processing units in home and office PCs and laptops has a potential for empowering even common users to become technology contributors.  Certainly, it is no longer sufficient for even basic programmers to acquire only the conventional programming skills.  All these phenomena point to the need for imparting a broad-based skill set in parallel and distributed computing at various levels, impacting Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CE) programs and related computational disciplines.  However, the rapid change in computing hardware platforms and devices, languages, and supporting programming environments, and the research advances, more than ever challenges the educators in deciding what to teach in any given semester. Students and their future employers face similar challenges on what constitutes basic expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our vision is bringing all stakeholder experts working together and periodically providing guidance on restructuring standard curriculum across various courses and modules related to parallel and distributed computing.   Immediate benefit would be providing CS/CE students and their instructors with periodic guidelines on which aspects to cover in which courses. New programs at colleges (nationally and internationally) will receive guidance in setting up courses and/or integrating parallelism in the Computer Science or Engineering or Computational Science curriculum. Employers would have well defined expectations from students on PDC skills. This will similarly help in retraining and certifications of existing professionals.  As background preparation, a planning workshop was held in Feb 2010 to explore the state of curriculum in parallel and distributed education, assess the needs, provide action plans and recommend mechanisms for how best to address the curricular needs in both the short and long terms. The planning workshop and its related set of activities have drawn experts from various stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary task is to propose a set of core topics in parallel and distributed computing for undergraduate curriculum for CS/CE students.  For various topics in the three sub-areas of Programming, Algorithms, and Architecture, the expected deliverables are (i) learning outcomes, (ii) level of coverage (Bloom's classification), and (iii) examples of how to teach each topic.  In summer 2010, we aim to carry out a public release of preliminary curriculum, collect feedback from various stakeholders, and identify and recruit colleagues who will try out aspects the proposed curriculum during fall 2010 and spring 2011.  Following these, during these two semesters, the activities will include monitoring and supporting the courses and feedback collection from instructors and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our larger goal is to enable students to be fully prepared for their future careers in light of the technological shifts and mass marketing of multicores and GPUs and to make real impact on all the stakeholders including employers, authors, and educators. This curricular guidance and its trajectory, along with periodic feedback and other evaluation data on adoption and use, will also help steer companies hiring students and interns, hardware and software vendors, and, of course, the authors and researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes: A team of NSF-funded researchers from multiple universities became the first to formulate a core curriculum on parallel and distributed computing (PDC) designed to ensure all students graduating with a bachelorsÆ degree in computer science/computer engineering receive an education that fully prepares them for careers in a field where technological advances take place at a daunting pace.  Impact/benefits: Through the curriculum, students and their instructors will receive periodic guidelines that indentify aspects of PDC that are important to cover, and suggest specific core courses in which their coverage might find an appropriate context. New programs at colleges (nationally and internationally) will receive guidance in setting up courses or integrating parallelism into the institutionsÆ current curriculums. Employers will also benefit by using the new curriculum model to gain a better sense of what they can expect from students in the area of parallel and distributed computing skills. Curriculum guidelines will similarly provide guidance to companies retraining or seeking certifications for existing professionals.  About four dozen early-adopter institutions are trying out this curriculum.  Background:  The penetration of parallel and distributed computer technology into the daily lives of users via their wireless networks, smartphones, social networking sites and more, has made it imperative that computer scientists and engineers provide rapidly changing, but yet effective, efficient and reliable technology to consumers.     This points to the urgent need for imparting a broad-based skill set in PDC technology at various levels in the educational fabric. However, the rapid change in computing technology and research advances challenge educators in knowing what to teach in any given semester. Other stakeholders including employers face similar challenges regarding what constitutes basic expertise.  This curriculum seeks to address this challenge in a manner that is flexible and broad, with allowance for local variations in emphasis. The field is changing too rapidly for a proposal with any rigidity to remain valuable to the community for a useful length of time and attempts to identify basic concepts and learning goals that are likely to retain their relevance for the foreseeable future.  Curriculum Initiative Website: http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~tcpp/curriculum/index.php  Detailed Activities: The first step of our work on parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) was a planning workshop sponsored by NSF and IEEE/TCPP in Feb., 2010.

A preliminary version of the core curriculum was released in Dec, 2010 (http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~tcpp/curriculum/index.php).  A major mechanism for evaluating a snapshot of our guidelines is the Early Adopter competition that we have thus far used thrice, in the Spring 2011 from this grant and in Fall of 2011 and Spring of 2012 with subsequent grants from NSF and Intel.  Aspiring Early Adopters submit a proposal that is evaluated.  Selected...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
