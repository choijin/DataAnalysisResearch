<AbstractNarration>This OEDG planning grant is being used to address the underrepresentation of African-Americans, Hispanic/Latinos and Native Americans in the ocean-sciences workforce in the Southeastern U.S. The Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence - Southeast (COSEE SE) and the Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at N.C. State University will host a two-day, invitational planning workshop for individuals from state and federal marine science agencies and institutions of higher education in NC, SC, and GA. A logic model approach to project planning is being used to identify the regional situation of workforce diversity, regional assets, and successful strategies from previous and current initiatives for increasing diversity in the ocean sciences.  The workshop draws on an existing, extensive partnership network across NC, SC and GA developed by COSEE SE.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ African-Americans, Hispanic/Latinos and Native Americans are under-represented in the ocean-sciences workforce in the Southeastern U.S.  On December 9-10, 2010 the Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence -Southeast and the Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at N.C. State University hosted a two-day, invitational planning workshop in Raleigh to explore our situation of workforce diversity, to learn about regional assets for recruitment and retention, and to share successful strategies from previous and current initiatives for increasing diversity in the ocean sciences.  Thirty-seven professionals from research agencies and institutions of higher learning within NC, SC and GA came together to share previous experiences and identify transferable programs for enhancing diversity; explore regional connections and form partnerships across state boundaries; and create action plans for program implementation and proposal development.  Panel presentations and small group activities identified regional assets such as potential collaborators, support programs, and experience base, as well as action items for engagement after the close of the workshop.  Informal networking opportunities during meals and breaks also generated lively conversations and bridged new relationships.  Following the workshop ocean science professionals in our region were empowered to more actively engage in activities that broaden participation of racial and ethnically underserved populations.  On October 14, 2011 two workshop scientists presented ocean career information and led activities at the tenth annual NC-OPT ED Alliance Day, a day-long event targeted to the unique needs of the underrepresented minority students in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.  In February of 2012, the OPT-ED Program Director, also a workshop participant, presented a poster on the collaborations generated by the workshop at the Ocean Sciences Meeting (an international conference for ocean scientists and educators).
