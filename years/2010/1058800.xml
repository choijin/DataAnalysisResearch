<AbstractNarration>The project DIG: Scientists in Alaska's Scenery will perform proof-of-concept on integrating a tourist's visit with place-based stories of meaningful science research in the Arctic. DIG (Digitally Integrated Guide) will widen the general public's interaction with the cultural and natural environment by allowing them to access Web sites and load their handheld mobile devices with engaging descriptions of research.  Access can occur before, during, or after their visit - even if the visit takes them far from computers, electricity and the Internet.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The creation of user-friendly access to technology and to scientists' stories will provide a new information tool for the public. For these tourists, or others interested in research in Alaska, opportunities to learn directly from the scientists themselves are almost non-existent.  Moreover, tourists have no capability to link such research with places they visit. DIG's place-based outreach will be delivered using standard media (broadcast TV, publications) and social media (Web, facebook, twitter, etc.) and mobile devices. DIG demonstration project will join scientists, Alaska Native peoples, tourists, media makers, interpreters and technology experts in inquiry-based learning designed to maximize engagement by the general public.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The radically different approach to Arctic-focused science documentary proposed here fosters the close collaboration of the scientist and media maker. Video podcasts (vodcasts) and supporting Web-based materials will be created for three current research projects in Alaska, with a focus on NSF-funded projects.  Such projects include anthropology and cultural/linguistic study, paleontology, climate change research, biology, and other areas.  Delivery and evaluation will emphasize tourists who visit, or are planning to visit, the National Parks of Alaska.  These tourists are accessible to the research team, and they are motivated to seek out information about the places they are visiting.  If successful, our approach to science education and outreach will augment their knowledge about research in Alaska, resulting in a deeper and more informed experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since the April 2011 web launch, Frontier Scientists continues to share first person accounts and real time insights from leading archaeologists, grizzly bear biologists, volcano researchers, climate change specialists, native anthropologists, and other scientists.  Fascinating video of current scientific discoveries in some of the ArcticÆs most remote and dramatic landscapes are chronicled in short videos, Twitter feeds, blogs and web reports.  The research covers these categories:  Grizzlies Petroglyphs Paleo-Eskimo Cook Inlet Volcanoes Computational Science Alutiiq Weavers Climate Change Watch Arctic Winter Cruise 2011 Raven Bluff Computational Science Modeling Arctic Waters AlaskaÆs Unmanned Aircraft Research Where is Lake ElÆgygytgyn?   "We want to let travelers, teachers, students, aspiring scientists, and anyone else interested in science feel as if they are with scientists as they track grizzlies or take the temperature of permafrost in a borehole," explained Liz OÆConnell, video director for Frontier Scientists.  Visitors to Frontier Scientists can ask questions to our scientists directly; follow some of them on Twitter and Facebook, converse with scientists on their blogs, and if you are in Alaska locate research via the FS App on mobile devices.  Scientists like Frontier Scientists because it is not a article or a documentary that is viewed just once.  FontierScientists.com is always available online, easy to access, updated at least weekly with new information on blogs and twitter.  But most important, the scientists are telling their stories not second hand through a narrator.    To date there has been 12,739 unique visitors to the FS web site, with 19,958 visits.  Over 44,513 page views with an average of 2.18 minutes per visit viewing 2.28 pages per visit.  36% of the visitors are returning.  Currently the Petroglyph videos are part of an exhibit in the Alutiiq Museum and Archaeological Repository in Kodiak, Alaska.
