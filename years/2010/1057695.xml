<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Title: Repurposing of funds from the 2010 Huntsville Workshop: Partially Ionized Plasmas Throughout the Cosmos; Nashville, Tennessee; October 3-8, 2010 in support of the 2011 Joint Space Weather Summer School.  PI: Gary Zank   Awardee: University of Alabama in Huntsville   Award Number: 1057695  Program Officer Name: Kile B. Baker   Program Officer Email Address: kbaker@nsf.gov  Program Officer Phone Number: (703)292-8519     The original purpose of the NSF grant was to provide support to allow student participants to attend the 2010 Huntsville Workshop on Partially Ionized Plasmas Throughout the Cosmos.  We requested permission of the Program Officer to use the remaining funds of this grant ($5,260.93) to fund US-based student participation in our upcoming Joint Space Weather Summer Camp (JSWSC), which was graciously provided.     The first JSWSC was held from 17th July to 14th August, 2011.  Its aim was to provide undergraduate and graduate students from both UAHuntsville and universities across Germany an introduction to the practical and theoretical aspects of space plasma physics and its applications to space weather.  The course was co-hosted by UAHuntsville, The University of Rostock in Germany and the German Space Agency (DLR) and consisted of two weeks in Germany and two weeks in the United States.   The US portion of the course focused on the theory of space weather, its drivers, and its influence on the wider heliosphere.  This was a æFrom Sun to Mud and BeyondÆ approach to space weather, and introduced students to the theoretical background to space weather.  The approach was not purely theoretical, however; students had to participate in project work (in teams of 4-5 students) to apply their new-found knowledge of space weather physics to real research problems, working in international groups, under the leadership of a staff or faculty mentor.  Students were required to prepare and present posters of their work, all of which were submitted to the von Braun Symposium student poster competition that was held in Huntsville in October 2011.   Posters are now hosted on the SWSC website, which can be found at http://www.cspar.uah.edu/space-weather-summer-camp.html  The two weeks in Germany consisted on lectures on the applications of space weather, focusing firstly on the effects of space weather on the ionosphere, global communications, artificial satellites, and spacecraft, and secondly on how space weather effects in the ionosphere are detected and monitored.
