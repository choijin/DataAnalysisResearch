<AbstractNarration>This Future Forward Scholarship Program (F²SP) builds on a prior, highly successful scholarship program at Del Mar College, a Hispanic-serving, two-year institution, by supporting STEM students to complete applied science degrees to enter the workforce and/or associate degrees for transfer to four-year institutions.  Ultimately, this scholarship program is supporting at least 88 majors in the fields of Biotechnology, Electrical Engineering, Engineering Technology, Geology, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, or Physics.  F²SP provides financial support in addition to academic and social support, actively engaging academically talented and financially needy students from underrepresented STEM populations including women, Hispanics, differently abled students and Veterans by addressing the following program objectives:&lt;br/&gt;     - Create a "math cohort" with STEM-focused curriculum for college algebra, trigonometry and calculus I to bridge the gap between math, physics and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;     - Increase the number of students declaring majors in Biotechnology, Mechanical Engineering, and Engineering Technology through a campus awareness campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     - Increase the number of skilled graduates in technical areas of need such as Engineering Technology.&lt;br/&gt;     - Increase the number of students receiving Associate's degrees in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;     - Increase the number of students transferring to baccalaureate degree programs in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;     - Provide shadowing and internship opportunities for scholarship students.&lt;br/&gt;     - Provide information to all advisors on STEM majors and careers.&lt;br/&gt;     - Decrease the number of hours scholarship students work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholarship students are recruited from: the Educational Service Center Region 2 area of Texas, which includes 42 public school districts; private and charter schools; nonprofit organizations such as the Women's Shelter, Salvation Army and VA Clinic; and from currently enrolled undecided undeclared and Liberal Arts students.  Student support programs in place at Del Mar College, coupled with a pilot "math cohort" creating a learning community addressing fundamental concepts needed by all STEM majors, provide a strong foundation for scholarship recipients.  The cohort of scholarship recipients is also extensively supported by STEM faculty through mentoring, intrusive advising, degree monitoring and personal counseling.</AbstractNarration>
