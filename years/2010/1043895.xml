<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop and use virtual reality (VR) laboratories to emulate the learning environment of physical laboratories, while preserving the three dimensionality, immersion, interactivity and hands-on data acquisition features of physical experiments.  The project team is developing the physical-to-virtual transformation methodology, integrating VR experiments in the supplementation and stand-alone modes for laboratory instruction and the embedded mode in lecture courses, and incorporating devices (such as 3-D mice, data gloves) for human-computer interfaces.   The combination of VR based practice sessions and physical experiment sessions provides students hands-on experience in both physical and virtual domains.  The pedagogical results and lessons learned from this project are disseminated through a workshop to community colleges in Virginia and a website hosting the teaching modules and project results for distribution to 4-year and 2-year colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this exploratory project at Old Dominion University (ODU) is to advance the development and use of virtual reality laboratories that are designed to emulate the learning environment of physical laboratories.

The broader impacts relate to the educational processes in higher education. The project facilitates the use of virtual reality experiments for practice runs prior to physical laboratory sessions. This translates into enhanced quality of laboratory instruction reflected in improved student learning. Validation of key concepts in this project lays the foundation at Old Dominion University for development of hybrid laboratories consisting of an optimal mix of physical and virtual experiments. Due to their cost effectiveness, inherent flexibility and the ability to provide hands-on experience in both physical and virtual domains, hybrid labs are an attractive means for revitalizing engineering education infrastructure for the new globally competitive knowledge-based economy. Furthermore, virtual reality experiments have the potential of becoming building blocks for development of virtual reality labs enabling more advanced distance learning web-based programs that reach a more diverse non-traditional student base including women, minority, and physically-challenged individuals. The project advances the learning environment in engineering schools through incorporation of exciting and user friendly modern technology-based instructional tools, such as VR laboratories, that are more in tune with students` visual learning style in the new modern digital age.  The following are the outcomes of this project :  (i) Two virtual reality experiments, one for the solid mechanics lab and one for the thermo-fluids lab, were developed and implemented in two undergraduate mechanical engineering courses namely solid mechanics lab (MAE 225) and thermo-fluids lab (MAE 305). (ii)               Two immersion levels were tested for their impact on student learning. The desk-top virtual reality ("DTVR") system employed a desk-top computer coupled with a 3-D flat screen digital TV to create a one screen virtual reality immersive environment. The CAVE virtual reality ("CVR") system employed a full-scale ( room size ) three screen projection system coupled to a computer. Assessment of these two systems, the "DTVR" and the "CVR", was done using quantitative and qualitative techniques. Statistical analysis of quiz scores of students revealed that any enhancement in quiz mean scores of students in the "CVR" group over students` quiz mean score of the "DTVR" group was statistically not significant. In other words, students` learning effectiveness was essentially the same whether they used the "DTVR" or the "CVR" system. This is a significant finding since cost of full-scale "CVR" system can be twenty to fifty times that of the "DTVR" system. (iii)             A new virtual reality system, the t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
