<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award will build on advances in biogeochemistry at microbial, whole-ecosystem, and global scales, and broaden graduate student training from an exclusive focus at one scale to interdisciplinary training in the principles, measurement techniques, and quantitative approaches used at multiple scales. Intellectual Merit: Human activities are rapidly changing Earth?s climate. However, model projections of future climate have large uncertainties, due in large part to lack of knowledge about biogeochemical controls and feedbacks that determine future atmospheric concentrations of key greenhouse gases. Predictions of future climate require integrated understanding of these biogeochemical processes across multiple scales in both space and time. This training will also improve communication between empiricists and modelers and to the general public.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program starts with three core classes on the principles, observational methods, and quantitative approaches of cross-scale biogeochemistry, followed by three short, intensive modules providing training in microbial methods (Cornell), whole-ecosystem biogeochemistry (Cary Institute), and global modeling (NCAR).  This training is followed by discussion groups on particular biogeochemical processes with an explicit inclusion of multiple scales. Workshops will provide training in science communication, mentoring, and other professional development skills, with multi-pronged efforts to recruit and retain women and underrepresented minorities.  Broader Impacts: The project is enriched with a global perspective through collaboration with four international institutions: the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Germany; the University of SÃ£o Paulo, (Brazil); the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Bangor, Wales; and the University of Essex (UK).  Together, these partnerships and training activities will provide the next generation of graduate students with the ability to address the biogeochemical drivers of and responses to climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

Predictions of future climate require integrated understanding of these biogeochemical processes across multiple scales. This education and training program in Cross-Scale Biogeochemistry and Climate equipped graduate students from a wide range of backgrounds in the observational and simulation tools needed to advance understanding of the controls of the fluxes of these greenhouse gases across microbial, whole-ecosystem, and global scales. This program produced major research accomplishments in four main areas: (1) decomposition and stabilization of soil organic carbon, (2) nitrogen limitation and fixationm, (3) methane production and consumption,&nbsp; and (4) denitrification and production of nitrous oxide. For example, participants used a range of advanced instrumentation to show how organic carbon stabilizes in soils, and how soil microbial communities can affect both organic matter decomposition and its stabilization. Others demonstrated how microbial communities often govern the ecosystem-scale emissions of methane and nitrous oxide and cycling of nitrogen, and still others showed how ecosystem-scale measurements of nitrogen cycling and losses can be used to test and improve a major Earth system model.
