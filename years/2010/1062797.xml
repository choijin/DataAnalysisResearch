<AbstractNarration>The Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) hosts an REU site dedicated to physical metallurgy research, an area that continues to be fundamental to critical national needs in transportation, infrastructure, and energy.    Specifically, research in the REU Site focuses on processing-structure-property relationships of ferrous alloys, non-ferrous alloys, modern welding and joining technologies, and solidification. The Materials Reliability Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder also collaborates on 2 projects and offers both their facilities and their mentorship to the students.  The REU Site provides research experiences for 10 undergraduates each year.  Students stay for 10 weeks during summers and live together on campus so they are fully integrated as a group into the CSM community.  As part of their research experience, students participate in 4 half-day workshops that introduce them to physical metallurgy concepts and tools, especially those that are unique to CSM. The students are also exposed to other materials engineering environments via tours to local industry and government facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important for the US to prepare competent scientists and engineers who are knowledgeable in metallurgy areas in order to help fill the large numbers of high level research and leadership positions available in national and global industries. The REU Site will be assessed to make improvements on the effectiveness of its activities and analyze the direct impacts of those activities on participants? critical thinking and future career decisions.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Site program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Colorado School of Mines was awarded a Research Experience for Undergraduates site program from 2011 to 2015.  The program was entitled "REU Site: Advanced Metallurgical Design for Transportation, Infrastructure, and Energy." The program focused on these areas because they have been identified as critical national priorities for sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly development, and advanced alloys will be a major component of technological advances.  Also, developing new infrastructure and monitoring aging of existing infrastructure continues to be a pressing concern in the metallurgical and broader engineering fields. The program Principal Investigator was Prof. Kip Findley, and the co-PI was Prof. Michael Kaufman.  Both were in the G.S. Ansell Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering (MME).   The participants included over 35 undergraduate researchers from over 25 institutions including colleges and universities, primarily undergraduate institutions, community colleges, and high schools.  The students had three primary activities: 1) individual research projects with existing groups in the MME department, 2) hands-on workshops in metallurgical engineering in areas such as forging and forming, foundry, and welding, and 3) tours to local metallurgical industries and research labs such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, CO and Ball Canning in Golden, CO.  Three of the research groups involved are current or former NSF-IUCRC awardees: the Advanced Steel Processing and Products Research Center, the Center of Advanced Non-Ferrous Structural Alloys, and the Center for Integrative Materials Joining Science for Energy Applications. The program also facilitated collaboration between the Colorado School of Mines and NIST-Boulder.  Two students during each summer performed joint projects between CSM and NIST, and thus had the opportunity to take advantage of staff and equipment resources at both locations.  Each summer, the program culminated with a poster session that was held cooperatively with other REU groups on campus.  The poster session allowed the students to present their work to a diverse audience from CSM and the surrounding community.  Many of the students also presented their posters at national meetings, wrote publications in conference proceedings or journals, and wrote technical reports for research centers.   Student assessment was performed with the cooperation of REU groups at multiple universities: Colorado School of Mines, Washington State University, Purdue University, and Clemson University.  The students were assessed based on their motivation for participating in the REU programs, their perceived benefits of the program, and their self-efficacy in research before and after the program.  One important result is that the studentsÆ self-efficacy in all of these programs improved in multiple research activities after participating in the programs.  Of the students who participated in the program and have completed their undergraduate degree, almost all have remained in STEM disciplines and several are now pursuing graduate degrees in STEM disciplines.
