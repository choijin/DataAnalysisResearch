<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for the Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence - Ocean Systems (COSEE-OS). Through its ongoing efforts, COSEE-OS has identified key areas for future growth, including: (i) facilitating the creation of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) resources that are conceptually linked to ocean-climate content; (ii) scaling up ocean scientists' impacts by taking advantage of networking infrastructure; and (iii) building tools to assess the quality of consensus-based products created by diverse communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will expand its successful model of creating software that is flexible, transferrable, and user focused for the ocean science community. OS will share this model via workshops for scientists at other COSEE's. OS will scale up its regional initiatives to have national impact, with a focus on rural and inland audiences. In addition, a new partnership with the Institute for Broadening Participation is improving engagement of underrepresented minorities in OS opportunities, and will serve as a model for the greater Network. By supporting existing educational programs, OS will assist two small, but prestigious, research laboratories -- Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences -- in meeting their goal of providing effective research experiences for K-12 educators and "young scientists" in training. The Center's goal is to build Capacity nationwide, honing individuals' abilities to develop effective "Broader Impacts" (BI) activities. This is accomplished, in part, by engaging informal education institution partners such as Seacoast Science Center (SSC) and New England Aquarium (NEAq) to aid in the development of BI activities with scientists. The Center also supports the New England Ocean Sciences Education Collaborative (NEOSEC), a diverse network of over 40 organizations coordinated by NEAq, to build regional capacity by training its educators in planning and implementing BI activities for ocean scientists. This ensures that the content and products of current ocean science research can efficiently reach a broad audience in a timely fashion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A newly formalized partnership with the Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal and Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS) unites the New England cadre of ocean science educators and their students to the NERACOOS scientists, providing opportunities to increase the BI for scientists. The Center's joint efforts with New England regional Sea Grant Extension staff to field test new analytical tools that aid consensus building about climate change issues in New England coastal communities is another opportunity for scientists to increase their BI activities.</AbstractNarration>

Development of the Recommendations  The development of the recommendations identified in the outcomes was initiated through a day-long gathering of scientists and informal educators in March of 2011 with the purpose of investigating the nature of the BI relationship. A number of group processes were used to identify the characteristics of scientist/educator Broader Impact relationships. The outcome of the gathering was a detailed set of notes about actual scientist/educator relationships.

The concept map was developed utilizing the Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence - Ocean Systems concept map building tool (CLIMB) and exists within the CenterÆs Public Maps.     Broader Impact Collaboration Training Utilizing the Concept Map  Two workshops and two presentations were used to introduce the Broader Impacts Concept Map to scientists and informal educators to elicit user feedback and suggestions for imbedded resources. The map was first introduced to approximately 35 educators and scientists at a 2011 workshop at the Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.

Around twenty early career scientists were trained on Broader Impacts utilizing the concept map and other COSEE-developed resources. Feedback again indicated that users found the map to be a helpful tool in the development of a Broader Impact component to a proposal.     Recommendations for Future Use of the Tool  The Broader Impact Concept Maps are designed to allow for users to provide additional resources that can be embedded in the map to continue its growth and increase its usefulness. The interactive nature of the tool with users, and the capacity to grow and become more useful was identified by many users as a strength of the design.     The maps are not easy to find, and their use is predicated on the ass...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
