<AbstractNarration>In recent years deformation of algebraic and topological structures has given rise to important structures such as quantum groups, vertex algebras, and homotopy Lie algebras which in turn have important connections with other areas of mathematics and physics. The representation theory of quantum groups and vertex algebras are better understood than the representation theory of  homotopy Lie algebras. An NSF/ CBMS regional conference on "Deformation Theory of Algebras and Modules" is proposed to be held at North Carolina State University during the week of May 16 - May 20, 2011 with Professor Martin Markl of the Mathematical Institute of the Czech Academy as the principal lecturer who will deliver ten lectures on deformations of algebras and modules. Professor Markl will shed new light on these seemingly unrelated algebraic structures. This in turn will generate discussions among participating algebraists, topologists as well as mathematical physicists to explore new frontiers of research in deformation theory. It is hoped that this will lead to research collaborations among participants. In particular, it may result in a better understanding of the representations of  homotopy Lie algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major objective of this conference is to foster new collaborations among algebraists and topologists working on various aspects of deformation theory. The proposed lecture series will be of immense educational value to the participating graduate students and young researchers from universities in the southeastern region of USA. Furthermore, this lecture series will help enhance the research collaborations between researchers in USA and Eastern Europe, and provide international exposure to participating US graduate students and junior researchers. It will also help attract strong graduate students from Eastern Europe to NCSU and other US universities in the southeastern region.</AbstractNarration>
