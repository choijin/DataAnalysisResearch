<AbstractNarration>This project examines state strategies and the nature of popular and elite geopolitical culture in Kazakhstan. It highlights the contested nature of the state project to promote a particular vision of national identity in Kazakhstan. The central research questions are: How has the state decision to move the capital to Astana been used to promote a particular "Kazakhstani" identity? And how has this been interpreted by the people of Kazakhstan? In answering these questions, this study will employ both quantitative and qualitative methods, including a country-wide survey (of 1,500 respondents), textual analysis, focus groups, and interviews. Furthermore, the research project will explore the ways in which the citizens of Kazakhstan have actively engaged in the interpretation of the state's identity project. The researcher will also shed light on contestations and multiple articulations of identity in Kazakhstan. The capital city change is used as a focal point for understanding the population's articulations of their identity and their geopolitical imaginations. &lt;br/&gt;The findings of the proposed research will contribute to advancing knowledge by linking theoretical and methodological approaches to the investigation of nationalism of a region currently undergoing significant political changes. The project draws heavily on the regional studies tradition, highlighting the centrality of deep regional knowledge to the generation of theory and empirical field research in geography. Furthermore, Kazakhstan is an important site for this study because Central Asia is a particularly neglected region within the discipline of geography. Although Kazakhstan has a small population of 16 million people with a territorial size of 2.7 million sq km, its strategic significance cannot be underestimated given that the country is home to vast oil and gas reserves and is one of the world's leading producers of uranium ore. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career. This project is jointly supported by the NSF Geography and Spatial Sciences Program and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is a study of contemporary political geography in Kazakhstan, which gained independence in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed. The primary research question is, how has the ruling regime under President Nursultan Nazarbayev asserted its own authority and legitimacy, as well as KazakhstanÆs sovereignty in the post-Soviet era? The intellectual merit of the project is thus to explain the genuine popularity of the nondemocratic regime of Nazarbayev, who has been in power since 1991 &ndash; as well as to shed light on authoritarian regime popularity more generally. This goal has the broader impact of helping US policy makers and scholars to understand the domestic politics of Kazakhstan, a country whose strategic significance cannot be underestimated, as noted by US Under Secretary William J. Burns (2009): "Central AsiaÆs economic growth and political development can produce more reliable partners for combating global challenges, from non-proliferation to counter-narcotics to energy security." US interests in Central Asia depend on regional stability, so in the case of Kazakhstan, this study has analyzed how this stability is achieved, and whether or not it is sustainable.  The primary output of the research is the co-PIÆs doctoral dissertation in Geography at the University of Colorado, Boulder, entitled, "The city and the steppe: Territory, technologies of government, and KazakhstanÆs new capital." This dissertation employs mixed qualitative and quantitative methods, including data from a country-wide survey (and analyzed through multilevel statistical modeling), interviews, participant observation, focus groups, and textual analysis. It was carried out over the course of 3 field visits to 8 cities in Kazakhstan from June 2009 to July 2011.
