<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Paul Schleyer of the University of Georgia, for the development of computational chemistry methodology to study novel chemical architectures.  The goals of this work are to understand structure and bonding in exotic systems such as metal and metal hydride clusters, fullerenes, aromatic compounds, and hypervalent carbon systems.  Evaluations of bond length strain, angle strain, aromaticity, hyperconjugation, homoconjugation in a systematic way will lead to a deeper understanding of chemical structure and bonding at a fundamental level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research include training opportunities for students in computational chemistry.  Some of the novel structures, such as metal hydride clusters and the hypervalent carbon and hydrogen species, may be detectable in interstellar space and are therefore of interest to the astronomy community.  There is also potential for this work to lead to new techologically advanced materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fundamental reinterpretations for several key organic molecules (e.g., the 2-norbornyl cation, cyclopropane, cyclobutadiene,cyclooctatetraene,and ethylene) were reported during this NSF support period. Our publication in Science, in collaboration with Prof. MeyerÆs (University of Erlangen-Nuremberg) and Prof. KrossingÆs (University of Freiburg) groups, report the long sought X-ray structure of the non-classical 2-norbornyl cation (confirming its bridging carbon). This historical milestone brings closure to the 60 year long debate on the structure of the 2-norbornyl cation, and provides impetus for our current investigation of still more unsolved problems regarding this and other fascinating "highly electron delocalized" species.     Our computational studies also demonstrated key principles for quantifying (anti)aromaticity in porphyrinoids, fullerenes,and M&ouml;bius rings, and yielded stimulating discoveries for many basic organic reactions and mechanisms. For example, we demonstrated that the electrophilic bromination, sulfonation,and chlorinationof several arenes follow an addition-elimination route rather than the familiar substitution mechanism. Our computational study also refuted the traditional view by revealing that electrostatic interactions between the b-carbon (C&beta;) and the nucleophile/leaving group atoms at the SN2 reaction centers govern the intrinsic SN2 reaction rate trends of a much broader spectrum of hydrocarbon substrates     This project also used well-established methods from modern quantum chemistry to predict the properties of unusual inorganic and organometallic molecules. Such research suggests new areas of chemistry and helps to plan efficient future experimental work to explore these areas of chemistry.  This project thus differs from most theoretical chemistry projects in focusing on a search for new areas of chemistry rather than a more detailed interpretation of existing experimental data.      Another outcome involves the development of reciprocal hydrogen (H-) bonding &ndash; aromaticity coupling relationships. Hydrogen bonding can influence the aromaticity of heterocyclic &pi;-conjugated H-bonded substrates, both favorably and unfavorably, through ring &pi;-electron polarization effects. Thus, H-bonding interactions that increase aromaticity, by enhancing cyclic 4n+2 &pi;-electron delocalization, are strengthened. Conversely, H-bonding interactions that decrease aromaticity, by inducing localized quinoidal &pi;-character, are weakened. Computed association energies and dissected nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS) document the mutual enhancement (or reduction) of intermolecular interactions and changes in the aromatic character of the H-bonded substrates. Such coupling effects open unique opportunities for "tuning" H-bond strengths for molecular design.            Last Modified: 11/28/2015       Submitted by: Paul V Schleyer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
