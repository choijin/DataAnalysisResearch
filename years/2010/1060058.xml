<AbstractNarration>This project continues and expands a previous S-STEM project to further encourage students to persist in completion of degrees in STEM.  The College of St. Catherine, a women's college in Minnesota, identified several barriers to persistence in STEM majors among their S-STEM Scholars.  Accordingly, they structured the program to identify individual scholars as "diamonds in the rough" (entering first-year students), "continuing" (previous scholars whose records allow them to retain their scholarships), "late comers" (students who enter undeclared or considering non-STEM majors, but who later decide to pursue a STEM major), and "tenacity" (students whose records prevent them from being in the continuing category, but who demonstrate a love of their major discipline despite their academic difficulty).  Each group of students is offered a different combination of support from scholarship funds, tutoring, and specially designed courses that use science applications in the teaching of mathematics.  Already dealing with an exclusively female student population with financial need, the new program is establishing contacts within two predominant immigrant communities in the area, the Hmong and Somali, and actively recruiting these underrepresented student groups into the scholarship program.  Over the course of the five-year project, at least 65 scholarships will have been awarded.  Graduates of St. Catherine's have succeeded in entering and completing graduate programs and in the workforce.  Thus this project plays a major role in expanding access to STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of the grant was to provide scholarship support to undergraduate students so that they could complete their education within a STEM discipline. Additional goals included revising our introductory calculus class so that students could see its real-world applications, developing recruitment materials that could attract STEM students from underrepresented communities, and strengthening professional development of our STEM majors.  During five and one-half academic years, the grant supported a total of sixty-nine undergraduates. Forty-two scholars graduated from the university with a major in a STEM field, while eleven scholars were still completing their degrees when the grant expired. (Sixteen students had graduated with a degree outside of STEM or had left the university.) Survey responses from thirty-eight alumni of the program indicated that twenty-five of them were either employed in a STEM field or were in a graduate program within STEM.  Changes to our calculus course had the goal of increasing students? appreciation of the plethora of calculus applications across disciplines.  Projects, such as creating videos or presentations addressing "Why I Should Study Calculus", and "real-world" examples, such as modeling drug absorption into the human body using the first and second derivatives of a function, were included as some of the activities used to achieve this heightened awareness.  The course has currently evolved into an almost fully flipped classroom model meeting four days a week.  Funds from the grant also supported the production of a series of videos profiling students of color pursuing education in STEM at St. Catherine University. Under the guidance of the university?s Multicultural and International Programs and Services (MIPS) Office, the videos are part of the #ExperienceMIPS series that our university's staff can use when recruiting at schools with diverse populations.  Professional development opportunities included a networking program called "Dessert and Destiny," scholarship support for career development courses, and a small amount of support for student travel to conferences.  On average, we hosted 4-5 of the Dessert &amp; Destiny events per year. These provided opportunities for students to come together and learn about career opportunities in STEM from professionals in the field, including several of our university?s alumnae. Topics included: preparing for graduate school; career possibilities in engineering; finding internships; opportunities in clinical research; using recruiters to find jobs in the private sector; and opportunities in STEM education.  Students gave the events high ratings on evaluations, and their input was used to help choose the topics for our gatherings.  The most popular Dessert &amp; Destiny event was "Preparing for Graduate School."  This reflected growing awareness of the wide variety of graduate programs in the sciences that go beyond the medical professions.  All scholarship recipients were given tuition support to complete one two-credit course that would advance their professional development. Most scholars took our university?s "Career Development for Women" course which covered topics such as resume writing and interviewing. Some scholars used the tuition support to take internships for credit or to complete research for credit under the direction of a STEM faculty member.  After consultation with our program officer, some grant funding was used to support student travel to scientific conferences.  As a result, we supported three students to travel to professional conferences in their disciplines to present their research.  These students have indicated that these experiences helped direct them towards STEM careers post-graduation. In addition to supporting travel expenses, we also helped support students present their research through poster printing. This helped students create professional research posters for local and regional scientific and networking meetings.
