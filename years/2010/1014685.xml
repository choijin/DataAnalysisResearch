<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Oxygen is an essential molecule necessary for life to exist on Earth.  There are a number of natural chemical processes that involve oxygen and one that has been of great interest is how proteins in nature can utilize oxygen to transform organic molecules into new chemical structures.  Nature can very efficiently carry out this chemistry using metal ions that are located within proteins, generally referred to as metalloproteins. One example of this natural synthesis is the production of penicillin in fungi.  Metalloproteins can be so efficient that it can be experimentally challenging for scientists to uncover exactly how they conduct the chemical reactions with oxygen.  One way that this problem can be simplified is by designing small model compounds that can mimic how the metalloproteins function. Understanding metal-oxygen compounds and their chemical reactivity is the driving force behind the research conducted at the Center for Biomimetic Systems (CBS) and Metal Oxygen Bioinspired Chemistry (MOBIC) group at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.  Research was conducted by Joseph Braymer, a Chemistry graduate student at the University of Michigan, in collaboration with Professor Wonwoo Nam, director of CBS and MOBIC and Assistant Professor Jaeheung Cho.    Research was made possible through a National Science Foundation &ndash; East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute (NSF-EAPSI) fellowship awarded to Joseph Braymer.  Important findings from the research included developing chemical conditions and procedures for characterizing various metal-oxygen compounds and how they react with organic compounds.  Overall understanding of this research may lead to new ways of converting unreactive chemical feedstocks to more valuable chemicals that could be used in pharmaceuticals, fuels, etc.                    Last Modified: 12/01/2010       Submitted by: Joseph J Braymer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
