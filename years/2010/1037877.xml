<AbstractNarration>This workshop on Mathematical Foundations of Open Systems explores new research directions towards a logical/mathematical foundation for modeling the behavior of dynamic open systems that evolve over time through self-organization, regulation, and adaptation to changing environments and structures. Such a framework should provide a unified approach for obtaining an advanced understanding of natural systems, the ability to fix and modify them, and to design cyber-physical systems (CPS) in principled ways using new notions of control and coordination.  The workshop, held May 23-25, 2010, Philadelphia, PA, is supported by the NSF and other agency members of the interagency coordinating group on High Confidence Software and Systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Security Agency (NSA), the University of Pennsylvania, and SRI International sponsored a workshop on the mathematical foundations of open systems held at the Inn @ Penn in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, May 23-25, 2010.     The goals of the workshop were to:  * assess the current state-of-the art in system modeling and analysis;  identify the limitations and critical gaps in existing theories and modeling formalisms,  * develop benchmark challenge problems whose solutions could have high impact on the design, analysis, and maintainability of critical systems and the understanding of complex natural systems;  * recommend a research agenda for developing new technologies to enable more rapid advance in areas such as biological science and the science of cyber-physical systems.  * recommend new directions in education.     Workshop participants included leading researchers in mathematics, biology, formal methods, computer science, chemistry, physics, control theory, and engineering. The workshop agenda included invited presentations on a variety of topics related to open systems, followed by several open discussion sessions probing issues raised and identifying potential grand challenge problems. The discussions are and recommendations are summarized below.     1 Summary of Talks     Pat Lincoln: Discussed Formal/logical approaches to modeling and understanding complex systems.     Ilya Nemenman:  Discussed Information theory, what the FlyÆs Eye tells the FlyÆs Brain.     Hong Qian: Gave a talk on Open Systems and Entropy.     Kenneth Gollob: Discussed Issues in Immune System Modeling.     Ashish Tiwari: Discussed Abstraction and Modeling.        Bud Mishra:  Gave a discussion of Model Checking Applications to Cancer Models.     Ary Goldberger:  Discussed Time Asymmetry properties of Human Physiologic Signals.     John Doyle: Discussed Complexity and Network-Centric Infrastructures.     2 Emerging concepts  Research emerged during discussions: the mathematics of rare events; complexity as an essential feature of healthy systems; complexity as a tool; thermodynamics -- irreversibility, energetics, mathematics of far from equilibrium systems; and networks everywhere.     3 Open Discussions   There were robust discussions of rare events, biology as a model for cyber-physical systems, robustness, complexity as a tool, thermodynamics and far from equilibrium methods and networks.      4  Gaps:       &bull; Complexity leads to replacing models by data analysis     &bull; Overuse and ubiquitous abuse of statistics     &bull; The emerging ability to produce large quantities of data (in space and/or time), leads to over-determined systems.     &bull; Model-checking has proved to be useful in many applications, however there are serious limitations including scalability, and difficulty of application to hybrid systems or reaction-diffusion equations.     &bull; Linear methods have problems of scale while nonlinear methods have problems of compositionality.     &bull; Models should be compositional, adaptive, useful, predictive, insightful. Methods for validation are needed.     &bull; Fundamental mathematics and logic of stochastic/nonlinear dynamics is lacking.     &bull; Overuse of simulation and topological data analysis.       &bull; The infeasibility of universal models coupled with dynamically changing systems, e.g., internet and supply systems, limit the use of traditional techniques such as regression analysis.       5 Challenges and recommendations: towards a transformative agenda      There is a need to develop a combined mathematical and logical framework for modeling the behavior of open dynamic networks that evolve over time. The framework would provide a unified approach to build diverse top down and bottom up models that are consistent with each other and with the system (biological, cyber-physical, or other) being modeled.         6  New Directions for Education were proposed...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
