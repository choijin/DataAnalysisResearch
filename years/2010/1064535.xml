<AbstractNarration>Given the sensitivity of glacier dynamics to the position of the glacier front, without a parameterization of calving, to determine the position of the glacier front, which can be implemented into continental scale ice sheet models, our ability to accurately forecast changes in sea level from the ice sheets in response to climate change will be seriously compromised.  However, despite the important role iceberg calving plays in contributing to observed changes in Greenland and Antarctica, the glaciology community still does not have a parameterization of iceberg calving that can explain the diversity of observed calving behavior.  The challenge that must be overcome is that the parameterization of calving must not only be capable of explaining the wide variety of observed behaviors, it must also be sufficiently simple that it can be incorporated into continental-scale ice sheet models without introducing a prohibitive computational tax on the models and modelers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided to develop a parameterization of calving that (i) can be applied to grounded and floating glacier termini and (ii) can be implemented into regional and/or continental scale ice-sheet-shelf models.  The primary goal is not to predict the specific behavior of a particular outlet glacier, but instead to attack the problem from a broader perspective and try to understand the qualitative envelope of behavior and stability of ice tongues, outlet and tidewater glaciers as a group. The calving law will be formulated as a stochastic process using techniques borrowed from the statistical-mechanical theory of fracture of disordered material. The newly derived calving law will be incorporated into a flowline ice-sheet-shelf model to simulate a range of different environmental conditions, basal topographies, and sliding laws. The core of this proposal focuses on determining the behavior predicted by the calving law throughout the entire range of parameter space.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ice sheets and glaciers constitute the largest reservoirs of freshwater on the planet and contain enough water equivalent to rise global sea level by nearly 70 m if they were to melt completely.  Although mass loss of this scale over the next century is unexpected, it is imperative that we have reliable estimates of the evolution of ice sheets over the coming decades and centuries so that stakeholders can plan and mitigate expected sea level rise.  To do this, it is necessary to predict if ice sheets are gaining or losing mass.  Ice sheets and glaciers gain mass by the slow accumulation of snow on the surface and lose mass by (1) melting (from the surface or base) or (2) the sporadic detachment of icebergs from the terminus of glaciers.  Of the two processes that remove mass from ice sheets, iceberg calving is the least well understood even though it accounts for up to half of the mass lost from glaciers and portions of ice sheets in contact with the ocean.  Moreover, few numerical models are capable of realistically simulating ice mass lost by iceberg calving leading to large uncertainties in sea level rise projections.  This project sought to improve our understanding of iceberg calving by taking into account the fact that iceberg calving is a complex, discrete process and the timing of individual calving events is seemingly random.  We took this random component of the behavior into account by explicitly accounting for the stochastic (i.e., random) nature of iceberg calving events in the models that we created.  We illustrate why this is necessary with an example: the cards a player is dealt in a blackjack game are random (at least if the game is fair).  Knowing the cards you are dealt, a skilled player can calculate the probability (or odds) of winning based on the cards they are dealt.  However, as every casino knows, it is possible to calculate the odds of winning many hands and on average, the house always wins.  Hence, even though the chance that a player wins or loses a hand might have a random component, when averaged over a large number of hands (or iceberg calving events in our case) it is possible to calculate the probability that the house will win in the end.  Similarly, our project found a means of calculating the probability of observing an individual calving event, given a certain hand dealt (in this case the state of the glacier along with observed atmospheric and oceanic forcing).  We also showed that if we know these probabilities, it is possible to calculate the "house effect", i.e., the probability that a glacier or group of glaciers will advance (smaller iceberg calving rates) or retreat (larger iceberg calving rates) when averaged over a long time and large number of calving events.  This allows us to simulate the average (or expected value) of advance or retreat of glaciers.  It also allows us to calculate the uncertainty in this expected value, i.e., how likely it is that a given glacier or portion of an ice sheet does something else.  As part of this project, we also partially trained three graduate students who learned about glaciology, geophysics and climate science.  These students learned how to think critically and work in areas that lie in the interdisciplinary boundary between different areas.  This is especially important because much of the work performed in this project relied on borrowing tools first developed in statistical physics and using these ideas in the newer context of glaciology.  The principal investigator of this project, along with the graduate students also worked with undergraduate researchers to give the undergraduates a taste of what "real" scientific research is like and to expose these students to the opportunity, challenges and frustration involved in scientific research to better prepare these students for careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
