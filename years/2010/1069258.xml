<AbstractNarration>1069258 Rutgers University; Dimitris Metaxas &lt;br/&gt;1069147 Arie Kaufman; SUNY at Stony Brook &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Dynamic Data Analysis (CDDA) will focus on conducting innovative research and applications based on the collaborative efforts between the two universities and member companies in the emerging field of dynamic data analysis. The end result will be novel science, algorithms and applications that transform chaos into knowledge. Rutgers University (RU) and SUNY at Stony Brook are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with RU as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will investigate algorithms and potential solutions to analyze and visualize massive, complex, multidimensional and multi-scale dynamic data. The algorithm design will be tested, validated and improved based on the close collaboration and research between the two participating universities and industry. The participating universities have research and education programs whose strengths cover the technical scope of the center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research projects will be useful to industry and homeland security, and the proposed Center will transform traditional research in computer science. Analysis and visualization of large-scale dynamic data will also become a new area of research for many graduate students. CDDA plans to have students spend time with the industrial affiliates in the form of summer internships and during the academic year so they can improve their skills. The participating universities also plan to leverage existing outreach programs at their institutions, and programs sponsored by the NSF, to encourage the participation of under-represented groups in the research..</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERIT  The Center for Dynamic Data Analytics (CDDA) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored Industry and University Cooperative Research Program (I/UCRC) established between Rutgers university (Lead Institution), the State University of New York (SUNY) and the State University of New York, Stony Brook. The CDDA completed its I/UCRC phase in 2017.   The 2010 motivation for the inception of the center was the lack of scalable algorithms, methods and solutions for addressing the ever increasing amounts of industry-related data. The formation of the CDDA center resulted in University-Industry focused research on data sets that are massive, dynamic, complex and multidimensional, or what is commonly known as Big Data analytics. This was the first I/UCRC  funcded by NSF on this very important  domain area. The goal of the center was to discover, develop and apply data analytics solutions to industry problems such that the seemingly chaotic data is transformed into knowledge and industry products. The CDDA continues the tradition of the Dynamic Data-Driven Application System (DDDAS) paradigm by inventing and applying methods for dynamic data analytics and related applications based on multidiciplinary collaborations.   MISSION  The mission of the CDDA is to conduct integrative, multi-disciplinary, transformative research and development, at the pre-competitive stage, that will (i) analyze and visualize massive, complex, multi-dimensional and multi-scale dynamic data to transform chaos into knowledge, and (ii) be applicable to many industrial sectors, such as healthcare, finance, security, search, and entertainment.   PROJECTS  Projects at the CDDA are most closely aligned to the industries of healthcare, finance, security/defense, technology, data mining, social networking and entertainment. For organizational purposes within the CDDA, we typically divide our projects into two groups, noting there is often overlap in the project areas. Those groups are Analytics and Reasoning (textual analysis, anomaly detection, string mining, etc.) and Imaging and Visualization (analytics performed on visual data and/or visual representation of data).  OUR PEOPLE  The CDDA is staffed by world-class researchers and is backed by one of the largest universities in the United States. Under the leadership of Dr. Dimitris Metaxas (Director), the CDDA brings together a multitude of talent for a common purpose.       OUTCOMES   CDDA has been a success and has resulted in many slgorithmic breakthroughs and related software that has been very useful to the participating industries. CDDA has resulted in over 20 PhD student theses, several patents,  over 50 research publications, novel educational programs on data analytics and very valuable industrial connections that have benefited both industry as well as Rutgers Professors and PhD students.
