<AbstractNarration>This Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) project at California State University Sacramento (CSUS) is providing scholarships to eleven undergraduate and four graduate students enrolled computer science or computer engineering degree programs.  The undergraduate students receive their scholarships during the final two years of their degree program and are also earning an undergraduate certificate in information assurance and security.  The graduate students receive their scholarships during the two years of their masters program and are also earning a graduate certificate in information assurance and security.  The project includes an explicit effort to recruit students from underrepresented groups into the program and has academic support programs to foster their success.  The project also includes activities to build community among the students receiving scholarships.  CSUS received the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security (NSA/DHS) Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE) designation in 2007.  The project includes an assessment and evaluation plan coordinated by an independent evaluator to ensure that the project achieves its objectives.  The project's results are being disseminated through conference and professional presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scholarship for Service at California State University, Sacramento  Project Outcome Report     Introduction     The College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) at California State University, Sacramento (Sacramento State) has developed a solid infrastructure for cybersecurity education, including the establishment of both a strong practically-oriented cybersecurity component to the Computer Science program and a Center for Information Assurance and Security (CIAS). The National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated Sacramento StateÆs CIAS a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE-IAE) for academic years 2007 &ndash; 2012 and again for 2012 &ndash; 2017.         In 2010 the National Science Foundation awarded Sacramento StateÆs Computer Science Department a $1.19 million four-year grant to enable 15 students to become cybersecurity specialists as part of the CyberCorps&reg; Scholarship for Service (SFS) program.  The funding has helped Sacramento State to establish a strong SFS program and to increase security education into our curriculum.     Intellectual Merit      The primary objective of this project was to attract qualified students to be educated in cybersecurity at Sacramento State. This is in line with the Federal Cyber Service Scholarship for Service main objective to increase the number of cybersecurity professionals to meet the ever-growing demands in these fields.     Sacramento State is one of the few institutions that can produce cybersecurity professionals for northern California, the heart of computer technology development and industry.   Our SFS program has successfully trained cybersecurity professionals who are now part of the cybersecurity workforce in federal and state agencies, as well as national laboratories.   Many of our students had multiple post-graduation job offers and have accepted jobs with several US Navy divisions (including the SPAWAR), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, and the State of California.  Based on an evaluation conducted by an external consultant, our SFS program has been successful in producing well-prepared graduates that meet the needs of employers and helping them find appropriate government positions.      The SFS program at Sacramento State has been successful in recruiting and graduating SFS students in our cybersecurity program within the target two years from acceptance into the program. All 15 students we committed to in our program&mdash;12 Computer Science and 3 Computer Engineering majors&mdash;were recruited through a competitive selection process, with 12 of the 15 pursuing Bachelor of Science (BS) and 3 pursuing Master of Science (MS) degrees. All students in our graduated within two years of receiving the scholarship.  The program has very successful in placement of graduates in qualified post-graduation positions. This placement success can be attributed to the strong relationships we have established with several federal agencies, national labs, and state agencies.      Broader Impacts      Funds from our SFS program have enabled ten faculty members to keep abreast of advances in cybersecurity by attending twenty six conferences, workshops, or colloquiums, including presenting thirteen peer-reviewed papers (twelve of which were principally on cybersecurity). Our faculty members have participated in activities that have enhanced the depth and scope of research being conducted in cybersecurity-related fields at Sacramento State. Further, they have not only incorporated current security trends and techniques into our six cybersecurity-related courses, but they have also been able to integrate more security topics into other computer science courses, benefiting SFS and non-SFS students alike.     The SFS program has encouraged participation by women and minorities through its recruitment process.    Based on the data collected by the Office of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
