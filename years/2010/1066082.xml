<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop new techniques to overcome the inherent difficulty of obtaining defect-free mechanical linkages using automated computer-aided design techniques, known as kinematic synthesis.  Recent research has shown that this can be achieved for planar and spherical four-bar linkages by a stochastic search in tolerance zones provided by the designer in the vicinity of a desired task.   The goal is to extend these results to planar and spherical six-bar and eight-bar linkage systems.  The result will be reliable computer-aided synthesis of complex linkage systems that are beyond our current capabilities.  Deliverables include software for the synthesis of defect-free linkage systems, demonstration and validation using software and hardware, documentation of the research results, and engineering education at the graduate and undergraduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will include the integration of kinematic synthesis in modern computer modeling software.  The ability to reliably synthesize planar and spherical six-bar and eight-bar linkage system that while complex are able meet the designers goals will provide an opportunity for innovation that currently does not exist.  Working engineers, undergraduate and graduate students will benefit from the commercial integration of kinematic synthesis, which provides reliable, innovative, and low-cost mechanical movement in automation for the home, office, hospital, and factory.  This will be demonstrated by example software and hardware design presented by video over the internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes:  This research developed a process that uses synthesis equations to calculate linkage dimensions, evaluates each candidate to find feasible designs, and then iterates the process for random task variations within user-defined tolerance zones.  The result is an effective design methodology for a wide range of linkage systems.  The MechGen 2 and 3 software packages implement this approach for planar four-bar and six-bar linkage synthesis, and were used in coursework for undergraduate and graduate students.  MechGen 4 and 5 implement this for spherical four-bar and six-bar linkages and are still in the prototype stage.  All four systems output a linkage design as a solid model in SolidWorks.  Applying this approach to the design of six-bar function generators yielded large sets of synthesis equations, 70 quadratic equations in 70 unknowns, which demanded new techniques for their solution as well as the evaluation of each design.  Similar equations for an eight-bar linkage are far beyond our abilty to solve, however a specialized version of this approach yielded a new design system for eight-bar linkages.  This design system was used by undergraduate and graduate students to obtain new products in a wide range of applications.  The result is a new inventive capability for the mechanical designer.  Intellectual Merit: This research has yielded a new design methodolgy for four-bar, six-bar and eight-bar linkages, which is demonstrated in the design innovative devices that were not previously possible.  This research provides a new opportunity for innovation that is beyond the current capabilities of the mechanical design systems.  Broader Impacts: This desgin methodology obrtained in this research has yielded innovative products ranging from a long-travel suspension for off-road vehicles, to a torque-cancelling wrist brace for stroke patients, as well a linkage system that imitates the wing movement of a bird in flight and a gait training system for lower limb rehabilitation.  It provides the theoretical foundation for design of new and innovative mechanical devices for home, office and industrial automation.          Last Modified: 09/06/2015       Submitted by: J.
