<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This award provides support for the Wind River Conference on Procaryotic Biology (formerly the Wind River Conference on Genetic Exchange; Transformation Meetings).  The 2010 meeting will be held June 2-6 in Estes Park, Colorado. This annual international meeting is devoted to the biology of a variety of procaryotic systems and includes reports of research in the fields of procaryotic gene regulation, molecular biology, physiology, genetic exchange, procaryotic biology and related areas, including DNA repair/mutagenesis/evolution, procaryotic differentiation and developmental pathways, recombination pathways, thermophilic biology, archaeal biology, and biotechnology. The diversity of systems represented by the meeting provide a fertile environment for sharing of new ideas and for applying well-established concepts to newly emerging systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Historically, a strength of this meeting has been a commitment to including participation by graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and even some very talented undergraduate researchers. This grant will foster this tradition by allowing these young researchers to present their research in oral and poster presentations, discuss their work with nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field, and begin to build their own professional networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is co-funded by Genes and Genome Systems, Biomolecular Systems, and Cellular Systems.</AbstractNarration>
