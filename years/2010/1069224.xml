<AbstractNarration>A simple analytic theory of the dynamics of sheared granular materials near the jamming transition is needed to guide current experiments, simulations, and applications. Here such a model is developed that:&lt;br/&gt;(1) identifies the key parameters that control the intermittent dynamics of sheared granular materials near the jamming transition,&lt;br/&gt;(2) provides predictions for the dependence of the slip avalanche statistics on the key parameters, both near and far from the jamming transition, and&lt;br/&gt;(3) provides a unified understanding of the interplay between structure and dynamics of granular materials and related systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Granular materials, such as powders, sand, gravel, and grain, either flow if  pushed, similar to fluids, or they jam, with intermittent sudden stops and slips, similar to earthquakes. A simple mathematical tool to quickly predict the behavior of pushed granular materials is being developed that is expected to have wide applications in processes that use molecular liquids, powders, construction materials, and agricultural grains. The tool can be used to predict the results of new experiments, in computer simulations, and in industrial applications, where jamming of granular matter poses a significant operational problem. The results of this research are relevant also to other physical systems, over a wide range of scales, from the deformation of metallic crystals and amorphous materials to the deformation of the earth's crust in earthquakes. The model provides new approaches to nondestructive materials testing and hazard prediction. The project also provides broad interdisciplinary training to a graduate student and an advanced undergraduate student. The students learn modern mathematical modeling tools from physics, materials science and engineering, dynamical systems theory, mathematical physics, and computational science. Collaboration with theorists, experimentalists, engineers, and geophysicists broaden the students? perspectives and increase their versatility in solving new problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Loosely packed granular materials, such as powders or construction materials, flow like a liquid when under shear, or when pushed, while densely packed granular materials move in a jerky way with slips that are similar to earthquakes. This project developed a model for the deformation behavior of densely packed granular materials and compared the results with data obtained from experiments in a plane or in three dimensions.  The project determined which parameters affect the statistics of earthquake-like slips in these materials, and the model predictions agree with recent experiments. The study provides a unified understanding of the interplay between structure and dynamics of granular materials and related systems.  The project identified which quantities measured in experiments on densely packed granular materials would also be relevant for the understanding of earthquakes on much larger scales. It predicted the effect of the rate at which the granular material is deformed and how densely the material is packed.  It also determined the effect of the data acquisition rate on the experimental results.  The tools used in the project range from numerical simulations, to analytical calculations, to the analysis of experimental data.  Broader Impact:  The model predicts the dependence of the shear-response of granular materials on the key control parameters, such as the rate at which the material is deformed and how densely the material is packed. The results are relevant not only to guide new experiments and simulations but also for industrial applications where jamming of powders and other granular matter poses a significant problem.  The results are relevant also to other systems, on a wide range of scales, including the deformation of crystals, of metallic glasses, and of the Earth itself in earthquakes. These results provide the basics for new approaches to nondestructive materials testing and hazard prediction and prevention.
