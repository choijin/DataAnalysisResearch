<AbstractNarration>This project is providing needed-based scholarships to qualified students participating in an innovative partnership between Norfolk State University Engineering faculty and peer faculty at five community college campuses. The project extends the conventional focus of college transfer programs beyond the baccalaureate to the graduate level.  The project includes comprehensive enrichment activities to cultivate social and intellectual connections between participating students and faculty across six college campuses. These activities include a bridge immersion program, peer mentoring and tutorial services, weekend recruiting events, and a televideo seminar series. The project increases the number of talented students, including female and minority students, in the targeted Electronics and Optical Engineering program. Assessments are being conducted to identify and document factors that influence student success and partnership strength.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the Norfolk State Uiversity (NSU) Two-Three Community College to University Programs Project (TCUP) Scholarship effort has been to amplify community college pathways into engineering careers. Five interdependent themes formed the core program design,   1)   Academic enrichment;  2)   Marketing and networking;  3)   Community-building activities;  4)   Outreach; and  5)   Assessment.  The prmary community college targets for the project included Central Virginia Community College (Lynchburg, VA), Northern Virginia Community College (Alexandria, VA), The College of Southern Maryland (LaPlata, MD), Thomas Nelson Community College (Newport News, VA), and Tidewater Community College (Norfolk, VA).   The TCUP project has had a significant impact on the culture and morale of the Engineering department students and faculty, as evidenced through interviews and focus groups conducted at the close of the fifth year of the effort.
