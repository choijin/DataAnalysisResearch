<AbstractNarration>In many animals, males have evolved elaborate traits or behaviors that they use during courtship, and which are assessed by females as they choose mates.  One such example is birdsong; males sing to attract mates, and females listen and seem to prefer males who sing certain kinds of songs.  This project examines the development of both male singing performance and female preferences for male songs.  Work with males asks how social and environmental experiences early in life influence song development.  Young male swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana) captured from a natural population will be raised under both normal and nutritionally challenged conditions, and trained with songs in which rates of syllable repetition (trill rate) are enhanced above normal levels.  These models are designed to test young males' vocal proficiency.  Patterns of song learning will reveal how rearing environment shapes song structure, and thus reliably indicate male developmental history and genetic quality.  Work with females asks how preferences for certain types of song develop, specifically with respect to learning as compared to inherent biases for high-performance songs.   Young female swamp sparrows will be reared in the laboratory, exposed to male songs, and presented with video images of adult females giving mating displays to some of these songs.  Prior work indicates that reared females learn to produce their own displays as a result this rearing methodology.  Young females will then be tested for the relative roles of song quality and rearing experience in the development of their mate preferences.  This project will provide new insights into the importance of experience and learning during the development of communication signals, both in their production and perception.  This project includes extensive training and participation of undergraduate and high-school students.</AbstractNarration>
