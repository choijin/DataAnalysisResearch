<AbstractNarration>In this project the principal investigator will be continue his studies in dynamics with a particular emphasis on partially hyperbolic dynamical systems. Partial hyperbolicity has seen great progress in the last decade after the breakthrough work of Pugh and Shub, who established ergodicity for volume-preserving perturbations of the time-one map of the geodesic flow of a surface of constant negative curvature. A series of papers, culminating in work of the principal investigator with Wilkinson, has established ergodicity for a very general class of volume-preserving partially hyperbolic systems. These results appear to have pushed current techniques to their limit, but still fall short of providing a complete understanding of when volume-preserving partially hyperbolic systems are ergodic: new ideas are needed. This project will pursue such fresh lines of attack on this question.  It will also consider various dynamical systems of a geometrical nature that exhibit hyperbolic behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partially hyperbolic dynamical systems are important because they model significant phenomena that occur in nature and because the mathematical tools for understanding such systems are by now well developed. For example, there is now a good understanding of how partial hyperbolicity gives rise to highly chaotic behavior. Researchers also possess a rich set of concrete examples in which it is possible to understand completely the mechanisms that create the partially hyperbolic behavior. In the long run, improving this knowledge, as this project hopes to do, could have important implications for science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

On the sphere the geodesics are the great circles. In a curved surface or manifold (the analogue of a surface in higher dimensions) geodesics can behave in surprisingly complex ways. A famous result (of Anosov in the 1960s) is that the typical geodesic in a closed manifold with the negative curvature passes close to all points in all possible directions.   Anosov?s proof makes crucial use of uniform bounds on various geometric qualities that are important in the proof.   There are natural examples of manifolds with negative curvature that occur in the branch of mathematics known as Teichmueller theory. These are (up to some irrelevant details) the moduli spaces of surfaces with the Weil-Petersson metric. It has been expected since the 1980s that Anosov?s result should apply to these examples. However Anosov?s proof cannot be used directly, because the important geometric quantities are  not bounded. It is, however, possible to extend Anosov?s argument if one replace the uniform bounds by suitable estimates of how the quantities become unbounded. This was achieved in joint work with Howard Masur and Amie Wilkinson.   The Weil-Petersson metric on the moduli space is a fundamental object of study in Teichmueller theory and our result sheds new light on its properties.  The above is the main achievement of the research conducted with the support of the grant. Other results related to the behavior of geodesics in manifolds with negative curvature were also obtained.                Last Modified: 12/31/2016       Submitted by: Keith Burns]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
