<AbstractNarration>The presence of ice ponds from surface melting of glacial ice can be a significant threshold in assessing  the  stability of ice sheets, and their overall response to a warming climate. Snow melt has a much reduced albedo, leading to additional seasonal melting from warming insolation. Water run-off not only contributes to the mass loss of ice sheets directly, but  meltwater reaching the glacial ice bed may lubricate faster flow of ice sheets towards the ocean. Surficial meltwater may also reach the grounding lines of glacial ice through the wedging open of existing crevasses. The occurrence and amount of meltwater refreeze has even been suggested as a paleo proxy of near-surface atmospheric temperature regimes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using contemporary remote sensing (microwave) satellite assessment of surface melt occurrence and extent, the predictive skill of regional meteorological models  and reanalyses (e.g. WRF, ERA-Interim) to describe the synoptic conditions favourable to surficial melt is to be investigated. Statistical approaches and pattern recognition techniques are argued to provide a context for projecting future ice sheet change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC AR4) commented on our lack of understanding of ice-sheet mass balance processes in polar regions and the potential for sea-level change. The IPPC suggested that the forthcoming AR5 efforts highlight regional cryosphere modeling efforts, such as is proposed here.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Surface melting on polar ice sheets and ice shelves is an important physical process and sensitive climate indicator for these normally frozen regions. This project aimed to learn more about Antarctic surface melting and its relationship to meteorology and climate, then apply that knowledge to estimating potential future changes in melting.  The best observations of surface melting come from passive microwave instruments on polar-orbiting satellites.  These records are available from mid-1979 to present with daily observations from 1988 onward.  Figure 1 shows examples of melt occurrence (number of days with detected melt as a percentage of the total number of days), each for the southern hemisphere mid-summer month of January.  The central large map shows the 20-year period  1981-2000:  melt is quite frequent at the north end of the warmer Antarctic Peninsula (upper left corner) but relatively rare on the colder continent. The four smaller maps show examples of low (1988) to higher melt (1992 was an exceptional year during this 20-year period).  These observational records provide our reference for when surface melting occurs and our goal was to determine what aspects of meteorology and climate were behind it.  Figure 1 also shows that latitude and elevation by themselves provide some basic information about where to expect melt, on average.  Lower latitudes (farther north) and elevations (the large interior regions in purple are low-lying ice shelves) predict melt occurrence reasonably well over longer time periods.  But to learn more about timing and other key characteristics of melting, we need atmospheric circulation models to tell us about temperatures, winds and other influences on melting. To get higher spatial resolution and higher skill in polar regions, we used a regional forecast model known as Polar WRF.  Regional models like Polar WRF need global data to tell the model about their surroundings.  Such global data for recent decades (1979-present) came from a dataset known as ERA-Interim and Global Climate Models (GCMs). The latter also provided predictive data for possible future climate scenarios.  For GCM-based Polar WRF model runs, we first needed to know how well the GCMs worked in the Antarctic so that we could focus on the best GCMs.  Figure 2 shows one approach to this question: differences between GCMs and the ERA-Interim reference data, as 20-year averages. Model?s temperature differences cover a broad range encompassing notably warm and cold as well as a variety of spatial differences. For example, warm anomalies come mostly from warm continents but the oceans contribute as well in some cases.  These comparisons also provide information about intermodel variability, i.e., how much uncertainty in model predictions is due to choosing between different models.  Another aspect of understanding predictions is intramodel, or inherent uncertainty, or how much do predictions from a single model vary due to how it implements its model of the real world.  Figure 3 shows an example of this with the CESM Large Ensemble (Kay et al., 2015), a set of 30 runs of the GCM CESM 1.0 using slightly different initial conditions.  Although ensemble members show small differences relative to the ensemble average at upper left when spatially averaged, there are potentially significant larger differences over numerous spatially extensive regions.  As noted above, a major part of the project was focused on running Polar WRF with ERA-Interim and GCMs (in practice, limited to CCSM4 and MRI-CGCM3) to create higher resolution meteorological datasets for selected summer months, recent and future.  Results from this work supported new climatologies of both historical and future climate scenarios, analyses of the benefits of using a polar-focused regional model versus the global models, comparisons of climate changes over time (historical versus late 21st century), and our work to calibrate surface melting events to meteorology.  Main Outcomes  PI gained significant experience in working with the Polar WRF regional forecast model in  high-performance computing environments (at NCAR, the University of Colorado-Boulder, and the Wyoming Supercomputing Center), including developing methods for converting GCM datasets to Polar WRF format.  Preliminary calibrations of meteorological conditions to surface melting were completed through a small number of melting event case studies, for example, the extensive melting during December 1991 and January 1992 on the Ross Ice Shelf.  New analyses of both intermodel and intramodel GCM uncertainties were developed using both traditional methods from climatology and a new approach based in artificial neural networks (self-organizing maps).  The intramodel analysis examined 19 different (though not entirely independent) GCMs from the CMIP5 archive.  The intermodel analysis looked at 30 instances of one GCM from the CESM Large Ensemble.  New high-resolution (time and space) Polar WRF datasets with (a) ERA-Interim (December/January, 1981-2000), (b) the GCM CCSM4 (December/January 1991-2000, 2049-2059 and 2089-2099), and (c) the GCM MRI-CGCM3 (January 1990-1999 and 2090-2099).  Future runs used the IPCC?s RCP 8.5 high emissions scenario.  Multiple presentations at national and international conferences and workshops.
