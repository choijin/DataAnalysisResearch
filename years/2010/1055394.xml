<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to establish Integrated Nanomanufacturing and Nanoinformatics (INN) as a core academic discipline for quality improvement in nanomanufacturing (NM). This CAREER project will create (i) a body of knowledge regarding the system-level modeling and control of multiscale process variations in NM; and (ii) an INN program and curricula to educate a new generation of NM engineers with a concentration on quality control. The multiscale process variations present unique modeling and control challenges for NM. The research will address these challenges by defining the system-level modeling and control issues and developing multiscale physical-statistical modeling approaches to couple the process models across scales for consistent prediction and control. The methodology will be validated by improving the manufacturing processes of nanowire-based solar photovoltaics and polymer nanocomposites. The integrated education efforts will lead to the creation of an INN program and curricula.  A national and international INN collaboration network will be established to achieve excellence in education and to train a globally engaged NM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide technologies and tools to transform the quality and productivity in NM so as to broaden nanotechnology's impact on the society. Specifically, the research will assist to overcome the NM bottleneck by improving nanostructure (nanowire and nanocomposites) uniformity and process yield with energy applications in photovoltaics and polymer nanocomposites. The results will be disseminated to allow quality control in cost-effective NM.  The educational activities aim to enhance the U.S.' competitive edge in NM. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through the new INN curriculum and involvement in the research. Research and educational infrastructure for INN program will be enhanced and developed. K-12 outreach and involvement of underrepresented groups will promote the engineering career in NM for broader impact.</AbstractNarration>

It can generate profound impacts on health, wealth, and national security.

This CAREER project aims to create a body of knowledge regarding the system-level modeling and control of process variations in NM; and an education curricula to educate a new generation of NM engineers with a concentration on quality control.  The research outcomes regarding quality control methods involve the following aspects:  Scalable and robust process modeling under uncertainties: Scalable NM models ensure model validity when a process is scaled up by size, quantity, throughput or yield; and ensure robustness of process outputs when a process operates under uncertainties. We establish modeling methods to achieve both scalability and robustness.  Scale-up process modeling and experimental design for processes across multiple physical domains: NM processes can operate under different physical domains, which results in complications in experimental investigation and modeling. To predict behaviors of NM processes under different domains, we devise an efficient experimental design and modeling approaches by identifying model structures in low-dimensional space.   2D nanostructure growth process modeling and control: Nanomaterials such as graphene represents an exciting new class of 2D nanomaterials. We established a novel stochastic modeling approach for controllable manufacturing of 2D nanostructures under uncertainties. A new modeling methodology for NM process modeling under large uncertainties: We devised a cross-domain model building and validation (CDMV) method, a modeling strategy beyond the existing physical, statistical, and physical-statistical modeling methods, to accommodate NM scenarios characterized by extremely limited data and physical knowledge.   The developed methodologies cover experimental design for scalable NM experimentation and data collection and scale-up process modeling under various uncertainties. The methodologies are applicable to manufacturing of zero-dimensional (0D), 1D, and 2D nanomaterials.  Regarding educational outcomes, a curriculum of integrated NM and nanoinformatics has been developed with a new course added into existing curricula. Three PhD students were partially supported on the project and two of them graduated with dissertation topics on nanomanufacturing.
