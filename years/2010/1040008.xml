<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Bart Bartlett and colleagues Vincent Pecoraro, Wei Lu, Nicolai Lehnert and Stephen Maldonado from University of Michigan will acquire a very specialized superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) capable of performing both DC (direct current-static) and AC (alternating current-dynamic) magnetometry for measurements of magnetic moments. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as spin structure of transition metal oxides, Hall resistivity measurements in thin film semiconductors, high-spin molecules for information storage, electronic structure of enzymes functional in nitric oxide (NO) reduction, and charge ordering within battery cathode materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A SQUID magnetometer is critical for studying magnetic moments of molecules that have unpaired electrons, particularly for weakly magnetic/small moment samples. The large magnetic field generated by a magnet in the instrument interacts with these unpaired electrons in the various materials under study. In a DC magnetization measurement, one measures the magnetic moment as a function of applied DC magnetic field (and/or temperature). Using DC magnetization experiments, one can determine magnetic moments or a hysteresis curve, or identify magnetic phase transitions. This type of magnetometer also can be used to carry on measurements using a direct current. Magnetism is instrumental in many fields including data transfer in computation devices, biological systems and to understand magnetic processes in inorganic and bioinorganic materials. This instrument will be used in research and for training of the new generation of students in this important field.</AbstractNarration>
