<AbstractNarration>Researchers throughout the social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences use data to test hypotheses about a wide range of individual and social behaviors, decisions, and outcomes.  Government statistical agencies regularly collect data that are extremely valuable for this purpose.  However, these data are not made directly available to the research community because the data providers' (responents') identity is part of the data itself.  Therefore statistical agencies and the scientific community have been developing methods to make analytically valid and highly detailed data available to researchers while simultaneously protecting individual privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A particularly valuable and sensitive kind of data is linked administrative data such as the Longitudinal Employer-Household Data (LEHD), the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) and surveys with linked administrative data (SIPP).  These datasets have been constructed with support from statistical agencies and the NSF.  The highly detailed nature of these data make them particularly sensitive, and access to the micro-data remains restriced.  One approach for balancing the tension between confientiality protection and access is the generation of synthetic data.  The process for generating such data begins by estimating a posterior predictive distribution (PPD) of the to-be-released data given the confidential micro-data.  The next step is to draw samples from the PPD to produce the released micro-data.  The quality of inferences based on a wide variety of models applied to synthetic and actual data has been indaquately assessed to date because only a limited number of users have had access to both data sources.  This kind of assessment needs to be integrated within a quality-feedback loop in order to improve synthetic data and increase the use of the data by the research community.  This award facilitiates such a feedback loop for synthetic versions of two datasetss:  the Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation and the Longitudinal Business Database.  The goal is to broaden access to the data, enhance the feedback loop, and provide flexible and secure access to these synthetic data early releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of social scientists from a range of disciplines will be able to use this data access method and will provide detailed input that will guide future improvements in data quality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Designed to protect the confidentiality of the people and firms in the underlying confidential data, synthetic data are simulated data generated from statistical models.  The SyntheticData Server (SDS) was created to facilitate a feedback loop between users and producers of innovative synthetic, privacy-protected versions of confidential datasets. The Census BureauÆs SIPP Synthetic Beta (SSB) and Synthetic Longitudinal Business Database (SynLBD) are two such frequently used datasets.  Datasets made available As of March 2015, the SDS provides access to three datasets:      SSB  v5.1 (released in 2013)     SSB  v6.0 (2015)    SynLBD  v2.0 (2011).     Information on available data is maintained at http://vrdc.cornell.edu/sds.  Access requests are reviewed for feasibility only. Users access typical statistical software (SAS, Stata, R, and others), only restricted by the software available on the Census Bureau's validation servers.  Usage and impact Account growth has been steady (Figure A). As of 2015 Q4, 186 accounts had been created on the server. The rate of account requests increased subsequent to conference presentations or after specific events, such as the 2014 workshop described below.  Feedback loop Both current data providers have incorporated feedback from users into their data products. The SSB was itself the second public iteration, after the original release of v4.0. Feedback lead to the incorporation of additional variables in v5.1, and subsequently to further enhancements in v6.0. Only one iteration of the SynLBD has so far been released on the SDS, but key shortcomings identified by (potential) users of the SynLBD v2.0 - absence of North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, of geographic detail, and of indicators of firm structure - are actively being worked on. Out of 100 applications for access to the SynLBD received through 2015-08-10, 21 were denied because they were not feasible using the synthetic data (this does not take into account applications that were partially feasible, which were generally approved). Of those denied,  6 (28.57%) had requested firm-level variables,  11 (52.38%) had requested data to perform conditional geographic analysis, and 1 (4.76%) had requested data for specific NAICS industries.  Validation requests The data are by their nature  and users are discouraged from using results based solely on the synthetic data. Validation requests are encouraged and free, subject to following certain rules, outlined on the data providers' websites.  may be as short as one week. A  complete analysis of validation requests can be found in a forthcoming publication.  Prior and subsequent experience in the Census RDC One of the (initially) unintended consequences was the use of the SDS as a gateway to  in-depth use of confidential data, in  data available through theFederal Statistical Research Data Center (FSRDC). Figure B describes the access history - before and after access to the SDS.Of 106 users (as of October 2014), 14 were Census internal users,20 other users were also present in some form in the Census RDC system. 11 users had been authorized for at least one RDC project prior to their access to the SDS. 3 users obtained Census RDC access after their initial access to the SDS, and an additional 6 users were still waiting for the approval of their RDC project, on average 516 days after having started their SDS project. We don't have firm evidence of the relationship between the RDC projects and the SDS project, but from personal conversations of the authors with presenters at RDC conferences, at  some of the RDC projects were direct continuations of SDS projects.  Other activities Sessions on "Synthetic establishment microdata" were organized at the 2013 and 2015 World Statistics Congress. Papers from the 2013 session can be found at the and were published in the June 2014 open-access issue of the Statistical Journal of the IAOS, available athttps://madmimi.com/s/ae1dd4.
