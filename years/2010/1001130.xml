<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of researchers participating in the conference "Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equations," which will be held on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln campus on April 17 and 18, 2010. Most of the funding will be directed to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, but certain senior participants will be funded as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will cover a wide range of topics, touching upon virtually all the active areas in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. The conference is being held in conjunction with the annual Howard Rowlee Lecture. The 2010 Rowlee lecturer is Carlos Kenig, whose research interests furnish the unifying theme for the conference. The format of the conference provides ample opportunity for young mathematicians to present their work and otherwise to participate fully in conference activities.</AbstractNarration>
