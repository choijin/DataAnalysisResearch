<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for U.S. participants in two programs on quantum information science in Sweden during the fall of 2010:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The scientific program on Quantum Information held at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics (NORDITA), Stockholm, Sweden, from 27 September to 29 October, 2010. (http://agenda.albanova.se/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=1434)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The program in Quantum Information Theory held at the Mittag-Leffler Mathematics Institute, Djursholm, Sweden, from 1 September to 15 December, 2010. (http://www.mittag-leffler.se/programs/future/1011f/)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both programs share involvement in a common central meeting, the "International Conference on Quantum Information and Computation," held 4-8 October 2010 at the Wenner-Gren Center, Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;br/&gt;(http://agenda.albanova.se/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=1440)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support under this travel grant is targeted to young U.S. scientists, enabling them to make important contacts in the international scientific community, and contributing to the training of the next generation of quantum information scientists.  For further information, please contact Dr. Mary Beth Ruskai, Tufts University [marybeth.ruskai@tufts.edu].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information science is the study of using quantum effects for computation, communication, and cryptography.  A quantum computer would be more powerful than existing ones; it could perform tasks which are not feasible with the classical computers of today.  Although building a quantum computer remains a formidable challenge, much progress has been made, and devices for new quantum methods of cryptography are now commercially available.  Quantum information science is an interdisciplinary field, whose participants range from experimentalists working on the physical implementation of quantum computers and other information processing devices to mathematicians working in abstract fields which have had unanticipated applications in quantum information theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quantum computer would threaten the security of commonly-used encryption protocols for tasks ranging from secure transmission of credit card numbers or medical records to transmission of information vital to national security.  It is essential that the U.S. remain a leader in this rapidly developing field.  This grant will facilitate the participation of U.S. scientists in important international research programs on quantum information theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[              Quantum information science is the study of using quantum effects for computation, communication and cryptography.  A quantum computer would be more powerful than existing ones; it could perform tasks which are not feasible with the classical computers of today, which are reaching their limits.  Although building a quantum computer remains a formidable challenge, much progress has been made and devices for new quantum methods of cryptography are now commercially available.   Quantum information theory is an extremely interdisciplinary field whose participants range from experimentalists working on the physical implementation of quantum computers and other information processing devices to mathematicians working in abstract fields which have had unanticipated applications in quantum information theory.      A quantum computer would threaten the security of commonly used encryption protocols for tasks ranging from secure transmission of credit card numbers or medical records to transmission of information vital to national security.   It is essential that the US remain a leader in this rapidly developing field.  Other countries including Canada, Japan, China, Singapore and the members of the EU have established major research centers with substantial funding.        This grant enabled 13 US scientists to participate in an international conference on quantum information theory in Stockholm in October, 2010.  Of these,  5 were recent PhD's, 3 were graduate students, and 5 were senior faculty involved with undergraduate research at RUI institutions.   Three of the recipients also participated in longer programs at Nordita and the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Stockholm.  This conference was selected for support because it covered the full spectrum of both theoretical and experimental quantum information science and because it facilitated interactions with participants in the programs at Nordita and the Mittag-Leffler in fall, 2010.      Only 20 of the 180 registered participants for this conference were from the US.   These 20 include two (Charles Bennett from IBM and  John Martinis from UCSB) of the ten invited plenary speakers.  Most of the other 5 US participants were already in Stockholm for the programs at Nordita and/or Mittag-Leffler.   Thus, this grant played a critical role in facilitating participation by US scientists in this international conference in a critical area.
