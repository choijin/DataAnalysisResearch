<AbstractNarration>This project is funded as an EArly-concept Grant For Exploratory Research (EAGER).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rapid Climate Change-Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heat Flux Array (RAPID-MOCHA) began monitoring meridional mass transports in the North Atlantic Ocean along a transatlantic section from North America to Africa in 2004. It estimates the climatically critical meridional overturning circulation (MOC) by differencing dynamic height profiles gathered from small clusters of moorings on either side of the Atlantic basin, measuring boundary current flows with current meters, measuring transport in the Florida Strait electrically, and using satellite winds to estimate Ekman transport. While bottom pressure gauges are used to estimate time-varying barotropic contributions, RAPID-MOCHA relies on an assumed spatially uniform temporally constant barotropic flow to estimate mean transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first scientific use of the newly developed full-ocean-depth (surface to 6 km) autonomous underwater glider, Deepglider will complement the RAPID-MOCHA array. Deepgliders will be used to estimate absolute transports independently of RAPID-MOCHA by collecting repeat hydrographic sections of the extended western boundary region off Abaco, Bahamas. A pair of vehicles will repeatedly transit across 100 and 500 km wide overlapping sections between end members of the RAPID-MOCHA dynamic height moorings. These sections will be repeated about weekly and monthly, respectively, by Deepgliders, providing substantial spatial resolution compared to that provided by the moorings, although at considerably coarser temporal resolution. Each Deepglider is expected to last well over 1 year, possibly up to about 18 months. Integrated geostrophic shear inferred from horizontal density gradients resolved in the sections will be referenced to depth-averaged current inferred from each glider dive cycle. The difference between dead-reckoned glider displacement through the water and GPS displacement over the ground is used to estimate depth-averaged current. The Deepglider estimates will include the likely possibility of horizontally varying time-mean barotropic contributions to transport. The independent Deepglider estimates of transports will be compared to those from the RAPIDMOCHA array. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Deepgliders temporarily will be used in 'virtual mooring' mode to check the adequacy of the moorings in measuring dynamic height. Together, the complement of repeat section and moored time series will be used to assess errors and improve estimates of meridional transports in the extended western boundary region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this work lies in its connections to basic issues of global climate dynamics. The variability of the MOC is not well observed, let alone understood. The same can be said for the deep flow. Comparison of techniques by which the MOC is monitored is essential to establish their credibility and effectiveness. Deepglider repeat hydrography will provide independent measures of climatically critical ocean circulation transports, the western boundary contributions to MOC. Resolution of the temporal/spatial structure of western boundary currents is prerequisite to understanding how this portion of the climate system operates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project will serve as a demonstration of efficacy and economy of full-depth gliders in monitoring ocean circulation not only along the RAPID-MOCHA line, but also along other transects. It will pioneer the use of autonomous gliders to monitor not only the upper ocean, but its deep regions as well. Currently Argo floats monitor the upper ocean globally, but the deep ocean is severely under-observed for climate change, a situation Deepgliders could alter. By making deep ocean access affordable, the Deepglider technology opens the possibility that the complete extent of global ocean climate change may be observed.</AbstractNarration>
