<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Proteins embedded in the lipid membranes that surround cells control the interaction of cells with their environment. They transport molecules in and out of cells and transmit messages between the external environment and the interior of the cell. However, there is much that is not known about how membrane protein structure allows them to carry out these functions. A key to answer this question is to understand the behavior of transmembrane (TM) helices, the predominant structure found in the membrane-embedded portion of membrane proteins. TM helices are helical sequences of amino acids that cross from one side of the membrane to the other. The goal of this proposal is to determine how the amino acid sequence of TM helices and the chemical composition of the lipids in a membrane control the ability of TM helices to interconvert between different structural and functional states. In particular, how amino acid sequence and lipid composition affect the position of a TM helix in membranes, and how TM helix position within the membrane alters function will be examined. To do this, the project will define amino acid mutations of TM helices that alter the position of TM helices within a membrane in a controllable fashion. Fluorescence methods, developed in previous studies, will then be used to measure the position of TM helices in a membrane. The behavior of artificial TM helices, in which carefully controlled sequences can answer precise questions concerning the sequence/structure relationship, will be studied in artificial lipid membranes in which lipid composition and other environmental conditions can be varied. In addition, TM helices with the amino acid sequences found in natural membrane proteins will be studied, in conjunction with the corresponding intact membrane proteins, in order to demonstrate how the knowledge gained can be used to define the relationship between TM helix positioning and function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;This project will have a broad impact on career development of future scientists, including minority students, at the educational level by training both graduate and undergraduate students (including via contacts with other local institutions) in the conduct of research, fluorescence principles, and membrane structure and function. Training in the unique fluorescence quenching approaches used in the lab would aid dissemination of these techniques by these students after they graduate and apply them in their future careers. By defining strategies other labs can use to approach the relationship of membrane protein helix structure to function there would also be a broad impact upon bioremediation of toxic compounds by plants and bacteria (which involves membrane protein transporters), biomaterials applications (in which membrane proteins are being studied as hypersensitive biosensors) and bioelectronics applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         Cells are surrounded by a membrane composed of specialized fats (membrane lipids) in which are incorporated proteins that carry out various functions required to maintain the life of the cell.  In this project we studied both how the differences in the chemical structure of different types of lipids found in cells affect the structure and function of membrane proteins, and how the type of the amino acids of which membrane proteins are composed affect the structure of a protein in a membrane (and thus its function).   We found that altering the amino acid composition of a membrane protein could alter its function significantly, including control of the size of pores that a protein can make within a membrane and the location of a protein within membranes.  This includes the ability to control the affinity of a membrane protein for membrane regions that have a different composition from the remainder of the membrane in terms of lipid structure (for example, whether a protein binds to membrane regions with a high concentration of saturated lipids and cholesterol).  In other studies, we found that membrane proteins are not only affected by the structure of membrane lipids, but also by the difference in the chemical structure of lipids within the inner and outer halves of a membrane.  This study showed that the natural arrangement of lipids within the inner and outer halves of a membrane could greatly alter the structure of a membrane protein.  The studies in this report were largely carried out by graduate students, whose training in the membrane research was supported by this project.   The results of the report were disseminated to the scientific community through public seminars and publications in professional journals.
