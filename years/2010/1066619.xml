<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel cryopreservation technique for zebrafish oocytes. The zebrafish is a valuable model system for human diseases and other research areas such as embryogenesis, organ development, and aging. Successful cryopreservation of zebrafish oocytes or embryos is urgently needed to maintain exponentially growing numbers of mutant and transgenic lines. Successful banking of zebrafish gametes or embryos would not only significantly reduce costs, but also avoid risks of infection and genetic drift associated with continuous breeding. Furthermore, development of a successful cryopreservation technique for zebrafish oocytes would be a major stepping-stone towards conservation of other fish species, many of which are rapidly declining. Cryopreservation of fish sperm is currently practiced albeit with limited success, whereas fish embryos remain non-freezable due to several major obstacles such as their large size and multi-compartmental structure, extremely low membrane permeability to water and cryoprotective chemicals, and susceptibility to chilling injury and intracellular ice formation. To circumvent these obstacles, this project proposes to cryopreserve unfertilized zebrafish oocytes using a multidisciplinary approach. This proposal predicts that zebrafish oocytes will be more amenable to cryopreservation than embryos, based on their smaller size, much simpler single-cell structure, and higher permeability and tolerance to cryoprotectants.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This project is significant and innovative because it proposes to tackle a fundamental scientific problem (i.e., cryopreservation of fish oocytes) by combining engineering (e.g., modeling membrane permeability and intracellular ice formation, mathematical and experimental optimization of CPA loading/removal and cooling profiles) and cell/molecular biology approaches (e.g., molecular manipulation of the membrane transport). The proposed mechanistic approach is novel and inspired by adaptation schemes observed in nature (e.g., survival strategies by organisms such as frogs, tardigrades, brine shrimp, bacteria, and yeast, which are able to adapt to extreme conditions including freezing and desiccation); a key adaptation is the accumulation of intra- and extracellular sugars. Recent studies have demonstrated beneficial effect of sugars during cryopreservation and desiccation of mammalian cells, whereas the membrane permeability barrier to sugars must be overcome for this strategy to be effective. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the combination of sugars with low concentrations of conventional penetrating cryoprotectants can compensate for the low permeation of the former wile reducing the cytotoxicity of the latter. Thus, the central hypothesis of this project is that combination of intra- and extracellular sugars with small amounts of a penetrating cryoprotectant will protect zebrafish oocytes against freezing-associated stresses. Using engineering models of mass transport and non-equilibrium phase transformation, in combination with molecular biology techniques, this proposal will test the central hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: (1) test the working hypothesis that osmotic limitations of zebrafish oocytes can be overcome by a multi-disciplinary strategy including biological, physico-chemical, and engineering approaches; (2) test working hypothesis that an optimized combination of intra- and extracellular sugars with a penetrating CPA permits successful cryopreservation of zebrafish oocytes; (3) test working hypothesis that to maximize viability, zebrafish oocytes should be cooled as rapidly as possible without causing formation of deleterious intracellular ice crystals. The interdisciplinary approach proposed here is expected to overcome the obstacles associated with cryopreservation of zebrafish germplasm, and lead to significant advances towards successful cryopreservation of zebrafish oocytes. The proposed work is also expected to lead to advances in the state-of-the-art of bioheat/mass-transfer modeling of cryobiological phenomena, and in computer-aided optimization of biothermal process design.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed research will be attained by: (1) educational outreach activities in local high schools using zebrafish as a teaching tool to awaken curiosity/interest among the students in science and technology; (2) developing teaching materials for K-12 as well as undergraduate bioengineering students; (3) creating a summer research program for high school students; (4) training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The proposed outreach activities are expected to broaden and strengthen the ongoing partnership of the Medical College of Georgia with local high school and communities. The proposed development of educational materials and course modules will enhance the bioengineering curriculum at Villanova University and beyond.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Zebrafish are a highly valuable and powerful animal model for basic research on molecular genetics, vertebrate embryogenesis, organ development, and various human diseases.  The number of mutant and transgenic lines of zebrafish created for such research currently exceeds 25,000 and has been growing exponentially over the past decade.  However, the cost of maintaining these diverse genetic strains by continuous breeding of live fish is quickly becoming prohibitive (due to the required labor, supplies, and demands on research space for aquaria).  Worse, the risk of losing unique fish lines due to disease or natural genetic drift is great when continuous breeding is used.  In principle, these problems can be overcome by maintaining repositories of fish embryos or oocytes (roe) in cryogenic storage, which may then be thawed and used to restore fish lines as required.  Unfortunately, to date, no adequate method for cryopreservation of zebrafish oocytes or embryos is known, because these cell types are unusually susceptible to cryoinjury.  In most cell types (including oocytes and embryos) from other animal species, intracellular ice formation has been identified as one of the major mechanisms of cell damage during freezing, and circumventing intracellular freezing is an effective approach to successful cryopreservation.  To date, however, there are no published investigations of intracellular ice formation in zebrafish oocytes, and only a few studies of intracellular freezing in zebrafish embryos.   The long-range goal of the principal investigator?s research program is to develop successful cryopreservation techniques for zebrafish oocytes and embryos.  In the funded project, experiments were completed to elucidate the key mechanisms of damage during cryopreservation of oocytes and embryos of the zebrafish, and to characterize the process of intracellular ice formation in these systems.  The research team used a unique high-speed video cryomicroscopy system to capture video recordings of intracellular ice formation events that are literally faster than the blink of an eye, and also identified other important damage mechanisms by analyzing the resulting captured images.  Specific findings resulting from this research include evidence for several hitherto-unknown mechanisms of damage to zebrafish oocytes and embryos during the cryopreservation process. For example, zebrafish embryos were found to be extremely sensitive to mechanical damage resulting from contact with surrounding ice crystals, whereas the unfertilized oocytes were not susceptible to this mode of cryoinjury.  On the other hand, video evidence suggests that mature zebrafish oocytes are adversely affected by exposure to lowered temperatures even above the freezing point, with degradation manifesting in the form of a granular substance that is released from the cell membrane after the oocyte is rewarmed from cold exposure.  This form of chilling sensitivity represents a previously unrecognized obstacle to the successful cryopreservation of mature zebrafish oocytes.  During rapid freezing to subzero temperatures, the response of zebrafish embryos is significantly more complex than what is commonly seen in mammalian embryos or in somatic cells.  In particular, the research team discovered up to 16 distinct events that occurred upon contact between the embryo and the extracellular ice.  Identification of this sequence of events paves the way for further characterization of the response of zebrafish embryos to freezing, towards the goal of fully elucidating the mechanisms of cryoinjury.  Analysis of cryomicroscopy videos of mature zebrafish oocytes during freezing revealed that intracellular ice formation manifested as a sudden increase in opacity of the egg.  The temperature at which intracellular ice appeared was not sensitive to the rate of cooling. This was an unexpected result, because it suggests that the intracellular ice formation process is not modulated by cell dehydration, even at cooling rates as low as 0.01 K/s.  Conversely, the characteristic temperature of intracellular ice formation was observed to increase in oocytes that had been maintained in vitro for more than 40 min, suggesting that these oocytes were more susceptible to cryoinjury.  This indicates that rapid processing of the harvested roe may be an important factor to ensure successful cryopreservation of the oocytes.  The insights and data gained from this research project represent an important first step towards the development of effective cryopreservation technology for oocytes and embryos of zebrafish and other aquatic species.  Advances made possible by this work is expected to have benefits for biomedical research, commercial aquaculture, and conservation of endangered fish species.
