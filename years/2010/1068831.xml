<AbstractNarration>The research goal of this award is the parallel development of theoretical and computational methods for modeling and analyzing the collective behavior of arrays of Spin Torque Nano-Oscillators (STNOs). These types of nano-oscillators consist of at least two layers of ferromagnetic materials separated by a nonmagnetic metal layer. A spin-polarized current applied through the layers can facilitate a local torque, thus exciting steady oscillations and small microwave voltage signals. The research will result in general methods to study complex systems in science and engineering, and, in particular, to model, design and fabricate arrays of STNOs with larger microwave power output. The research approach progresses from the analysis of the underlying bifurcations that lead to synchronized oscillations to the design and fabrication of a nano-scale microwave signal generator. Deliverables include modeling and bifurcation analysis tools, hardware prototype, research reports, math and engineering research experience and education for students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project have the potential to lead to the fabrication of a nano-scale microwave signal generator that should be tuneable over a broad frequency band, about 40 GHz. Such frequency range will render the microwave device ideal for many applications, including telecommunications ( e.g., wireless systems), radar( e.g. air traffic control, weather forecasting),  antennas and navigation systems. The theoretical foundation for fabricating such device lies on the conjecture by various research groups that a possible solution to increase microwave power output is to synchronize several STNOs so that a coherent signal with a common frequency and phase can be extracted from the ensemble. Graduate and undergraduate engineering, math, and physics students, will be recruited for classroom instruction and to participate in research activities. Dissemination and outreach activities at various venues will be conducted.</AbstractNarration>

Our main objective was to conduct transformative research to close the gap between theory and device realization of a nano-scale microwave signal generator with power output, at least, in the order of micro-watts and broad frequency tuning.   The system under investigation consists of 1D arrays of nano-oscillators, one connected in series and one in parallel. In future work we may also plan to consider 2D arrays. To model and analyze the behavior of the governing equations, the PI and several graduate students from the M.S. program in Applied Mathematics and the Ph.D. program in Computational Science and Engineering at San Diego State University, conducted several analytical and computational tasks. In particular, we investigated the following Fundamental Issues:   (i) Study the underlying bifurcations that lead to the formation of different coherent states, in particular complete synchronization of oscillations, and conditions for their existence and stability.   (ii) Investigate how the microwave impedance of arrays of STNOs is influenced by the contin- uous component of the spin-torque dynamics and the discrete topology of connections.   (iii) Formulate appropriate design rules for fabricating robust, 1D and 2D, multi-layers of STNOs. In particular, it is important to study the effects of thermal and material fluctuations in microwave power output as well as the effects of delays in the coupling circuitry.      Accomplishments     On the first year of the project, we derived the equations that govern the dynamics of 1D arrays of N STNOs. Two cases were considered. One where the STNOs are connected in series and one where the connection is in parallel. For each case, a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) was derived. Each STNO was found to be modeled a 3D system of ODEs so the entire array had dimensions 3N-D. Then the model equations were reduced to 2N-D via stereographic projections. In the following years, computer simulations and bifurcation analysis of the dynamics were carried out by various SDSU students: Katie Beauvais, M.S. student in Computational Sciences, Richard Shaffer, M.S. student in Applied Mathematics and James Turtle, PhD student in the Computational Sciences program.
