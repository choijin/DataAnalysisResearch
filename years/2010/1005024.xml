<AbstractNarration>This proposal will fund the REU program associated with the Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium (KNAC). KNAC is a group of eight liberal arts colleges with astronomy programs that have collaborated since 1990. The consortium was formed to enhance the research opportunities for undergraduates at institutions where astronomy was taught, but where research opportunities are limited. Ten undergraduates per year take part in the summer research program that runs for ten weeks. Some (2-4) of the program slots are reserved for students from outside the consortium. Near the end of the program each supported students participate in a Student Symposium that is attended by the entire faculty in the consortium. The students give a 10-min talk on their research and produce poster presentations. Additionally the students write a 4-page paper on their projects and submit it to the Proceedings of the Undergraduate Research Symposium which is distributed throughout the astronomy community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very nature of an REU site results in a broader impact, in terms of educational activities. In this case the consortium works as a model for other small colleges to show how a regional partnership can overcome issues of size. Since 1990 just over 50% of the student participants have been female. The consortium members pledge to continue their efforts to attract more members of underrepresented groups to the program. The member schools also recruit participants from schools in the northeast where there are no opportunities for astronomy research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium (KNAC) has successfully run its summer research program for undergraduates since 1991, serving over 300 students, many of whom have gone on to successful careers in science-related fields. The primary elements of the program have not changed over time and include a summer research experience of 10 weeks for selected undergraduates, working with a faculty member at one our eight institutions (Colgate, Haverford/Bryn Mawr, Middlebury, Swarthmore, Vassar, Wellesley, Wesleyan and Williams),. This leads to the publication of a research-style paper in the Proceedings of the Undergraduate Research Symposium (URS), sponsored by KNAC. It also leads to an oral paper presented at the annual URS, attended by over 100 faculty and students. In addition, the consortium hosts an annual consortium faculty meeting for professional development and assessing the undergraduate program.</p> <p>One of our goals has been to increase the representation of women and minority students in the physical sciences and we have typically had a much higher percentage of each enrolled in our summer program than is represented in our profession. The images attached here show REU students who attended and presented their research results at our 2015 Symposium, held on October 17, 2015, at Williams College. One of the 2015 summer students, Aylin Garcia-Soto of Wesleyan, also presented her work as a poster paper at the 228th meeting of the American Astronomical Society on June, 2016, in San Diego, CA.</p> <p>This summer we had 9 students engaged in work at Wellesley, Colgate, Wesleyan, Vassar and Middlebury Colleges. The 9 were selected from a strong applicant pool of 103 students. NSF funding has been vital over the years to creating these extraordinary opportunities for undergraduate students to learn first-hand about research in the sciences. In our increasingly technological society there is a need for much more understanding of science in general and there is no better way than by doing science to learn what it is about. Many of our students go on to graduate school in astronomy, physics or related fields. Almost all of them continue to use their science education in their careers. A scientifically knowledgable and competent citizenry is a critical component to the success of our nation in today's world. The REU program is essential to that goal and the KNAC program has been a leader in this area for more than a quarter of a century. We are extremely grateful to the NSF for their continued support of this critical enterprise.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/27/2016<br>      Modified by: William&nbsp;Herbst</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1005024/1005024_10041601_1474991026611_IMG_5065--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1005024/1005024_10041601_1474991026611_IMG_5065--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2015 KNAC REU Students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1005024/1005024_10041601_1474991026611_IMG_5065--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2015 KNAC REU Students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Summer research students supported by the NSF/REU grant.
