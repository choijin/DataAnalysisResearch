<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to study the relationship between homotopy theory and formal groups, and applications of homotopy theory to category theory.  The PI plans to study power operations for Morava E-theory, relating the algebra of such operations to the Bousfield-Kuhn functor, a construction which picks out invariants of a single chromatic layer of unstable homotopy theory.  The PI proposes to prove a a series of conjectures, which would lead to some new computational techniques, and would also draw interesting connections between unstable homotopy theory and the algebra of cohomology operations in Morava E-theory.  In addition, the PI will study certain models for higher category theory based on the ideas of homotopy theory.  Higher categories have recently been applied (through work of Hopkins, Lurie and others) to the classification of topological field theories.  The models the PI will study (called Theta-n spaces), are conjectured to be presentations for the theory of (infinity,n)-categories; a goal of this project is to prove this conjecture, and to extend these results to the setting of enriched higher category theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy theory is a branch of topology; it arose as the study of certain invariant properties of spaces, namely those left unchanged by continuous deformations.  The most powerful tools for studying such properties are what are called "cohomology theories".  Cohomology theories are illuminated by the theory of formal groups, which in turn are closely related to problems in algebraic number theory.  The first goal of this project is to understand this relationship, with the prospect of creating new computational tools.  A second goal is to understand how to use homotopy theory to shed light on higher category theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The results of this project contribute to the understanding of several aspects of homotopy theory, which is a branch of the mathematical discipline of topology.  Homotopy theory is the study of properties of abstract spaces which are unchanged by continuous deformations. Better understanding  such invariants has direct application to many problems in geometry.  Additionally, homotopy theory supplies the framework for higher category theory, which has emerged in recent years as a powerful set of tools for solving problems in a number of subdisciplines of mathematics.  This project provides in outline solutions to two  different problems in homotopy theory.  One part of this project proves a conjecture due to the PI about what is called unstable chromatic homotopy theory.   The results we obtain lead to new techniques for computing partial information about continuous maps between spheres with respect to continuous deformation.   In particular, these results exhibit a precise relationship between some phenomena of  unstable chromatic homotopy theory and certain algebraic invariants of formal groups.  This has already led to new advances in the calculation of unstable chromatic homotopy groups at height 2.  Another part of this project provides a model for higher categories, using the concept of Theta-n spaces which had been previously  introduced by the PI.  We are able to give a recursive characterization of "infinity/n-categories": they are equivalent to categories enriched over infinity/(n-1)-categories.
