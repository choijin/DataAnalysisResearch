<AbstractNarration>1035310&lt;br/&gt;Gaetani&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides $168,038 in funding over 12 months to support the Northeast National Ion Microprobe Facility (NENIMF) at Woods Hole. The facility will feature the PI as the manager and an IMS 1280 which will allow flexible and wide-ranging analyses. The facility can analyze uranium, zircon and monazite Th-Pb chronology, high-resolution zircon Ti measurements for thermometry, volatiles and isotopic analysis in silicate glasses, and elemental ratios in marine carbonates. The facility behaves as a multi-user national resource with considerable outside institution demand. Principal facility interests are in microanalysis for magmatic volatiles in silicate glasses and biogenic carbonates. Other projects supported range from determining paleoceanographic proxies, melt inclusion analysis to determine geodynamic environments, submarine eruption histories and high pressure melt analyses. As a multi-user facility, impacts will span the range of projects supported. Students and scientists from WHOI and other institutions will be afforded training and have access to specialized analyses. Summer student fellows will be targeted for research training. Data generated through the facility will be incorporated into graduate courses. The NENIMF will operate through an internal steering committee consisting of the PIs and an outside advisory committee with which the PIs will work closely. The advisory committee meetings will be scheduled monthly. A website and publication history will be used to advertise the offered services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
