<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Plant, Season, and Microbial Controls on Complete Denitrification in Treatment Wetlands&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Otto R. Stein&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Montana State University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No.: 1034434&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to determine the effects of wetland plant species and season on the removal of nitrate from constructed wetland microcosms at different organic carbon loading rates, and the relationship between rhizosphere microbial community dynamics and the composition of gaseous emissions from denitrification. The overall goals of the research are to minimize the NO3 and N20 in treated wastewater effluent and gaseous emissions and to maximize the amount of N2 produced during denitrification in treatment wetlands.  It is anticipated that the research will yield useful data on the optimal combination of plant species and operating conditions for use in constructed wetlands for tertiary treatment of municipal waste water. The project will support one masters-level graduate student and several undergraduate students at Montana State University. The results will be published in peer-reviewed articles and presented at national and international conferences. The PI has the opportunity to disseminate the results locally in Montana thru contacts in the state and municipal water treatment offices.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bruce K.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Treatment or constructed wetlands (TWs) are engineered water quality remediation systems designed to treat water from point and non-point sources such as agricultural and stormwater runoff, drainage from mine sites and especially domestic wastewater. Treatment wetland designs have undergone rapid technological advancement over the last decade.  Modern TW have performance expectations similar to more traditional systems but with lower capital costs, much lower operating costs (especially in electrical power requirements), and they can sustain ancillary ecological services such as wildlife habitat and visually appealing landscape aesthetics. Efficient and complete conversion of influent nitrogen to environmentally benign substances such as N2 gas, however, remains a challenging process in TWs. Many of the technical improvements in wetlands have emanated from Europe and focused primarily on the reduction of ammonium, potentially leaving significant quantities of nitrate.     Wetland plants facilitate nitrate removal in TWs by incorporating nitrogen into biomass and by promoting microbial removal through processes such as denitrification. Denitrification is a stepwise microbially-mediated process transforming nitrate to harmless di-nitrogen gas, which already comprises approximately 80% of our atmosphere. There are several intermediate nitrogen compounds produced during denitrification including the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, which may be produced in excess when the final step in denitrification is inhibited. Several factors may inhibit the last step in denitrification, some, such as temperature are environmental but others such as, pH, and the availability of organic carbon can be influenced by plants.     Our research used wastewater that varied in organic carbon content in a three-year, climate controlled greenhouse study to investigate the influence of plants and season on nitrate removal, the resulting greenhouse gas production, and the microbial communities that live in the subsurface of the wetlands. Five wetland species were evaluated: Carex utriculata, and Schoenoplectus acutus (Cyperaceae); Deschampsia cespitosa and Phragmites australis (Poaceae), as well as Typha latifolia (Typhaceae). The greenhouse temperature was fluctuated between 4&deg;C and 24&deg;C on an annual cycle to mimic a northern temperate climate.     Water quality data indicated that plant species, carbon load and temperature/season all affected nitrate removal. The presence of two plant species, Phragmites and Schoenoplectus, dampened the effects of both carbon load and temperature achieving excellent nitrate removal year round at similar rates (approximately 177 g m-2 yr-1) regardless of temperature or carbon load. Carex improved nitrate removal compared to the non-planted controls, however, a stronger temperature/seasonal dependence was found with removal rates increasing with elevated temperature. The reduction in annual performance was primarily accounted for by reductions in treatment in the winter months. Deschampsia and Typha did not perform significantly better than the non-planted controls, which could be a result of the plants species or a by-product of the poor health of many of the replicates.     Production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) was found to increase with additional exogenous carbon. This result countered expectations as the low amounts of available organic carbon were hypothesized to inhibit the last step in denitrification and result in a failure to reduce N2O to N2 gas. Plant biomass data indicate that the plants in the highest carbon load were stunted compared to the plants receiving less organic carbon. Microbial competition for nitrogen may have resulted in a deficiency in available nitrogen for the plants receiving the highest load of exogenous carbon, resulting in less plant biomass. For the plant treatments that received zero exogenous carbon, increased plant uptake may explain a portion of the nitrat...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
