<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding evolution is essential for understanding viruses, bacteria, and our own human genes involved in disease.  There are two main ways to study evolution: either within a population of the same species (microevolution) or between different species (macroevolution).  They are really the same process, but at different time scales; like following the stock market for a single day compared to over many years.  I study how DNA evolves at these different time scales, and use what we know about how it evolves at one time scale to test predictions about what happens at another time scale.  This helps other people studying evolution to understand how what they learn about one time scale can affect what we know about other time scales.    I chose to begin this work with Professor Hideki Innan at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Hayama, Japan because of his expertise on theoretical models of evolution within a single population.  I presented the results of the work at two scientific conferences this summer, and will  submit the research for publication later this year. In the future I hope to study more ways that these two evolutionary time scales can be combined to discover new things about how evolution happens.
