<AbstractNarration>Vulnerability to property loss and societal disruption is increasing as society becomes more complex and interconnected, and as private, industrial and commercial development expands in high risk areas. &lt;br/&gt;Understanding and predicting variations and changes in weather extremes is thus a major societal issue, encompassing urban, commercial and industrial planning, watershed maintenance, agricultural practices and the development of insurance solutions designed to encourage investment in cost-effective adaptation measures. Current climate models do not have the capacity to resolve the intensity, damage potential, and other important characteristics of extreme weather, e.g. extended droughts, heat waves, major hurricanes and resulting storm surge, severe local storms and tornadoes, extreme local rainfall and snowfall, ice storms, and wind storms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this activity are high. This collaborative project will bring together an international group of regional climate, societal, statistical, risk analysis, and insurance/reinsurance experts. The group will examine the potential for using high-level extreme value statistics to assess weather extremes through a combination of pilot projects and expert workshops. A feature of the program will be colloquia and funding to enable young scientists to develop careers in this cross-disciplinary area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project addressed the use of advanced statistics as a tool in support of more accurately assessing regional climate predictions provided by climate models.     Major outcomes included:  Intense Hurricanes: Here we utilised a combination of observational and climate model data together with extreme value statistical theory to assess potential changes in hurricanes with global climate variability and change:  First we used observed hurricane data around the globe together with a climate change index derived from climate models to assess changes over the past 50 years from global warming. We found that there were no changes in the total number of hurricanes and tropical storms, but a substantial increase in the proportion of Cat4-5 hurricanes, which was strongly related to the climate change index. Second we investigated the generic problem of assessing intense hurricanes in global climate models, where the highest intensities are not currently adequately resolved. By using an extreme value distribution called the Weibull Distribution and knowledge of past hurricanes, we demonstrated a more accurate approach than hitherto to assessing the intense hurricane changes from climate model projections into the future. These techniques are now being applied to a range of weather and climate extremes.   Use of statistics to assess weather and climate extremes using only the broad fields available in global analyses and climate projections:  Existing approaches to assessing hurricane genesis potential from these fields were critically assessed and a new approach developed called the Cyclone Genesis Index (CGI). The CGI reproduced observed formation frequency in the North Atlantic but proved to be more problematic in its application to monsoon environments around the rest of the world. Further work is aimed at understanding this. A framework for assessing future changes in drought was developed. This was demonstrated to have skill for drought over the US mid-west. Its application to other regions is proceeding. An approach to directly assessing hurricane damage potential - called the index for Cyclone Damage Potential (CDP) &ndash; was developed to provide globally consistent assessments of damage potential. Local exposure and vulnerability factors can be combined with the CDP to assess actual local damage potential. Statistical techniques were used to directly assess this damage potential from large-scale fields, without the need to directly simulate hurricanes.   Public Collaboration: This research was conducted directly with users and impacted communities and all techniques and generated data are available free to the public.  Public-Private Partnership: The work also provided valuable input into the development of a new public-private partnership, the Engineering for Climate Extremes Partnership (ECEP). ECEP involves representatives from business, industry, government and academia. All have the common goal of combining fundamental and applied research with technique development to address community priorities in planning and adapting for future demographic, climatic and ecological changes.
