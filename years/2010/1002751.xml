<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Ceramics are an important class of technological materials being used in insulators, fuel cells, gas turbines and various other electronic and structural components. However, the processing of ceramics is usually performed at high temperatures and slow rates. It was discovered that the application of a modest electric field enhances the processing rate, thereby reducing the required processing time or temperature. This offers the potential of significantly reducing the required energy and related cost. Thus, the use of an electric field provides a novel approach to the processing of materials. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the atomic mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effect of an electric field with the aim of optimizing the conditions. A major factor is the electronic space charge which exists in ceramic materials.  A post-doctoral scholar and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be trained during the course of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: It was discovered in prior work that the application of an electric field during the plastic deformation of the polycrystalline oxides MgO, Al2O3 and ZrO2(3Y-TZP) gave a significant reduction in flow stress. In the case of 3Y-TZP the reduction consisted of three components: one due to Joule heating, a rapid reversible component due to the direct effect of the field on the plastic deformation kinetics and an irreversible, cumulative component due to the effect of the field on the microstructure. These effects are attributed to ionic conduction, a reduction in the energy to form vacancies and a retardation of dynamic grain growth. In contrast to 3Y-TZP, MgO and Al2O3 did not exhibit the same three components. Theoretical considerations indicate that the three components are related to the space charge at the grain boundaries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to determine the physical mechanisms responsible for the reduction in flow stress in oxides which occurs with application of an electric field, with focus on the role of the valence of solute additions on: (a) the space charge at the grain boundaries and (b) the related grain boundary structure employing advanced high-resolution electron microscopy techniques. To obtain information on the time constants relating to the mechanisms, the influence of the electric field frequency is being investigated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    1.    Research   It was discovered that the application of a weak electric field (DC or 60 Hz AC)  retarded grain growth during the sintering, annealing and forming (plastic deformation) of polycrystalline zirconia; see for example Fig. 1. The microscopic feature revealed in Fig.1 are the grain boundaries (GBs), which are regions of higher energy that result from the crystallographic mismatch between the atoms in neighboring grains; see for example in Fig.2.      It was established for the first time in this NSF-sponsored study that the GB energy (                                                  ) in ionic ceramics consisted of three major components, namely           (1)  where     is due to the crystallographic mismatch between the contacting grains,      is due to the size difference between the cations segregated at the GBs and the host ions and     an electrostatic component due to the electric charge    (volts) which exists at the GBs as a result of the difference in valence between the segregated solute cation and the host ions. The three components are illustrated in Fig.2. It was determined that a major effect of an applied electric field on grain growth resulted from its interaction with the electrostatic component    .        The variation of the grain size with the strength of a DC field for all three processes is shown in Fig. 3, which gives the ratio of the grain size (GS) with field (dE) to that without (d) as a function of the applied electric field strength E. It is seen from Fig.3. that the application of a weak DC electric field E     25 V/cm during the processing of zirconia gives a significant reduction in the corresponding GS. Further, it was discovered that a 60 Hz AC field gave an even greater reduction in GS compared to an equivalent DC; see Fig.1.       In keeping with the well-known fact that in general the processing rates of polycrystalline ceramics increase with decrease in GS, it was found that the sintering and forming rates of zirconia increased markedly with application of an electric field; see for example Figs. 4 and 5. Thus, since the conventional (entirely isothermal) processing of ceramic components is energy intensive, the application of a weak electric field during processing ("electroprocessing") offers the potential of reducing the required energy and in turn the cost of manufacturing ceramic products. Moreover, since the mechanical properties of crystalline solids are known to increase with decrease in GS, electroprocessing should give a product with improved mechanical properties.       Important from both scientific and technology viewpoints is a knowledge of the phenomena and physical mechanism(s) that govern electroprocessing. The atomic-scale phenomena involved, their sequence and the physical mechanisms deduced in the present NSF study are presented in Fig. 6. They give that a major effect of an applied electric field is to reduce the grain boundary energy     by the electrostatic interaction of the field with the space charge potential     at the GBs, which in turn gives a reduction in the driving force P for grain growth. The scientific bases for the phenomena and physical mechanisms are given in the paper by Jun Wang and Hans Conrad, J. Mater. Sci., 49(2014)6074-6080, which was noted by the journal Advances in Engineering as a Key Scientific Article contributing to excellence in engineering, scientific and industrial research. Especially exciting is the finding that by simply controlling the voltage on the power supply one can control the magnitude of the materialÆs internal, atomic-scale physical property   and in turn the processing rate.      Although Fig. 6 refers to yttria-stabilized zirconia, exploratory experiments on polycrystalline magnesia and alumina indicated that the behavior and physical mechanisms are similar. However, this needs to be confirmed in future work.  2.    Outcome Activities         A total of 13 papers were published in notable scientific jou...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
