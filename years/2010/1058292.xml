<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is supporting  Professor John L. Wood of the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University to develop new methods for the formation of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing heterocycles via a rhodium(II)-mediated O-H/N-H insertion tandem Conia-ene cyclization. Since its discovery, the Conia-ene cyclization has presented a method for assembling carbocycles from linear substrates containing an enol and pendant olefinic moiety. This rearrangement remains synthetically underdeveloped because of the harsh reaction conditions required for its application. Recent advances in metal-catalyzed Conia-ene cyclizations have made this reaction more amenable for synthetic use, however the reaction is still limited to underfunctionalized, linear precursors. One metal that has not been explored is rhodium(II). Rhodium(II) is well known for its dediazotization ability in carbene chemistry, but few examples exists where it behaves as a pi-Lewis acid that would help initiate a rearrangement such as a Conia-ene cyclization.  Tandem reactions are synthetically attractive for their efficiency and tendency to generate minimal waste. The development of this reaction sequence will create a new synthetic tool for the construction of target compounds that possess interesting biological and structural properties including complex natural products. Specifically, the proposal outlines a strategy utilizing the newly developed method for the synthesis of the welwitindolinone B/D family. Syntheses of theses compounds could generate intermediates that possess medicinally relevant activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of Broader Impacts, the PI will build on his notable track record in training undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral fellows through the scholarly pursuit of methods development and its application to the construction of complex molecular targets.  It is expected that these individuals will have a positive influence on the academic community, pharmaceutical industry and allied scientific fields in the general areas of matter by design and controlled molecular synthesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The recently concluded project entitled "Rodium (II)-Mediated O-H or N-H insertion Tandem Conia-Ene Cylizations: Application Towards the Synthesis of the Welwitindolinone Alkaloids" (NSF CHE 1058292) resulted in further development of the rhodium mediated chemistry of alpha diazo-carbonyl compounds.       The project began with efforts directed toward a synthesis of Welwitindolinone D. The results of this study inspired further advances in the [3+2] cycloaddition chemistry of nitrones.  Both types of reactions are applicable in the synthesis of complex molecules that hold potential as new chemotherapeutic agents or materials.  In these particular studies, the utility of this chemistry was demonstrated in synthetic efforts that were directed toward preparing providencin, securinine, allosecurinine, and citrinadin B.  These are all naturally occurring secondary metabolites (see representative structural illustrations) that were originally isolated and structurally characterized due to their interesting biological properties.  In addition to demonstrating utility in the synthesis of the specific molecules listed above, these studies demonstrated the potential of these methods for use in the general context of complex molecule synthesis.      Increasing the repertoire of methods available for use in the synthesis of small molecules has impact on a broad range of areas, including the development of new pharmaceuticals, new chemicals for use in agriculture whether it be new herbicides or insecticides and new materials.     In addition to advancing the science of synthetic chemistry these efforts also provided an opportunity for several chemists to develop the skills needed to prepare complex molecules.
