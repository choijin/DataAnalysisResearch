<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop methods to measure, and theoretical models to interpret, the interaction between biological molecules, such as proteins and DNA, and fine-scale or nano-materials.  This knowledge will be fundamental for the development of the scientific and engineering basis, both for the design of therapies that employ biomolecule-nanomaterial hybrids, and for understanding of the possible deleterious effects of nanomaterials on health.  The approach taken will be to develop and employ complementary tools in experiment and theory.  The project will initially focus on the well-defined nucleic acid-carbon nanotube system and will (i) measure forces required to detach single biological molecules from individual nanoparticles, (ii) develop theoretical models to convert raw experimental measurements into fundamental physical properties, and (iii) study binding and competition between biomolecules and nanoparticles in a simulated cellular environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research will be to generate fundamental quantitative data, to uncover underlying principles that govern the interaction between biological molecules and nanomaterials, and to suggest ways to manipulate them through chemical modifications.  Such information is critical for the design of novel therapies using new hybrid constructs.  For example, knowing quantitatively the strength of binding between a therapeutic biological molecule and a carbon nanotube will permit the design of therapies that rely on the delivery of the drug using this nanomaterial as a carrier.  Similarly, the results of this research will help to develop the framework for understanding the basic interactions between nanomaterials and the biological molecules in human cells and for predicting potentially harmful effects.  This award will also support, through collaboration with a local science museum, the development of informal science education for the general public about the mechanistic basis of the health effects of nanomaterials and their potential applications in biomedicine.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Materials in very small sizes (nanomaterials) have unique physical and chemical properties that make them very promising candidates in applications as varied as highly miniaturized electronics and fighting cancer.  Especially for biomedical applications, their size and novel properties also raise legitimate concerns regarding potentially harmful health effects, which need to be understood and mitigated.  Examples of such nanomaterials include carbon nanotubes, gold nanoparticles, and quantum dots.   Both their beneficial and potentially harmful aspects ultimately depend on how these nanomaterials interact with the fundamental biological molecules such as DNA and proteins.  In this project we developed experimental methods to measure and characterize the strength of interaction between DNA and carbon nanotubes, and conducted detailed computer simulation studies to understand the structural and sequence-dependent basis for these interactions.  Intellectual Merit: The principal goal of this project was to develop methods for, and to generate data on, interactions between biomolecules (single stranded DNA and proteins) and nanomaterials (single wall carbon nanotubes, graphite, and methyl-terminated surfaces).  We developed methods to measure the strength of binding between single biological molecules and the nanomaterial using atomic force microscopy.  We also studied solution-based molecule exchange experimental techniques. Using molecular simulation, we showed how the sequence dependence of binding strength is related to whether and how the biological molecule recognizes the nanomaterial.   Broader Impact:  This project resulted in training of four graduate students, including two women. Through the REU mechanism, we supported summer research for five undergraduate students, including two women. One of the goals of our program was to, "Educate the general public on the basis and importance of understanding interactions between nanometer-scale objects in the cell (biomolecules) and man-made nanometer-scale materials (e.g. SWCNTs)." In collaboration with the Da Vinci Science Center in Allentown (PA), we developed two exhibits (installed in Fall 2014) to educate the general public on the interaction of nanomaterials with biological molecules.
