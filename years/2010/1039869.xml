<AbstractNarration>1039869&lt;br/&gt;Goetz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for the purchase of a state-of-the-art flow cytometer with cell sorting capability, specifically a FACSAria Special Order (SO) manufactured by BD Biosciences. The FACSAria SO will support investigators from 3 colleges on the Ohio University campus representing 6 departments and a multitude of undergraduate and graduate academic programs including 2 interdisciplinary graduate programs. Combined the major users have 24 graduate students, 14 undergraduate students, and 6 senior personnel. The majority of the primary users are unified through formal affiliation with campus-wide bioengineering/biotechnology initiatives. The numerous ongoing collaborations among these faculty members span bioengineering, biophysics, chemistry, and cell biology. The research projects are exceedingly meritorious as evidenced by the faculty members' publication records and the peer-reviewed research support. The FACSAria SO will replace the existing flow cytometer owned by Ohio University. The current flow cytometer was purchased more than 16 years ago from BD Pharmingen (currently BD Biosciences) and is no longer manufactured. The outdated technology and non-upgradeable capabilities of the current flow cytometer are severely limiting research progress and training. In addition, the frequent breakdown of the instrument leads to an unacceptable amount of frustration and lost productivity. Reviewers have commented on the lack of adequate flow cytometry facilities at Ohio University. The nearest fully functional flow cytometer/cell sorter is located in Columbus, Ohio, 75 miles away from Ohio University.</AbstractNarration>
