<AbstractNarration>The framework, characteristics, and structure of learning are being greatly impacted by cyberinfrastructure (CI) and the emerging computational sciences and engineering (CS &amp; E) fueling much of CI development. We are witnessing the emergence of CI-enabled learning, or cyberlearning, which holds tremendous potential, interest, and excitement for formal and informal education. For the 21st century, our nation must be CI savvy if it is to be competitive in the international marketplace. To meet its anticipated workforce demands, the nation must broaden participation in STEM, particularly in CI and CS &amp; E, and utilize CI to help this broadening effort. Education is no longer PK-20, but rather a lifelong endeavor affecting the general citizenry as well as future and current scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of workshops, planned by a select group of experts in the field, would greatly advance research and curricular developments for cyberlearning and cyberinfrastructure workforce development.  The NSF?s learning and workforce development goals for cyberinfrastructure envision an expansion of CI knowledge, skills, and opportunities throughout all levels of education and society. Developing an effective approach for community input on achieving those goals would help the nation and the CI community to move effectively in that direction, and thus ultimately realize the full benefits of CI for learning, discovery, innovation, and broader engagement in and the democratization of science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The emerging knowledge-based economy is presenting the nation major educational and workforce development challenges that call for major changes needed to preserve our global competitiveness. Much of the new economy is based upon rapidly accelerating significant advancements in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), in large part fueled by the emergence of cyberinfrastructure (CI) and computational and data intensive science and engineering (CDS&amp;E).  The advancements in CDS&amp;E and CI evolve largely from innovation and rapid developments in interdisciplinary and cross-sector thinking and collaborations.  Furthermore, the full nature of the emergent potential of technological advancements is often not immediately recognized, but becomes apparent once implemented on a large scale.  These advancements in turn stimulate further innovations in an ever-accelerating positive feedback loop.    For the 21st century, our nation must be cyberinfrastructure savvy if it is to be competitive in the international marketplace. Education is no longer PK-20, but rather a lifelong endeavor involving the general citizenry just as much as current and future scientists and engineers. Some of the workforce production issues arise from the traditional talent pool being too small for the demand.   Broader participation on the part of underrepresented groups- women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities &ndash; is a necessary part of our global competitiveness solution. The very nature of what and how we learn and who can fully participate is being in large part reshaped, reconstructed or facilitated by CI and CDS&amp;E.     An earlier meeting of a select group of national experts outlined a general conceptual framework for cyberlearning and workforce development with the following five components:    Cyberinfrastructure Workforce Development and Higher Education: Computational and Data-Intensive Science and Engineering Cyberlearning K-14, Training, Informal Science Education, and Lifelong Learning Campus Bridging and Education Broadening Participation and Cyberinfrastructure    Based upon the above conceptual framework, the logistical planning and preparation for a workshop to garner broad community input was conducted.  Multiple planning discussions and much work were conducted by the steering committee.  Members for a broad expert committee with sub-committees along the major themes were identified and invited to participate.  Other individuals and groups with identified interest, concern or diverse perspectives were also identified and invited to contribute to the discussions and provide their input.  A professional meeting planner was contracted.  The agenda and format was drafted, revised and finalized.  The workshop venue, meals and hotel accommodations were negotiated and arranged.  The venue was selected to be in close proximity to many governmental and non-profit entities and experts to enable their participation.  Travel arrangement assistance was provided as requested.  The groundwork for a successful workshop to more fully develop the conceptual framework with broad community input was completed.
