<AbstractNarration>This CAREER proposal will support an early career female PI to establish an integrated research and education program in the fields of polar biology and environmental microbiology, focusing on single-celled eukaryotes (protists) in high latitude ice-covered Antarctic lakes systems.  Protists play important roles in energy flow and material cycling, and act as both primary producers (fixing inorganic carbon by photosynthesis) and consumers (preying on bacteria by phagotrophic digestion). The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) located in Victoria Land, Antarctica, harbor microbial communities which are isolated in the unique aquatic ecosystem of perennially ice-capped lakes. The lakes support exclusively microbial consortia in chemically stratified water columns that are not influenced by seasonal mixing, allochthonous inputs, or direct human impact. This project will exploit permanently stratified biogeochemistry that is unique across the water columns of several MDV lakes to address gaps in our understanding of protist trophic function in aquatic food webs.  The proposed research will examine (1) the impact of permanent biogeochemical gradients on protist trophic strategy, (2) the effect of major abiotic drivers (light and nutrients) on the distribution of two key mixotrophic and photoautotrophic protist species, and (3) the effect of episodic nutrient pulses on mixotroph communities in high latitude (ultraoligotrophic) MDV lakes versus low latitude (eutrophic) watersheds. The project will impact the fields of microbial ecology and environmental microbiology by combining results from field, laboratory and in situ incubation studies to synthesize new models for the protist trophic roles in the aquatic food web. The research component of this proposed project will be tightly integrated with the development of two new education activities designed to exploit the inherent excitement associated with polar biological research. The educational objectives are: 1) to establish a teaching module in polar biology in a core undergraduate course for microbiology majors; 2) to develop an instructional module to engage middle school girls in STEM disciplines. Undergraduates and middle school girls will also work with a doctoral student on his experiments in local Ohio watersheds.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF CAREER Project supported an early career female PI in establishing an integrated research and education program in the fields of polar biology and environmental microbiology, focusing on single celled eukaryotes (protists) residing in high latitude ice-covered Antarctic lakes systems (McMurdo Dry Valleys, MDV, Antarctica). Protists are part of a metabolically diverse group of microorganisms that have critical, yet poorly understood and underappreciated, functions in aquatic food chains. Specifically, they play important roles in energy flow and material cycling, and act as both primary producers (fixing inorganic carbon by photosynthesis) and consumers (predating on bacteria by phagotrophic digestion). However, one of the more fascinating abilities of protists is their ability to combine photosynthesis with predatory behavior (mixotrophy). At the outset of this project, the current understanding of the nutritional plasticity of individual protist species was limited. The overall goals of the project were: 1) to understand how abiotic drivers impact protist trophic strategy and, 2) to predict how future episodic climate events will impact protist trophic function in chemically stratified Antarctic lakes. We discovered that MDV protists are vertically stratified within the water columns and that their &ldquo;trophic choices&rdquo; are influenced by a complex set of abiotic and biotic variables. By combining data from natural communities with a novel in situ incubation experiment, we determined that photosynthetic and mixotrophic protists exploit differential physiological strategies to occupy different layers of the chemically stratified water columns. Seasonal trends in protists are also related to their trophic abilities as well as other traits, including adaptation to extreme shade. Parasitism is likely an important top-down control over larger flagellates (eg: <em>Chlamydomonas</em>), while populations of smaller mixotrophic phytoplankton are controlled by heterotrophic nanoflagellates. In addition, protist trophic mode influences the associated bacterial communities. Last, certain phytoplankton species will likely be the winners in future scenarios of increased hydrological activity in the dry valleys. Since photosynthetic protists play a critical role in the MDV food web dynamics, it is anticipated that shifts in the protist community could have significant impacts on the diversity and community structure of heterotrophic bacteria.</p> <p>Project science activities were tightly integrated with educational and outreach activities designed to exploit the inherent excitement associated with polar biological research. Undergraduate teaching labs at the introductory and senior levels worked with cultures and samples of microbial communities collected from the MDV lakes, including next generation sequencing and analyses of cultures and natural communities. In addition to the research question-based activities which reached &gt;100 undergraduate students in the teaching labs, an additional 19 undergraduate research scholars participated in independent research projects in the lab, including students from NSF-REU, -URM and LSAMP programs. The PI and her graduate students have also taught hands-on classes in polar microbiology every year to Grades 1-5, for a total of 450 students for the duration of the award. In addition, key findings of this project were highlighted throughout several chapters of a popular general microbiology textbook.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/03/2017<br>      Modified by: Rachael&nbsp;M&nbsp;Morgan-Kiss</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1056396/1056396_10084176_1507080392865_OutcomeImages-5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1056396/1056396_10084176_1507080392865_OutcomeImages-5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MDV Lake Protists"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1056396/1056396_10084176_1507080392865_OutcomeImages-5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MDV Lake Protists"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Scanning electron micrographs of a selection of MDV protists from Lake Bonney (LB) and Lake Fryxell (FRX).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wei Li</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rachael&nbsp;M&nbsp;Morgan-Kiss</div> <div class="imageTitle">MDV Lake Protists</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1056396/1056396_10084176_1507080144457_OutcomeImages-1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1056396/1056396_10084176_1507080144457_OutcomeImages-1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Algal Dialysis Frame on Lake Bonney"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1056396/1056396_10084176_1507080144457_OutcomeImages-1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Algal Dialysis Frame on Lake Bonney"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students deploying algal frames carrying Lake Bonney dialysis bags of Chlamydomonas sp.
