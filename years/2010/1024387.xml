<AbstractNarration>This award funds students to attend a summer school in Bangalore, India, hosted by IIT-Bangalore in India from May 23 - 30, 2010.   The goal of this school is to expose graduate students and young researchers to new and important ideas in concurrent and real-time programming.   Concurrency is an important topic involved in design of new hyper-threading techniques in computer architectures, specification of non-blocking data structures and algorithms, implementation of scalable computer farms for handling massive data sets, and the design of a robust software architecture for distributed business processes.  Recent architectural advances in multi-core and many-core architectures have made this an essential topic for a serious student of computer science.  The focus will be on real-time systems, programming language design, program analysis, specification, and implementation as they relate to concurrent systems.   Real-time issues are important in many kinds of critical embedded and other types of systems.  The trip to India will also be an international experience and a community-building experience for the next generation of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Third International Summer School on Trends in Concurrency  IIIT-Bangalore, India     Concurrency is a pervasive and essential characteristic of modern computer systems. Whether it is the design of new hyper-threading techniques in computer architectures, specification of non-blocking data structures and algorithms, implementation of scalable computer farms for handling massive data sets, or the design of a robust software architecture for distributed business processes, a deep understanding of mechanisms and foundations for expressing and controlling concurrency is required.  Recent architectural advances in multi-core and many-core architectures have made this an essential topic for any serious student of computer science.     This summer school brought together outstanding researchers from academia and industry to discuss current research and future trends in concurrent systems design and implementation.  All instructors have had significant impact in the area of concurrency, and play an active role in substantial ongoing research and commercial efforts.     The goal of this school was to expose graduate students and young researchers to new and important ideas in concurrent programming.  The focus was on programming language design, program analysis, specification, and implementation as they relate to concurrent and real-time systems.       The speakers included the following researchers:     Madan Musuvavthi, Microsoft Research.  Dr Musuvathi is a researcher in the Software Reliability Research group at Microsoft Research.
