<AbstractNarration>The Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative (PTEI) 10-week REU site program will provide undergraduate students a fundamental understanding of underlying biological and engineering principles of structural tissue engineering (TE).  The PTEI REU will expose students to real-world problems and solutions applications increase the satisfaction students get from their education, and stimulate them to continue working on exploratory projects. By working as a team member in a highly interdisciplinary research environment, undergraduate students become active in developing practical solutions beneficial to society, providing an initial glance at how they might apply their knowledge. Undergraduate students will be mentored by faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral trainees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To enhance the research experience, a variety of activities have been incorporated, i.e. seminars and workshops designed to introduce students to and inform them about "hot topics" in TE and career opportunities in academia and industry.  Participants will also take a short course to address the interdisciplinary nature of TE and issues not addressed in standard undergraduate engineering and science curriculum. Several cultural and social activities are planned for students which will help foster the cohort experience.   At the end of the REU program students will be required to give a 3-5 minute oral overview of his/her research project, prepare and submit an abstract, and present a research poster. Finally, REU participants will receive a program completion certificate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this REU program is to enhance the exposure of underserved and underrepresented minorities, to include students from two-year community colleges, and non-research based 4-year institutions, and U.S. Veterans who are returning to active duty to collaborative, interdisciplinary research in structural tissue engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research outcomes will be disseminated by presentations at the final poster session, professional meetings, and publications with undergraduates as co-authors and/or credited for their contributions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A considerable challenge in tissue engineering (TE) is developing the next generation of experts, cognizant of the interdisciplinary challenges and approaches needed to solve TE problems.  As in many of todayÆs promising fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), future success depends upon active engagement and education of young men and women today.  Toward this end, the primary aim of the REU program in Structural TE was to actively engage a diverse spectrum of undergraduate students for 10 weeks during the summers 2010-2012, providing each a fundamental understanding of the biological and engineering principles of structural TE via hands-on, independent research experiences to fill the gap between classroom learning and real-life application.  This REU is unique in that it draws upon experienced TE researchers and institutional resources from the Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative's five member academic institutions including Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.   The REU goals include:   Promoting independence through active participation with a research team; developing abilities to interact with other STEM disciplines; hands-on exposure to modern instrumentation and techniques;  fostering educational growth and ongoing interest in research and graduate education; and improving, strengthening, and diversifying engineering and science across educational levels   Interns were selected from a national applicant pool of students pursuing degrees in engineering, biotechnology, chemistry, biology, pre-med, and related fields.  Through partnerships established with under-represented minority (URMs) organizations, 34 undergraduates, 21 females and 13 males, participated in the program with average cohort of 11 interns each summer.  Breakdown by ethnicity comprised 11 African Americans, 4 Hispanics, 1 Native American, 6 Asians, and 12 Caucasians.  A majority were sophomores (10) and juniors (14). Four were seniors and six were freshmen.  The majority came from racially diverse institutions. There were differences in their past experiences, some from institutions with opportunities for research and others with no research opportunities. Overall interns gained experience in a multidisciplinary research TE laboratory, increased understanding of TE research and were exposed to technically and culturally diverse teams of experts and mentors.  Via a near-peer mentor structure to include faculty mentors and postdoctoral/graduate student co-mentors, each got a taste of graduate study in scientific research, gaining insight and appreciation for research.  Twenty-three interns with definite plans to attend medical school (8 currently enrolled), eight considering MD/PhD (1 currently enrolled), seven considering graduate school (3 currently enrolled) and one interested in dentistry.  Three year results indicate the REU was well-organized, providing rich learning environments for a diverse group of undergraduate students to learn new skills, gain new knowledge, get a taste for the research process, gain experience communicating and publishing research, and build academic relationships with researchers and their team. Although some found themselves in new territory, they were able to rise to the occasion and acquire the necessary background to carry out their research. Interns especially appreciated the opportunity to present their work both orally and with posters to a large audience.
