<AbstractNarration>Project Goal: The Goal: The Fort Peck Math and Science Network goal is to build Fort Peck Reservation Assiniboine and Sioux students? science and math knowledge and capacities and provide students access to STEM career pathways. Fort Peck Community College and four reservation high schools Brockton, Frazer, Poplar and Wolf Point are partners in the Fort Peck Math and Science Network. Tribal College students, 435 total, and five hundred high school students will have active learning experiences in science and computer-assisted mathematics throughout the grant period. The aim is to raise the Moncas science and math scores at the 16th percentile (average 2 year trend) up to the 50th percentile, and open the STEM pipeline for Assiniboine and Sioux students to enter STEM degree programs at Fort Peck Community College.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 1: A comprehensive foundation of mathematics skills, knowledge and capacities will be built in high school and college students on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, through the implementation of the ALEKS computer assisted math learning system as indicated by Moncas math test scores and college freshman placement ASSET test results. Objective 2: Science instruction for all high school and college students on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation will feature active learning as forty percent of the entire learning experience to raised Moncas science scores. Objective 3: The Network partners will expand math and science instruction through designated learning labs on all campuses, for maximum access to active learning instructional activities in science and computer assisted curriculum in mathematics. Objective 4: Highly qualified senior principal investigators and the Network STEM Faculty Steering Committee will manage the Fort Peck Math and Science Network; summative and formative project evaluations will be performed semiannually during the project period, for continuous improvement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Fort Peck Math and Science Network Fort Peck Community College NSF-TCUP Project  The goal of the Fort Peck Community College NSF-TCUP project ,"The Fort Peck Math and Science Network", is to build the Fort Peck Reservation Assiniboine and Sioux studentsÆ science and math knowledge and capacities and provide students access to STEM career pathways.  Fort Peck Community College and the four Fort Peck Reservation high schools Brockton, Frazer, Poplar and Wolf Point are partners in the Fort Peck Math and Science Network.  A total of 435 Tribal College students and 500 high school students will have active learning experiences in science and computer-assisted mathematics throughout the grant period.  The aim is to raise the Montcas science and math scores at the four Network High Schools from 16% to 50%, open up the STEM pipeline and make it possible for Assiniboine and Sioux students to enter STEM degree programs at Fort Peck Community College.  The emphasis of the project is Computer-Assisted Math and Active Learning Science for the broad-based STEM student learning, curricular development and expansion, and teacher professional development activities.  The TCUP Project Outcomes:    Over the three year period of the TCUP project, the average Math Montcas test score increased by 7.43%. However, it did not increase to 50%. The average science Montcas test score decreased by 1.67%.     A total of 1551 students have used and experienced Math Computer Assisted Learning (ALEKS math software).    The FPCC placement of freshman students in college level math courses increased by 15%.    Three TCUP Summer Math Institutes were implemented at the Fort Peck Community College. A total of 98 high school and college students participated in the summer Math Institutes. The overall completion rate for the Summer Math Institutes was 50%.    Six TCUP Summer Undergraduate Research projects (2 every summer) were implemented at Fort Peck Community College. Each one of these research projects was 7 weeks long. A total of 26 students from the Fort Peck Reservation High Schools and the Fort Peck Community College and 4 FPCC science faculty members participated in the  research projects and gained research experience and training in the areas of environmental science and alternative energy resources. The research project was the most successful component of the NSF-TCUP project at FPCC. The TCUP project has enhanced research capacity at the Fort Peck Community College.    A computer Lab was established at each one of the Network High Schools as well as the Fort Peck Community College. The computer labs enhanced the computing and internet onnectivity capabilities at the four Network High Schools and FPCC.    The TCUP project provided STEM training and workshops for all the science and math teachers and faculty at the Network High Schools and FPCC.    Science active learning equipment and supplies provided by the TCUP project were essential for the science curriculum at the four Network High Schools as well as the Fort Peck Community college.
