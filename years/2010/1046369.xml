<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a layer-by-layer spray technology capable of integrating commercially-available nanoparticles, including multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNT), carbon nanofibers (CNF) and nanoclays into stable and strong nanopapers by electrostatic bonding, offering superior surface wear resistance and electrical conductivity properties at much lower cost and higher production rate than existing methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide light-weight, high-strength and low-cost nanopapers with superior Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) shielding capability and wear resistance. The nanopapers are expected to form strong bonding with the matrix resin such as epoxy.  The resulting nanocomposite materials can be used as structural composites for a broad range of applications including aerospace industry, wind energy generators and so on.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Multifunctional NanoPapers for Structural, Wear-Resistant and Conducting Applications     This Phase I and IB study has led to very fruitful findings and achievements. The developed new technology will deliver significant benefits in the green energy (wind mill, and Li-battery), aerospace, military, electronics, consumer goods and automobile industries.  However, based on OhioÃ†s local business and our domestic and international industrial supply chains, NIL would like to stay focus on the automobile market in the US and wind energy and aerospace markets in China with near-term commercialization targets of several under-hood automotive parts for EMI shielding and erosion resistance in the US and protective wind blade coating for sand erosion resistance, de-icing and possibly lightening protection in China.     Our Phase I project objective was to prove the technology feasibility of surface modification of carbon nanoparticles and using functionalized nanoparticles to form high strength nanopapers for erosion resistant and EMI shielding applications in near-term wind energy, consumer goods and automotive markets and long-term aerospace markets. To realize this goal, NIL worked closely with The Ohio State University (OSU) faculty, post-doc researchers and students over the last fifteen months. We have successfully synthesized polyaniline functionalized nanoparticles including carbon nanofibers (CNF), multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNT), nanoclays (MMT) and graphene (from graphite). We have also worked out agreements with a small Ohio company, Capital Resin Corporation (CRC) and a large chemical company, LCY Group to scale up the nanoparticle functionalization process. NIL and OSU also built a pilot scale batch equipment capable of producing large nanopapers from functionalized nanoparticles using the layer-by-layer spraying for customer evaluation.     The major achievements in Phase I and IB are highlighted in the following:  Polyaniline      surface modified nanoparticles such as, carbon nanofibers (CNF), multiwall      carbon nanotubes (MWNT), nanoclays (MMT) and graphene were      successfully synthesized. The polyaniline modified carbon nanopapers      showed much better mechanical strength and electric conductivity than      nanopapers prepared by non-treated, acid treated and PEI treated carbon nanoparticles. For example,      the polyaniline modified CNF      nanopapers showed &gt;100X improvement in tensile strength and &gt;10X      improvement in electrical conductivity than pristine CNF nanopapers, which is very attractive to      our customers in regard to nanopaper processibility and EMI shielding      performance. CNF nanopapers. TEM      and CV electric scan measurements revealed strong bonding of polyaniline      to carbon nanofibers.   A      pilot scale high pressure layer-by-layer coating machine was designed and      built to apply the aforementioned nanoparticles to make large nanopaper      samples for customer evaluation. The      aforementioned nanopapers could be easily applied to the conventional      Vacuum Assisted RTM (VARTM) process and Seeman Composite Resin Infusion      Molding Process (SCRIMP) without any process changes (i.e. "drop-in"      process).   The      polyaniline surface modified nanopapers could result in faster curing for      epoxy resins based composites, which is significant for the fabrication of      large infrastructures at low temperatures, such as wind blade molding, in      terms of reduced energy consumption, tooling cost and operation time, and improved      composite strength due to less residual resins. CNF nanopaper (~20 vol.% CNF) coated epoxy composites showed &gt;7X      improvement of sand erosion resistance than epoxy/unidirectional glass      fiber (&gt;40 vol.% glass fiber) composites typically for wind blades, and      &gt;3X improvement of sand erosion resistance than epoxy/woven carbon      fiber (&gt;50 vol.% carbon fiber) composites typically for helicopter  ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
