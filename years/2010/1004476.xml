<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Rice University that will provide cutting-edge research training and professional development activities for 10 weeks for 10 students, for the summers of 2010-2012. This award is supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO) and Engineering (ENG). The specific focus of the NSF REU program is cellular engineering, a field with enormous potential to make truly significant contributions to mankind in both medical and non-medical fields over the next decades.  The goal of the program is to expose students to cutting-edge technologies and approaches in metabolic and tissue engineering.  The summer NSF REU features:  research training in cellular engineering; weekly research seminars; training in ethics and the responsible conduct of research; leadership and  mentorship retreats; safety training; special seminars and career development workshops; stipend and travel support; on-campus housing; participation in the "Advances in Tissue Engineering" short course; and a capstone research poster symposium.  Students should expect an enriching and rigorous summer where they may nurture their professional and scientific development. Students will be recruited nationwide, with particular emphasis on recruiting women and under-represented minorities. Students will be selected based on the faculty steering committee's evaluation of each applicant's transcript, personal statement regarding interest and motivation for research, and letters of recommendation.  Each year, a "Class Notes" newsletter of the NSF REU alumni will be published that features news on alumni's current academic or professional status and accomplishments. Assessment of this program is done via pre- and post-questionnaires as well by using the REU common assessment tool.  More information on this NSF REU in cellular engineering is available at http://nsfreu.rice.edu, or by contacting Dr. Jennifer West (Principal Investigator) at 713-348-5955 or jwest@rice.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rice UniversityÃ†s NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program is an interdisciplinary program in cellular engineering, with focus areas in the fields of metabolic engineering and tissue engineering. This program is administered by Rice's Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering.  Cellular engineering is a field with enormous potential to make truly significant contributions to mankind in both medical and non-medical fields over the next decades. We believe the next generation of therapeutics (following recombinant proteins and peptides) will utilize cells and tissues. Many new technologies in fields such as environmental engineering and chemical production will also be based on advances in cellular engineering.  Interdisciplinary scientists and engineers with skills in molecular and cell biology, biochemistry, and engineering will be necessary for U.S. industrial competitiveness and will be crucial for translating our world leadership in the scientific aspects of biotechnology into cost-effective, environmentally benign, industrial and product applications.  We have developed an innovative interdisciplinary training program in cellular engineering to provide scientists and engineers with educational and research opportunities that span the fields of bioengineering, biochemistry, and cell biology.   This emerging interdisciplinary field, where Rice University offers great depth of research opportunities and expertise, provides undergraduate students with exciting and impacting research experiences. Under this REU program in Cellular Engineering, ten undergraduates were selected each summer to work on any of a number of projects under the mentorship of faculty in diverse Natural Science and Engineering departments. Students are recruited nationwide, with particular emphasis on recruiting women and under-represented minorities. The students participated in cutting-edge research and professional development activities for 10 weeks each summer.  Additionally, the following significant results were achieved:   Intern degree completion, transfer to four-year colleges, and career paths. Our  REU site recruited students who on average had just finished their sophomore year at the time of participation.Of the 29 who participated in the program from 2010-2012, 18 have graduated with STEM degrees while eleven are on track to graduate in May 2014.  Based on the email responses in a recent follow-up poll, the majority of program participants who have completed their undergraduate education (10) have matriculated in graduate programs across the country including Rice University, Yale University, Duke University, Florida State University, and Washington University at St. Louis. The remaining are either enrolled in medical school (5) at Baylor College of Medicine, Southwestern, UT Medical Branch and Vanderbilt or have pursued careers in teaching or the private sector (3).  Diversity of students recruited. The intended majors of our interns spanned many STEM disciplines, including: (i) Biology, (ii) Biochemistry, (iii) Bioengineering, (iv) Chemical Engineering, and (v) Biomedical Engineering. Students were matched with mentors in departments spanning these areas, including faculty with primary appointments in Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology, Bioengineering, Chemical &amp; Biomolecular Engineering, and Chemistry. When provided open-ended questions about their mentors, students noted that they appreciated the thought that went into laboratory placement and mentors, and they felt that this contributed positively to their summer experience and understanding of how diverse STEM disciplines contribute to both engineering and biological research.  Student perceived outcomes. When provided open ended questions about their perceived outcomes from the summer REU experience, interns almost uniformly noted that they were more confident in their research abilitiy. At the end of the summers, interns quotes ranged from "no fear going into a l...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
