<AbstractNarration>Ecosystems provide a wide variety of services to human societies.  The services from riparian ecosystems in the Southwest United States derive from the presence of water in a dry land and a web of physical, biological and human processes. Southwestern rivers have been significantly altered by human impacts through surface water diversions, damming, groundwater extraction and impacts from land use change. This project seeks to understand how ecosystem services change in response to extraction or addition of water to ecosystems due to population change and climate change.  The project will look at how the value of ecosystem services changes in response to decreases in water availability and to increases in water availability to these systems. The standing hypothesis is that once dewatered, restoration of hydrologic conditions will result in a lower level of ecosystem services and value than was originally found in these ecosystems.  The utilization of existing data on dewatering and on restoration will provide a robust library of understanding of how the value of ecosystems services in riparian systems change in response to hydrologic and biological conditions.  This library of knowledge will then be used to understand how these systems might respond to drivers of change in these systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further understanding of the interaction of physical, biological and economic processes in free flowing river systems will better inform management in more controlled and human affected systems such as dammed rivers or rivers with large amounts of diversion for agriculture.  Since this project will project the potential effects of future changes in population change and climate change, it is important that these efforts be transferred quickly to the decision-making realm. This project's team incorporates federal, state and local stakeholders. Interaction with these stakeholders will ensure that this research is relevant and can quickly be applied in the real world.  This interaction will also expose students and post-doctoral researchers to potential career paths across the earth, ecosystem and economic sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our objective with this research was to understand if ecological thresholds exist for public goods, specifically trying to understand how individuals value ecological goods such as the San Pedro and Santa Cruz Rivers.  Working with the physical scientists on the project to synthesize the scientific results of future impacts to these two river systems as a result of climatic change, we developed a choice experimental framework that allowed us to elicit responses in a controlled focus group setting.  Because we needed to account for time in the framework, due to the drivers of change for both river systems depending upon time, we employed a contingent choice framework where each response is contingent upon the previous response or responses.  This framework led to 27 different endpoints that could occur for the two river systems which allowed participants to either preserve one of the river systems at the expense of the other, or allow each system to be degraded.  We were able to observe evidence of ecological thresholds as individual and group choices were altered as the participants progressed through the three contingent choice questions that were presented.  We define a threshold as changing preferences as participants observed a quantifiable decline in a river system.  For instance, nine of the fifteen experimental sessions initially chose to preserve the San Pedro at the expense of the Santa Cruz, in the second question five of these groups chose to opt to preserve the Santa Cruz at this new lower state allowing the San Pedro to decline.  This indicates that the conditions in the Santa Cruz had decreased such that the marginal utility of preservation efforts in the Santa Cruz were perceived to be greater in the second question for these participants than the San Pedro.      While the conditional choice questions framework allowed us to track preferences through time we are not able to quantify the level of the ecological threshold.  In order to quantify threshold levels a larger set of economic experiments would need to be conducted that varies the ecological conditions across the experimental sessions.  As we worked to synthesize the results of the scientific models we did not vary the level of decline for the two river systems across our focus groups.  Such a procedure would require a large data collection effort which wasnÆt the focus of our research project.
