<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A study was designed and conducted at the China Agricultural University to determine the effect of lactic acid on neonatal lymphocytes and foster collaborative researcher between U.S. and Chinese researchers.  Lactic acid is produced in the intestine and bowel by lactic acid producing bacteria.  Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria are greater in number in breast-fed infants compared to formula-fed infants and the incidence of disease is lower in breast-fed infants than formula-fed infants.  It is therefore hypothesized that there is a link between intestinal bacterial communities and their by-products and the maturation of the immune system in infants.  Previous work has shown such a link with other fermentation products, but research is lacking in regards to lactic acid.  Lymphocytes were isolated from newborn piglets and treated with lactic acid, lactic acid mixed with other acid by-products of fermentation, acid by-products without lactic acid and a control without any acids.  The levels of the acids were reflective of normal physiological levels found in the mammalian intestine.  After 24 hours, the cells were stimulated by a T cell specific stimulator, ConA.  The cytokines IL-4 (to determine Th2 activation) and IL-10 (to determine Treg activation) were measured, but the levels were undetectable.  Previous work with lymphocytes from older pigs has shown to be detectable after ConA stimulation.  These results show that IL-4 and IL-10 production is much lower in newborns.  The TNF&alpha; levels were not significantly different, but there was an 8% in production due to lactic acid.  TNF&alpha; are an indication of Th1 repsonse in the infant, a response that is suppressed in utero and needed to prevent infections.  Further work is needed to determine if lactic acid was able to increase Th1 response.  The purpose of the fellowship is to allow students to interact and develop collaborations abroad.  As an EAPSI fellow studying in Beijing, I was under the direction of Dr. Yuming Guo, an Associate Dean of the College of Animal Science and Technology at China Agriculture University (CAU).  I worked in collaboration with Yan Guiling and Sidoeun Bun on this project and collaborated with other students to assist with sample collection and laboratory analysis for their projects.  I traveled with Dr. Guo while he was assisting a poultry company in Hebei to try and determine why some of the broilers were not growing correctly.  Since returning to the US I have helped edit two manuscripts from Dr.Guo's lab and two manuscripts from China Agricultural University that were not from Dr. GuoÃ†s lab.  I currently am collaborating with a student whom I meet at CAU in my home University laboratory.       Last Modified: 06/01/2011       Submitted by: Tina M Herfel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
