<AbstractNarration>This is a workshop award to organize the US-Israel Workshop on Sustainable Buildings: Materials and Energy from July 12-13, 2010, in Haifa, Israel. The workshop will provide a vehicle for exploration and discussion of long-term barriers to sustainable buildings and the innovations required to overcome them. The workshop will focus on two broad areas of sustainability in buildings: (1) the materials used in the construction and operation of buildings and their systems and (2) the role of building materials on the energy required to maintain a comfortable, healthy, and productive indoor environment. In each area, the workshop will include emphases on the development of materials and systems as well as the models, theories, and data required to effectively analyze the long-term impact of sustainable buildings through life cycle assessment (LCA). The expected outcome of the two-day workshop will be a report that identifies needs and opportunities for innovation and describes research pathways to deliver on the promise of sustainable buildings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by promoting collaborations among US academic institutions and international partnerships between institutions in Israel and the US. The workshop will engage researchers and educators from multiple disciplines in engineering and architecture, including researchers who have not traditionally worked in the field of sustainable buildings, and will disseminate its results to the diverse community through the conference website. Since building impose such a significant impact on the global environment, the research program for sustainable buildings developed by the workshop can have far-reaching benefits to society in the US, in Israel, and worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

Grace  Dean, College of Engineering  Lawrence Technological University  Alissa Kendall  Assistant Professor  University of California Davis  Michael J. Brandemuehl  Professor  University of Colorado at Boulder     A two-day long international workshop was organized by the Center for Innovative Materials Research (CIMR) at Lawrence Technological University in conjunction with University of Colorado and University of California, Davis hosted by Technion - Israel Institute of Technology on July 12-13, 2010. Building on the strengths of both Israeli and U.S. expertise in architecture, building and material sciences, and energy and environmental building technologies and design, participation of both Israeli and U.S delegates allowed for cross-pollination of ideas and knowledge unique to researchers and experiences in both countries.  Delegates from both countries presented original research and then engaged in group break-out sessions that led to more in-depth, targeted discussion between delegates.  Workshop details and presentations are available at: http://technion.ac.il/~sustain/index.htm.  During workshop breakout sessions participants from both countries came together to identify key gaps in current knowledge and practice in the design and implementation of sustainable buildings and related technologies.  In general, participants identified a lack of collaborative, multi-disciplinary research and practice within academic and professional environments as key obstacles.  In particular, participants noted the absence of behavioral sciences in building research, despite the influence of human decisionmaking on the environmental performance of building systems.  There was broad agreement among workshop participants on the value of life cycle assessment as an evaluation tool for sustainability, but also agreement that there were significant barriers to successful implementation. Life cycle assessment is a holistic approach to understanding the environmental performance of systems.  It tracks energy and environmental flows over a system's entire lifetime, as well as flows associated with upstream processes, such as the production of building materials and the generation of electricity.  This kind of modeling requires life cycle inventory datasets. Currently, most life cycle inventory data is housed in proprietary, commercial databases which are costly to access. The lack of public, open-source data makes life cycle assessment expensive and difficult to conduct.  This led to a recommendation that partnerships between government, industry and the research community be formed to generate free, high-quality, and transparent life cycle inventory data.  In addition, participants observed that the emergence and adoption of building information modeling, a computer-based approach to facilitating building design, construction, and operation, presents new opportunities for integrating life cycle assessment and other quantitative approaches to modeling sustainability during each step in the building life cycle. Doing so would allow architects, engineers, and building users and managers to improve the sustainability of their buildings.  A course has been developed at UC Davis that reflects the findings of this workshop to prepare future engineers, designers and landscape architects to design more sustainable sites and buildings. The course brings students together from engineering, design, and landscape architecture in project&ndash;based courses.  The courses instruct students on integrated design methods, life cycle assessment, building standards and building information modeling software. Students from multiple disciplines then design a building together while continually interacting with stakeholders and building occupants to understand how the design of their site and structure affects economic and environmental performance, as well as th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
