<AbstractNarration>The American Statistical Association (ASA) will use this grant for 20 United States participants to attend the 58th Session of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) in Dublin, Ireland from August 21-26, 2011.  The ISI meeting includes the meetings of the Bernoulli Society, International Association for Official Statistics (IAOS), International Association for Statistical Computing (IASC), International Association of Survey Statisticians (IASS), and the International Association for Statistical Education (IASE).  Thus it is an umbrella meeting with sessions of interest for thousands of statisticians.  The travel grant will provide support to defray transportation costs for individuals selected from institutions and non-profit associations. An emphasis of the award is to encourage and provide the opportunity for younger statisticians to participate in the meeting.  Participants will be notified of the availability of the travel grant through Amstat News, a membership publication of the ASA, and on the ASA Home Page on the Internet. Notices will be provided to university and college statistics and mathematics departments to encourage younger statisticians to apply for the travel grant. A review and selection committee will be established to review the applications and select grantees.  The committee will be comprised of three or more ASA members and will convene at the ASA office in Alexandria, Virginia.  Special consideration will be given to statisticians who have recently received their Ph.D.?s and to women and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Statistical Association (ASA) will use this grant for 20 United States participants to attend the 58th Session of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) in Dublin, Ireland from August 21-26, 2011.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report     NSF: 1045137     This award provided funding for eight recipients to attend the 58th Session of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) held in Dublin, Ireland from August 21-26, 2011. Special emphasis was placed on newer faculty (those who have completed Ph.D. requirements in 2002 or later), women, and minorities to apply and receive funding.     The ISI is an international professional society whose membership is drawn from individual scientists, national statistical offices and their representatives, and national professional associations.  It was established in 1885 and now has eight sections:  (1) the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability, (2) the International Association of Survey Statisticians (IASS), (3) the International Association for Statistical Computing (IASC), (4) the International Association for Official Statistics (IAOS), (5) the International Association for Statistical Education (IASE), (6) the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC), (7) the International Environmetrics Society (TIES), (8) and the International Society for Business and Industrial Statistics (ISBIS).     During the 58th Session of the ISI, several sections held meetings, not only within the general program, but also as independent "satellite" meetings from all parts of the world.  These smaller, more focused meetings brought together experts in numerous fields throughout the world, as well as many younger researchers from Ireland who had a unique opportunity to meet, converse with, and discuss specific programs with the outstanding experts in the particular areas. The Session also attracted a significant number of statisticians from the developing and less-developed countries as well as a large number of government statisticians. The sessionÆs topics reflect this attendance, as exemplified by a "Water Theme Day" in which many sessions related to water issues around the world.     Also meeting in conjunction with the ISI were specific groups with interest in applied statistics in the medical sciences, Bayesian statistics, and matrix methods for statistics, as well as other special interest groups.  The convergence of the foremost statisticians in the world is often a good forum to present different research results and educational activities in statistics.  Further, the meeting provided a primary opportunity to put together individuals in various areas of research, not only in theoretical statistics, but many areas of application, ranging from the behavioral, social, and physical sciences, to health sciences and engineering.  Copies of individual papers were made available during the meeting and proceedings of the Session will be published.
