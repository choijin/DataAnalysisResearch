<AbstractNarration>Bacterial pathogens are diverse and important enemies of plants. In agriculture, these pathogens cause significant destruction of crops and necessitate costly applications of antibiotics. How is it that wild plants are able to resist infection by these same bacteria? If the resistance mechanisms of wild plants can be identified, they can be used to improve the resistance of crops. Towards this goal, this research team has discovered that some wild collected plants of Arabidopsis thaliana are dramatically more resistant to infection by the virulent bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. The focus of the current project is to understand how elevated resistance in these plants is accomplished. For this purpose, the researchers use a powerful new approach, genome-wide association mapping, combined with mining of microarray data on gene expression, to identify focal candidate genes. RNAi knockdown lines will be created for these focal genes in the Stewart Lab and characterized in the Traw Lab for defects in plant resistance. In addition, plants lacking functional copies of these genes will be complemented with resistance allele candidates in both labs and tested in the Traw Lab to determine whether resistance is restored to those lines. Finally, given suspected roles of several candidates in membrane transport, broad and focused metabolite screening will be conducted by the Traw Lab using a subset of the experimental lines. One of the novel candidate genes is involved in the downstream response to abscisic acid. Allelic variation at that locus may therefore help explain how this bacterial pathogen is able to hijack the abscisic acid pathway in some plants. Thus, the project will provide strong insights into the mechanisms of natural plant resistance to bacteria. The findings are likely to contribute to the improvement of crop yields and reduction of exogenous antibiotic use in agriculture. The research may also contribute to improved treatment of bacterial diseases in humans. The project will advance the training of two postdocs and a graduate student, and will be used to create a series of laboratories that can be used in the teaching of introductory biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bacterial pathogens are ubiquitous and important enemies of plants. In agriculture, these pathogens destroy crops and necessitate costly applications of antibiotics. Because wild plants have been exposed to natural pathogens for many generations, they are likely to yield valuable new strategies for defense against pathogen attack.  If the resistance mechanisms of these wild plants can be identified, they can be used to improve the resistance of crops.   Towards this goal, our research team discovered that some wild-collected plants of Arabidopsis thaliana are dramatically more resistant to infection by the virulent bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000). The focus of the current project was to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance in these wild plants.  The two specific aims of our grant were  1) to identify genetic variation responsible for high natural resistance of plants to Pst DC3000, and 2) to characterize the roles of ABCG16-18, which are three tandem white-brown class ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters forming a tight locus.   We found 14 major loci containing 59 genes that are candidates for resistance to Pst DC3000, addressing Specific Aim#1.  We also found that knockouts of ABCG16 have impaired tolerance to exogenous ABA, addressing Specific Aim #2.  Our collaborators at the University of Tennessee showed that the ABCG16 protein is localizes to the plasma membrane.  Collectively these results were consistent with the hypothesis that ABCG16 transports ABA and is involved with managing plant hormonal stresses in the environment.  We published these findings last year  in  Plant Physiology, a leading research journal.   Collectively, the project has resulted in one new book (Microbiome community ecology: fundamentals and applications) and  four peer-reviewed publications, as well as 21 invited talks and posters presented to academic and general audiences.  Several additional manuscripts are in the review process.  The project has advanced significantly the careers of nine individuals here at the University of Pittsburgh.  Because of the importance of bacterial pathogens in human health, six members of our group have gone on to pursue human health-related professions.    In summary, our research has pushed the boundaries of our knowledge about how plants work and tolerate stress in their environments.  The tolerance of stress is of great importance both to human health and in agricultural crops.  Research that improves our understanding of stress responses is likely therefore to have a strong positive benefit to society.
