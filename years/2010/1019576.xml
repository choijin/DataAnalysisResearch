<AbstractNarration>This project is a collaborative effort of the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) at Rutgers University, Perth Amboy Public Schools, Elizabeth Public Schools, Long Branch Public Schools, and Open Minds, LLC with the overarching goal of improving the readiness of dual language learners (DLL) for kindergarten.  Based on research indicating that very young learners can accomplish more than we have expected of them and that inquiry-based science programs and literacy programs are mutually supportive, especially for English language learners, the project is designing,  implementing, and studying the effects of workshops for 48 teachers of 3 and 4 year-olds in three urban school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will monitor the extent to which teachers adopt and implement recommended instructional approaches and the impacts of the professional development experience on their attitudes and knowledge.  The data will provide preliminary answers to three questions about the professional development model: 1) Does the PD experience enhance teacher knowledge and classroom interactions around mathematics and science? 2) Does it enhance classroom supports for dual language learners? and 3) Does the PD experience produce results confirming that math and science experiences can contribute to, rather than detract from, language development and literacy learning for all students?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key outcomes of the project will be insights into the effects of integrated mathematics, science, and literacy instruction for very young children and, potentially a model for teacher professional development that encourages such content integration.</AbstractNarration>
