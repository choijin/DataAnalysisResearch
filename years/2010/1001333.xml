<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to explore individually addressable high density arrays of specialty diodes (p/n junction, Schottky, Zener, metal-semiconductor-metal and tunnel structures) made from vertical silicon and germanium nanowires grown with the vapor-liquid-solid method.  It will study the diode performance and design interaction with the nanowire characteristics while addressing processing challenges.  Arrays of such diodes have applications ranging from select devices for crosspoint memories to optical sensing and energy scavenging.  The approach is based on bottom-up fabrication of vertical Si, Ge, and Si/Ge heterostructure nanowires grown with in-situ doping.  It combines the seed and growth capabilities developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies with the wafer processing and device modeling, design, and testing expertise at Arizona State University.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of this work lie in understanding the interactions between the growth process, the resulting physical junction, and the electrical behavior of the diode.  Modeling of the transport characteristics of these nanowire diodes will be compared to experimental results such as the current voltage characteristics.  &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research lie in its educational component and the potential value to the electronics industry.  The opportunity for the student to work with researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies is especially valuable.  Since the research is aimed at enabling the early introduction of nanowire devices into mainstream CMOS technology, there is a potentially large impact on an industry which is important to our national competitiveness and to society in general.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanowire Specialty Diodes for Integrated Applications  Background  The successful efforts of industry to shrink the size of the silicon transistor have enabled the wide range of microprocessor based computing and communication devices that our society relies upon.  One approach is to use the third or vertical dimension, building the new devices in vertical nanowires and looking to stack devices on top of one another rather than side by side. Nanowires are tiny cylinders of material with diameters much less than their lengths. Their diameters are so small that they cannot be seen under an optical microscope, and when stacked side by side approximately a million or more will fit in a half inch space. When made from semiconducting materials such as silicon, one can build electronic devices in the nanowire and then put many devices together on a small area semiconductor chip.   In trying to integrate or add vertical devices on top of existing planar circuits, there are some difficult challenges and questions, among which are:  How does one place the vertical device at a precise      location without disturbing the pre-existing transistors? Once the vertical devices are connected with metal      traces into a circuit do they perform differently?     Research  This research explored answers to these questions using individually addressable high density arrays of nanowire specialty diodes.  Different methods of forming the nanowires were examined, including growth techniques developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies and etching techniques developed at Arizona State University.  Building diodes into the nanowires was done at the NanoFab at Arizona State.    The nanowires were formed in the vertical direction, much like a forest of closely spaced trees but in a periodic array so each wire is in a known location and ready to receive the top electrical contact. An example of such an array created using the growth technique at Los Alamos is shown in Figure 1, where the precise location of each wire is determined by a lithographically defined seed pattern before the sample is subjected to the growth process.  In figure 1 the nanowires are raw semiconductor material and many further steps have to be done to make the diodes and electrically connect them so they can be probed and measured.  Images at various stages of the process are shown in figure 2, starting with the seeds, then showing the vertically grown nanowires, and finally the dielectric encapsulated nanowires with the tips exposed for metal contacts to be made.  Measuring and interpreting the electrical properties of the resulting devices was a major portion of the research, since the characteristics were quite different from planar diodes made of the same material.  These differences are related to the surface of the nanowire, which has crystalline defects due to structural imperfections, to charges in the insulator surrounding the nanowire, and to electric field lines from the top metal contact reaching through the insulator to the sidewalls of the nanowire.  To explore their importance, various nanowire sizes and materials were processed, different insulating films were used, and by adjusting certain parameters in the modeling and simulation programs one could match the measured data.  Outcomes  The growth of high density arrays of vertical nanowires in defined positions in which to later build devices appears possible, but there are critical restrictions and limitations.  First, the seeds which initiate the growth migrate misplacing the nanowire location unless extra steps are taken to confine them. Next, some nanowire materials are more difficult; germanium nanowires tend to grow vertically at low temperatures while silicon nanowires require much higher temperatures and many tend to have kinks.  Finally, even with germanium and under the best of conditions, the yield is less than 100% on moderate sized arrays, which is not acceptab...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
