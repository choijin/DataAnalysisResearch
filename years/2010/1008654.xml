<AbstractNarration>Nanomagnetism is one of the most active areas in science, with a wide range of fundamental scientific problems as well as important and emerging technologies. The main focus of this joint work between investigators at the University of California-San Diego, the Institut Jean Lamour and the Universite du Paris Sud-Orsay in France is on novel nanostructured magnetic materials for spintronics and, more precisely, for spin transfer torque based memory and spin logic devices. The research has three thrust areas: (i) development and characterization of novel magnetic materials suitable for magneto-electronics, (ii) integration of these materials into nanopillars, spin-injection and wire devices and (iii) study of the influence of both intrinsic (anisotropy, damping, magnetization) and extrinsic (size and shape of devices) parameters on the magnetization dynamic due to injected current at the nanoscale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has prospects of achieving a fundamental understanding and ability to modify the properties of novel materials designed for spin-torque applications.  This research addresses fundamental issues of magnetism, dynamics and spin transport at the nanoscale and trains undergraduate and graduate students in important areas of materials synthesis and characterization, device fabrication, nano-science, and nano-technology. An understanding and control of novel magnetic materials will have broad ranging impact from understanding the performance of current magnetic devices, to assessing the potential of current control of magnetism in future spin-based electronics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
