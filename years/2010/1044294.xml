<AbstractNarration>This project is designing tools for mining and analyzing data produced via student use of the LON-CAPA homework and learning management system.  The tools are improving the ability of the system to respond to individual user (student, instructor, and author) needs. New tools are being developed, implemented, and tested in a Newtonian Mechanics course at MIT, and fully developed tools are being integrated into the production version of LON-CAPA, where they are available to all users.  The tools are housed in an open-source system, allowing easy adoption and refinement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project is producing tools that gather and analyze information on difficulty, time, and discrimination of assessment items; analyze user data to help improve assessment items; provide a user-ranked asset window that provides resources in order of utility based on past use and solicits students to suggest new resources; and provide information to authors and instructors about which FAQs and comments students select, allowing identification of items that are most useful to student learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing the potential to monitor individual and class performance reliably, to guide instruction effectively, and to dramatically enhance the effectiveness of individual instructional and assessment items.  In particular, the tools may lead to customized tutoring by recommending optimal item-by-item instructional paths to individual learners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Spreading Use of NSDL Resources Using a MOOC  Shortly after our grant period started, NSF announced the termination of support for the National Science Digital Library, emphasizing the difficulty of getting teachers to use open educational resources, an obviously valuable payoff of digital education.  We made a free open online course for teachers that would expose them to the problems and eText that they could share or use on paper or in open source learning systems.  This builds on the experience of the PI in writing (with his son) cybertutor.mit.edu which has now become MasteringPhysics.com, MasteringChemistry.com, etc. where a searchable library of vetted assessment items can be assigned to students and automatically graded by the click of the teacherÃ†s mouse. A Small Open Online Course for Teachers  RELATE has slowly assembled a complete online course [TPR10] centered around our top-quality educational resources: homework with problems labeled easy, medium and hard [TSC11]; our short e-text that is intertwined with short videos, simulations, and checkpoint questions; and moderated discussion forums for each topic to be learned and for each problem.  This course was offered for free in both Spring (S12) and Summer 2012 (U12), both times on the LONCAPA.org platform.    Figure 1.  The number of students at various stages of the open online courses weÃ†ve run or studied for each certificate granted.  This number is ~20 in typical MOOCs  We were surprised to discover that the spring 2012 course attracted over 15% teachers (we had expected to attract their best students).  We therefore oriented our Summer 2012 course specifically for teachers. We made posts about it on listserves, got friendly organizations to announce it, and offered continuing education credits through AAPT to entice high school teachers especially.  Concentrating the course on teachers is a powerful dissemination of the enlightening/challenging problems that we got from NSDL or wrote ourselves.  Although only ~700 people registered for the summer 2012 course, we granted 117 certificates of satisfactory completion, a whopping 90% to teachers.  This is the lowest fractional attrition of any MOOC in STEM so far (the corresponding numbers for the Spring course were ~2700 and 67).  Impressively, 74% of those who attempted over &frac14; of weekly homework assignment #2 received a certificate of satisfactory completion.  We note that if 74% of students who made any attempt on the second assignment of an on-campus elective course received a passing grade, the Dean of Education would be pleased. We predict that our summer course will foreshadow future MOOCs where targeting a particular audience will lead to less attrition.  The teachers lauded the course, with some spontaneous quotes from the last discussion board in the course:  The difficulty of the problem sets and the discussions they brought about helped me to see the difficulties that my students face on a daily basis and also helped reinforce my own understanding.  Learning to formulate a problem in terms of SIM has helped me in solving many problems that I would have otherwise struggled to solve.  Awesome course with great problem-approach methods and even better problems.  Unlike MITx, Coursera and Udacity, there is more text broken into convenient parts which I prefer. The videos were good, but I preferred examples and derivations done in text.  I will recommend this course very strongly for my own AP Physics students next year as we do the Mechanics only course in the first two trimesters of the year. This would be a great review for them during third trimester when they are doing independent projects.  Even though they [the homework problems] only required introductory mechanics concepts, you were forced to carefully and systematically apply this knowledge to solve them. It's great when you can say that a particular problem was fun or that you learned a great deal from solving it.   A Massive Open Online C...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
