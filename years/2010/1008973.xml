<AbstractNarration>This project examines supersonic flows in dispersive fluids experiencing negligible dissipative effects.  The main objective is to develop an understanding of fundamental excitations in dispersive fluids which are physically relevant for a number of systems including Bose-Einstein condensates, optics, plasma, and shallow water.  Such excitations include oblique dispersive shock waves which will be constructed for a number of nonlinear dispersive wave equations. Properties, including stability and the behavior of interacting dispersive shock waves, will be investigated and applied to the study of multidimensional boundary value problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thunder, the crack of a whip, and the boom heard from a jet plane surpassing the speed of sound are familiar occurrences in human experience and all result from the generation of viscous shock waves. This project will focus on a very different type of shock wave that propagates through dispersive media such as the superfluidic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), nonlinear photonic crystals, plasma, and shallow water.  Applications of this theory include the control of nonlinear waves, fostering advances in modern technologies such as matter lasers, atomic interferometry, and imaging.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project was to develop a mathematical description of a certain class of fluid dynamics termed dispersive hydrodynamics, providing fundamental physical and mathematical insight.  In systems of this type, which include superfluids, optical wavefields, water waves, and plasma, the medium exhibits the peculiar property that energy is either not dissipated or only weakly dissipated.  Rather, energy is conserved but disperses via wave packets whose propagation depends strongly on the packet wavelength.  As such, the generation of shock waves in supersonic flow of these media does not occur via traditional physical mechanisms where the shock front exhibits a sharp transition between two fluid states (e.g., a jump in pressure for a shock in air).  Instead, an expanding, oscillatory, structured wavetrain can be generated, which we call a dispersive shock wave (DSW).  The work supported by this project addressed the following key issues, all working toward a physically relevant mathematical description of DSWs:  What is the description of DSWs in dispersive Eulerian fluids, i.e. fluids that exhibit conservation of mass and momentum with a concept of pressure and no dissipative loss. Can existing DSW theory be extended to multiple spatial dimensions? Can DSW theory be applied to modern laboratory systems?   With regard to the first, the mathematical construction of DSW solutions in dispersive Eulerian fluids as successfully performed.  This analysis yielded physical properties of the DSW, e.g., wavetrain speeds and amplitude, as well as certain admissibility criteria.  When these criteria are not satisfied, new physical features are expected and, indeed, some of these features were observed and elucidated under the auspices of this project.  Toward the second, a description of oblique DSWs was given in a model system, applicable in optical media and superfluids.  These oblique DSWs are fundamental structures expected in certain supersonic, dispersive hydrodynamic flows.  However, not all oblique DSWs are stable so a mathematical prediction for when such structures are stable was developed.  Oblique DSWs represent the first non-trivial, multi-dimensional dynamics encountered in dispersive hydrodynamics.  With regard to the third, this project included several joint works with experimentalists in ultracold atomic physics, identifying and understanding their superfluid observations.  These experiments are at the cutting edge of fundamental physics.  Additionally, a new laboratory was formed by the PI in order to undertake dispersive hydrodynamics experiments directly.  The system studied involves deformable viscous fluid conduits with, e.g., corn syrup and diluted corn syrup.  For this, a mathematical model was derived and analyzed, providing a detailed, mathematical description of DSWs and another fundamental wave structure, the soliton.  The geometry of two soliton interactions was theoretically analyzed and favorably compared with experiment (see supporting image).  This viscous fluid conduit system holds promise as a model system in which to study generic dispersive hydrodynamics.  Additionally, it provides a tool for learning about nonlinear waves in a physically accessible system.    In the process of this research, the PI mentored a number of students, developed domestic and international collaborations, and gave presentations at universities and conferences.
