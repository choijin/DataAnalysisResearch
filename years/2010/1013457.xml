<AbstractNarration>University of Hawaii requests funds to purchase oceanographic instrumentation and equipment in support of the multidisciplinary NSF/UNOLS projects to be undertaken on R/V Kilo Moana, a 185? general purpose research vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. &lt;br/&gt;The requests, in order of priority are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Turner 10-AU Fluorometer&lt;br/&gt;2) Network Upgrades &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported through the Oceanographic Instrumentation program at NSF provided funds to acquire a fluorometer and computer networking components to upgrade the research capabilities of R/V Kilo Moana, a research vessel operated by University of Hawaii as part of the academic oceanographic research fleet (University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, or UNOLS).  These upgrades to the shipboard data acquisition and management systems on the vessel will be used by most users of the ship, which undertakes biological, physical, chemical and geological oceanographic research throughout the Pacific Ocean.  The instrumentation aboard the vessel is available for use by all researchers, who come from universities and research laboratories across the US and internationally.  The majority of researchers using the ship are NSF-funded.  The ship is owned by the federal government (US Navy) and operated by University of Hawaii under a charter party agreement with the Office of Naval Research and a cooperative agreement with NSF.  There is no separate charge to NSF-funded researchers (or other federally-funded researchers) to use the shared-use instruments on the vessel, and it is our objective to provide well-calibrated, well-maintained, cutting edge systems for users, with trained technical personnel to support excellent scientific research.  The funds provided here contributed to that goal.       Last Modified: 07/30/2011       Submitted by: Alexander N Shor]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
