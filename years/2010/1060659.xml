<AbstractNarration>The MAX (Mentored Academic Experience) Scholarship Program builds on prior, highly successful scholarship programs at Minnesota State University (MSU), Mankato.  The current scholarship program is providing 104 scholarships to at least 60 students over four years to enhance opportunities for academically-talented, financially-challenged students enrolled in the following majors in the MSU College of Science, Engineering and Technology: Mathematics; Computer Science; Information Technology; Biology; Chemistry; Physics; Electrical, Mechanical, Civil, and Computer Engineering; and Electronic, Manufacturing, Automotive and Computer Engineering Technology.  Scholarships are available for 26 students per year, starting in their sophomore years at MSU, and are renewable for up to three years.  Of the 26, approximately 4 scholars per year are from the Iron Range Engineering program, an upper-division engineering program that draws students from community colleges, which grants MSU degrees to students who will serve the technical needs of companies in the northeast corner of Minnesota where mining is the primary industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholarship program is creating and maintaining a diverse, interdisciplinary cohort each year starting with scholar selection and recruitment.  The selection process is guided by the program goals of 1) increasing the number of underrepresented students in the targeted STEM majors, 2) improving student retention and 3) facilitating professional development of student scholars.  Additional recruitment activities involve seeking ways to attract non-traditional students, and partnering with community colleges, specifically Itasca Community College and Mesabi Range College, to promote and provide educational opportunities over a wider geographic area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MAX Scholarship Program provides mentoring, financial support, community building, and opportunities to participate in undergraduate research and/or internships.  An essential feature of the program is the building of strong interdisciplinary mentoring cohorts that foster academic engagement among the participants.  As such, scholarship recipients participate in an active mentoring program focusing on interdisciplinary interactions, academic support and professional development.  This interdisciplinary peer-mentoring model was established during the initial implementation of the MAX Scholarship Program, and now includes students studying at a remote campus as well as in a broader range of science majors.  All of this work builds upon a STEM integrated network developed at MSU that seeks to understand and address the significant challenges facing students in order to eliminate retention problems and to guide students through their STEM majors, as well as the need for connection and community for STEM majors across disciplines.  Additional efforts to develop community and a sense of belonging for the scholars include a weekly seminar, field trips, interdisciplinary projects, interaction with industry partners and alumni, and opportunities to apply theory in research or industry settings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "MAX Scholarships: Interdisciplinary Mentored Academic EXperience for STEM Success" project at Minnesota State University, Mankato (MSU) was funded by the National Science Foundation through the S-STEM award DUE-1060659 from 2011 &ndash; 2016 (including a one-year, no-cost extension).  The project was known on campus as the MAX Scholars program.  The goals of the project were to increase the number of underrepresented students in the targeted STEM majors, improve retention and graduation, and provide professional development and a cohort community of support for scholarship recipients and faculty mentors.  The project awarded 133 scholarships over its five year duration with most of these awards at $5000 each.  An individual student could receive the award for up to three years if they maintained financial and academic eligibility.  With this competitive renewal process, the 133 scholarships were awarded to 75 unique students.   Of the 75 students receiving scholarships through this S-STEM grant:  96% (72) were retained (current student) or graduated in a STEM major, 24% (18) were students of color (African American, Hispanic or multiple), and 37% (28) were female.   These benchmarks for the MAX Scholars program are significantly higher than the university percentages including all STEM majors (based on 2005-2012 institutional data) of 52% retained or graduated, 17% students of color, and 27% female.  The project used a multidisciplinary approach to engage students from diverse STEM majors in a cohort experience with peer and faculty mentoring and academic and professional development. The MAX Scholars received financial support from the S-STEM scholarship and participated in a weekly seminar. The program was led by a team of 4-5 multidisciplinary faculty serving as curriculum designers, seminar leaders, and mentors. These faculty mentors have represented biology, computer science, computer information science, engineering, engineering technology, math, and technical communication. In addition, the program funded a graduate assistant in the Experiential Education program who helped coordinate the seminar and other activities.  A continuous improvement process was guided by the program goals and implemented through its structural supports: scholarship awards, mentoring, weekly seminars, annual retreats, and multidisciplinary group projects.  Approximately 15% of the scholarships were awarded to students in the MSU +2 Iron Range Engineering (IRE) program located at a satellite campus in northern Minnesota. These students participated in the MAX scholars program through video conferencing during the weekly seminar and were able to build community with the on-campus Scholars through tools such as Skype for small group discussions.

Our program has also demonstrated success in addressing issues noted as important to the field and accreditation boards, such as functioning on multidisciplinary teams, understanding ethical responsibilities, and developing a sense of the global and societal context of STEM work. Past recipients of the MAX scholarship have gone on to graduate school and STEM industry, but they remain connected through a LinkedIn group.  Intellectual Merit: The MAX Scholars program was successful at increasing retention and graduation rates for participants compared to university rates for all STEM majors.  It achieved program goals of providing professional development and a cohort community of support for scholarship recipients and faculty mentors. A cornerstone of the MAX Scholars program was its multidisciplinary cohort, which also included students at a satellite campus in northern Minnesota. Developing distance-based communication skills by working with team members on a satellite campus was valuable for all students involved in the MAX scholars program. The community of support provided through the multidisciplinary cohort was highlighted by participants as a vital element in their academic success.   Broader Impacts: The MAX Scholars program had broad participation of underrepresented groups in its multidisciplinary STEM mentoring community.  Scholarship recipients were strongly encouraged through the program to participate in either undergraduate research or industry internship experiences.  The MAX Scholars program provided opportunities for scholars to apply disciplinary theory to real world, societal issues by working in multidisciplinary teams; improve academic success through seminar activities; and develop professional and life skills.  The program also provided multidisciplinary team experiences and professional development opportunities for the STEM faculty mentors and experiential education graduate students working on the project.  Project findings were disseminated through presentations and publications to the broader academic community.       Last Modified: 10/21/2016       Submitted by: Deborah K Nykanen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
