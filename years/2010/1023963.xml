<AbstractNarration>The United States has significant vulnerabilities with respect to Information Assurance (IA).  US colleges and universities need to increase the number of qualified professionals to help respond to this threat.  This project supports travel for seven US educators and other Information Assurance (IA) experts to attend a working group meeting in Ankara, Turkey.  The focus of the working group is to examine key governmental and industry IA education standards and the curricula of existing academic programs.  An expected outcome is a report that defines the IA education space along with specific curricular recommendations for a selected topic.  This effort is the initial step to developing comprehensive IA curricular recommendations.</AbstractNarration>

NSA (the federal agency that accredits Centers for Academic Excellence in IA education and research at both the two-year and four-year school levels, in conjunction with DHS) is comfortable with this proposed effort to develop a newer and more "academic" approach towards curricular guidelines, and many universities will be able to use the new guidelines to develop their own IA programs.
