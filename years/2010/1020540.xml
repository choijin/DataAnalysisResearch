<AbstractNarration>Grassland ecosystems comprise over 30% of the Earth's terrestrial surface, and provide a resource base for extensive agricultural activities such as ranching. Grasslands are sensitive to climate change because they exist where hot, dry weather is common and rainfall is unpredictable, and because their plant communities may rapidly shift in response to rising climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Grassland soils contain large stores of long-lived carbon, which could either buffer climate change, or accelerate it if this carbon is released to the atmosphere. Soil microbial communities are the ultimate drivers of soil carbon uptake or loss. This project investigates how plant-microbe interactions regulate soil carbon cycling within an ongoing, state-of-the-art, manipulative climate change experiment in grasslands near Cheyenne, Wyoming, the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) experiment. Thirty plots are exposed to combinations of climate conditions, including warming and CO2 conditions expected to occur before the end of the 21st century, and altered precipitation. An important component of the experiment is the comparison of carbon and nutrient cycling between native and disturbed grasslands with distinct plant communities, including invasive species. Laboratory and growth chamber experiments applying molecular and isotopic methods will test specific hypotheses generated from observations and measurements in the field. This project is expected to reduce uncertainties related to interactions between soil nutrients, biological communities and climate change, leading to improved predictions of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations and associated warming effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will reach out to agricultural resource management agencies, ranchers and landowners who are concerned about impacts of climate change, disturbance and weed invasion on rangeland productivity, by conducting annual Field Days at the PHACE site and publishing articles in the popular press. Cross-site collaboration and data synthesis will be promoted by incorporating soil data into a comprehensive database. The project will provide strong interdisciplinary training to two graduate students, several undergraduates, and two postdoctoral scientists from under-represented groups. In-service middle school science teachers participating in the University of Wyoming Master's of Science in Natural Science degree program will be invited to the field site for hands-on lesson development, and minority high school students will be mentored. The new Summer Soil Institute at Colorado State University (http://soilinstitute.nrel.colostate.edu) will bring students to the PHACE field site for sampling and analyses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Grassland ecosystems, which encompass a large portion of the western United States, are facing rapid environmental changes.  This includes elevated carbon dioxide levels which could help plants grow faster, but also a higher frequency of droughts and a generally warmer climate.  Because of the importance of this ecosystem for supporting grazing, wildlife, clean air and water, and beauftiful landscapes, we need to understand how they will resond to this change if we are to better manage them.  This project was part of a larger experiment to examine how all of the components of a mixed grass prairie respond to elevated carbon dioxide and warming.  Under warmer temperatures, the metabolism of living organisms tends to speed up.  This is true for the microbes that live in soils and release nutrients as they decompose dead plant material. Prior to the experiment, we thought that the types of bacteria and fungi living in these soils would change in response to warming and as the plants responded to elevated carbon dioxide.  However, we found that natural variation in weather over several years of study was more important than the experimental treatment.  We also found that the microbes weren't responding very strongly to the warming treatment directly, but were responding to what the plants were doing.  For example, the chemistry of plant leaves responded to warming by producing more stress compounds.  And the microbes noticed, in that the plant litter grown under future climate conditions was used differently than the control litter.  The microbes perhaps found it less tastey, and weren't able to produce the same types of enzymes to degrade it.    We decided to follow-up on these close linkages between plants and microbes, and studied how different plant species in this system recruited different types of microbes in their rooting system.  It apears that plants support microbes that give them an advantage over other species, by making nutrients available at the time when plant uptake is greatest.    These insights into how plants support beneficial microbes led us to attempt to apply these beneficial microbes to agricultural crops.  We developed a consortium of bacteria that make phosphorus available to plants.  Normally, phosphorus sticks to soil particles, making fertilization very inefficient.  Our microbes help release it, incresing fertilizer efficiency and boosting yields.  To get this product into the hands of growers and farmers that can use it, we commercialized this patent-pending technology and brought it to market through a startup company called Growcentia, Inc.  This is a great example of how fundamental NSF-funded research on natural systems can lead to new discoveries that can improve the health of people and our planet.
