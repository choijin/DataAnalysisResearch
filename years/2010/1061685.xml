<AbstractNarration>Latinos are now the largest ethnic minority group in the U.S. However, with regard to their inclusion in the American legal system, the fact that a nontrivial part of the Latino population does not speak English well poses a challenge for mainstream society. Currently, New Mexico is the only state that allows non-English speaking (NES) citizens to serve on juries, with the help of a certified interpreter offering simultaneous translation. This doctoral dissertation research will be the first studies to examine: (1) whether the inclusion of NES jurors has an influence on verdicts, (2) whether the inclusion of NES jurors leads to different jury experiences, and (3) the nature of public opinion toward and acceptance of this practice.  Focusing on a single county in New Mexico, Study 1 utilizes archival methods to examine whether juries in criminal cases that included NES jurors render different verdicts than comparable juries without NES jurors. By testing competing predictions from social identity theory and aversive racism theory, this study will contribute to research on juror ethnic biases by demonstrating how an NES juror might reduce or increase bias toward Latino defendants. In Study 2, former jurors will be asked to complete a survey assessing their jury experiences, opinions about the inclusion of NES jurors, and various ideologies and beliefs, such as support for English-only policies. Competing views regarding the benefits and drawbacks of working in diverse groups suggest that having NES jurors on a jury may either lead to more positive or negative jury experiences for jurors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inclusion of NES jurors in American juries is an important issue in light of demographic shifts in the U.S. This research will produce the first data on both the NES jury experience and public attitudes towards the practice, and may have implications for attorneys, judges, and court administrators in jurisdictions with high Latino populations.</AbstractNarration>
