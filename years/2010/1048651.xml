<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor Anne Kelley and colleagues Erik Menke and Tao Ye from the University of California - Merced will acquire an atomic force microscope (AFM). The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) structure and local conductivity of polymer thin films blended with nanoparticles, (b) charge transport through semiconductor nanoparticle aggregates, (c) amplification of surface induced chirality with enantioselective autocatalytic reactions, and (d) electrochemically driven nanoscale motors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An atomic force microscope is used to characterize surface topography on a nanoscale level, distinguish different molecular coverage on surfaces, unfold polymers, calculate substrate stiffness, and quantify interaction forces. The AFM generally has a cantilever with a sharp point at its end used to scan the specimen surface. When the tip is brought into proximity of a sample surface, forces between the tip and the sample lead to a deflection of the cantilever. This deflection is often measured using a laser spot reflected from the top surface of the cantilever into a detector. This instrument will be used not only in research but also for research training of students and in outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
