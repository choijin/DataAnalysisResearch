<AbstractNarration>One of the most significant revolutions in the marine sciences in recent decades has been the characterization of the fundamental role that microbes play in both oceanic and global ecology. However, despite their significance, the assessment of population size spectra, considered to be an important character of marine ecosystems, has been problematic. The issue is compounded by the fact that more than 90% of marine microbes cannot be cultured. Over the last decade, Dr. Jaffe has been working on a next generation of instruments that show promise to characterize marine microbes using visible light. The central idea of the new instrument takes advantage of the fact that the light that is scattered at the non-forward angles contains information about the smallest spatial structures in the object. Since this light is not a major component of the light imaged in conventional optical microscopy, features of conventional images are insensitive to structures smaller than ~ 1 Âµm. Although more advanced methods can exceed this criteria, their use in a routine manner to size marine microbial populations is not straightforward. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI requests funding to develop a new type of light microscope that can be used to characterize particles that are smaller than the wavelength of light. A successful demonstration that light microscopy can be used to systematically characterize sub-wavelength particles in the routine manner described here would be a significant milestone in the development of optical methods. As such, other fields of inquiry, such as cellular biology, would benefit from this methodology as the routine inference of sub wavelength cell structure has important ramifications for cell sorting, understanding cellular structure, as well as cell pathology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed optical system and analysis methods could broadly impact marine microbial ecology, bio-optical oceanography, and potentially extend to other fields such as biomedicine. The project specifically contributes to graduate education/training through support of a PhD student. Outreach to high-school applications is also outlined. But most importantly, the potential project outcomes can be used in a broad range of other biological and marine-physics fields which employ optical methods to deal with very small objects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                   One of the most significant revolutions in marine sciences in recent decades has been the characterization of the fundamental role that microbes, organisms that are generally smaller than a few micrometers, play in both oceanic and global ecology. However, despite their significance, the routine assessment of the abundance of microbes in natural populations has been difficult.  The issue is compounded by the fact that more than 90% of marine microbes cannot be cultured in the lab and thus, must be collected and quickly examined in their native environment.  In examining the contemporary state of the art, conventional methods that use light such as optical microscopy or flow cytometry, are not able to size particles that are less than .5 micrometers in diameter.  Since a considerable fraction of the ecologically important organisms are smaller than this, the development of an instrument that could size these ecologically important "players" would be of great value.  Summarily, the work accomplished under this grant verified that an experimental system that used a novel geometric arrangement of optical components could, in fact, yield data that allowed the sizing particles down to .1 micrometers, an unprecedented accomplishment for a system that uses visible light.                    As background, prior to this award, the lead investigator Dr. Jaffe had performed extensive computer simulations to investigate the advantage of using omni-directional light scatter to extend the success of particle size estimation to ever smaller particles.  The results of the simulations clearly indicated the potential improvement in using visible light for size estimation that recorded particle light scatter over a larger range of angles than had previously been explored.  Given this verification of the underlying physics, an experimental apparatus was proposed and subsequently funded to fabricate a laboratory system that would be capable of recording the necessary data.  Following the successful construction of a lab device to record this data, the program included the formulation of algorithms that would utilize the recorded experimental data to yield an estimate of particle size for these sub-.5 micrometer particles.                    As part of the research program, several types of experimental configurations were tested.  The task of recording the backward scatter from individual particles was found to be quite difficult because the small size resulted in a very small amount of scatter. Fortunately, however, a configuration was found that yielded adequate signal to noise that permitted the envisioned data to be recorded.  The configuration used oblique illumination that was then captured with (2) CCD cameras to record both a forward and backward scattered quadrant from the single particle.  Additional challenges, due to the large dynamic range in the recorded patterns were addressed via multiple recordings with different gain factors in order to synthesize a final recorded pattern.                    A simple algorithm was then used that computed a ratio of forward scatter to backward scatter, integrated over some suitable range of angles. Results indicated  that a size estimate of a variety of small polystyrene spheres (.1 micrometer to .8 micrometer) could be obtained with good accuracy using this methodology.                    In terms of broader impacts, more generally, this work demonstrates that light microscopy can be used to systematically characterize sub-wavelength particles in the routine manner described here.  As such, other fields of inquiry, such as cellular biology, would benefit from this methodology as the routine inference of sub wavelength cell structure has important ramifications for cell sorting, understanding cellular structure, as well as cell pathology.
