<AbstractNarration>Researchers from the United States, their graduate students, and colleagues from the National Museums of Kenya are conducting archaeological and geological research on the islands of Rusinga and Mfangano, near the Kenyan shores of Lake Victoria.  Genetic, fossil, and archaeological evidence suggest that the origins of living humans can be traced to early populations of Homo sapiens from the Late Pleistocene of eastern Africa, roughly 130,000-40,000 years ago.  Research on the sites of Rusinga and Mfangano provides an important opportunity to examine the biological and behavioral diversity among these eastern Africa source populations, and the social and environmental contexts that may have contributed to this diversity and ultimately, the evolutionary success of our species.  Located in equatorial eastern Africa, Lake Victoria is the largest lake on the continent and today supports diverse ecosystems and dense human populations.  Past lake size has periodically dramatically fluctuated between completely drying up and nearly doubling in size, and these events have likely had major impacts on the composition, size, and distribution of surrounding environments and human populations.  Using archaeological survey and excavation and a variety of field geological and laboratory-based geochemical and geophysical methods, past human diversity is investigated through the study of Middle Stone Age artifacts, site age is determined by correlating and dating associated volcanic ash deposits, and ancient environments are reconstructed through the analysis of sediments and fossils.  Some of these fossils include extinct species, as well as extant taxa, that are indicative of arid grassland settings, substantially differing from today's regional environment.  Integration of these data with detailed studies of neighboring lake basins contributes to our understanding of past and present patterns of climate change, particularly the timing and periodicity of pan-African intervals of increased aridity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study provides an improved understanding of Late Pleistocene paleoenvironments of eastern Africa, which has clear implications for attempts to understand and moderate the effects of global climate change today. This two-year project is providing field and laboratory training, thesis research opportunities, and professional experience for US undergraduate and graduate students.  Additionally, the project is fostering collaborations between US universities and contributes to the National Museums of Kenya and other local cultural heritage museums on Rusinga and Mfangano.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fossil and genetic evidence indicate that modern humans (Homo sapiens) originated in eastern Africa.  All living humans can trace their ancestry to populations that dispersed within and out of Africa to Eurasia, Australia, and the Americas, doing so intermittently from perhaps 100,000 to 40,000 years ago, during the cooler and drier climates of the Last Glacial Period.  These early modern human colonists replaced or assimilated all other human populations (such as Neanderthals) in the process.  The reason(s) for the evolutionary success and global distribution of our species remains poorly understood, as does the role of novel behaviors and methods of social organization.  This is especially true in the area of eastern Africa where H. sapiens likely originated. Our project focused on better understanding the behaviors of early modern humans in eastern Africa and their environmental context.  Environmental context is particularly important, as the environment places key constraints on the behaviors of human foragers (hunters, gatherers, and fishers), and environmental change is the root cause of the dispersal of many plant and animal taxa, including early hominin species such as H. erectus.  Through field and laboratory work conducted in 2010-2013 on late Pleistocene sites in the Lake Victoria region in equatorial Africa, we are able to show: 1. Similarly aged fossil- and artifact-bearing sediments are located on Rusinga Island, Mfangano Island, and at Karungu on the mainland.  The sediments preserve the same volcanic ash deposits from distant Rift Valley volcanoes, demonstrating their comparable age.  Current age estimates indicate that these sediments date to between 100,000 and 33,000 years ago, during the interval when some populations of H. sapiens left Africa.  The nature of sediments all indicate local seasonal stream or spring deposits, and isotopic analyses indicate fairly wooded conditions. 2. Unlike the sediments, the fossils from Rusinga, Mfangano, and Karungu all indicate dry grassland settings in an environment much more arid than the present, a finding corroborated by isotopic analyses of fossil teeth.  Thus, the sites that were the focus of our fieldwork represent isolated well-watered places within a larger, dry grassland environment.  The fossils include a number of extinct species (primarily large-bodied herbivores) with adaptations to dry grasslands, and Rusinga Island in particular has the greatest diversity of Late Pleistocene extinct taxa for eastern Africa.  Importantly, the fossil fauna also includes extant species such as Grevy&iacute;s zebra and oryx that are found far west and south of their current home range, suggesting that during past intervals of aridty, these animals expanded their home range. 3. Archaeologically, all of the material recovered from Rusinga, Mfangano, and Karungu can be attributed to the Middle Stone Age (MSA).  Elsewhere in Africa, MSA artifacts are associated with the earliest fossils of Homo sapiens, and can generally be considered the &euml;calling card&iacute; of our species in the absence of direct fossil evidence.  Our evidence from the Lake Victoria margin includes one of the few known MSA butchery sites, and artifact styles and stone raw material (obsidian) show strong connections with areas to the east in the Rift Valley.  As with the fauna, the archaeological evidence is consistent with the westward movement of human populations (or behavioral adapations) during arid intervals. 4. One important impact of Last Glacial climates is a reduction in the size and depth of Lake Victoria.  Although today the largest lake in Africa in terms of area, Lake Victoria is shallow and fluctuates in response to rainfall abundance.  Multiple lines of evidence indicate that sediments, artifacts, and fossils that we studied were deposited during a period when the lake was much smaller and possibly completely dried up.  The absence of the lake would have removed a major barrier to large h...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
