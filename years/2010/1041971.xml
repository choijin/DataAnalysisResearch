<AbstractNarration>The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) is a premier forum for presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative architectural ideas and techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This symposium brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture, compilers, chips and systems, for technical exchange on current areas of architectural challenge. This proposal aims to support this highly regarded conference by obtaining travel support for up to 25 from US-based students in order to defray the costs of attending and participating in the ISCA conference in June, 2010 in San Malo, France.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding provided supported graduate students to attend the 2010 International Symposium on Computer Architecture.  This meeting is the top IEEE/ACM meeting in the field of Computer Architecture.  The support provided partially defrayed the travel/hotel costs for the graduate students.  Student presenting papers at the meeting were given preference over those not presenting.  30 graduate students were supported by this grant, including 4 women and 1 minority student.  The research presented at the International Symposium on Computer Architecture has enjoyed a tradition of including many talks and presentations of breakthrough ideas that have had lasting impact upon the field of computing. The meeting only accepts a low number of the over 200+ submitted papers, clearly indicating the level of quality of the papers that appear at this meeting.    Attending high quality research conferences is one of the most important elements of a graduate education that a student can have.  This meeting includes the top researchers from both academia and industry, providing significant networking opportunities for these student, while also providing the students the ability to receive feedback on their top quality research. The support provided by the National Science Foundation has served to better prepare students as they enter into careers in either academia or industry in the field of Computer Architecture.
