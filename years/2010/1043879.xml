<AbstractNarration>Originally funded as a collection project in the first round of NSDL awards, MathDL has added many additional features making it the primary site for access to resources for undergraduate mathematics.  MathDL, now the pathway project in NSDL for the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) with stewardship for undergraduate mathematics, provides access to a wide variety of online materials from Partner sites as well as many resources on the site itself. MathDL is creating a New Collection of quality resources for a range of undergraduate mathematics courses. This component enables users to browse materials, organized by courses and topics, post and access reviews and other materials concerning online resources, and join a community of colleagues working on the same curricula. In addition MathDL is adding two new sections to the existing online publication, Loci and the daily Math in the News articles: Mathematical Communication, featuring advice and exemplars of good mathematical communication; and Tools for Online Mathematics. MathDL is expanding the impact of the New Collection by workshops and minicourses at national and local meetings of MAA and presentations at colleges and universities with a particular focus on underrepresented groups, especially the historically black colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit    The intellectual merit of this project is represented by the Mathematical Sciences Digital Library (MathDL). Grant 1043879 supported the development of and publicity for MathDL, a Pathway Project within the National Science Digital Library.  Except for one, which still exists separately, in July 2013 the components of MathDL were integrated into the newly revised Mathematical Association of America (MAA) website.  Broader Impact    The broader impact of this grant is illustrated by the components discussed below.

The MAA Journal Writing Awards site displays summaries, short bios, and the winning articles for the seven journal-writing awards that the MAA bestows. The Journal-Writing Awards may be accessed from http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards.  The Journal of Online Mathematics and its Applications (JOMA) was the journal for MathDL from its beginning in January of 2001 until the middle of 2008. A listing of the articles by year of publication and links to the articles themselves may be found at http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/loci/joma/joma-archive.  Loci was formed in 2008 by merging the resources of JOMA, Convergence, and Digital Classroom Resources. In July of 2013 Loci ended publication. A listing of the articles in Loci by year of publication and links to the articles themselves may be found at http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/loci-tables-of-contents.  The Mathematical Communication site discusses the details of communication intensive mathematics courses. The site may be accessed at http://mathcomm.org/.
