<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Doctoral Colloquium program at the 2010 iConference to be held on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign February 3 - February 6, 2010. This workshop will bring together 15 dissertation-stage doctoral students from diverse information and informatics subfields for one day of presentations, interaction, and feedback with 5 faculty members selected from among distinguished information researchers. The iConference Doctoral Research Colloquium is designed to assist doctoral students to become stewards of the information and informatics disciplines, by providing an opportunity for interaction with distinguished research faculty and for the development of a global cohort of new researchers. This award provides support for the travel, lodging and registration of students, plus one night lodging for the participating faculty mentors, as well as the direct expenses of putting on the Doctoral Colloquium at the meeting.</AbstractNarration>

We began with an overview of the DC, emphasizing its supportive approach, encouraging the airing of issues that are sometimes hard to air in oneÆs home department. We then did a æJust a minute elevator pitchÆ icebreaker for attendees and mentors. Students were put into one of 5 groups based on their research area to work with a mentor.

One theme that pervaded the day was the challenge of speaking to a very diverse audience. A classic (but not unique) case is doing a job talk. You want to show off how clever you are - to the 5 people in the audience who understand your research and even go to the same disciplinary conference as you. But what about the rest of your audience? They are all very smart people, but many - perhaps most, will come from a completely different disciplinary, methodological and epistemological tradition. Can you explain to them at least why your research matters? Which slide do you lose them on? Do you start off unnecessarily slowly and then accelerate too fast in terms of complexity?  Various measures were used to assess the outcomes of the DC. These are described in the final rep...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
