<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will develop a gas sensor technology that is both highly sensitive and selective, with a rapidity and accuracy not yet seen in commercially available technologies. This will develop an integrated high performance, low cost, and compact gas sensor device for environmental monitoring, with emphasis placed on the early and reliable detection of a variety of prevalent environmental and industrial airborne contaminants. The sensor system will be fast (i.e., having a response time &lt;100 milliseconds) while demonstrating a minimum number of false positives. This detection requires sensors that are prevalent, sensitive, robust, and inexpensive. Furthermore, the response to targeted gases will be orthogonal to interfering species while also displaying fast recovery times. Many types of current gas sensors reveal large interfering sensitivities to molecules other than those of interest, typically resulting in false positive signals for the targeted gases. A micro-cantilever-based gas sensor technology that provides high sensitivity and low cross-sensitivity will be developed. The proposal will concentrate its efforts on detecting 5 gases of commercial and environmental importance: CO, NO2, H2S, NH3, and benzene. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to meet future environmental safety standards as outlined by the EPA will require gas sensors with high sensitivity (ppb level) and low cross-sensitivity. Currently available gas sensors cannot meet such requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
