<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build on the successful results obtained during Phase I. Phase I research indicated that aqueous chlorine can be used as an alternative chemical source for Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), and was capable of producing hydroxyl and other highly reactive radicals when illuminated with ultraviolet light. These radicals were harnessed to destroy and mineralize small organic molecules and impact the structure of natural organic matter found in surface water. Phase II research will focus on developing a solid understanding of how aqueous chlorine based AOPs can be integrated into overall water treatment processes, compare the efficacies of aqueous chlorine and hydrogen peroxide based AOPs, and demonstrate that solar ultraviolet light can be used to drive this process.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research center around the ability to provide a greener, more efficient AOP which can be used to more economically produce high quality water. Phase II research will deliver an increased understanding of chlorine-based AOP technology, enabling the development of products with enhanced capabilities towards the removal of trace organic contaminants from water.  Successful completion of this research will positively impact the quality of both drinking water and packaged beverages. In addition, the research could permanently remove contaminants from the environment through mineralization, preventing unintended release from municipal and industrial wastewater plants.  Finally, since this process can be driven using solar energy, the resulting technology will be deployable in rural and developing regions of the world at an affordable cost.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report               Improvements in the methods used to measure water quality have led to the widespread detection of numerous chemicals which, through long term exposure in drinking water, can have potential negative consequences to human health. These chemicals, collectively known as Compounds of Emerging Concern (CECs) are often difficult or impossible to remove from water using traditional treatment technologies, and when traditional technologies can be deployed, removal of CECs are often costly. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), which use various methods to generate short lived highly reactive chemical oxidants capable of destroying CECs, are often viewed as the preferred technology for the removal of these chemicals from water. In partnership with researchers from the Southern Nevada Water Authority, University of Arizona, and Hazen and Sawyer, PC, MIOX Corporation has developed a novel AOP technology based on research completed under this National Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research program.                 MIOXÆs innovative research has resulted in the development of Integrated Advanced Oxidation (iAO) technology, which combines water conditioning, the electrolytic production of oxidants, controlled ultraviolet photolysis, and other treatment process units into a single technology that, in many cases, is capable of effectively removing CECs from water at substantially lower cost than traditional AOP technologies. Specific outcomes from this research program include:  Development of a technology that cleans water through the removal of CECs without the production of hazardous chemical byproducts. Development of a technology that has the capability of cleaning up water in contaminated aquifers and other groundwater sources. Demonstration of this technology through a number of field studies at municipal water treatment and groundwater remediation facilities. Enabling water treatment facilities to remove CECs while substantially reducing water treatment costs and energy expenditures by providing a greener alternative to legacy AOP technologies. Sharing of the knowledge gained from this research through technical and professional channels in the water treatment industry that will allow for widespread adoption of the technology developed during this program.                Currently, MIOX is working with partners and customers in several water treatment industry sectors to commercialize this technology. Immediate applications where MIOX intends to deploy the iAO technology developed in this program include the remediation of contaminated groundwater plumes as well as the cleaning and recycling of water used for industrial processes. Over time, MIOX also expects to deploy this technology in the municipal drinking water sector, enabling the low cost and effective removal of CECs from the nationÆs potable water supplies.
