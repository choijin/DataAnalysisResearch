<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This project develops the transformative idea that fast ionic conductors exemplified by sodium beta-alumina (SBA) can act as high-capacitance gate dielectrics in transistors.  The sodium, or other small inorganic cation, is intercalated between nonstoichiometric layers of Al (2-x) O3 (AlOx).  The transistors can be solution-fabricated, transparent, and operable at battery voltages (1-5 V).  They can employ organic semiconductors or inorganic oxide semiconductors with higher carrier mobility.  While the ultimate technological goal is to produce improved electronic circuits, the project summarized here is to uncover fundamental solid state structures and ion transport mechanisms in this and related electronic oxide materials.   This will be done by (a) uncovering the detailed structural intermediates traversed during their formation from sol-gel precursors, (b) studying the cation-dependent electric-field-induced ionic motions that are responsible for the high dielectric constants, and (c) deducing mechanisms by which the cations could conceivably migrate out of the dielectric films, resulting in undesired leakage currents and degradation in transistors, and with the aim of minimizing these effects. The first two tasks will be accomplished through combined experimental (synthesis, X-ray diffraction, scanning probe microscopy, frequency-dependent dielectric measurements) and theoretical (molecular dynamics) study.   The third task will be carried out in part by considering conductors and semiconductors with which the BAs will be integrated, evaluating the possibilities that cations could penetrate such materials, and deriving conditions under which leakage currents would be minimized.  Effort will therefore be devoted toward refining these accompanying materials, including newly discovered Al-Zn-Sn-O conductive compositions and ZnO-based semiconductors.  Support from the Ceramics (CER) program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) is gratefully acknowledged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops the transformative idea that a certain class of ceramic electrical conductors based on a compound known as sodium beta-alumina (SBA), can act as electrical insulators in certain devices.  While the work of this proposal will be to uncover the fundamental scientific reasons why the SBA compounds can be so useful in electronics technologies, the ultimate impact will be to greatly advance the capabilities of printed, transparent, battery-powered circuits that can be applied to displays, photovoltaic systems, and sensors mounted on transparent substrates such as windshields and windows.  The work will also lead to high school and undergraduate classroom modules that demonstrate the broad possibilities of electronics fabrication, physics, and application beyond silicon technology.  These modules will be usable with apparatus readily available in educational laboratories with limited resources.  This project is a strong fit with an ongoing nanomaterials collaboration of the PIs with minority institutions including Howard University and Prince Georges Community College that has already trained three African-American researchers, and that collaboration will be expanded.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be trained in a synergistic combination of simulation, materials synthesis, physical characterization, and electronic integration techniques that can be applied to a broad range of future materials opportunities.  Support from the Ceramics (CER) program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) is gratefully acknowledged.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project advanced our understanding, the practical use, and the workforce skills associated with new electronics technologies that use less power, are more transparent, and are easier to produce as devices than conventional circuitry.   The broad class of materials that supports these technologies are called metal oxides, compounds of metal elements like aluminum, zinc, and tin, with oxygen.  Some of these oxides have the property that they block the flow of electric current known as insulators, while others allow current to flow depending on certain electrical settings; these are called semiconductors.  It is particularly efficient to be able to produce materials as films suitable for use in electronics by depositing them from simple solutions and not having to heat them at such high temperatures that they might melt other parts of electronic components, such as plastics.  It is rare for low temperature, solution processed oxides that are both insulating and semiconducting to be used together.  The project just concluded successfully demonstrated this possibility and studied the detailed structures and the electronic performance of the material combinations.  New chemistry was found to make sure that temperature limits would not be exceeded when the electronic material films were made.  Detailed resolution of the boundaries between the different materials, which often control their performance, was achieved.  In particular, it was found that devices made from these materials can operate using just one volt of electrical force, less than what is obtained from a typical battery.  The voltage was even less when sodium ions, just like the ones found in ordinary table salt, were added to the insulating oxide.  The movement of the sodium ions through the oxides was responsible for this voltage reduction.   A new way of patterning the oxide materials was discovered so devices would not waste power or interfere with each other.   This work was done in collaboration with a major electronics company.   Advanced electronic devices beyond simple switches and circuit elements were made and demonstrated.  For example, a particularly high sensitivity light detector was made.  Such detectors can be used in different kinds of digital photography and x-ray imaging.  Chemical sensors were studied that can determine when certain gases are present.  One example is ammonia gas, which is produced by certain industrial sites and can lead to difficulties in breathing.  Finally, the use of some of these oxides in converting heat into electricity was evaluated by computer calculation and with experiments.  The low temperature form of the oxides, which resembles a glassy material, was predicted to have promising performance for this particular application.  Small particles of one of the oxides, when mixed with a plastic, displayed high efficiency in producing a voltage from a difference in temperature between two parts of the solid mixture.  The researchers on this project made significant contributions to educating public school students to participate in these new technologies.  An intern from Western High School contributed so much experimental work to the project that she became a coauthor on one of the published works produced.  Also, trainees on the project engaged with third and fifth grade students in the City of Baltimore in science project activities during year-long after school programs.
