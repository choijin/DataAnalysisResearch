<AbstractNarration>The workshop "Terahertz-to-Infrared Probes in Molecular and Materials Sciences", which will be held on April 14th and 15th, 2011 in Arlington, VA, will provide a forum for leading experts to assess the need within the materials research, biophysical and biochemical research communities for advanced terahertz-to-infrared light sources. The workshop will include a mix of presentations and discussion, centered around the following five topics 1. Complex bio-molecular dynamics. 2. Molecular spectroscopy in the gas phase. 3. Terahertz-to-infrared microscopy/nanoscopy, nanoscale phenomenon, surface interactions, etc. 4. Condensed matter I - frequency domain spectroscopy 5. Condensed matter II - non-linear and ultrafast phenomena. The workshop will assess the potential broader impacts that could result from the development of advanced terahertz-to-infrared light sources, both in terms of the research that they will enable, and in terms of technical education in areas that are vital to the nation?s continued scientific competitiveness.  The conference will give preference to women and minority scientists and is co-funded by the Physics, Chemistry Divisions, the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and by the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A two-day workshop entitled "Applications of Terahertz-to-Infrared Probes in Molecular and Materials Sciences" was held on April 14th and 15th, 2011, at the Westin hotel in Arlington, VA. Experts were invited who could contribute to the dialog from various perspectives. A number of NSF Program Directors were also in attendance. The workshop program and list of attendees can be found on the workshop web site, http://biologyphysics.blogspot.com/. The primary objective was be to bring together leading theorists and spectroscopists working on a broad range of problems that are of interest to the NSF, with a view to: (a) identifying the important fundamental questions that can only be answered via interrogation with electromagnetic radiation spanning the terahertz-to-infrared (THIR) regime; (b) assessing the potential impact that development of advanced THIR light sources would have on these problems; and (c) gauging the broader impacts of such a development. A workshop report was written that will be made available online at www.magnet.fsu.edu. In addition to summarizing all presentations and discussions at the workshop, the report makes several recommendations that are succinctly summarized in the following six bullets:  Compelling scientific arguments were presented highlighting the crucial importance of spectroscopy in the THz-to-infrared regime in terms of addressing many of the gaps in our current understanding of the physics and chemistry of materials and living systems. Filling these knowledge gaps would be transformative, with the potential for remarkable societal impacts.   Considerable effort/resources should be directed towards the development of the next-generation of tunable, high-intensity sources of THIR radiation that meet the requirements for performing sophisticated non-linear and/or time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopies where, in principle, both the pump and the probe could be in the THIR regime.   A strong case was made for combining high-intensity, tunable light sources with high magnetic fields.   A number of intense THIR FEL sources already exist at different locations around the globe. Collaborative experimental efforts must be encouraged to further assess whether such sources are, indeed, capable of addressing the most challenging science described in this report.   A variety of compact (non-FEL) radiation sources either already exist or show tremendous potential for advanced spectroscopy in the THIR regime. Detailed studies should be undertaken to determine how much of the science described in this report can be achieved using this technology.   A detailed fact-finding mission and subsequent workshop are needed to assess the state-of-the-art in THz-to-infrared technologies &ndash; both sources and associated spectrometers &ndash; and to chart the most efficient path towards achieving the scientific goals described in this report.   The workshop report is intended to serve as a resource for researchers in the condensed matter physics, materials science, biochemical and biophysical research communities, informing them of future prospects involving spectroscopy in the THIR regime; it also offers recommendations to light source designers based on the needs of these research communities.
