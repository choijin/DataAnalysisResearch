<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Department of Defense (ASSURE Program) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Christopher T. Culbertson and Stefan H. Bossmann at Kansas State University.  The majority of research projects supported in this site are in areas of chemistry with applications in national security (e.g. detection of chemical and biological agents.)   The site will have support for three summers, commencing in 2010.  The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program.  Sample projects include:  (1)  the development of microfluidic devices with integrated surface plasmon detectors; (2)  the detection of pathogenic Burkholderia bacteria based upon their surface virulence components; (3)  the development of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectroscopies for detection of chemical and biological warfare agents; (4)  the design and synthesis of portable biosensors ; (5)  the design of porous inorganic-organic hybrid materials for incorporation and destruction of chemical warfare simulants; (6) the development of nanoelectronic biosensors for biosecurity;  (7) the detection of chemical and biological warfare agents with terahertz spectroscopy; (8) the investigation of the surface chemistry of Group III nitrides for detecting chemical and biological warfare agents; (9) the inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication; and (10) single-molecule studies of molecularly-imprinted silica films.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities.  An interesting component of this REU site is the inclusion of lectures on the history and philosophy of science.  The site also includes training in scientific ethics.   The site will recruit nationwide, with a particular focus on recruitment of students in the Kansas/Missouri community and will include students in community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in the chemical sciences to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity.  The research projects are in diverse areas of chemistry, many of which will have an impact in areas of national security.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Between the summers of 2010 and 2014 the Chemistry Department at Kansas State University hosted 35 undergraduate students as part of our NSF funded research experience for undergraduates (REU) program.  Thirty-four of the 35 students were recruited from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs). Housing and dining was provided for the students who spend 10 weeks each summer on campus.  The students also earned a $4500 stipend for their participation in the project.  Students were able to select an area of chemistry research that interested them, and then they were paired with a research mentor who oversaw their research over the course of the summer.  The students worked full time on a variety of research projects in the areas of Analytical, Organic, Inorganic and Physical Chemistry.  They also learned how to use sophisticated research instrumentation that was generally not available back at their home institutions including X-ray crystallographs and multi-nuclei NMR spectrometers.        In addition to the research experience, the students met for a 2 hr professional development seminar every Monday afternoon.  The topics covered in this seminar included the nature of science, scientific ethics, how to get started in research, how to write a scientific paper, how to make oral and written presentations, how to apply to graduate school, life in graduate school, and post graduate school options.  At the end of the summer, students wrote up their results in a paper and made both written and oral presentations in open public forums.  Social networking opportunities were also provided and sponsored by the Graduate School and University.  These opportunities allowed the students to interact with students in other on campus REU programs and with graduate students and faculty mentors outside of the normal workplace encounters. Evaluations of the program indicated that the students felt that they now understood what graduate school would be like, and that they really enjoyed their overall experience on the K-State campus.       Of the 35 students that participated in the program 21 have matriculated to graduate school, 2 have taken B.S. chemistry positions, 1 has gone onto medical school, and 11 are still undergraduates.  Twenty females and fifteen males participated in the program which included 8 Hispanics and 2 African-Americans.  Four community college students also participated.  All of these students transferred to 4 year colleges after graduating from their community colleges.  Two of the students have gone onto win Goldwater Scholarships.  Two videos were made for distribution and recruitment over the course of the program.  They detail the experience of the students.  They can be found at: http://youtu.be/HecG-T0x2hM  and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uuh0stQCrL0.  The student participants were also co-authors on &gt;17 peer-reviewed journal articles and presented &gt;33 posters at regional and national meetings.
