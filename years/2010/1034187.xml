<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project is to research and develop a new type of thermophotonic device. The intellectual merit includes studies in the physics of heat and charge transport in charge controlled quantum wells combined with microcavity physics to achieve waste heat absorption. Thermophotonics has long been proposed as a potential advance to achieve solar energy conversion of close to 100%, due to its ability to utilize waste heat from above band gap absorption. However, nonoptimized device structures and internal efficiency problems have limited the overall efficiency. These problems are addressed through charge control in high quality quantum wells, and microcavity physics to reach high extraction efficiency. The proposed structures provide a new device route to overcoming past technology hurdles in the efficiency of waste heat absorption.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The research project is gender diverse, and the broader impacts include the advancement of women in science and engineering, as well as the impact that thermophotonic device technologies can make on society. Devices that can produce high efficiency absorption of waste heat can be used in a wide range of applications, and thermophotonic devices are well suited for these since they can in principle produce heat absorption even for small temperature differences. Besides high efficiency photovoltaic cells, thermophotonic devices could find applications in consumer electronics such as computers, cell-phones, and various sensors. The thermophotonic devices can greatly increase the efficiency of these electronics and extend their battery lifetimes and operating lifetimes by reducing waste heat and temperature rises due to inefficient electronics.</AbstractNarration>
