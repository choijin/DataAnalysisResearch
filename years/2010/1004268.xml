<AbstractNarration>Georgetown University REU in Materials Physics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year, nine undergraduates from diverse backgrounds and a broad spectrum of institutions will be recruited for a 10-week summer research experience in materials physics at Georgetown University. Students will engage in experimental, computational, and theoretical research projects in nanoscale physics, soft matter, device physics, active matter, biophysics, and cold-atom systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking advantage of Georgetown's location in the nation's capital, students will be exposed to the role of science, particularly materials research, in public policy. These activities build on Georgetown?s existing programs designed to engage undergraduate science majors directly with the government on issues of national importance, and will help build an understanding of the connection between scientific research and the world outside of the laboratory. Students will also participate in a variety of professional development activities, many of which will be held jointly with the REU program in the Georgetown Chemistry Department.</AbstractNarration>
