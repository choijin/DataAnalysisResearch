<AbstractNarration>This project will support the dissertation research of graduate student Travis Hedwig on the social implication of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD).   Using ethnographic research methods of participant observation, targeted interviews, and life histories the researcher will examine how a diagnosis of FASD affects social relationships (family, kinship, and identity) and how such a diagnosis structures access to health care.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "The Cultural Politics of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the Diagnosis of Difference," Hedwig and Anglin   Project Outcomes Report   This research examined the social and cultural implications of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) in Anchorage, Alaska.  During the study period (8/1/2010-7/31/2011), the researcher interviewed 43 people and collected data in the form of personal/reflective notes, disability histories and recorded interviews with foster/adoptive parents (N = 18), extended natural family (i.e. grandparents) (N = 10), direct service professionals, including program  administrators and parent support professionals in state, tribal and non-profit organizations (N = 10), and adults over the age of 18 who have a diagnosis of FASD (N = 5).   Primary research questions were designed to better understand how a diagnosis of FASD is made, how family, kinship and residence patterns are altered and reconfigured following diagnosis, and how everyday impairments associated with FASD are managed through participation in both formal and informal networks and systems of care.  The researcher participated in FASD-related community activities, including family camps, foster family  picnics, parent support groups, trainings and public presentations offered by agencies involved in providing information and referral as well as direct care services for individuals experiencing FASD and other disabilities.  Due to the sensitive nature of research, only individuals and families that expressed overall readiness to meet were included in the study.  Since diagnosis of FASD can be a traumatic and stressful event for families, the researcher avoided recruitment of participants who have just begun their (lifelong) journeys managing the FASD-related impairments of their family  members.  Rather, families more seasoned in their journeys were specifically recruited so thatpotentially stressful situations could be minimized and interviewees could speak with a certain degree of distance and comfort about their experiences.   This research is positioned to address key gaps in service delivery and serve to facilitate a more sensitive and nuanced dialogue about how to better serve individuals with FASD and their families in Alaska, the circumpolar north, North America more broadly and other regions of the world where FASD is a growing problem.  Anthropologists working on issues of health disparities and inequalities will find this work to be of relevance as an example of the ways in which social differences influence everyday life, health and disability outcomes for disadvantaged groups.  In addition, since the nature of impairment(s) associated with FASD encompasses a range of physical, cognitive and behavioral impairments in varying degrees of severity, this  research offers a unique perspective on how the experience of disability is shaped by social perceptions of difference and interacts with other key locations of difference, including race/ethnicity, gender, cultural identity and socioeconomic status, to shape health and disability outcomes.
