<AbstractNarration>A partnership of research scientists, science educators and supporters of science-based conservation are developing mechanisms to engage middle school students and educators from a major urban region in geosciences research with advanced sampling and sensing platforms. The collective science and education strengths of Rutgers University, the N.J. Marine Sciences Consortium/N.J. Sea Grant College Program, Brookdale Community College, the National Park Service, and the Sandy Hook Foundation -- a nongovernmental organization, constitute the backbone of a partnership that is incorporating real-world geoscience programs into formal and informal science curricula and activities at the Red Bank Middle School. The school is revamping its science curricula to align it with the new state science standards which were just revised to include the Earth sciences.  The partnership is developing educational strategies to incorporate real-world science and technology into the new curricula with an emphasis on inquiry-based learning, integrated science topics, and the inclusion of technology.  Educational strategies also are being developed to enrich after school programs and enhance science content for field programs delivered at the Sandy Hook Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area, National Park Service.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  A partnership of research scientists, science educators and supporters  of science-based conservation developed mechanisms to engage middle  school students and educators from a major urban region in geosciences  research with advanced sampling and sensing platforms. The collective  science and education strengths of Rutgers University, the N.J. Sea  Grant Consortium, Brookdale Community College, the National Park  Service, and the Sandy Hook Foundation--a nongovernmental organization,  constituted the backbone of a partnership that incorporated real-world  geoscience programs into formal and informal science curricula and  activities at the Red Bank Middle School. Through this project, the  school revamped its science curricula which were just revised to include  the earth sciences.  Educational strategies also were developed to enrich after school programs and enhance science content for field experiences. The partnership identified key strategies to  enable a middle school in an urban area to capitalize on active  research investigations underway at a nearby natural area to transform  its science curricula in a collaborative manner with scientists,  environmental managers and science educators.  Such a collaborative  approach helped to create a school culture that fosters cross-discipline  and cross-grade level interaction, forms cross-curricular linkages  between in-school, after school and environmental center programs,  aligns activities with core science standards, and integrates current  scientific content and technology into school programs. Collaboration  was strengthened by engaging teachers in the acquisition and  pre-processing of real-world data into sample lesson plans and  activities, especially for the non-science teachers.  Integration of  content across disciplines and grade levels was very important for  designing the teacher professional development workshop. In addition,  the inclusion of administrators was important to providing structured  time for the teachers to collaborate across disciplines and grade  levels. The availability/presence of a scientist during lesson plan  development was highly valued by the teachers. In addition, a  Scientist-in-Residence program was very important for initial  implementation of newly developed curriculum modules. These strategies  can be used to broaden incorporation of STEM content and field  experiences into middle school systems and K-12 science education  networks. Further, content can be incorporated into many disciplines  (e.g., language arts, history, social sciences) to enhance and enrich  STEM awareness, literacy and engagement among students. Communication  mechanisms that sustain the collaboration beyond the funding period are  extremely important and include continuation of the  Scientist-in-Residence program, periodic brown bag lunches with  scientists and educators, and development of a "wiki" to foster access  to data resources in a simple, effiecient manner. A resource repository  was also created to provide teachers with field equipment (such as the  aquabotz) to support hand-on learning activities and field experiences  they can conduct on their own.
