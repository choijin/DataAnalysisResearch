<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will pursue experimental research of electric-field driven phenomena in ferroelectric multilayer materials.  This research will explore new fascinating opportunities to create materials with enhanced and unparalleled functional properties by combining several thin layers of different ferroelectric oxides in a multilayer system.  The dynamics of electric polarization and the electromechanical properties of ferroelectric multilayers will be probed by time-resolved synchrotron x-ray microdiffraction.  This experimental approach will be used to test predictions for polarization dynamics and unusual configurations of polarization domains in ferroelectric multilayers.  The knowledge obtained in this project will improve our fundamental understanding of the physics of complex oxide systems.  This can result in potentially transformative applications in 3-D non-volatile memories and tunable dielectric devices.  Graduate and undergraduate students will play a pivotal role in this project.  The students will travel to the U.S. national laboratories where they will get hands-on experience with modern synchrotron x-ray techniques.  An important educational component of this project, the Demonstrations in Electromagnetism for elementary and middle School Kids (DESK) program, will be developed to inspire children to pursue careers in science and engineering in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of naturally occurring materials is limited, but now there are fascinating opportunities to engineer new artificial materials by combining multiple layers of known materials together at the nanoscale.  This Faculty Early Career Award supports research that is aimed to synthesize ultrathin multilayers of nanoscale-thick oxide films and to investigate their electrical, mechanical, and structural properties.  Such new materials may have enhanced and novel properties that can be used in practical applications including nanoelectromechanical systems, high-density electronic memories, and alternative energy technologies.  This research will advance our understanding of the structure-properties relationships of the multilayer systems at the nanoscale.  The anticipated results of this research will lead to new theoretical models and approaches to materials design, which will impact a broad community of scientists and engineers.  The educational component of this project will establish a new program, Demonstrations in Electromagnetism for elementary and middle School Kids (DESK), which is aimed to inspire children to pursue careers in science in the future.  Another essential educational part of the project is that graduate and undergraduate students involved in research will travel to the national laboratory facilities where they will get hands-on experience with state-of-the-art scientific tools and interact with world-renowned scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This research project focused on exploring opportunities to create electronic materials with new functional properties by combining multiple thin layers of ferroelectric materials together in one.  Ferroelectric materials have a spontaneous electric polarization, and when two different ferroelectrics are brought together they should experience electrostatic polarization coupling that tends to average properties of a heterogeneous system.  This coupling has been demonstrated to make strong averaging effects on the properties of ultra-thin ferroelectric superlattices in which each ferroelectric layer is typically thinned than 10 nm.  Our goal was to investigate the changes in the coupling strength and related electronic properties when thicker layers are combined together.  As model systems, bilayers of the best characterized ferroelectrics, Barium Titanate (BTO) and Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT), were studied in this project.  We found that the electrostatic polarization coupling is significantly weaker in relatively thick bilayers (120-nm BTO on 120-nm PZT) than predictions for strong coupling between ideally insulating ferroelectric layers.  This weaker coupling led to interesting new properties including double polarization hysteresis loops, which we explain by independent polarization switching in each layer.  Our theoretical modeling efforts helped to attribute weakening polarization coupling in thicker ferroelectric multilayers to an increase of free charges at the interface separating ferroelectrics.  These results have significant impacts on explanation of observed and prediction of expected electronic, optical, and electromechanical properties of engineered ferroelectric multilayer systems.  For example, an interesting property of BTO/PZT bilayers discovered in this project was the ability of this system to sustain very strong electric fields (&gt; 2 MV/cm) without destruction, and achieve at these fields huge linear piezoelectric strains (&gt; 2.5%), which can be important for practical applications in tunable dielectrics and electromechanical transducers.      Important and long lasting outcomes of this project are also in educational and research opportunities created for students of the University of Tulsa.  Our students now have access to advanced instruments for sample preparation and characterization that were developed and acquired with support of this grant.  Several undergraduate and graduate students have visited the Argonne National Lab to participate in advanced structural studies of ferroelectric samples, which is a valuable career building experience.
