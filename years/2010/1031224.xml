<AbstractNarration>The PIs' preliminary data from sediment cores from deep equatorial Pacific show evidence of old radiocarbon ages and thus the presence of old, poorly ventilated bottom water brought to the surface as deglaciation began at the end of the last glacial, thereby potentially explaining the prolonged decrease in radiocarbon content and a concurrent increase pCO2 levels of the atmosphere. The PIs propose to evaluate this ventilation signal further and test its significance through a combination of 14C and 230Th measurements on selected additional cores in order to better understand the effects of benthic processes.  In addition, Thorium profiling will be used to test the significance of maxima in foraminiferal abundance that are dated with 14-C. This method will be used to evaluate the accumulation rates of benthic foraminifera and the possible role of winnowing and sediment focusing in creating benthic abundance peaks. Thorium data will also help refine chronology of millennial-scale events in the eastern Equatorial Pacific over the last 25 K.Y.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The scientific impact of the findings could be strong for other paleoclimate research. Outreach and educational efforts include training of teachers, students and a post-doctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research was conducted between 2010 and 2014 by the PI, his technical assistant, his graduate student, and a high school student.  Our objectives were (1) to radiocarbon date the shells of marine protozoa (foraminifera), called forams, in various sediment cores from the deep Equatorial Pacific Ocean in order to establish the timing of climate change over the past 25,000 years, (2) to compare the radiocarbon dates of those forams that lived in surface waters (planktonic) with those that lived on the seafloor (benthic).  Because dense water bathing the seafloor originated at the ocean surface where it usually exchanges with the atmosphere, the age difference between benthic and planktonic  forams is a measure of the relative age of bottom waters.    It is known that at the end of the last ice age about 15,000 yrs ago the radiocarbon content of the atmosphere decreased (the atmosphere got "older") and the CO2 content increased.  It is hypothesized that replenishment of deep waters was suppressed during the maximum of glaciation, leading to older (radiocarbon-depleted) bottom waters, but that it increased about 15,000 years ago, thus exhaling the old and CO2-rich water to the atmosphere.    Various researchers, including the PI, searched for evidence of these older, isolated, glacial waters to test the hypothesis that the atmospheric changes were driven by the ocean.  Because the Pacific is the largest ocean, if the idea is correct, this ocean would be the likely reservoir of these old waters.  Earlier workers found no good evidence for this effect in the North Pacific, but the earlier studies focused on cores from water depths shallower than about 3000 m.  Deeper than that in the N. Pacific, the forams needed for the radiocarbon dating were generally rare to absent.    We had preliminary evidence from cores archived at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution that a better test of the hypothesis could be made in the very deep waters (&gt;3 km) of the Equatorial Pacific. Our work concentrated on those cores, plus others sampled for us by curators at Univeristy of Miami, Scripps Inst. of Oceanography, Oregon State University, and the University of Hawaii.  In aggregate, our results show that bottom waters &gt;3.2 km in the Equatorial Pacific were thousands of years older than today during the last glacial period.    Thus, we conclude that the ocean did indeed drive atmospheric changes in the carbon system at the end of the glacial period, and we have submitted our results to the peer-reviewed journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters on 27 October 2014.
