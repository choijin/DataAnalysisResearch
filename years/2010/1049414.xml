<AbstractNarration>In ill-defined domains such as engineering design and ethics, mathematical discovery, and law, problems often have more than one 'right' answer. In such situations decision-makers propose rules or hypotheses about how to decide the problem in light of past cases and underlying principles and policies; through this process of interpretive argument decision-makers may then pose hypothetical examples in order to draw out and test the normative, logical, or empirical consequences of the hypothesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In integrating decision rules, case analogies, hypothetical examples, underlying principles, and policies, interpretive argument is a paradigm of robust reasoning. Although the problems are ill-defined, interpretive argument has an underlying logic, which this project is modeling computationally. By working in successively more complex argument microworlds, families of cases, rules, concepts, principles and policies drawn from realistic legal domains, the project is developing an ontology and implementing inference control mechanisms and argument schema with which a computer program will engage in interpretive argument. Empirical evaluation of the computational model is comparing arguments by the computer and by human arguers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work contributes to the fields of AI, argumentation theory, AI and Law, and case-based reasoning, and it aims in the longer term to contribute to intelligent tutoring systems that will prepare students for making effective, supportable and otherwise rational arguments, and to design artificial agents as proxies and advocates for humans engaged in disputes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The researchers developed a detailed value judgment formalism that supports value-based argumentation involving both hypothetical reasoning and case-based comparisons. We have applied the value judgment formalism in explicating the legal argumentation and reasoning of Supreme Court Justices and contending advocates in a variety of cases involving the so-called automobile exception to the constitutional requirement of a search warrant. Significantly, the formalism models the use of intermediate legal concepts and underlying values to draw more abstract analogies across apparently different factual circumstances. The graduate student reasearcher is developing his dissertation proposal. The dissertation witll present the value judgement formalism, a computer program that implements&nbsp; the formalism enabling the program to make such arguments, and an experiment to compare the program's arguments with those of law students as judged in a blind test by experts. Students will be presented cases, asked how the cases should be decided, and asked to make arguments using given cases to justify their decisions, as well as arguments contrary to their decisions. The program will generated its own arguments pro and con the students' decisions. The arguments will be rendered indistinguishable in terms of format and presented to experts to compare and grade without knowing who prepared the arguments or that a computer prepared some of them.
