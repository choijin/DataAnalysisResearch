<AbstractNarration>The Robert Noyce Scholarship Program at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) is designed to attract undergraduates from a range of STEM disciplines as well as STEM professionals choosing a change of career to teach science and mathematics in fifth through twelfth grades.  The project is supporting the preparation of 28 new teachers who choose to work in high need school districts through a successful and recognized preparation program modified to address issues and strategies for working in rural, high need districts, and to provide continued mentoring and professional development during the novice teachers' induction years. UNH Noyce Scholars are receiving an enhanced academic and clinical preparation, provided through a strong, sustained collaboration among faculty in the physical sciences, life sciences, mathematics and education, in concert with the diversity of experiences offered by the UNH TRIO programs.  UNH's five-year teacher preparation program culminating in a Master's degree provides for a year-long internship as well as other clinical experiences through pedagogical course work. The UNH Noyce Scholarship program is expanding the teacher preparation program by offering multiple opportunities for undergraduates to tutor and mentor at-risk middle school and high school students from high need districts through summer internships. In addition, a series of seminars focus on rural educational issues such as professional isolation, addressing the needs of at-risk students, and scarcity of funding for special education to better prepare future teachers and help to increase retention rates of new STEM educators in rural, high need districts. Induction support uses the resources of e-Mentoring for Student Success, an electronic learning community for new teachers and faculty mentors. Many school districts in the state of New Hampshire are rural, characterized by low student populations, low household income, and low educational achievement. Schools in these communities record high teacher turnover rates and insufficient numbers of well-prepared new teachers in the STEM disciplines. The UNH Noyce Scholars are being prepared to teach in these rural school districts.</AbstractNarration>

The intellectual merit of the UNH Noyce Scholarship Program lies in the enhanced academic and clinical preparation of the Noyce Scholars, as well as the strong collaboration among faculty in the physical sciences, life sciences, mathematics and education, in concert with the diversity of experiences offered by the UNH federally-funded TRIO programs. The program goals were met by supporting 22 Noyce Scholars through scholarships and stipends over the five years of the grant. More importantly, the UNH Noyce Program provided monthly professional development workshops, tutoring experiences, a year-long internship in a high-need school, and induction year support through a well-established and highly rated e-mentoring program.

The Noyce Scholars and faculty mentors formed a community of learners as they interacted with each other and with experts in teacher preparation. Access to local teachers and schools, as well as experts in rural education, informed the Noyce Program faculty in crafting worthwhile workshops to supplement the preservice education of the Noyce Scholars and other UNH interns in the sciences.     Sixteen of the 22 Noyce Scholars are currently teaching in high need districts, four of whom are in rural districts. Because our Scholars have a strong preparation in content and pedagogy, they are well positioned to have an immediate positive impact on the schools where they work. In fact, one UNH Noyce Program graduate was awarded the National Science Teachers Association?s Simmons Award for outstanding new science teachers in 2016 (one of 25 such awards presented nationwide).  In addition to the academic scholarships and mentoring, the UNH Noyce Program supported eight summer Noyce Fellows over the first two project years. Three of these Fellows became Noyce Scholarship recipients and are currently teaching in high need schools.    The intended broader impacts of the UNH Noyce Program were to fill the gap of mathematics and science teacher shortages, particularly in rural schools, by recruiting more STEM majors to seek teacher certification, and to serve as a model for rural teacher preparation. The UNH Noyce Program was successful in recruiting and preparing at least 22 new STEM teachers who otherwise may not have chosen a career in teaching.
