<AbstractNarration>GOALI: Optically Modulated Switching Transition and Switching Sequence Based Power Electronics Control for Next-Generation Power Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT SUMMARY: The objective of this project is to synthesize a power-electronics control for next-generation power systems based on optically-modulated active-gate control (OAGC) for modulating power-semiconductor-device (PSD) switching dynamics and sequence-based control for modulating evolution of PSD switching sequences. Our approach is twofold: Formulate a joint optimal framework integrating OAGC and SBC for dynamic control of electromagnetic (EM) emission, switching loss, and dv/dt and di/dt stresses of next-generation high-frequency power converters under transient and steady-state conditions while ensuring regulation under stability bound; Investigate the effectiveness of the control schemes using scaled experimental validation and detailed simulation. University of Illinois, Chicago will be supported in this approach, with regard to optical device epitaxial and fabrication efforts, by the GOALIE industrial partner.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Combining OAGC and SBC, yields a radical and transformative systems control at device level while achieving complete isolation between the low-voltage control and the high-voltage power stages. This is achieved, using photonic control, by translating power-system and power-converter system-level performance and reliability issues (e.g. efficiency, EM noise, device stress) along with regulation and stability requirements into precise switching-transition and switching-sequence requirements. Synthesis of such a real-time joint optimal-control methodology is a key challenge considering the wide scale of the dynamics being controlled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed control has applications for FACTS, HVDC, microgrid/DG, EM launch systems, solid-state power stations, electric ships, fly-by-light, pulse-power systems and fault control, motor drives, EV/HEV. Results of the research will be integrated into two power courses. The project will include 2 (supported) Ph.D., 1 middle-school, and 6 senior-design-undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
