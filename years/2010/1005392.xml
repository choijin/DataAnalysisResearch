<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the study of the extremal metrics in Kaehler geometry, the Calabi flow and related PDEs, such as the complex Monge-Ampere equation and an operator recently suggested by S. Donaldson. The stability conjecture in Kaehler geometry relates the existence of the extremal metrics to the stability of the underlying complex projective variety. The stability conjecture and related problems are fundamental problems in Kaehler  geometry, which has tight relation with the partial differential equations, complex analysis and algebraic geometry.  The precise understanding of the Calabi flow will lead to solving such a conjecture.  Inspired by Perelman's success in Hamilton's problem to solve geometrization conjecture by Ricci  flow, the PI proposes to study the Calabi  flow to attack the existence of extremal metrics. The key issue for the Calabi flow is the long time existence, the asymptotic behavior and related problems. Based on the previous work of the PI and his collaborators, he plans to further study the Calabi flow on Kaehler surfaces,  in particular  on Del Pezzo surfaces and toric surfaces. The PI also plans to study the regularity problem of related PDEs, such as the complex Monge-Ampere equation, which is a fundamental equation in Kaehler geometry and is also closely related to the extremal metrics and the Calabi flow. In particular, the PI plans to study whether some regularity result, which has been proved for the real Monge-Ampere equation, holds or not for the complex Monge-Ampere equation. The study of  S. Donaldson's operator will give new insight on this.  Donaldson's operator can be viewed as an operator with some nature of both the real and complex Monge-Ampere operators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problems in the proposal arise naturally from our attempts to understand geometric partial dierential equations from geometry and physics, which have tight relation with many other fields such as algebraic geometry, complex analysis and mathematical physics. One of the key features of these problems is how the global structure of a space influences the local, analytic properties of the solutions of such equations. Understanding this general principle  will have broad impact in physics and other fields of science in general. The proposed research will have immediate beneficial effect on students in PI's home university.</AbstractNarration>

Our results are also used crucially by others to study the Calabi flow and related problems.   Next I will briefly summarize my results and findings.  1. I have made important progress on the study of extremal metrics and the Calabi flow. In a series of work with X.X. Chen, we have established the maximal regularity for the short time solution of the Calabi flow, and proved that if the Ricci curvature is bounded then the Calabi flow exists for all time.

The second one is  the geodesic equation of the space of Kahler potentials. This equation plays an important role in Donaldson's program on the existence of constant scalar curvature metric on Kahler manifolds. After X.X. Chen established a weak solution for this equation, there are extensive study and papers in literature about this equation. We have established a significant improvement of Chen's result by weakening the assumption. Our results are very useful and have already been used in literature in various setting.
