<AbstractNarration>Data replication demands complex tools such as SYNCHRONIZERS and VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS to maintain or restore consistency when changes are made to replicated data structures.  Unfortunately, the burgeoning activity in this area has not been fully matched by advances in its theoretical underpinnings, resulting in systems that are complex, hard to understand, and prone to surprising behaviors.  The project aims to develop mathematical foundations and a prototype implementation of a HETEROGENEOUS VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM, able to manage propagation and integration of concurrent updates to multiple replicas, where each replica may be represented differently and may include information that is not shared with the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past work in these areas has had significant real-world impacts: the Unison file synchronizer is now part of the basic toolset of a large community of users, both within and outside the research community, and Redhat's Augeas tool, based directly on the experimental bidirectional language Boomerang, is becoming a popular tool for system configuration management.  Better mathematical foundations will improve the functionality and robustness of future systems---for example, industrial tools for software model transformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's primary technical threads are (1) the algebraic theory of SYMMETRIC LENSES, a mechanism for propagating bidirectional updates, (2) a new THEORY OF PATCHES providing a solid foundation to modern distributed version control systems, and (3) a prototype implementation of a system embodying both sets of ideas.</AbstractNarration>

Unfortunately, the burgeoning activity in thisarea has not been fully matched by advances in its theoretical underpinnings, resulting in systems that are complex, hard to understand,and prone to surprising behaviors.  This project developed new mathematical foundations for such systems based on the idea of LENSES -- programs that operate "bidirectionally" to propagate concurrent updates to multiple replicas, where each replica may be represented differently and may include information that is not shared with the others.     Work in this area is having significant real-world impacts: the Unison filesynchronizer (developed with NSF support) is now part of the basic toolset of a large community of users, both within and outside the research community, and Redhat's Augeas tool, based directly on the mathematical concept of lenses and the experimental bidirectional language Boomerang (also NSF-supported), has become a popular tool for system configuration management.  Better mathematical foundations will improve thef unctionality and robustness of future systems -- for example, industrial tools for software model transformation.  The present project produced four significant bodies of results: (1) a rich theory extending the basic ideas and constructions oflenses to the "symmetric" setting where each replica may include informationthat the other doesn't have; (2) a theory of "edit lenses," where synchronization is performed in terms of individual edit operations, rather than full replica states, leading to better performance as well as a more refined view of edits that may also be applicable to formalizing modern version-control systems; a logical specification of a family of modern filesystem synchronizers (e.g., Dropbox) and a random testing framework for applying this specification to find bugs (e.g., in Dropbox); and (4) a surprising application of the ideas of lenses to the problem of generating random data structures satisfying complex logical invariants, for use in property-based random testing.
