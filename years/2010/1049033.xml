<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to improve the decadal and regional projections of the carbon cycle in the Community Earth System Model.  There currently is substantial spread in the predictions of atmospheric carbon among the full complexity climate-carbon models, even with the same anthropogenic forcings. This spread in predictions of the carbon uptake by the land and ocean result in large differences in climate forcing, and thus climate impacts. The next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the first that will include the carbon cycle for all models, and thus the carbon cycle models have not yet been subject to the same rigorous analysis that the physical models have been exposed to. This project will jump-start the process of understanding and improving the carbon cycle in the Community Earth System Model.  The goal is to compile datasets, prepare methodologies for comparisons and develop metrics that will facilitate improvements in the models and reduce the uncertainty in future climate projections of the carbon cycle for earth system models. In addition, the PIs will use these datasets to answer fundamental questions about how the carbon cycle responds on regional and decadal scales, and how it will evolve in the future. This project includes experts in modeling and model/data comparisons for the land, ocean and atmosphere, which is required for the cross-disciplinary challenge of improving simulations of regional and decadal scale carbon fluxes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project includes the compilation and publishing of important datasets and metrics that can be used to improve carbon flux predictions.  It will result in improvements in the publically available Community Earth System Model.  The project includes the education of 4 graduate students, and 2 undergraduate students in cross-disciplinary studies of the carbon cycle.  It also includes outreach programs targeted at temporary exhibits at museums, and K-12 teacher development programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this grant was to improve the decadal and regional projections of the carbon cycle in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We focused on answering the following questions, and their associated tasks:  1. What are the most effective ways to use available observations to improve model simulations of regional and decadal variability in the carbon cycle?  2. How does biogeochemistry respond to climate change and human activity on decadal and regional scales? How do different biogeochemistry feedbacks contribute to decadal scale variability in the climate system?  3. How will the carbon cycle evolve in the next several decades? The main tasks involve compiling validation datasets, conducting model-data evaluations for historical and contemporary conditions, and reassessing model performance on standard retrospective and future projection scenarios. Our results produced new datasets and approaches for improving the CESM model performance by combining multiple datasets together to revise estimates of carbon fluxes and by using innovative new calibration methods.   Comparisons of model output to leaf area index observations from satellite are used to evaluate and constrain future projections of leaf area index.   Modeled LAI typically increases with modeled warming in the high latitudes, but often decreases with increasing local warming in the tropics. The models with the most skill in simulating current LAI in the tropics relative to satellite observations tend to project smaller increases in LAI in the tropics in the future compared to the average of all the models. Using LAI projections to identify regions that may be vulnerable to climate change presents a slightly different picture than using precipitation projections, suggesting LAI may be an additional useful tool for understanding climate change impacts. Including new methods of calibrating model fluxes of methane underscore the difficulty of constraining complicated process models using limited flux data, since many of the important parameters are not directly observable, and cannot be well constrained from observations. Numerous studies show that the addition of nitrogen fertilization increases carbon dioxide fertilization. To improve long-term projections of CESM, we have evaluated the simulated pathways of nitrogen addition against measurements and, in particular, we test the hypothesis that direct foliar uptake of N deposition changes the fate and response of terrestrial ecosystem C and N cycling. Discrepancies between the response in the CLM and measurements suggest projections of the interaction of the carbon and nitrogen cycle must be treated cautiously. In addition, our results showed that land use impacts on climate are much larger and longer term than normally estimated.  Previous estimates of land use impacts on climate are using integrated assessment model estimates of deforestation rates, which underestimate tropical deforestation and conversion compared to observations.  Using current observed rates of deforestation suggests that deforestation and land conversion as usual will result in another 1 degree of warming by 2100.  While this is much smaller than the 4 degrees of warming likely to be associated with continued fossil fuel use, if we are successful in reducing our emissions from energy production to meet the Paris agreement, land use contributions to climate change will be significant and important to consider. This project contributed to the completion of a Teacher-Friendly Guide to Climate Change, which is part of a series from the Paleontological Research Institution on Earth science guides for middle and high school teachers (teacherfriendlyguide.org).
