<AbstractNarration>The identity, activity and longevity of plant cells is largely governed by the assortment of proteins they contain.  The synthesis of proteins is a highly orchestrated process that begins in the cell nucleus with gene transcription and continues in the cytoplasm following messenger RNA (mRNA) export from the nucleus.  In the cytoplasm, an mRNA may be stable or unstable, and may be sequestered or actively translated by ribosomes into protein. The stability or translation of mRNAs in multicellular plants also depends on developmental or environmental signals.  The goal of this project is to clarify how this cytoplasmic post-transcriptional regulation occurs, and specifically to analyze the roles of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in these processes.  In this Arabidopsis 2010 project, three research groups will collaborate to characterize the specific roles of more than 40 RBPs.  A major focus is to identify the mRNAs that are bound by specific a RBP in an RNA-protein (RNP) complex, and to identify other proteins within the RNP complex.  In addition, select RBPs will be analyzed for their roles in developmental networks and in dynamic responses to changes in cellular status due to environmental stress. The study will include functional analyses of RBPs through use of mutants. Methods will include deep sequencing of the mRNAs associated with specific RBPs and identification of the mRNA sequences recognized by the RBPs. These studies will combine advanced bioinformatic, molecular and genetic approaches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts from this project fall into three areas.  First, the project will engage graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in state-of-the art technologies in molecular and cellular biology as well as bioinformatics.  In addition, undergraduate researchers will be mentored in research projects, and scientists and teachers will be provided summer workshops on cellular mechanisms of gene expression.  Second, the outcomes of the research will be made available to the larger scientific community through the establishment of a web site (Plant mRNP-Net), which will allow mRNA-protein network mining and include resources for educators.  Third, the project will work directly with The Leonardo, a Utah science museum, to assist in development of a classroom demonstration linked to the 9th grade curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The blueprint for organism development and function is encoded by the genes of the genome, which reside in the nucleus of each cells of an organism. RNA is the intermediary carrier of the genome?s information, and it moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it specify the types of proteins that are synthesized.  In the cytoplasm, many different forces potentially influence the fate of mRNAs, including degradation, localization, sequestration, and translation.  The intellectual goals of this project were to understand the cytoplasmic influences on gene expression, with focus on RNA binding proteins, and two pathways for mRNA decay: mRNA decapping and SOV/DIS3L2.       The roles of mRNA decapping and SOV/DIS3L2 in decay of mRNAs of seedlings was characterized by a genome-wide mRNA decay analysis.  This analysis revealed that mRNA decapping contributes to decay of more than 75% of the mRNAs, and has an especially important role in mRNAs with fast decay rates.  Those fast-decaying mRNAs typically encode proteins known to rapidly change expression levels, for example in response to developmental or environmental signals.  These finding suggested that a rapid increase in the abundance of these mRNAs are likely to include changes to their rates of decay.  This finding suggests that responses to developmental and environmental signaling includes controlling the rate at which mRNA decapping acts on specific cohorts of mRNAs.   Roles for the SOV/DIS3L2 mRNA decay pathway in plants were mysterious because plants lacking this pathway appeared normal, whereas animals that lack this pathway were severely abnormal.  Analysis of mRNA decay rates revealed a surprising increase in decay rates for approximately one third of the mRNAs, yet the abundances of these faster-decaying mRNAs were not significantly affected.  This observation, together with data from the double mutant, suggested that plants respond to the loss of SOV by activating a feedback mechanism that recruits mRNA decapping, causing faster decay and by inference, also faster transcription rates.  Broader impacts from this study include the incorporation of novel mathematical approaches and unprecedented details of mRNA decay processes.  Additional broad impacts include outreach to local schools, science fairs, and training of high school students, undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
