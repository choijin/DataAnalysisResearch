<AbstractNarration>I/UCRC for Membrane Science, Engineering and Technology (MSET) Center &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1034710 New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT); Sirkar &lt;br/&gt;1034720 University of Colorado at Boulder (UC-B); Greenberg &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Membrane Science, Engineering and Technology Composites will focus on membrane research, innovation, and educational capabilities that far exceed those of either university working alone. This synergistic combination of skills and expertise provides a a compelling rationale for a new partnership between NJIT (lead institution) and UC-B as the research partner &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research plan addresses novel membrane materials (for wider applications, desalination of water), control of pore size distributions to improve selectivity and performance, protein fouling on membranes, particle classification (ie, fractionation), enhancement of shear forces to reduce membrane fouling, and others. Membranes are to separations as catalysts are to chemical reactions. The membranes make separations easier and more economical (in some cases, possible). The collaborators, UC-Boulder and NJIT, have historically produced quality research in separations and membrane technology. The two universities have sufficient resources, infrastructure, and well-qualified investigators. The proposed research projects are innovative, but more important, the projects have potential to evolve and develop significant technologies. The leadership team has substantial experience in running centers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most significant impact of this center on society may be the stimulation that will result between research, education, and industry. The research proposed by the center has potential to impact major societal issues including energy and fresh water supplies. While it is obvious that university-based teaching/training in research environments is the first priority of the proposed Center activities and goals, the key ingredient to their strong program is that the training is gained through advancement research in the rapidly-evolving cross-disciplinary regime of membrane science, separation processes and engineering design. The PIs plan for a very broad and yet still appropriately targeted dissemination through a variety of mechanisms including the usual publications as well as webinars, review meetings, direct connections to companies and industry communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[PROJECT OUTCOME REPORT: IIP1034720 Collaborative Research: I/UCRC-Membrane Science, Engineering and Technology Center University of Colorado Boulder  This is the Progress Outcome Report for NSF award IIP1034720, entitled, Collaborative Research: I/UCRC-Membrane Science, Engineering and Technology Center.  This five-year Phase I award started in July 2010 and established a Multi-University Center with the lead site at New Jersey Institute of Technology and a participating site at the University of Colorado Boulder (UCB).  A third site at University of Arkansas was awarded in March 2014 and planning for a fourth site at Pennsylvania State University is currently underway.  At the request of the NSF I/UCRC program manager, the UCB site operated under two no-cost extensions, which resulted in a June 30, 2017 end date for the Phase I award.  The UCB site was awarded Phase II status in July 2016.  The capabilities and resources available to the MAST Center sites facilitated development of a multifaceted research program characterized by both breadth and focus.  During the Phase I award period, the Center research program addressed the continuing need for novel membrane materials and structures, innovative membrane characterization techniques as well as fundamental and applied knowledge regarding selective species transport mechanisms and membrane fouling.  The research program sustained long-term interests in water and energy, and evolved new thrusts in food and barrier materials.  Overall, the Center successfully married the interests of membrane manufacturers and membrane users.  During the Phase I award period, the UCB site generated 62 peer-reviewed publications, four master?s degree theses, eight doctoral theses, and 117 presentations at national and international conferences.  During Phase I, the UCB site received over $2.5M in industrial sponsor fees, generated $5.1M of spin-off funding from 23 awards, and produced 11 invention disclosures and 10 provisional patents.  These site metrics resulted from sustained efforts by UCB to attract high-quality graduate students, add new faculty with relevant technical expertise, and diligently disseminate research results at major national and international meetings and via publication in first rank journals.  Overall, the MAST Center supported 47 research projects at six universities, which involved active participation from 37 faculty members, 43 graduate students, 17 post-doctoral fellows and eight undergraduate researchers.  The Center also welcomed five small businesses as MAST Center members through the NSF Supplemental Opportunity for SBIR/STTR Memberships in the I/UCRC program.  MAST Center directors and faculty made significant contributions to NSF during the term of this award such as leading session and roundtable discussions at the NSF I/UCRC annual meetings.  MAST Center faculty were also significant contributors to the membrane community via leadership and service in many professional activities including organizing major meetings, chairing technical sessions, and editing scientific journals.  The MAST Center has benefited from a diverse group of sponsors who remain committed to meaningful Center accomplishment.  Sponsors have retained long-term Center membership because of the high quality and relevance of our research projects.  In addition, sponsors regard their Center participation as a professional growth experience with a positive career impact.  From a broad perspective, membrane research has significantly contributed to many areas of society.  In particular, Center research has facilitated the production of more effective pharmaceuticals, increased amounts of potable water to places where it is in short supply, assisted in environmental cleanup, and streamlined petroleum refining processes.  The UCB site plans to continue its significant contributions to overall MAST Center success.          Last Modified: 06/20/2017       Submitted by: Alan R Greenberg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
