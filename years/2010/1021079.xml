<AbstractNarration>Fungi are primary decomposers in temperate forests and their activities are important in determining the ability of forest soils to supply nutrients for plant growth and carbon sequestration.  Shifts in the abundance, diversity, and activity of fungi are likely to have significant consequences for ecosystem function.  Environmental change can have severe impacts on biological diversity, but relatively little is known about how soil fungi are affected, especially as compared to other organism groups.  This project examines how soil fungi are affected by climate warming and nitrogen deposition, two important environmental changes in the Northeastern U.S. The specific objectives are to: (1) investigate the effects of chronic soil warming and nitrogen additions on the biodiversity of decomposer fungi; (2) determine if the fungi that grow in warmed or nitrogen-enriched plots persist because they are able to tolerate many different environments or because they have adapted to grow in the new environments of the experimental plots; and (3) examine the relationship between fungal diversity and decomposition in response to warming and nitrogen additions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will make a new and fundamental contribution to the understanding of the ecology of soil fungi by examining fungal evolution/adaptation in a global change context.  It will also add a great deal to what is known about the biodiversity of decomposer fungi and will provide information on how changes in the fungal community drive decomposition dynamics under conditions of altered temperature and nitrogen availability.  Fungi are also emerging as infectious diseases of humans and other organisms.  Climate change is clearly playing a role in the appearance of these novel diseases, and this work with a more benign group of fungi will provide data on the general features of fungal evolution in a changed climate.  This project also supports the collaboration between project personnel and the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) in the development and distribution of a game that educates children about fungi. Lichens and mushrooms are startlingly beautiful and obvious to even the casual observer.  "Fungal Bingo" teaches very young children about the amazing colors and shapes of the fungi they see in their own parks and forests.  The partnership with EOL will result in a web-based version of Fungal Bingo that can be assembled automatically from local species lists.</AbstractNarration>

The Anthropocene may date to the time James Watt invented the steam engine, although other scientists have proposed alternative start dates, including dates tied to the permanent record left by radioactive isotopes generated from atomic bombs. A hallmark of the Anthropocene is biodiversity loss, but less well understood is how remaining species may be adapting to global change and other human influences, including nitrogen (N) pollution. Human activities, including agriculture, industrialization, the burning of fossil fuels, and land-use change, have greatly increased the input of N to terrestrial environments, in large part mediated by the invention of the Haber-Bosch process of ammonia synthesis, used to take nitrogen from the atmosphere and fix it into a form people can use. Before the industrial revolution, biological N fixation was probably something like 60 Tg&middot;yr<sup>-1 </sup>while in 2005, anthropogenic N fixation was estimated as approximately 185 Tg&middot;yr<sup>-1</sup>. In the temperate forests of the Northeast U.S., chronic N deposition is influencing carbon cycles, and for example as leaves fall to the ground they no longer turn to soil as quickly. Nor does soil decompose as quickly as it used to. Fungi are the organisms typically responsible for decomposition. In our work we have found that not only is the biodiversity of fungi changing, but the species that remain are less able to decompose leaves. Our central experiment involved isolating cultures of the same species of fungi from both high N and low N environments. This was possible because we based our work at the Chronic Nitrogen Amendment Study (CNAS) of Harvard Forest&rsquo;s Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in Petersham, MA, USA. At the CNAS, N has been experimentally added to soil for over 28 years, and so we could compare control fungi (which have only been exposed to ambient N) to fungi exposed to medium and very high levels of N, levels which mimic the N of a future world. Both growth and the ability of species to decay litter were significantly altered by long-term exposure to N enrichment. Litter decay by N isolates was generally lower as compared to decay by control isolates of the same species, a response that was not reversed when N isolates were grown in control environments. The data suggest fungi from N plots have evolved, and while ours is a single experiment focused on one critical subset of biodiversity, it adds to a nascent body of knowledge suggesting many species (and not just fungi) are evolving in response to the myriad of anthropogenic influences.
