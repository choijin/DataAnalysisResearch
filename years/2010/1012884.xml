<AbstractNarration>Dr. Vladimir Sidorov and coworkers at the Chemistry Department of Virginia Commonwealth University have identified a family of cyclen-based receptors for water-soluble anionic dyes.  With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry at NSF, the Sidorov group is developing techniques based on cyclen-based receptors for monitoring biomembrane processes.  Cyclen-based receptors that bind anionic dyes and dyes conjugated to biologically-relevant substrates will be designed and synthesized.  Techniques based on these receptors will be developed for membrane leakage assay, intra-cellular trafficking of the liposomal content, the analysis of drug delivery systems, and the separation of heparin oligomers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research, which employs supramolecular chemistry in techniques for monitoring biomembrane processes and for separating bioactive compounds, would have implications for human therapeutics and broadly impact the bioorganic and biological communities.   The research training and educational activities of this project would contribute to human resource development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the help of this NSF award, several new technologies in the fields crossing the boundaries of Chemistry, Biology and Physiology have been developed.  Most importantly, this funding allowed the researchers to develop a path for testing the cellular proteins, known as ion channels at unprecedented detail. These proteins govern the performance of the central neural system, allowing individual cells to communicate with each other and to maintain their homeostasis. The mulfunction of ion channels in neurons often leads to serious neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or schisophrenia.  Whereas the techniques used to study the ion channel activity have been implemented decades ago, these techniques have not able to test the activity of ion channels in a specific local environment, which varies significantly across the cell membrane.  Even though it was proposed many years ago, that the functional behavior of individual ion channels may strongly depend on whether they are surrounded by stiff islands mostly made of cholesterol, or by much more flexible areas comprising phosphorilated lipids, this hypothesis has not been resolved up to date due to the lack of appropriate techniques.  The research team has found a direct path to resolve this issue: they have developed a chemical technology that allowed them to select an ion channel from one or another area and to test it in its local native environment. The implications of this new technology are significant: once the influence of local environment on the physiology of ion channels is established, new approaches to the treatment of neurological diseases will emerge.  In addition, very similar chemical approach has been proven efficient to detect rare proteins in cell membranes. While being in the initial stage of the development, this approach wil eventually allow to detect proteins that are produced by the cells in the very early stages of cancer, allowing early diagnosis of such condition.  Further developments have lead the researchers to develop a physiologically  innocuous drug delivery system that allows the drug to circulate in the blood stream for prolonged time silently, and to release the drug in portions when required. Such drug delivery system may become especially useful for the diabetes type 1 patients.  Finally, a new separation procedure has been developed, that allows a facile purification of biological targets of interest. It is especially important when it comes to the targets that are not easily separated by other conventional means.
