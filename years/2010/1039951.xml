<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MRI award to researchers and engineers from WHOI and University of Michigan seek to assemble a suite of instrumentation to further both research and educational training into the practical and theoretical aspects of the navigation and communication capabilities of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs).  The application focus is to encourage a more routine operation of relatively inexpensive AUVs in under sea-ice, floating ice shelves and large iceberg environments. Such studies are recognized (e.g. IPCC AR4) as critical needs to our understanding of climate induced changes in the cryosphere, and the implications such changes may have for  future sea level rise, planetary albedo, and other aspects of climate prediction.  Our current limited understanding of ice/ocean interactions at the terminal margins of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are notably lacking in direct and sustained observation of factors such as basal roughness, subglacial hydrology and topographic conditions, temporal and spatial variability of ice sheet and meltwater flow fields,  ocean thermal, salinity and current fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awareness of the approach and progress to its realization will be communicated by the investigators to the public and K-12 activities under ongoing programs at their respective institutions. Successful results will be of immediate interest to polar and climate scientists engaged in observation and modeling studies. The increasing number of small AUVs that exist in the US academic and oceanographic agencies provides a natural focus for student involvement in research and development projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rapid changes in the polar regions are raising concerns about sea level rise. The decrease of both sea-ice in the Arctic region and the net mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets is likely due to a combination of factors , but in both cases ice/ocean interactions have recently emerged as a significant driver. However, our limited understanding of the relevant dynamics in both environments makes it difficult to evaluate the oceanÆs role and, also, improve climate predictions. This proposal was aimed at developing the navigation and communications infrastructure to allow the routine operation of small AUVs in extended adaptive missions under-ice in the polar regions. Our focus was a number of related critical technologies That the vehicle could be transformed from being completely autonomous to seamlessly working in an acoustically tethered mode to allow for far more adaptive missions, real time data offload, and if required, operator intervention to help mitigate the risk in working in such environments. Modifying the existing acoustic communications systems on these AUVs and augmenting them so that they can operate at lower frequencies to increase range with the goal to expand our capabilities for point-to-point command and control links, as well as for acoustic navigation. Vehicle developments also focussed on the context of a small adaptive network that allowed intermediate vehicles to serve as communication relays and navigation aids to other vehicles operating further under the ice. These technologies were demonstrated on a number of field exercises and cruises of opportunity which included  Local testing in Buzzards Bay off Woods Hole Working off the Australian Icebreaker Aurora Australis in Eastern Antarctica Testing at the West GreenlandÆs Sarqardliup Glacier Working in the Arctic off the USCG Icebreaker Healey Our work was picked up for a story by Reuters News Service that subsequently was featured in newspapers around the world.  A number of graduate students participated in this research including Jeff Kaeli, Christopher Murphy, Clayton Kunz (MIT-WHOI Joint Program) and Jeff Walls (U of Michigan).
