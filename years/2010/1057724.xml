<AbstractNarration>This travel award will support student participation in the IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom) to be held from March 21st to March 25th, 2011, in Seattle, Washington. This is the flagship conference of the pervasive computing community. The conference offers a valuable opportunity to present research results, to learn about the state of the art in pervasive computing, and to train doctoral students through the PhD forum. Of particular value to participating students will be the PhD Forum. In addition to a traditional PhD Forum that consists primarily of poster presentations, the 2011 conference will extend the forum to include a more concrete benefit to student participants. In particular, the PerCom 2011 PhD Forum will include a closed session for participants that will take place one day before the conference starts. The students and the Forum committee members (approximately 6 individuals) will come together for a working session to discuss concerns related to performing PhD research and building a post-dissertation career. Specifically, topics discussed in the Forum will include discussions on how to formulate and follow through on research questions, discussions and critiques of presenting research ideas and solutions, discussions and demonstrations on providing evidence to support research, and a panel focused on how to launch and sustain a research career. The travel awards will focus on particularly recruiting women and minority students to attend the conference by advertising the support opportunity on the PerCom web page and on web sites targeted toward women and minority students, including NSF-sponsored IGERT and REU web sites.</AbstractNarration>
