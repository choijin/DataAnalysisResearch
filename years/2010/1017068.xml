<AbstractNarration>Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) has been used as the main memory in computer systems for decades.  However, DRAM technologies are facing both scalability and power issues.  With the superior scalability, phase-change memory (PCM) has become an attractive DRAM alternative to implement high-capacity, ultra-dense main memory systems.  Recent advances in nano-scale material engineering have also enabled fabricating phase change memory using nano-scale structures (e.g. nano-wire), which exhibit ultra-low programming power than the conventional thin-film based substrates.  Although technology scaling and advanced material engineering provide smaller and denser devices, they make architecting reliable, power-efficient and high-performance phase change memory systems increasingly challenging.  If left unattended, these challenges will soon become showstoppers of future phase change memory systems by either preventing them from scaling down to smaller feature sizes or resulting in the inefficient operation of these systems.  This collaborative research project aims to improve the efficiency of phase change memory systems as the underlying processing technology scaling continues, including: (1) Cross-layer process variation characterization, modeling and mitigation for phase change memory (2) Nano-wire based PCM design exploration and (3) Resistance drift resilient phase change memory system.  In addition, this project will develop a comprehensive full-system simulation infrastructure that consists of PCM device/array/architecture multi-scale models and architecture/OS techniques that will allow the computer architecture design community to study the trade offs and optimizations of employing emerging phase change based memory systems in light of advanced process technology and material engineering.  This collaborative research project will facilitate ultra-density, low-power and reliable phase change based non-volatile memory systems to most effectively leverage emerging nano-scale material and fabrication technologies to tackle the grand "Memory Wall" challenge faced in today's computer design community.  It can greatly contribute to enabling high-performance computing to stay on track with its historic scaling as the number of CPU cores increases and workloads become more memory intensive, and hence benefit numerous real-life applications running from high-end servers to low-end embedded systems.  This collaborative research project will also contribute to society through engaging under-represented groups, research infrastructure dissemination for education and training, and outreach to non-volatile memory design industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The  completed research project will help computer and electronic device manufacturers design improved computer architectures for new emerging memory technologies that could potentially improve memory system performance, power-efficiency, and reliability through advanced process technologies and memory device engineering.  This basic research study has also engaged both graduate and undergraduate students and increased the capabilities of the Boise State University microfabrication facility  as well as provided undergraduate students with training specific to the semiconductor processing industry which is a major contributor to the local economy.     For decades, computer and electronic devices have used a memory technology called dynamic random access memory, or DRAM. As is clear from the movement toward small devices like smart phones you can hold in your hand or fitness trackers you wear on a wrist, there is an increasing emphasis on making such devices smaller, and also reducing energy consumption and battery recharge time. Further, to fit more information on each device, manufacturers and users also seek high-density memory options. Unfortunately, there are physical limits on how small DRAM technologies can go, and how much more technologists can improve DRAM capacity and reduce power consumption. Therefore, our research project, Architecting Technology Enabled Phase Change Memory Systems, addresses this by leveraging new materials and advanced fabrication methods to ultimately develop a comprehensive full-system simulation infrastructure that consists of phase change memory  device/array/architecture models and architecture operating system techniques that will allow the computer architecture design community to study the trade-offs of employing emerging phase change-based memory systems.  Boise State University and the University of Florida formed an interdisciplinary partnership to complete this task. The emphasis here at Boise State, described in the remainder of this summary, was to address materials engineering and fabrication aspects, and to provide completed chip options to our partners for performance testing in test architectures.     At Boise State University, we developed phase-change memory device arrays and back-end-of-line processing techniques for devices that leveraged the unique capabilities of what are called chalcogenide materials.  Using the Boise State University Idaho Microfabrication Laboratory, the team fabricated 10 x 10 arrays (Fig. 1), including developing an electron-beam lithography (EBL) fabrication process to achieve 180 nm device sizes.  We packaged the die containing arrays in 24-pin ceramic packages (Fig. 2) for testing and supplied them to our collaborative partner for incorporation into test architectures.  Developing EBL capabilities for our 10 x 10 arrays has the potential to positively impact a range of researchers as it will enable future projects for both the primary investigator as well as other researchers to fabricate small arrays at desirable nanometer device sizes.     The Boise State team used three different materials systems to fabricate the devices. Doing so enabled us to investigate the electrical properties that could influence resistance drift and programming conditions so we could optimize pulse programming conditions and reduce programming current.  Fabricated device testing included a study of the device programming threshold voltage and resistances as a function of temperature, from 5 K to 340 K.  We used this information to investigate conduction mechanisms of the three materials systems and to explore the relationship of these conduction mechanisms with the resistance drift and pulse programming conditions.     The devices we characterized were comprised of layers of chalcogenide materials that possess the unique property of functioning as phase-change memory devices after they have been activated through the application of an electrical signal with a specific p...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
