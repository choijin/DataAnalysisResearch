<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Modified Title: In Vivo Imaging of Hepatocyte Zonation in Mouse Liver  I worked with Professor Chen-Yuan Dong at National Taiwan University last summer as an EAPSI Fellow. As the project title suggests, we were originally going to investigate the efficacy of zinc oxide nanoparticle-based sunblocks against UV radiation. However, we later decided that my project should focus on investigating properties of the liver. This was mainly because other members of the Dong group were working on the liver at the time of my arrival, and a collaboration with the Dong groupÃ†s current work would allow for a higher chance of producing results within the seven-week project timeframe.  Our project involved in vivo imaging of the liver using multiphoton microscopy (MPM). MPM is a special microscopy method that allows us to look inside the liver without actually cutting the liver open. We used this technique to observe the liver inside a living mouse (the mouse was under anesthesia during the entire procedure). A primary liver function is to metabolize molecules, and different zones of the liver are responsible for metabolizing different types of molecules.

This research is important for better understanding how the liver works. Many diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are becoming more common, and it is important to understand how these diseases develop in order to counteract them. Looking at tissue "in vivo" is very advantageous because it allows scientists to see dynamics that are much harder to see when looking at dead tissue.  Professor Dong is an expert at MPM imaging in biological tissue and uses it to look at many organs including the liver, the skin, and the intestines.
