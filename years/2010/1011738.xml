<AbstractNarration>This project will address the development of a class of novel and very efficient numerical methods for incompressible flows based on a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes equations that has been proved well-posed and provides boundary conditions for the viscous contribution to pressure in terms of vorticity circulation.  The main insight is that the total creation of boundary vorticity can be computed exactly by a commutator between the Laplacian and Helmholtzprojection operators. Moreover, this term is dominated by the viscosity term, hence we can treat it explicitly to gain efficiency and &lt;br/&gt;stability. The major advance is that the method can be formulated in standard continuous finite element space, and there is no compatibility condition needed for the velocity and pressure approximation spaces. Hence the standard fast solver can be applied to Navier-Stokes equation directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accurate, efficient simulations of 3D flows in complicated domain are still  major challeges for many scientific and engineering problems. The resolution of the flows near physical boundaries is essential to the accurate prediction of the body force such as the lift and drag, shedding of vortex and boundary layer separation. The success of this project will have an important impact on many branches of science and engineering. It will give more accurate predictions of body force which will result in better energy efficiency for transportation related applications. It will provide fast and reliable simulations for scientific research and engineering application.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

For instance, flocks of birds, fish schools or herds of gregarious mammals form large coherent spatial or temporal structures while, paradoxically, their agents interact only locally with their close neighbors. The seminal work of Vicsek (1995) and Cucker-Smale (2007) have generated much of research activities. Mathematical analyses of the flocking behavior and phase transition, as well as the passage from particle/agent model to kinetic model and to hydrodynamical models turned out to be very difficulty.

Frouvelle I proved in that the equilibrium distribution function changes type according to whether the density is below or above a certain threshold value. Below this value, the only equilibrium distribution is isotropic in velocity direction and is stable. Any  initial distribution relaxes exponentially fast to this isotropic equilibrium state. By contrast, when the density is above the threshold, a second class of anisotropic equilibria formed by Von-Mises-Fischer distributions of arbitrary orientation appears. The isotropic equilibria become unstable and any initial distribution relaxes towards one of these anisotropic states with exponential speed of convergence.   The methods I developed together with my collaborators will benefit others in solving related problems, particularly in plasmas physics and mechanical engineering. Mathematical analysis of flocking and swarming dynamics provide much insight in modeling of some biological systems.
