<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: A workshop will be held in Washington, DC in June, 2010, bringing together U.S. scientists engaged in geoscience research in Africa and their African collaborators in order to examine and codify the scientific rationale for expanding the AfricaArray (AA) seismic network into a multidisciplinary science network. As the AA seismic network has been developed over recent years, many scientists from allied fields have expressed interest in expanding the geographic extent of the network and adding additional sensors to the network for making a range of in-situ measurements, including for atmospheric science (including climate), geodesy, geography, hydrology, seismology, and space weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives for the workshop are: &lt;br/&gt;(1) To obtain community input on key science questions (multidisciplinary and discipline-specific) that cannot be addressed without new observations from Africa; &lt;br/&gt;(2) To determine the observational infrastructure needed to provide common data sets for addressing the science questions; &lt;br/&gt;(3) To determine the observational infrastructure needed to provide discipline-specific data sets for addressing the science questions;&lt;br/&gt;(4) To explore the intersection and overlap between the observational infrastructure identified in (2) and (3) and existing infrastructure within the AA network;&lt;br/&gt;(5) To investigate broader impacts, including best options for communicating and disseminating science information to government and non-government organization (NGO) decision-makers and supporting educational activities in Africa and the U.S.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These objectives are linked to three specific outcomes for the workshop; (a) a science plan that will describe the scientific rationale for expanding the AA network, (b) a logistics plan that will outline the observational needs for each science field and indicate how the existing AfricaArray network can be adapted to meet those needs, and (c) a broader impacts plan that will discuss ways to support science education in Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of this workshop include laying the foundation to expand research and education activities in many science fields in Africa for the benefit of many African faculty and students and for the U.S. faculty and students who are conducting research in Africa.  In addition, the workshop will provide a forum for developing plans for communicating data and research to a broad audience, both domestic and international.  Both early career scientists and graduate students will participate in the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding from this grant was used to support a workshop on June 2-4, 2010 at Howard University titled "US-Africa workshop on expanding the AfricaArray network to support multidisciplinary science in Africa".   The objectives of the workshop were to 1) obtain community input on key science questions (multidisciplinary and discipline-specific) that cannot be addressed without new observations from Africa, 2) determine the observational infrastructure needed to provide cross-cutting and discipline-specific data sets for addressing the science questions, 3) explore the intersection and overlap between the observational infrastructure identified above and existing infrastructure within the AfricaArray network, and 4) investigate broader impacts, including best options for communicating and disseminating science information to government and non-government organization (NGOs) decision-makers and supporting educational activities in Africa and the U.S.  The proposed outcomes for the workshop were to 1) develop a science plan describing the rationale for developing a single instrumentation initiative the addresses the needs of several geoscience disciplines, 2) develop a logistics plan that outlines the observational needs for each science field and indicates how the existing AfricaArray network can be adapted to meet those needs, and 3) develop "broader impacts" plan discussing ways to support science education in Africa and the U.S. and how to effectively provide information to decision-makers in government agencies and NGOs.  The workshop was attended by over 80 participants from the U.S., Africa and Europe spanning a range of geoscience disciplines, including atmospheric science, climate science, geography, ecology, hydrology, geophysics, geodesy, and space weather. The workshop was organized in seven sessions. In the first session, overview talks on science projects and research questions were provided for each of the major disciplinary areas represented by the workshop participants. Sessions 2-5 consisted of working groups and reports back from the working groups to a plenary session. Session 6 consisted of a series of presentations that synthesized and reviewed the compelling multidisciplinary science that could be addressed with an expanded science network. In the final session, an outline for a new science plan for AfricaArray was discussed.  There was overwhelming interest from the workshop participants to move forward with expanding AfricaArray into an interdisciplinary network to support research and education across a range of geoscience fields.  Input was obtained from participants within each field on the compelling science questions that could be addressed with an expanded sensor network and the kinds of in-situ observations that are needed.  This information was condensed into a draft outline for a new science plan for AfricaArray, and writing assignments for the various parts of the plan were made at the end of the workshop.  Because of the broad interest in expanding AfricaArray, it was also decided that a follow-on workshop should be held in Africa to obtain additional and more far reaching input from scientists in Africa.  Following the workshop in June, plans were put together quickly to add to the annual AfricaArray workshop an additional two days of discussion about expanding AfricaArray.  The annual AfricaArray workshop held November 21-22 in Johannesburg, and was preceded on November 19-20 with discussions on vetting and revising the science and logistics plan for an expanded AfricaArray.  The four-day combined event was attended by about 80 participants from across Africa.   As a result of these two workshops, several achievements have been made towards expanding AfricaArray.  1) A paper has been published in EOS, Trans. AGU documenting the history of AfricaArray and the current status of the expansion into all areas of the geosciences.  2) Drafts of several chapters of the science plan have been written. 3)...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
