<AbstractNarration>Most of the published research results about immersed finite element&lt;br/&gt;(IFE) methods deal with 2nd order elliptic interface problems. This project &lt;br/&gt;plans to extend the research on developing and analyzing IFE methods for &lt;br/&gt;interface problems to more sophisticated partial differential equations such &lt;br/&gt;as the Stokes system and the linear elasticity system which are of great &lt;br/&gt;importance in many applications of engineering and sciences. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;research consists of three key modules which complement each other. The first &lt;br/&gt;part is to develop new IFE functions and integrate them into modern finite &lt;br/&gt;element techniques for solving Stokes and linear elasticity interface problems. &lt;br/&gt;The intent is to find suitable IFE functions locally in interface elements &lt;br/&gt;that can handle interface jump conditions required by the interface problems &lt;br/&gt;and other conditions such as the inf-sup stability condition required by the &lt;br/&gt;finite element formulations to be used. The proposed research will result in &lt;br/&gt;efficient and robust IFE methods with an emphasis on DG formulations that &lt;br/&gt;simplify local h-, p-, and hp- refinements on Cartesian meshes. The second &lt;br/&gt;module is the theoretical analysis of IFEs, starting from their interpolation &lt;br/&gt;approximation capabilities and deriving error bounds for IFE solutions. The &lt;br/&gt;challenges are that the traditional analysis techniques have a limited use &lt;br/&gt;here. For example, using equivalent quotient norm in the scaling argument &lt;br/&gt;leads to an estimate for IFE interpolation useless for further deriving &lt;br/&gt;estimate of IFE solution unless it can be shown that the constants in the &lt;br/&gt;error bounds are independent of the interface. Also, 2D and 3D IFE methods are &lt;br/&gt;essentially non-confirming methods whose error estimations are often more &lt;br/&gt;complicated. The third module is about the applications of IFE methods. In &lt;br/&gt;addition to improving the IFE solver for the particle-in-cell simulator, this &lt;br/&gt;project will investigate the applications of IFE methods to be developed to &lt;br/&gt;multi-fluid Stokes flow problems and the multi-material shape/topology &lt;br/&gt;optimization problems involving the linear elasticity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IFE methods to be developed in this project can provide new and efficient &lt;br/&gt;simulation tools that can use structured/Cartesian meshes to solve challenging &lt;br/&gt;interface problems involving multi-scale and multi-physics with nontrivial &lt;br/&gt;interfaces in many areas of engineering and science, including flow problems, &lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic problems, shape/topology optimization problems, to name just a &lt;br/&gt;few. This research project will proceed in harmony with the development of IFE &lt;br/&gt;software packages to verify and support the theory, and address complex and &lt;br/&gt;realistic problems from a variety of disciplines. This strategy will enable &lt;br/&gt;theoretical innovation to become practice much more quickly than traditionally &lt;br/&gt;possible. The proposed research projects will have a great potential to impact &lt;br/&gt;on numerical simulations in the design/research of ion-propulsion engines for &lt;br/&gt;interplanetary deep space travel, optimal packaging of electronic devices, &lt;br/&gt;efficient and better image reconstruction in computer tomography, non-&lt;br/&gt;destructive/non-invasive detection of suspicious materials in security check, &lt;br/&gt;design of optimal shapes for lighter and stronger structures, and many other &lt;br/&gt;application areas of great federal interests.</AbstractNarration>
