<AbstractNarration>This project implements the principles of Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) in order to improve student learning in the physical chemistry laboratory (PCL) course. Tested POGIL principles are being used to develop inquiry-based physical chemistry experiments that emphasize macroscopic and molecular models of chemical phenomena.  The intellectual merit of the POGIL-PCL project lies in its four objectives: (1) writing POGIL physical chemistry experiments each of which has completed a screen-review-implementation-revise cycle and includes an instructor's user guide; (2) promoting the professional development of physical chemistry instructors with workshops focused on writing materials and implementation and facilitation strategies for POGIL physical chemistry experiments; (3) creating a community of physical chemistry instructors who write, review, and use these experiments and who can train additional instructors after the project is complete; and (4) developing different types of workshops in order to assess the ease with which the new field-tested methods are adopted. Building a vibrant, growing community of instructors who collaborate on generating and using POGIL-PCL experiments is the key to the success of the project.  The project's broader impact is derived from the collaboration of faculty members from research universities, small PUIs, HBCUs, and others who have committed to form the nucleus of this community. The POGIL-PCL project is making available a wide range of physical chemistry experiments with training materials and practitioner support so that instructors may assess their needs and resources and choose from a variety of turn-key experiments that best enhance their students' learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Objectives  The POGIL-Physical Chemistry Laboratory project (POGIL-PCL) has these objectives:  To develop POGIL physical chemistry experiments based on an established rubric that have completed a screen-review-implementation-revise cycle and include instructor's user guides. To promote the professional development of physical chemistry instructors with workshops focused on writing materials, developing implementation and facilitation strategies for POGIL physical chemistry experiments, and building a community of practitioners. To create a community of physical chemistry instructors who write, review, and use these experiments and who can train additional instructors after the project is complete.   Workshops  Workshops are the centerpiece of the POGIL-PCL Project. The POGIL-PCL experiment model (Figure 1) was developed with input from participants at the first three workshops. Most experiments developed during the grant period were tested at the workshops, and feedback from participants improved these experiments. The foundation of a strong faculty network was laid at the workshops. The opportunity for faculty to meet and work together is invaluable, especially for faculty who are the only physical chemistry laboratory instructor at their institution.  We held eight workshops at VCU and two workshops at the Biennial Conference on Chemical Education (BCCE). Workshops at VCU were attended by ten to twenty participants and facilitated by the PIÆs. A sample workshop agenda is attached (Figure 2). Our workshops begin with everyone doing the same POGIL-PCL experiment, facilitated by a workshop participant. Next, we break into two "tracks": development and dissemination. Participants interested in writing new POGIL-PCL experiments find similar interests, and they begin (or continue) writing. Other participants want to try as many POGIL-PCL experiments as possible. Both groups come together at the end of the workshop to share what they have learned.  Experiments  The POGIL-PCL experiment framework is diagrammed Figure 1.  The title of the experiment is a conceptual question to be answered by doing the experiment.  The heart of the experiment are "data-think cycles" in which students answer preparatory questions, make a prediction, follow a standard protocol to test the prediction, and analyze the data.  Experiments are designed such that at least two cycles are needed to answer the title question for the experiment.  Ultimately, students apply the concepts learned or probe the concepts more deeply in post-experiment questions.  Each pass through the cycle immerses the students more deeply into the concept.  The first data-think cycle generally focuses on a qualitative outcome, and successive cycles emphasize graphing data and quantitative modeling.  POGIL-PCL experiments cover topics ranging from kinetics to thermodynamics to spectroscopy.  We have five stages of progress for the experiments: (1) development (minimal classroom testing); (2) alpha-testing (experiments are tested in the authorsÆ classrooms); (3) review (tested experiments are reviewed by faculty using a POGIL-PCL screening rubric); (4) beta-testing (reviewed experiments are tested in new classrooms); and (5) publication to the pogil.org Web site.  Figure 3 (attached) lists the experiments with each experimentÆs stage of development.  Most experiments are designed to be completed by an entire class simultaneously in which data is shared by the class, but the experiments have been adapted for "round-robin" classrooms.  Faculty Network  A key outcome of the POGIL-PCL project is the development of a strong faculty network as a direct result of our workshop model: Faculty come to workshops and then collaborate to write, test, review, revise, and implement experiments. Because the network is strong, it is more likely that faculty will implement POGIL-PCL experiment; more faculty will implement guided inquiry and active learning in their classes; and more likely that the pro...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
