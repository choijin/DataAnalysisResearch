<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to explore and harness the transverse Anderson localization as a novel guiding mechanism in disordered optical fibers. The key transformative attribute of this research is the introduction of a new guiding mechanism in optical fibers besides the conventional index-guiding and the more recent band-gap-guiding and gain-guiding mechanisms. The disordered fibers are based on the novel behavior of high- and low-refractive index regions in phase-separated glasses. The research will characterize the emergence of the localized states, as well as their linear and nonlinear guiding properties at various disorder levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transverse Anderson localization was recently observed in a disordered optical waveguide, created by optical interference in a photo-refractive dielectric. Here, transverse Anderson localization will be investigated in an optical fiber medium. The fiber-based set-up is robust; the availability of well-established fiber characterization techniques enables a more detailed study of the localization phenomenon. For example, it enables direct access to the disordered refractive index profile (through SEM pictures), as well as access to the optical field. A fiber-based study is also the gateway to device-level implementation of the localization phenomenon in optical waveguides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical fibers are the backbone of communication around the globe, and play a critical role in the manufacturing, defense, and health sciences industries. The fundamental understanding and mastery of novel optical fibers is vital to the national security and technological competitiveness of the United States for the development of the next generation of high-speed communication devices and lightwave-based defense applications.</AbstractNarration>
