<AbstractNarration>The project has three main themes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms: The study of techniques such as lifting to speed up algorithms based on Markov chains, as well as the analysis of Markov chains---for lattice triangulations and the random cluster model---that are beyond the range of current techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Statistical physics and computation: A continuing study of the Glauber dynamics for spin systems, focusing especially on the key open question of the influence of boundary conditions on the mixing time; the harnessing of an emerging understanding of spatial mixing to derive new algorithms and complexity results for counting and sampling problems; the application of new techniques for the analysis of the Boltzmann equation in physics to a computational study of nonlinear models in population genetics and genetic algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Mobile geometric graphs: A mathematically rigorous investigation of the effects -- in terms of both increased power and novel algorithmic challenges -- of introducing mobile nodes into models of wireless networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous connections among the themes provide intellectual coherence.  For example, Markov chains play a central role in statistical physics through the Glauber dynamics; phase transitions and threshold phenomena appear in all three themes, as does the pervasive notion of dynamical evolution of a system over time; and the understanding of mobile geometric graphs is intimately connected with continuum percolation in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, all three themes are examples of outreach from theoretical computer science to other disciplines, notably probability theory, statistical physics and wireless networking, and the project is expected to contribute to cross-fertilization between computer science and these fields.  Throughout the project, the choice of research questions is driven not only by their intrinsic significance but also by the challenges that they present to existing techniques and the extent to which they illuminate connections with these other fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has supported research at the boundary between computer science, statistical physics, mathematics and electrical engineering.  Specifically, the PI and his collaborators have sought to view problems in various scientific disciplines through a "computational lens," motivated by the observation that many scientific phenomena are computational in nature and can therefore benefit from a computer science viewpoint.  The following are three representative examples of concrete outcomes from the project:  1. Phase transitions in statistical physics.  A "phase transition" in physics occurs when a system undergoes a sudden change in its basic properties when some environmental variable (such as temperature) is varied.  A familiar example is the freezing (or boiling) of water.  Mathematically, systems like this are modeled by the interactions of a very large number of microscopic particles arranged in space; at a phase transition, there is a sudden change in the global behavior of the particles (such as switching from being uncoordinated, or disordered, to being highly ordered).  This part of the project has brought tools from computer science to bear on the study of phase transitions, both by helping to better understand exactly when phase transitions occur, and by investigating how the dynamics of such systems are related to phase transitions.  2. Mobile wireless networks.  Numerous applications of wireless technology today are based on so-called "ad hoc" networks, in which a large number of simple wireless devices are moving in space.  Examples include vehicular networks (where sensors are attached to cars, buses or taxis), surveillance and disaster recovery applications (where sensors are used to survey an area), and pocket-switched networks based on short-range mobile communication devices.  Typically, due to power and range limitations, each device can only communicate with others that are within a certain range of it.  Thus, as the devices move, the topology of the network is constantly changing.  This part of the project developed new mathematical machinery to study the properties of mobile wireless networks, under a much more realistic model than had been used in the past.  Among the concrete applications analyzed were the time to detect a mobile target, and the time to broadcast a message from one sensor to all other sensors in the network.  3. Lattice triangulations.  Consider an n x n array of points arranged in a square grid.  A triangulation of these points is a set of non-crossing edges between pairs of points that is maximal (i.e., no more edges can be added).  It turns out that every such triangulation divides up the n x n square region containing the points into exactly (1/2)n2 triangles, each with area 1/2.  What can we say about the properties of "typical" triangulations?  Are the triangles mostly long and skinny (as in right figure), or mostly short and fat (as in the left figure)?  While this may seem like a recreational problem, there is in fact some deep mathematics behind it that is connected to fundamental questions in classical geometry and in algebraic geometry.  This part of the project studied the properties of such triangulations, using tools from computer science.  Suppose we weight the triangulations according to the total length of their edges; in the left figure slightly more weight is given to triangulations with short edge length, and in the right figure slightly more weight is given to triangulations with long edge length.  The figure in the middle is the unweighted case, where all triangulations have the same weight.  These figures suggest that the unweighted case is very special, and achieves a delicate balance between the other two regimes, in which either "long" or "short" triangles dominate.  In fact, it appears that we are witnessing a phase transition here (see item #1 above).  Our study was able to provide rigorous mathematical justification for this claim, and also to analyze a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
