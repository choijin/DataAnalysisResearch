<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research at Undergraduate Institutions project is focused on developing a fundamental understanding of the surface chemistry and morphology of POSS-based thin film hybrid polymers as they can be applied to microfabrication technologies. Specifically, we address two key issues: (1.) developing a model of understanding the kinetics of crystallization and phase behavior in POSS-based films through in-situ and ex-situ materials characterization techniques and (2.) demonstrating surface modification strategies in POSS-based thin films that have the potential to be applicable to microfabrication technologies including metal adhesion and microfluidics. Materials properties will be studied using a combination of surface analysis techniques including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic and lateral force microscopy (AFM/LFM), time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS), variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), attenuated total internal reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and contact angle measurements. Crystallization kinetics will be studied using in-situ and real-time AFM at different temperatures and correlated to ToF-SIMS, ATR-FTIR and VASE data. Surface modification of POSS-based thin films will be accomplished via a combination of plasma oxidation and chemical techniques. The surface chemistry of POSS-based thin films will be further studied to better understand the role of POSS in the enhanced adhesion of gold films to POSS-surfaces. Surfaces that have been exposed to a plasma environment will be further modified using silane self-assembled monolayer techniques. This project will involve the training of up to twelve undergraduate researchers and one high school chemistry, physics or biology teacher over the three year duration of the program. Both students and teachers will learn and use sophisticated surface analytical techniques, vacuum science, polymer materials characterization and processing, and microfluidic technology and science. Participants in this program will participate in activities related to the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) sites in chemistry and materials science at JMU to become part of a ?community of scholars? with over sixty other summer undergraduate researchers in chemistry and materials science at JMU. The students will also have further opportunities to interact with graduate students and post-doctoral researchers in the Lander?s lab in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Virginia through our ongoing collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research at Undergraduate Institutions project is focused on developing a deeper understanding of the surface properties of organic-inorganic hybrid polymers as they can be applied to microfabrication technologies. Advanced polymer materials are crucial technologies in a wide-range of industries. Developing an understanding of the surface properties of thin films of these materials is critical if they are to be integrated into many different technologies such a microelectronics and biomedical microfluidic devices. In this program, up to twelve undergraduate research students and one high school science teacher will use sophisticated surface science microscopy and chemical analysis tools to better understand hybrid polymer surfaces that have been chemically modified. In addition, outreach activities to local and regional high schools involving demonstration and teaching about nanoscience will be conducted. In summary, this program will help to impact the pipeline of future scientists from the high school through the graduate level with students trained in cutting-edge polymer materials science topics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
