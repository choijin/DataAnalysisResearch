<AbstractNarration>Fundamental research is proposed on a novel concept for combined neutron detection and retrieval of information about the level and timing of thermal neutron exposure that may have occurred prior to recovery of the data stored by a miniature, nanocrystal-based sensor. The concept is based on the unique properties of a dominant naturally occurring isotope of dysprosium,Dy, which upon exposure to thermal neutrons converts into a metastable state 165m, and then subsequently decays into a stable isotope of holmium, or, upon capturing a second neutron, into a stable erbium isotope. Combination of the high thermal neutron capture cross section of ~2,650 barns and transmutation into two other lanthanides makes dysporium a good candiate. Dy-containing nanocrystals of various chemical compositions will be synthesized, doped with Ho and Er, and optically characterized for maximum spectral differentiation between the three lanthanides. Reconstruction of data about neutron exposure will then be demonstrated by optical spectral analysis of the nanocrystalline samples.

The concept is based on the unique properties of a dominant naturally occurring isotope of dysprosium, 164Dy, which upon exposure to thermal neutrons converts into a metastable state 165mDy, and then subsequently decays into a stable isotope of holmium 165Ho, or, upon capturing a second neutron, into a stable erbium isotope 166Er.

Reconstruction of data about neutron exposure will then be demonstrated by optical spectral analysis of the nanocrystalline samples.  The educational component will emphasize collaboration and interactions across traditional academic disciplines, with the proposed project spanning the fields of chemistry, physics, electrical engineering, and nuclear engineering.</AbstractNarration>

A small size of the nanocrystalline sensor will make it possible to keep the cost of the sensor low, and, if desired, to easily conceal it as a piece of transparent plastic.        Other possible applications of the proposed concept include:  Neutron radiation monitoring devices in the vicinity of reactors Miniaturized neutron detectors mounted on mobile robotic or other remotely controlled platforms (such as radio-controlled insects) Inexpensive portable neutron dosimeters, with an easy, fast visual readout in case of very high exposure Neutron radiography, with Dy films replaced by sheets of plastic embedded with NCs Clandestine monitoring of suspected nuclear proliferation facilities        Last Modified: 04/17/2012       Submitted by: Marek Osinski]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
