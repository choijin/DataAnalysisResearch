<AbstractNarration>Criticism of the human research environment and recorded abuses of human research subjects served as the impetus for the establishment of the Nuremberg Code, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research and resulting Belmont Report. While human research deserves continued attention, current guidelines are fairly standardized and aim to protect the individual interests of human participants in research. In contrast, no similar, comprehensive and principled effort has addressed the use of animals in research. Although published policies regarding animal research provide relevant regulatory guidance, the lack of a fundamental effort to explore the ethical issues and principles regarding the use of animals in research has led to unclear and disparate policies. Furthermore, recent studies of animal cognition and emotion suggest that animals' capacities for experiencing a wide range of harms, such as pain and fear, are greater than previously appreciated. In light of this information, current research protections for animals deserve attention and reconsideration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes an investigative series allowing for open, methodical, ethical evaluation of questions concerning the use of animals in research, including a systematic review and critical evaluation of existing regulations. The project includes a progressive series of focused meetings, publications, and corresponding study of the scientific, ethical, legal and historical issues governing the use of animals in research. Investigators will work with other scholars to identify knowledge gaps and map out future avenues for research to refine existing guidelines. The project involves interdisciplinary and multi-institutional academic collaboration. Results will be reported in relevant ethical, scientific, legal, and medical publications, and details about the process and deliberation will be disseminated among the scientific community and general public. Broader impact could include more refined and appropriate protections for animals.</AbstractNarration>
