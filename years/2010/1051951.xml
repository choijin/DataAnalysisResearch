<AbstractNarration>The female gametophyte is central to plant reproduction and to seed production.  Located inside the pistil of the flower, the female gametophyte (also known as the embryo sac) contains two female gametes, the egg cell and central cell.  After fertilization by the sperm cells of the male gametophyte (pollen), the two female gametes give rise to the embryo and starch-rich endosperm that constitute the seed.   The project aims to understand the molecular mechanisms that control how the female gametophyte is patterned, i.e. how it develops from a single haploid cell to form a functional seven cell reproductive unit containing the two female gametes.  Previous work from this laboratory showed that this mechanism involves an unusual gradient of a plant hormone, auxin, which is produced by the gametophyte.  This project will investigate how the gradient of auxin is generated and maintained, and how it leads to the correct cells being specified within the gametophyte, and how the levels of auxin can be manipulated to make additional egg cells.  The approaches used will involve genetics, molecular and cell biology.  The research will be carried out in the model plant Arabidopsis, but the same mechanisms are expected to be found in all flowering plants.  The knowledge gained from this research can be applied to crop plants and will be important for the control of reproduction and seed production in agriculture.  The project will also provide training for participants at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels.</AbstractNarration>

Seed production requires the fertilization of these two gametes by the two sperm cells of the pollen, resulting in an embryo and nutritive endosperm.

Modifying hormonal signaling within the embryo sac resulted in the production of additional or fewer gametic cells, and switched the fates of the gametic cells, e.g. from central cell to egg cell, or from egg cell to central cell.   A specific gene called CKI1 was found to be both necessary and sufficient for formation of the central cell, and subsequently the endosperm.

The subcellular localization of this gene to the nuclear endoplasmic reticulum, and subsequent re-distribution in the embryo sac, appears to be responsible for the formation of one egg cell and one central cell in each ovule of the flower.  Manipulation of this gene in transgenic plants was used to produce seeds containing only nutritive endosperm without embryos, and thus incapable of propagation.  The CKI1 gene was shown to have originated in the gymnosperms, which are seed plants that have no endosperm, and are the ancestors of flowering plants.  Evolutionary changes in the expression of the CKI1 gene likely led to formation of endosperm in flowering plants, providing a critical link in a long standing mystery of the origin of endosperm.  Thus, the project has resulted in significant new insights into basic processes of plant reproduction, and identification of key genes and regulatory mechanisms.
