<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this symposium is to bring together the researchers from around the world working on fundamental issues and applications that are critical to furthering the understanding of bulk metallic glasses. Experimental as well as theoretical and computational efforts have been made that promise to uncover new details of glass formation, deformation mechanisms, and basic phenomena in transport, phase transitions, magnetic properties, corrosion, dynamic response, and fracture mechanics. Topics of interest include: 1. Applications and prototyping of BMGs including customer requirements, systems issues in incorporating metallic glasses, alloy design issues and process design; 2. New alloys and the principles needed for the physical and mechanical design of alloys; 3. Structure-property relations for BMGs including mechanical characterization and mechanisms of mechanical behavior and flow; 4. Glass forming ability and relations to properties including diffusion and devitrification kinetics; 5. Processing methods and opportunities; 6. Theories and modeling of glass forming liquids and BMGs including ab initio methods for property prediction, MD simulations, the physics of collective interatomic behavior and continuum techniques and constitutive property design.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recent advance has made it possible to produce bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) with extremely slow cooling rates. Because they behave as viscous fluids at high(er) temperatures, one can produce these materials using metallurgical methods and mould them like plastics into high-precision shapes, giving these materials the potential to either enable or revolutionize many applications.  The area of bulk metallic glasses has witnessed a fast growth in basic research and developments in the last ten years.  Materials have been developed for civil, military, biomedicine, mining, sports, and structure applications.   The purpose of this symposium U on Bulk Metallic Glasses and Their Applications was to bring together the researchers from around the world working on fundamental issues and applications that are critical to the further scientific and technological advancement of this field.  Invited peakers presented current understanding of mechanical response to applied stress on the nanoscale. New understanding of mechanical deformation and origin of ultrahigh strengths in monolithic as well as composite materials through experiment and computation was presented. The materials systems discussed were metals including nanoporous metals, nanocomposites, metal-polymer hybrids, and ceramics.   Although there is no apparent major breakthrough, the overall impression is that there have been steady advances in the processing of bulk metallic glasses through thermal plastic forming, design of high damage tolerance composites, and understanding of plasticity on the atomistic scale through computation and microstructural study.
