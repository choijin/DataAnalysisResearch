<AbstractNarration>The Arctic Ocean ecosystem may respond dramatically to climate change through already observed modification of the physical environment (e.g., hydrography and ice cover). A better understanding of the coupled biological-physical ocean ecosystem, and its interannual variability, is necessary to predict and understand these potential impacts of climate change on the Arctic ecosystem. The Chukchi-Beaufort Sea region near Barrow, AK, including coastal waters, has been identified as key because it lies at the junction of several ocean regions and downstream of the Pacific Arctic gateway and hence is influenced physically and ecologically by input from Bering Strait. Researchers have conducted oceanographic sampling of the coupled physical and biological marine environment in the Chukchi and near-shore Beaufort Seas for five years (2005 ? 2009), including coastal waters, using boat-based surveys during late summer and short-term (month) and year-long bottom-mounted moorings, and have observed significant interannual variability. They will now establish annual surveys of the pelagic marine environment and deploy a year-round mooring in Barrow Canyon as components of the Arctic Observing Network (AON). The surveys will measure a range of biological and physical parameters including hydrography, currents, plankton standing stocks, nutrients, and plankton genetics. The mooring will measure ocean currents, near bottom temperature and salinity, and acoustic backscatter (zooplankton proxy) in Barrow Canyon at a location typically within or beneath the Alaska Coastal Current.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this AON component will provide a 10-year record and enable a better understanding of inter-annual variability in the physical and biological characteristics of the Barrow area ocean confluence. Based on these data, changes in biological characteristics that respond to larger climate change can be detected. This proposed AON component includes measurements of key oceanic biological and chemical parameters, and their coupling to physical parameters from a region sensitive to climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will actively communicate plans and results with the community of Barrow through formal and informal discussions and presentations. They will also support the participation of a teacher in fieldwork for two of the years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The oceanic waters near Barrow, AK are highly productive.  Barrow or the official I&ntilde;upiat name of the city Utqiagvik, has been home to indigenous Inuit people for more than 1500 years.  It is believed that indigenous native Alaskans of the North Slope region settled in areas that provided access to abundant, rich food resources.  It is no surprise then that because of its proximity to highly productive and dependable food resources that Barrow is home to the largest settlement of I&ntilde;upiat people along the North Slope of Alaska.  The Oceanic region near Barrow, AK, at the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas confluence, is a highly productive marine environment that supports a rich feeding ground for higher trophic levels, including fishes, birds and marine mammals.  Additionally, this region is important to the traditional native communities who obtain a large portion of their food from subsistence activities. The reason this region is so productive is that it integrates both far-field productivity from as far south as the Bering Sea through advection of nutrients and plankton, and local production likely fueled by both the advected nutrients from the south and upwelled nutrients from the adjacent deep Arctic waters.  Our findings have shed light on the importance of the geological morphology, physical drivers, and ecological mechanisms that result in this area being a biological hotspot.   This project was a component of the Arctic Observing Network (AON) and continued work begun in 2005. The major goals of the program were: 1) To extend an existing time series (5 years) of coupled biological, physical, and nutrient data collected annually across sentinel transect lines at a critical confluence of seas, water types, and ecosystems for an additional six years; 2) To observe ocean currents, bottom temperatures, and acoustic backscatter (proxy for zooplankton) year-round at a location that will permit scientists to link processes and fluxes at the Pacific Arctic Gateway with those at the edge of the Arctic Ocean and further downstream in the Western Arctic Boundary Current; and 3) To collect data that will permit scientists to better understand and predict inter-annual variability in the physical, biological, and chemical marine environment at that critical ocean juncture and potentially detect ecosystem response to climate change. Vessel-based surveys during August and September 2010-2016 and year-long bottom-mounted moorings documented the variability and changes in the coupled biological and physical ocean environment in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, including coastal waters. We found that mean temperature and salinity sections showed that over the course of the study, on average, the Alaskan Coastal Current (ACC) on the eastern side of the Canyon contains warmer, northward flowing water, slightly fresher water (ice melt) is present on the western end near the surface, and that cold, salty water (Winter Water) is seen at depth across most of the Canyon but particularly on the western side. Additionally, mean temperature anomalies for the ACC showed substantial inter-annual differences (almost 8 degrees between 2006 and 2007). Moreover, the interannual variability in water temperature and salinity in Barrow Canyon was highly correlated with Chukchi winds. During the early phase of the study we described a mechanism by which the availability of euphausiid (krill) prey to bowhead whales on the shelf NE of Point Barrow was driven by local winds. Krill are transported in northward flowing currents to the region each fall from populations originating in the Bering Sea.  During easterly winds krill in deeper slope waters flowing past Barrow are upwelled onto the shallow shelf and trapped there when the winds relax or change direction.  These trapped krill form dense aggregations and attract higher trophic level predators including bowhead whales on their fall migration from their summer feeding grounds in the Canadian Arctic to the Bering Sea where they overwinter.  This mechanism was further documented during the latter portion of the study as well.  Outreach to the local community was a significant part of the project.  Results were presented to the Barrow Whaling Captains near-annually, at the Barrow Schoolyard Saturday Lecture Series (2013), at the Barrow I&ntilde;upiat Heritage Center (2016), in KBRW radio interviews (2012, 2015), at the Cohasset, MA Center for Student Coastal Research (2014), Barrow (2012, 2016) and Point Hope, AK (2012) school science classes, and to a Barrow science teacher workshop (2016). An 8-page color brochure describing the findings and a holographic card illustrating the mechanism producing krill patches were produced in 2016 for the general public. All data are archived at the NSF Arctic Data Center.  The results from this long term study provide information on the natural variability and influence of climate change on the physical drivers and the biological responses to those drivers. Information from this study can provide a basis for policy decisions from local to national levels that may have an impact on the productivity of this region.
