<AbstractNarration>How can scientists create and share scientific knowledge in a way that simultaneously takes advantage of new technologies and information systems and recognizes the increasingly diverse, global nature of knowledge production? The problem of how to work with differing ways of knowing, with differing ontologies, is a central question to business, the natural and social sciences, and designers and users of information technology. This issue is particularly relevant for any institution that holds the task of assembling, collecting, representing, and displaying information and objects that may have different meanings for communities and professions. For these "information institutions" maintaining the coherence of a data set while still being ontologically diverse has become a key tension. Rather than trying to mitigate this tension, this project explores how digital media systems can put this tension to productive and creative use. The principle investigators evaluate the hypothesis that information systems can be created to support distributed knowledges and multiple ontologies, and that these systems can serve the multiple communities as well as contribute to the creation and sharing of emergent scientific knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves the design, creation, and evaluation of a set of networked sites that share digital objects among three expert communities: a group of archaeologists, the Zuni indigenous community of New Mexico, and a set of curators from the five partner organizations. Through the research team's analyses of the objects, how they are described in different ways, and interviews/focus groups with each of the three communities, they will uncover means by which systems can work with multiple knowledge-based traditions rather than sweep away these differences by classifying them into singular standards. This research will have broad impact by creating and evaluating new models for broadening participation in science. The project focuses on how to produce and share knowledge in behavioral sciences such as anthropology and archaeology, but it provides a model of stakeholder participation for other disciplines as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Our research has been focused on the hypothesis that information systems can be created to support distributed knowledge and multiple ontologies, or multiple ways in which people of diverse cultures or communities speak about and understand the world. Our other major hypothesis has articulated that designing a technology according to the community-based classifications and ways of knowing, or ontologies, can comparatively shape technology use to the extent where it can be appropriated within community life and positively shape various developmental outcomes. This theme is particularly relevant for any institution or technology that holds the task of assembling, collecting, representing, and displaying a set of objects that derive from differing times, places and traditions. It is recognized therefore that these objects speak to traditions, communities, and social groups that are ontologically diverse, differing in ways that they identify and practice knowledge. Objects and their meaning and interpretations are not independent from their contexts of understanding, but are rather intricately linked with local ways of knowing and understanding. Our project has aimed to explore ways by which digital media system can put this tension to productive and creative use, creating a contact zone to facilitate greater communication between communities, institutions and individuals. This problem is a grand challenge more generally in research in design, ethnography and digital cultures in how to support the ontologies of diverse cultures and communities in an increasingly digital world. Designed with and for the Zuni tribal community and a set of archaeologist and museum partners, the project enables a bottom up approach toward thinking about system design, digital archives, and more. Reflecting the projectÆs institutional partnerships with numerous museums, the project has been of key interest within the discipline of museology, knowledge sharing and design. Many of these organizations and researchers have been looking for alternative models for managing and engaging with the ontological tensions between indigenous knowledge practices and views, and western professional practices. Our system has shown success at generating this type of rich dialogue around digital objects of Zuni patrimony and evidence of emergent knowledge sharing that is done in terms that respect the different partners and the sovereignty of how they æknowÆ. This is contingent on:   The importance of supporting continuous Zuni input into the networked system. With Zuni insights to provoke the practices and classifications used by curators and archaeologists insights are provided to open up the possibility of being informed by these ontologies. The power of context.    Our interviews reveal that often ontologies inform one another when they have a connection around a æboundary objectÆ that semantically connects the different forms of knowledge the stakeholders wish to share. One key element within this is æcontextÆ. Context here refers to the underlying information associated with objects in collections according to curator and archaeologist partners. Yet within context Zuni knowledge may interrupt and shape larger classificatory and ontological understandings, perhaps around the intended persistence of the object, its circulation, whose property it should be, and certain cosmologies on who the object impacts and in what ways. Context is also critical since it allows Zuni voices to trump what are commonly forms of misinformation that are applied to collections, even within museums.   Who rather than which: It was important to know specific roles and backgrounds of participants across the different stakeholders rather than simply assuming all indigenous input as simply Zuni, all curatorial inputs as simply museum curators, and more. A deeper level of awareness of æwhoÆ allows ontologies to be seen past simple binaries to see roles, backgrounds, and the agency of differ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
