<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award will provide a new generation of scientists with the tools to address effects of climate change on water resources. Monitoring data in the Western U.S. show alarming trends in temperature, river flows and snowpack. General circulation models (GCMs) indicate these and other climate-driven trends will continue and accelerate. Currently, major scientific gaps and socioeconomic factors preclude reliable predictions of climate change impacts on water resources, agriculture, and natural ecosystems on a sub-continental scale (e.g., California, Chile). Climate change requires attention from an unprecedented range of scientific disciplines, including atmospheric science, computational science, ecology, economics, engineering, hydrology, political science, and soil science, among others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The Climate Change, Water and Society (CCWAS) project will develop needed synergies through 1) a framework for cutting-edge research that focuses on key interfaces of climate/water/social sciences, and 2) an unprecedented, integrative, flexible education and training program. CCWAS fellows will pursue a special degree designation in "Climate Change, Water and Society," core and interface courses in hydroclimatology and decision making under uncertainty, cyber-enabled audio and video instruction for joint course offerings and sharing among campuses, and an innovative "world caf√©" style capstone course that annually defines state of the art and research needs in climate change, future water availability, and water resources management. Broader Impacts: Transformative qualities of the research will be broadened through collaboration and comparative studies with colleagues in Chile, which faces similar climate change and water challenges as California. An internship program will engage students with the government agencies responsible for mitigating and adapting to climate change effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

These conferences were aimed at providing policymakers with up-to-date scientific information and identifying the outstanding scientific and policy research questions that can be the topics of dissertation research by IGERT students.    Over the funding period, we held four workshops.  2013. The Future of Water in California: Integrating Climate, Water, and Policy  Water resources in California are essential for meeting human needs for drinking water, agriculture, ecosystems, and recreation. Climate change increases the difficulty of meeting these multiple and often conflicting needs. CCWAS IGERT students organized a two-day workshop that included physical and social scientists, water managers, and policymakers, with the goal of improving connections between scientific disciplines and the exchange between science, management, and policy.  The workshop included top academic scientists who summarized the state of climate science, hydrology, and human reactions to policymaking; and decision makers who identified key research questions to inform scientists what managers and policy-makers need.  2014. Climate Change and the Future of Groundwater in California   As climate changes, California will face decreased snowpack, earlier peaks in runoff, unknown changes in groundwater recharge, and more extreme events, such as drought. Many uncertainties exist, however, about how these changes will influence groundwater resources and management.  First-year CCWAS trainees organized and hosted a workshop, "Climate Change and the Future of Groundwater in California," that brought together diverse stakeholders for a day of discussion and brainstorming. Participants included academics, water managers, staff from environmental organizations, policymakers, and representatives from the agricultural sector.   2015. Water Scarcity in the West: Past, Present, Future   Trainees in the CCWAS IGERT admitted in Fall 2014 planned and organized a conference, "Water Scarcity in the West: Past, Present, and Future." Human existence in the American West has always been challenged by water scarcity, with drought, climate change, inefficiencies in use, and increasing demand exacerbating the issues facing water users today. In the workshop, trainees sought to examine how scientific, political, and historical perspectives inform our understanding of water scarcity in the West. In addition, they examined the role of scientists, policymakers, and the public in adapting to water scarcity in a changing climate.  Speakers at the day-and-a-half long conference included California Secretary for Natural Resources John Laird and Patricia Mulroy, former general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority.   2016. Weathering Change: The Impact of Climate and the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act on California?s Water   The trainees in the final CCWAS cohort worked together to convene a conference on California's groundbreaking legislation that implement regulation of California groundwater. TheSustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) will strongly influence water availability and allocation in California. At the time of the workshop, their joint consequences had received little attention. Successful adaptation to hydroclimate change will hinge on new approaches to integrated water resources management in concert with SGMA. The workshop sought to highlight some of these challenges, and to outline potential fruitful paths forward.  The event was kicked off with a keynote address by Kevin de Leon, the Speaker Pro Tempore of the California State Senate, and included presentations and panel discussions from academic and agency researchers, water managers, staff from non-governmental organizations, and farmers.
