<AbstractNarration>This program will explore the very inner structure of active galactic nuclei with the goals of (a) measuring the masses of the central black holes and (b) determining the structure and kinematics of the broad emission-line region. The main activities proposed are (1) reverberation-mapping studies that are designed to recover high fidelity velocity-delay maps of the broad-line region in several bright Seyfert 1 galaxies, and (2) continuing spectroscopic and imaging observations to calibrate the reverberation-based black hole mass scale.   This will lead to a better determination of black hole masses in active galactic nuclei and will aid in understanding the relation between black hole masses and stellar velocity dispersions in galaxy bulges.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and a postdoc, work with a local science museum, teacher training, and public talks.</AbstractNarration>
