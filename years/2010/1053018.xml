<AbstractNarration>COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH:  Records of Permian environments and climate from mid-continent redbeds and evaporites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael Soreghan and Gerilyn Soreghan, University of Oklahoma, EAR-1053018&lt;br/&gt;Kathy Benison, Central Michigan University, EAR-1053025&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The Permian Period (~300-250 million years ago) is a time of great change, including an end to the long-term mountain building that formed the supercontinent Pangaea, the end of a major continental glaciation, and the prelude to the largest mass extinction in Earth history.  Continental sedimentary rocks, including red-bed siliciclastics  and evaporites, were deposited during the Permian throughout the midcontinental United States and record major climate change. This research will integrate sedimentologic and geochemical data from outcrops and cores to interpret depositional environments and paleoclimate from these mid-upper Permian redbeds and evaporites.  The goal of this research is to determine whether: 1) the mid-continent was dominated by extensive lakes, including freshwater and saline perennial as well as saline and acid-saline ephemeral types; (2) regional climatic changes are faithfully recorded in these strata; and (3) ?redbeds? record a causative link between iron-rich eolian dust and extremely acid saline lakes. Understanding these abrupt climatic and environmental changes in the past improves our ability to test and refine climate models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF grant "Collaborative Research: Records of Permian environments and climate from mid-continent redbeds and evaporite" has led to a better understanding of old landscapes within the central United States from 300 to 270 million years ago. This mid-continent region contains a thick (&gt;1 km) layer of red muddy sediment that accumulated during a time when the supercontinent Pangaea existed. Prior pictures of this landscape painted by geologists included shallow seas and muddy shorelines.  Our analysis, however, of outcrops from Wyoming, Oklahoma, and north Texas, coupled with analysis of cores from Oklahoma and Kansas suggest that this ancient landscape, or paleogeography, consisted of windblown dust trapped by shallow saline lakes and sparse vegetation. Thus, although the mid-continent was near the equator at that time, the region was extremely arid, but experienced short-term and seasonal wet periods.  The data can now be fed to computer models to develop possible explanations for this equatorial aridity, and thus help us to better understand behavior of Earth?s climate system.   Also, by analyzing key minerals in these rocks (zircons) we can determine the source of the highlands that were being eroded to produce the sediment carried to the mid-continent.  The age groupings of the zircons, and their relative abundances, indicate that the Appalachian Mountains were producing huge volumes of muddy sediment that reached the mid-continent, mostly blown by winds.  However, during a period of this time (early Permian) a large upland formed in the region of the present-day Gulf of Mexico and south Texas.  The rocks exposed during this time are now mostly located in Mexico.  This likely signals a change in mountain-building processes that marked the end of the assembly of the supercontinent Pangaea.   This work was conducted by a team of researchers from OU and other universities, together with six graduate students and two undergraduate students from OU who conducted research and/or completed theses over the course of the project.  All of the graduate students are now employed in STEM-related fields (in industry and education) and both undergraduates are now pursuing graduate degrees in Geology. Four book chapters, eight published papers in the scientific literature, and 15 conference abstracts were produced during the project.  Results of this research were also highlighted in public talks at the University of Oklahoma, and several other universities, in high-school science classes, on a podcast, and featured in the OU alumni magazine.  For the life of the project, underserved middle-school students were taken on a field trip to see redbed outcrops in Oklahoma as part of a summer science camp.     Results form this work also provide constraints and data for other allied sciences and fields.  For example, introduction of wind-blown dust into marine systems can increase primary productivity &mdash; impacting the carbon cycle, and airborne dust can impact climate through its direct influence on solar radiation.  Both of these topics are relevant to research and discussions on geoengineering, and both are the topic of spin-off research that was initiated through work on this project.
