<AbstractNarration>This project is establishing a contemporary teaching method and interactive learning environment for use in medical image education. The project is developing medical imaging teaching software (MITS) and an interactive, internet-based, dynamic assessment tracking system (DATS); producing an innovative assessment model that is iterative and aids in student learning of design concepts. The project is a joint effort by University of Miami (lead), Florida Atlantic University, Florida International University, and Miami Dade College. The effort includes four specific tasks: 1) complete development of MITS utilizing efforts from participating institutions; 2) implementation of DATS as an online evaluation database; 3) comprehensive multi-level evaluations using the embedded iterative evaluation design framework, through reflective synthesis feedback loops (to monitor, direct and correct the development and application); and 4) multi-level dissemination in local, regional, state-wide, and national ranges. The products (MITS/DATS) are directly affecting the delivery of medical imaging education, particularly for those beginning to create medical imaging curricula. The four school collaboration is ensuring that the research is addressing diverse student populations, diverse class sizes and teaching environments, differing course settings involving more than 80 related courses, and a broad community engaged in student training and faculty development activities.</AbstractNarration>
