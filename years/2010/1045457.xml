<AbstractNarration>Review Analysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Thanh Nguyen&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1045457&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Symposium titled: Interfacial Chemistry: Fate, Transport, and Adsorption of Nanoparticles, Biocolloids, and Trace Organics in Aquatic Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium on interfacial chemistry will focus on issues related to interfacial phenomena at solid-liquid surface, where most of the important environmental processes in water, wastewater treatment, and sourcewater protection occur.  This symposium will bring researchers from basic to applied science and engineering who are advancing the state of knowledge on the following topics of interests: 1) transport and fate of microorganisms, natural and engineered nanoparticles; 2) role of surface interactions in pathogen inactivation; 3) chemical reactions at solid-liquid interface; 4) mechanisms of membrane fouling and cleaning; and 5) biofilm in natural and engineered systems.  Effective dissemination of state of the art knowledge on environmental interface allows the development of sustainable technologies for pollutant treatment and of science-based policies for environmental protection.  Interdisciplinary and international efforts are required for such an exchange of knowledge among scientists and engineers. This proposal seeks funding to allow a delegation of invited presenters and contributed student presenters from the United States of America to attend the symposium on ?Interfacial Chemistry: Fate, Transport, and Adsorption of Nanoparticles, Biocolloids, and Trace Organics in Aquatic Systems? to be held December 15-20 with the 2010 International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies (Pacifichem) in Honolulu, Hawaii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of the symposium is to foster discussion for generating research ideas and to promote scientific interactions among scientists and engineers across disciplines, generations, and from different countries. The U.S. delegates will have opportunities to discuss advances in understanding environmental processes that occur at the solid-liquid interface at scales ranging from molecular to macroscopic to field and pilot.  Attendance and participation of students from U.S. universities will provide a unique professional and educational experience that is necessary for future generations of leaders of environmental engineers and scientists. The entire experience will allow the students to supplement a solid background of knowledge in fundamental engineering and sciences with cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural experiences, and to make them capable of addressing traditional and emerging local and global environmental issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The widest possible participation and greatest influence of the symposium will be ensured by providing financial support for: 1) invited speakers from different disciplines and 2) contributed student authors from underrepresented minority and/or non-PhD granting institutions.  Announcement for the symposium will be circulated through the AEESP emailing list. Abstract review will be conducted by the symposium organizing committee. A call for student travel support applications will also be circulated through the AEESP emailing list, when funding is received. Student grantees will be selected for their scientific accomplishments and their contributions to the success of the symposium. In addition, Pacifichem congress has funding for international attendees.</AbstractNarration>
