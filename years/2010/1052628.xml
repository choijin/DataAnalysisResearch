<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to demonstrate proof-of-concept of a new multi-antenna wireless transceiver design that promises dramatic improvements in capacity and power/bandwidth efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art systems. The approach is based on a new hybrid analog-digital multiple-input-multiple-output architecture that enables a continuous-aperture phased-array operation and optimum beam agility. The new analog-digital interface is realized via a novel phased-array architecture - a high-resolution discrete lens array - that computes an analog spatial Fourier transform and enables optimum link adaptation through beam agility. The integrated theoretical-experimental research plan includes development of basic theory and prototype development to demonstrate the potential of the new transceiver design.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The compelling performance gains promised by the proposed agile transceiver rely on several innovations relative to the state-of-the-art, including: i) Integration of analog and digital processing for optimum  adaptation; ii) Integration of coherent beam-forming and spatial multiplexing; iii) Source-channel matching for capacity maximization; and iv) High-resolution discrete-lens-array-based operation for dynamic beam control. The project is expected to advance the state-of-the-art of wireless communications on both theoretical and practical fronts, including spurring interdisciplinary research into new transceiver architectures and new conceptual paradigms for antenna array design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this interdisciplinary project include multi-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students, involvement of underrepresented students in research, student participation in research meetings, research dissemination via presentations, publications and the web, incorporation of research results into graduate and undergraduate courses, and collaboration with other research groups and industry for cross-fertilization of ideas and technology transfer.</AbstractNarration>
