The broader impacts of this study were mainly cultural in nature. Since the methods in collecting data were similar in both places, there was not a lot to learn in that regard, but working across a language barrier and in a different culture made it a learning experience. I worked on my Japanese as we gathered samples and cooked, while my fellow students from Japan were able to practice their English. I now have contacts at Hokkaido University in Japan in the molecular department as well as the marine ecology one, and t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
