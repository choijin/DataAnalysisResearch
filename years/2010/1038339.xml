<AbstractNarration>This EAGER project will use the non-destructive techniques of electromagnetics, magnetometry, resistivity, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to assess the nature, extent, and preservation of previously unidentified Norse occupation sites in Greenland.  The PI argues that the current understanding of the Norse occupation of Greenland is biased toward large preserved ruins that are easily identified and surveyed because they are readily seen in the landscape. This project will assess the potentially numerous sites that are not so easily seen, perhaps buried under the deep aeolian sands that exist, or even those buried by later human occupation layers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is well proposed as an EAGER, it will "support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches."  Because of the unknown quality of the "hidden" Norse record this project is High Risk but with the definite potential for High Return. If the PI is successful in identifying these sites with these techniques, then the project has the potential of creating a deeper history of the Norse in Greenland. This is High Risk but not completely un-proven, the PI and CoPI have been using these techniques to locate sites in Iceland. And although the geology and geography of Greenland is different and thus the need to test this technique, based on the PI and CoPI's record in Iceland, there is a high probability that they will succeed in Greenland.</AbstractNarration>

Additionally, our findings can help eliminate the bias against earlier and buried elements of the Norse archaeological record in Greenland by opening up hard-to-detect features to archaeological investigation.  Our NSF funded project employed a suite of archaeogeophysical methods&mdash;EM (apparent ground conductivity and in-phase component), electrical resistivity, magnetometry, and GPR&mdash;on three Norse sites in the Igaliku fjord region. Three sites (&Oslash;64 in Innoqquassaq, &Oslash;66 in Igaliku Kujalleq, and &Oslash;172 in Tatsipataakilleq) were examined at varying intensities.  A range of archaeological contexts were tested, including Medieval farm mounds, a churchyard, a heavily eroded ruin, and sand covered homefield areas with no visible architecture.  Magnetometry and the in-phase component of EM can be used for site prospection, for the delineation of visible ruins, and to help identify areas of well-preserved buried architecture with stone foundations. For site and feature prospection, magnetometry provided the sharpest images but was not able to identify graves.  While GPR is difficult to use in areas with bumpy topography and scattered stones, it shows great promise in identifying a range of buried cultural features, most importantly Viking Age graves.  Archaeogeophysical surveying also proved an effective tool for investigating site geology and, in some cases, anthropogenic changes to site geology.  EM surveying was able to identify a buried irrigation canal at &Oslash;66 and both electrical resistivity and GPR successfully mapped buried surfaces associated with glacial till deposits, moraines, and bedrock. Unfortunalty, results of the study indicates that buried Viking Age turf walls that do not have stone foundations will be difficult to detect.  The least effective method employed was EM (apparent ground conductivity) and is attributed to the very resistive soils and sediments of Greenland combined with the relatively resistive nature of the archaeological targets of interest.  Ideally, this method works best in detecting conductive targets in a resistive environment.  In general, we recommend that reconnaissance surveying of sites should first be conducted using either the in-phase of an EM-38 instrument or a magnetic gradiometer.  This will produce the best pseudo 2-dimensional images of a site.  Follow-up work to obtain pseudo 3-dimensional images should be done with GPR equipped with a 500 MHz antenna if conditions permit.  If the surface is too uneven, then we recommend using electrical resistivity.       Last Modified: 10/17/2011       Submitted by: John M Steinberg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
