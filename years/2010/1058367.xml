<AbstractNarration>This is a Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction project for the construction of a 254-foot research vessel to work in the waters off the coast of Alaska including the Chukchi, Beaufort and Bering Seas. The University of Alaska, Fairbanks? (UAF) original proposal was in response to the National Science Foundation Program Solicitation NSF 07-515 for the management, acquisition and operation of an Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV), now known as the R/V SIKULIAQ. The construction of an ARRV was given the highest priority in the report National Academic Research Fleet, A Long Range Plan for Renewal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original proposal was reviewed by ten mail reviewers and ten panelists. A major recommendation from the panel was a phased acquisition strategy to mitigate risk.  A four phase approach has been implemented that requires certain milestones to be completed prior to funding the next phase.  UAF is using Earned Value Management (EVM) and a Project Execution Plan (PEP) as approved and monitored by NSF. NSF conducts annual panel reviews to evaluate project implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides the funds for Phase IV, Transition to Operations which includes a period of final outfitting, science and ice trials, and delivery to the vessel?s home port in Seward, Alaska.  The final construction design is currently being developed with the selected shipyard.  Fabrication will begin in October 2010, with delivery to UAF currently scheduled for January 2013.  The SIKULIAQ is expected to begin science operations in early 2014 as a member of the US academic research vessel fleet (www.unols.org) once Phase IV is completed.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The trials and testing of the scientific equipment aboard the R/V Sikuliaq was accomplished using funds from this grant.  Upon completion of construction at the shipyard in the great Lakes this phase of testing and maiden voyage to the home port in Seward, Alaska was started.  Several legs of the transit voyage were used to test the various scientific instrumentation including the scientific information system used to gather and transmit data to shoreside facilities.  The bottom mapping systems were tested off the East Coast with support from personnel of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  Deep water winch tests were conducted off Puerto Rico before transiting the Panama Canal.  Testing of the science systems in ice was also accomplished in the Bering Sea during early spring.   Subsequently, bottom sampling instrumentation was tested with gravity cores, multiple corer and the long coring sampling system.  Several new innovative scientific systems were tested under a wide range of operating conditions to assure their functionality.  A "no hands" system to deploy instrumentation over the side of the vessel was found to operate very well and safely in large seas.  A new large A-frame on the stern was also found to be fully operational and will support the deployment of large heavy equipment safely.  An assessment of ADA accommodations for hearing, sight and mobility disabled were also found to be a large improvement over other vessels in the UNOLS research fleet.   The extended period of testing resulted in a fully operational research vessel capable of supporting global scientific research especially in ice-covered seas.
