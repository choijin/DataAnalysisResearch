<AbstractNarration>While it has been shown theoretically that stochastic network&lt;br/&gt;optimization techniques utilizing queue backpressure can result in&lt;br/&gt;high performance cross-layer protocols, there has been limited prior&lt;br/&gt;work on translating them into practice. In this exploratory research&lt;br/&gt;project, we develop and demonstrate a novel cross-layer backpressure&lt;br/&gt;protocol stack for wireless sensor networks, building on our&lt;br/&gt;implementation of the backpressure collection protocol (BCP).  The&lt;br/&gt;possible gains of this highly agile approach to cross-layer wireless&lt;br/&gt;networking are substantial and include increased throughput even in&lt;br/&gt;the presence of mobility, handling of bursty external interference&lt;br/&gt;events with reduced losses, and reduced protocol implementation&lt;br/&gt;complexity. We incorporate techniques for MAC-layer backoff&lt;br/&gt;prioritization, transport layer utility optimization, mechanisms to&lt;br/&gt;handle various kinds of network dynamics, and interoperability with&lt;br/&gt;asynchronous low power sleep schedules. Protocol implementation code&lt;br/&gt;developed in the project will be released publicly as open-source. It&lt;br/&gt;is expected that the successful completion of this project will&lt;br/&gt;provide an important proof-of-concept that stochastic optimization&lt;br/&gt;theory-driven protocols can be successful in practice.</AbstractNarration>
