<AbstractNarration>Rose-Hulman's summer REU program in mathematics has served over 150 undergraduates in the past 21 years.  This REU has introduced students to problems in group theory, "cwatsets", hyperbolic geometry, number theory, inverse problems, and geometric analysis, and made contributions to each of  these areas.  The program has evolved from a single faculty member to one involving enthusiastic mentors who rotate in and out of the program year-to-year.  The result is a wider range of problems for undergraduates to investigate.  The REU has also gained strong support from the mathematics department as a whole and the Rose-Hulman community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the mathematical topics we investigate are diverse, we have developed a coherent approach to the research: we initially make use of computational tools to help students understand the problems at hand, by working out specific cases and examples. They can then begin making general conjectures, designing algorithms, and follow up with large scale computational and/or statistical investigations (as appropriate) and eventually rigorous analysis and proofs. The problems we pose can be attacked by students with a fairly modest mathematical background. However, the problems are drawn from active areas of mathematics, and can quickly lead to the frontiers of current research, depending on the student's abilities and drive. Our REU develops the students as "complete" mathematicians, capable of independent thinking, making and proving conjectures, and communicating their results. In the process, we hope to give them a basis for future career decisions. Thus, in the selection process we are especially interested in students who, beyond having adequate preparation, express interest in a career involving research, but who may not otherwise have a chance at an undergraduate research opportunity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of our Research Experiences for Undergraduates program is to give undergraduate students the chance to participate in the type of mathematical research that is often not experienced until graduate school.  We hope that the students will use this experience to make more informed judgments about their future career paths. Eleven students per year were introduced to mathematical research in the areas of computational number theory, systems biology, inverse problems, geometric analysis, and delay differential equations.  This includes training in literature search, reading advanced mathematics, experimental mathematics (conjecture and testing of conjecture through numerical experiments), development of mathematical models and algorithms to solve mathematical problems, and both written and oral mathematical exposition.  Students in most cases worked collaboratively to gain better understanding of their specific problems and to emphasize the modern form of mathematical research as a team effort with each individual contributing to the end result.  A brief synopsis of each group's area of research is described below.    The Computational Number Theory group studied mathematics related to certain types of "digital signatures" used on the Internet and in many other modern computer systems.  These signatures are designed so that each one is unique to a specific combination of signer and document, and cannot be forged by any other party.  Nevertheless, anyone can use public information to verify the authenticity of the signature without jeopardizing its security.  This process relies on the existence of mathematical transformations which are easy to perform in one direction, but cannot be reversed without secret private information. In most cases, however, it is an unproven conjecture that the transformations are as hard to invert as we think.  We investigated certain of these mathematical transformations and gathered evidence which suggests that in most cases the conjecture holds.  However, we also uncovered some statistical anomalies that it might be possible to exploit in the future.  Students working on the projects in Systems Biology combined the mathematical and computational sciences to model, solve, and analyze modern problems in biology.  One project studied a mathematical model to discern if two proteins had similar roles within a cell.  This is an increasingly important problem as the number of known protein structures grows. A second project studied and improved a mathematical model of a cell's metabolism.  The associated computational work proved a heightened efficacy of the new model over its predecessor. A third project investigated estimates of the genetic diversity required by a previous population so that it could combine to create a current population.  The Inverse Problems group focused on the ideas of non-destructive testing and cloaking.  The goal of non-destructive testing is to image the interior of an object without causing damage. A classic example is the use of x-rays, but other methods can be more useful in certain situations.  Two techniques of recent interest employ electrical and/or thermal methods, so-called "impedance" and "thermal" imaging. Groups of students mathematically modeled these techniques and explored the theoretical potential of each to produce images of the interior of an object.  An allied area of current interest is that of "cloaking," in which one attempts to hide an object from an observer. One student analyzed the possibility of cloaking an object against thermal imaging (work that won her a "best poster" award at the Joint Mathematical Meetings in 2012).  In the Geometric Analysis group, the underlying problem is to model using geometry and analysis (calculus) the optimal configuration (shape) of baked goods through developing a mathematical model for the physical processes governing the baking process.   One of the overarching questions was to develop a foam model for th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
