<AbstractNarration>The Target Infusion Project - Infusing the Tablet PC and Problem Based Learning into the Computer Science Curriculum to Enhance Student Ability in Computing Problem Analysis and Software Design - proposes to incorporate Tablet PC technology, active learning tools, and innovative instructional methods to establish an advanced software design lab and curricula to enhance student abilities in computing problem analysis and software design. These efforts will allow the Computer Science Department at Prairie View A&amp;M University to maintain and increase the competitive advantage of the degree program and ensure that graduates are highly trained to enter the computing workforce. &lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of the project are to (1) strengthen the educational infrastructure of the Computer Science Department by developing a Software Design Lab to improve the delivery of laboratory, lectures, and assessment; (2) update the software design and development course sequence with instructional materials that promote active and collaborative learning and problem-solving; and (3) increase students' understanding of abstract computing concepts and enhance students' skills in problem analysis and software design. The expected outcomes are that students will be better prepared to enter the computing workforce and the Computer Science Department will increase its effectiveness to attract and retain students.</AbstractNarration>
