<AbstractNarration>Many plant species self-pollinate (a severe form of inbreeding) and the leaves of all plant species are damaged by insect herbivores. Both inbreeding and herbivory reduce the growth and reproduction of plants but the effects of inbreeding on plant resistance to herbivores is largely unexplored. The proposed studies will use horsenettle plants to examine differences between inbred and outbred plants in the expression of anti-herbivore genes (using microarrays), the induction of key plant defensive chemicals (using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry) that help to protect the plants from herbivores, and the impact of these defensive chemicals on the feeding behavior of herbivores and their natural enemies (predatory insects). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horsenettle is a close relative of crop species such as tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, and peppers and it shares many of the same insect herbivores as these crops. Horsenettle, however, is a widespread invasive weed that is a problem in 43 states. It is an important weed in agricultural fields and it harbors pests and diseases that reduce the yield of these crop species. In addition to producing a complete study of the effects of inbreeding on plant resistance, the proposed research will produce critical information on the colonization and establishment stages of the life cycle of this important weed; provide insight into potential biocontrol agents of horsenettle; and elucidate the potential roles of chemical defenses in the development of sustainable management strategies informed by a sophisticated understanding of underlying genetic and chemical mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>

This severe form of inbreeding (reproducing with a close relative) typically results in progeny with stunted growth, shorter life expectancy, and reduced seed production.&nbsp; In addition, leaf herbivory is also common on plants. This study examined the effects of inbreeding on plant defenses against insect herbivores. We found that inbreeding in a close relative of tomato, potato, and eggplant (common horsenettle) hinders the expression of genes involved with plant defenses against herbivores and reduces both the physical (spines and leaf hairs) and chemical (nasty tasting compounds) defenses against herbivores. We also found that the odors produced by herbivore damaged inbred plants are reduced and attract few predaceous insects (insects that eat herbivores) than do the odors produced by undamaged plants. In addition, we found that herbivores prefer to lay their eggs on inbred damaged plants and that insects prefer to eat inbred plants when offered a choice. Not surprisingly, we found that inbred plants suffer far more herbivore damage than outbred plants and that both inbreeding and herbivory have a synergistic negative affect on seed production. Interestingly, we also found that herbivore larvae grew faster, were more likely to survive to adulthood, and become larger adults with more capable flight capacity (to find new plants to lay their eggs upon) when they fed on inbred plants. Together, these findings suggest that the mating patterns of plants (self-fertilization vs. mating with an unrelated neighbor) has ramifications throughout the food chain and that insects are capable of making host plant choices based upon the odors of their host plants that benefit their progeny. This study also clearly demonstrates that very subtle differences in host plant food quality (the differences in inbred plants vs. outbred plants of the same species) can have big effects on herbivores. In short, this study showed that plant inbreeding has a cascade of effects from the expression of plant defense genes, to the behavior of herbivores and their predators, to the flight capacity of the herbivores feeding upon the plants.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/05/2016<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;G&nbsp;Stephenson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1050998/1050998_10070228_1454715725542_firstinstar--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1050998/1050998_10070228_1454715725542_firstinstar--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Manduca sexta damage to an Inbred (left) and outbred (right) plant"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1050998/1050998_10070228_1454715725542_firstinstar--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Manduca sexta damage to an Inbred (left) and outbred (right) plant"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Manduca sexta damage to an inbred and an outbred horsenettle plant that were once the same size.
