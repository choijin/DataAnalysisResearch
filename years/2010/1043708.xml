<AbstractNarration>The NSDL Biological Sciences Pathway II (BEN) activities include: Redesigning the portal web site to highlight digital resources that are useful in college introductory biology courses and AP biology courses at the middle/high school level; Developing and implementing a Faculty Tester Program to examine the impact of biological sciences digital education resources on student learning; Increasing the number of BEN Faculty Scholars who promote the use of digital resources in the biological sciences classroom. Information reported by Faculty Testers is included in a blog called The Biological Sciences Digital Classroom. The BEN Pathway serves as a catalyst for professional societies or coalitions that seek to foster a change in biological sciences teaching at higher education institutions and at the middle/high school levels. The project focuses on improving curriculum, pedagogy, and student assessment. The BEN Pathway currently provides services and activities for 26 organizations, including aggregating the resources of collaborators into a portal and providing services to develop, disseminate, and sustain high quality digital education resources. This project addresses the need to provide mentoring and professional development for biological sciences education leaders and fosters the practice of using digital resources by assessing their impact on student learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Intellectual Merit  The BEN (Bioscience Education Network) Pathway serves as a catalyst for 27 professional societies or coalitions that seek to foster a change in biological sciences teaching at higher education institutions and the middle and high school levels; this includes changes in curriculum, teaching, and student assessment. The BEN Pathway addresses the pressing need for developing and disseminating high quality biological sciences teaching materials and tools that build problem-solving and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research and workforce skills.  In addition, new research directions in nanotechnology and informatics mean that all STEM college majors, and not just biological sciences majors, need an in-depth understanding of the biological sciences.  For non-STEM majors, faculty are looking for teaching resources that help prepare these students to understand public issues related to the biological sciences, such as stem cell research, cloning and gene therapy, and environmental and conservation issues.  For college students preparing to become K-12 teachers of biology, faculty members also need materials that emphasize the best teaching practices.  These and other needs were first identified in the 2003 report  by the National Research Council, Bio 2010: Transforming Undergraduate Education for Future Research Biologists (http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10497&amp;page=R2) and later again in 2011 in the Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action report (http://visionandchange.org/files/2011/03/Revised-Vision-and-Change-Final-Report.pdf).  Major project activities included:  ***Providing mentoring and professional development for staff members in 27 organizations on how to build digital libraries or contribute biological sciences education resources to digital libraries, including the National Science Digital Library (nsdl.org).  ***Developing and providing guidelines, software tools, and technical assistance for digital library builders and catalogers.  ***Developing and maintaining the BEN Portal. Through the BEN portal, peer-reviewed e-resources from all collaborators are aggregated into a one-stop, searchable central website (http://www.biosciednet.org).  *** Cataloging or describing and validating new online biological sciences education resources and deaccessioning or removing resources that have been deleted from the Internet. Descriptive information about each online resource includes author and copyright information, type of resources (video, image, journal article, etc.), and grade level.  More information about BEN catalog management and information are online (http://saas.aaas.org/ben-wiki/doku.php?id=ben_catalog_management and http://www.biosciednet.org/docs/BEN_Metadata_White_Paper.pdf).  ***Providing ongoing technical maintenance for the BEN portal, including upgrading the online search and browse functions and harvesting new resources.  Harvesting is the process for aggregating all the educational resources of the organizations at one central website. More information about the harvesting process is online (http://saas.aaas.org/ben-wiki/doku.php?id=harvesting_process).  ***Identifying and providing professional development for faculty who promote awareness and use of biological sciences digital libraries. These ambassadors are called BEN Scholars. More information about BEN Scholars is online (http://www.biosciednet.org/portal/about/benScholars.php?nav=main).  BEN lead collaborators include the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Isovera (technical service provider), American Physiological Society (APS), American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Institute for Biological Sciences (AIBS), BioQuest Curriculum Consortium (BCC), Bio-Link, and Ecological Society of America (ESA).
