<AbstractNarration>This award will support an observational program to characterize the fundamental properties of massive stars.  Dr. Gies and his team will conduct observations of the diameters and flattening of nearby massive stars, obtained with optical interferometry.  The first part of this project will determine temperatures, radii, masses, and rotational velocities for a large sample of massive stars.  The rotational speeds will be estimated through interferometric measurements of rotational flattening and spectroscopic measurements of the Doppler shifts related to rotation.  The second part of the project will examine how close pairs of massive binary stars interact over time exchanging both mass and angular momentum. The observations for this project will be conducted using the Center for High Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) telescope array, located at Mt. Wilson, California.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to impact the wider field of stellar astrophysics because the observations will provide key tests of theoretical models for the rotational evolution of massive stars from youth to old age.  The project will also involve graduate students at Georgia State University (GSU), and the results from this research will be incorporated into that institution's undergraduate curriculum.  The PI also proposes to engage in education and outreach activities in coordination with the Mount Wilson Observatory, and the GSU Hard Labor Creek Observatory in Georgia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The stars in the sky are so far away that they appear as pinpoints  in even the best telescopes.  The challenge of resolving them into  disks like that of the Sun requires the construction of arrays of  smaller telescopes, known as interferometers, that can combine  their collected light to create an instrument more powerful than  any single telescope.  Georgia State University operates the  Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array at  the historic Mount Wilson Observatory in southern California, and  this six-telescope interferometer is the best in the world for the  study of stars and their immediate environments.   The CHARA Array telescopes were the primary means to launch a series  of investigations on distant hot and massive stars.  The measurements were used to determine the temperatures and sizes of these huge  stars, and because many of them rotate very rapidly, they may  assume a flattened shape that can be measured with the Array.  The fastest rotating hot stars often eject gas from their rapid  spinning equators to create a circumstellar disk.  The CHARA  Array was used to make the first survey of the sizes and  orientation of the disks of these so-called Be stars.  The origin of the fast spin of Be stars is still mysterious,  but there is some evidence that a nearby orbiting star might  hold the explanation.  Many massive stars are born in co-orbiting pairs known as binary stars, and as stars age they may grow in  size to reach dimensions comparable to their separation.   When the more massive of the two grows to a critical radius,  it will begin to lose mass by a gas stream to the companion.  This mass donor star may be eventually stripped of all its  outer layers to reveal a hot small core, while the companion  gainer star will increase in mass and spin up.  CHARA Array  observations of one such system, phi Persei, have detected the  hot companion orbiting the brighter Be star, and these observations allow us to estimate the masses and other properties of both stars,  providing us with clear measurements of the outcome of the stellar transformations that occurred in this system.   Other binary systems consist of stars that orbit white dwarfs, the ancient  remains of once brilliant stars.  If the separation between stars is small  enough, then mass transfer to the surface of the white dwarf may occur.  In some circumstances, the gas accumulated on the white  dwarf may become so hot that a thermonuclear explosion occurs that  blasts the accreted gas into space.   The CHARA Array focused on  one such explosion of Nova Delphini in 2013, and these observations revealed for the first time how the expanding fireball changed in  appearance following the explosion.  The extraordinary power of the CHARA Array telescopes has given us the means to explore the  properties and life stories of stars in vivid detail.  The award from the NSF made possible these scientific investigations  and provided unique training opportunities in optics, techniques  of astronomical observation, and computational methods of data analysis for the scientists, postdoctoral research associates, and  graduate students involved with the work.  All of the students and scientists in the project participated in public outreach programs  to share their knowledge and excitement about these discoveries.
