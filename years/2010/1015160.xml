<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project used electroencephalography (measurement of brain potentials) to study how people integrate contextual information when understanding language. Specifically, we measured brain responses to [the Chinese equivalent of] the word <em>some</em>, which, like English <em>some</em>, can mean both "at least one" or "not all". According to linguistic theory, the "at least one" meaning of <em>some</em> is part of its inherent definition, whereas the "not all" meaning is a meaning we derive based on the context; our study aimed to identify what kind of brain activity is associated with deriving this meaning. To do this we showed Chinese speakers pictures in which either all the characters in the picture are doing the same thing, or in which some characters are doing one thing and some doing another; afterwards, the participants read Chinese sentences like "In the picture, <em>some of</em> the girls are sitting on chairs"; in this way, we could measure brain responses to the word <em>some</em> in contexts where its derived "not all" meaning is correct and contexts where it is not. Our investigation revealed a pattern of brain activity associated with the derived "not all" meaning of <em>some</em> which was distinct from brain activity patterns observed in other types of linguistic phenomena, suggesting that the brain may have specialized mechanisms for integrating language with context. In addition, our study is the first electroencephalography study of this phenomenon conducted in a non-European language.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/01/2011<br>      Modified by: Stephen&nbsp;J&nbsp;Politzer-Ahles</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
