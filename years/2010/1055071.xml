<AbstractNarration>The University of Southern Mississippi Gulf Coast Research Laboratory (GCRL) Museum houses a large collection of preserved marine invertebrates from the northern Gulf of Mexico. This collection is dominated by specimens collected from regions of the Gulf that are presently impacted or threatened by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. These collections represent reference material relevant to environmental impact studies that will be conducted in the aftermath of the spill. Many of the specimen lots in the museum represent historical collections (repeated collections made from the same location over a period of time) that will be useful for assessing oil spill impact. The goal of this project is to prepare the GCRL Museum invertebrate holdings from key areas of the northern Gulf of Mexico for access by the scientific community. This will entail cataloging data from collection lots, verifying identifications, entering the data into the museum database, and making that database searchable on the GCRL Museum web site. In addition, recent pre-impact samples from affected shoreline habitats will be processed and incorporated into the GCRL Museum collection. This work will take one year to complete, and be conducted by four senior scientists, two graduate students and two part time undergraduate workers. Upon completion, all data from the GCRL Museum invertebrate holdings pertaining to this project will be electronically accessible by the scientific community and all specimen lots will be available for loan to interested user groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archived invertebrate specimens and collections along with the ecological data pertaining to their acquisition are valuable resources that scientists need in order to study effects of oil on shoreline habitats of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Scientists, resource managers, and other interested parties will be able to search our holdings and learn which invertebrates occur in key areas that have since been exposed to oil. Equipped with baseline knowledge about species and communities that historically characterize an area, scientists can assess when or if a key shoreline habitat has recovered. Students participating in this project will learn museum curatorial techniques and be trained in taxonomy for proper identification of marine invertebrates. Further, the student participants will be encouraged to pursue projects relating to the study of biodiversity with emphasis on the acute and chronic effects that this environmental catastrophe may have had on the faunal integrity of affected shoreline habitats.</AbstractNarration>
