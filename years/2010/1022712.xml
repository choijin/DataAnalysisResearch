<AbstractNarration>Conceptualizing and Measuring Justice: &lt;br/&gt;Links between Academic Research and Practical Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term "justice" has broad academic appeal, and the effective promotion of justice is often touted as a goal of policy makers and practitioners in a wide range of fields. Justice, however, is measured and conceptualized differently based on academic discipline and policy orientation. Traditionally the idea of justice is a philosophical and moral concept. But, as the concept of justice has served as part of the foundation of more practice and policy orientated fields, the term has been adapted to each area of inquiry. For example, criminology scholars focus on justice as an outcome of the criminal justice system. International development and conflict scholars often focus on justice in terms of the rule of law and examine particular conflicts or nations in-depth to decide if justice or injustices occurred. Law &amp; society scholars often focus on justice as equity and look to decision-making processes and procedures to measure justice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Justice, Law and Society at George Mason University will host a series of two workshops at the National Science Foundation to advance scholarship and forge connections on the twin issues of conceptualizing and measuring justice. In the first of the two workshops, scholars and practitioners will present and discuss their conceptualization of justice. The second workshop will focus on techniques used by scholars and practitioners in each field to measure justice. The interdisciplinary focus on the broad concept of justice -- which is one of the main focus areas of three of the above mentioned areas of study and practice -- will deepen our understanding of the concept of justice and broaden our skill set for measuring justice in scholarship and practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will bring together a diverse group of scholars and graduate students in the fields of criminology, law &amp; society and international development and conflict. In the workshops, graduate students will have the opportunity to network with senior scholars and develop their research agendas through the two workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project sought to bring together scholars from a variety of disciplines to discuss how we conceptualize and measure justice in sociolegal research. Initially the goal was to host one conference on conceptualization of justice in social science research and a second on measurement of justice in social science research. Each conference would bring together senior scholars in the area as well as graduate students and early career academics to build a strong network of scholars focused on issues of justice within sociolegal inquiry. Ultimately scholars sought to make the inquiry of justice explicit in an area of scholarship where it has largely been an implicit concept. In the winter of 2010 organizers hosted a conference on conceptualizing justice at National Science Foundation headquarters. Approximately 30 scholars attended. In spring of 2011 organizers hosted a conference on measuring justice at George Mason University. Approximately 30 scholars attended. At the spring 2011 meeting the group decided to move forward with organizing efforts and partnered with the American Bar Foundation.

The project has brought together a network of senior and junior scholars working in a variety of higher education institutions and engaged in social science research focused on justice. In particular graduate students have benefitted from participation. A number of students have made connections with scholars outside of their home institution and had the opportunity to serve on panels at professional associations and share their work with senior scholars in their areas of interest. For example, five students involved in the original workshops participated on SJP panels at the Law &amp; Society Association conference in 2012. Six students participated in panels at the American Criminology Conference in 2011. Scholarly activity at national conferences and within multiple disciplines continues to build off of the work of the three workshops from this project. The project engaged practitioners at policy organizations (American Bar Association) and think tanks (Vera and Urban Institute). The goal was to see how social science work on justice may have a more productive dialogue with policy makers and practitioners engaged in justice work. The collaborations and efforts of scholars involved in the project is ongoing, and continues to grow from the initial National Science Foundation funded workshops.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/05/2013<br>      Modified by: Shannon&nbsp;Portillo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
