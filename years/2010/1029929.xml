<AbstractNarration>The Design Loft STEM Learning Program is introducing 400 underserved middle school students in California to engineering careers. The goal of the program is to develop students' ability to define and create solutions for real world problems by using "design thinking." The program's learning activities expose students to design thinking tasks that produce low-cost engineering solutions to improve the lives of poor people around the world. Students are designing cost-effective ways of increasing impoverished people's access to water, shelter, and energy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's objectives are to (1) develop design-based intersession career camps, (2) create a professional community institute and web site for camp educators and teachers from partner schools, (3) develop a participant-mentoring course for STEM college students, and (4) assess the effectiveness of the design-based STEM career camp model. Anticipated outcomes include exposure of middle school students to design thinking and engineering careers, development of instructional resources for teachers, creation of a scalable model program for teaching and learning about design thinking and engineering careers, and collection of project effectiveness data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Objectives  The d.Loft STEM Learning project applied design thinking as an approach to enhance STEM learning. Design thinking is a human-centered, prototype-driven engineering and innovation process and a series of mindsets that provides a scaffold for real-life problem solving.  The overall goals were to introduce design thinking into supplemental educational settings for middle school students, to introduce educators to design thinking as a STEM method, and to contribute to an improved understanding of the role of design thinking in K-12 education and STEM preparation.  Project Outcomes  630+ students in after school, summer school, and intersession camps, 370+ pre- and in-service educators and teachers attending activities, and 143 university students used design thinking to introduce students to STEM topics and careers. They used design thinking to identify problems, uncover novel insights, and develop solutions to local and global STEM issues such as access to water, energy, and shelter. The project established relationships with people and organizations that made it possible to recruit educators, teachers, and students and then help support them as they moved forward with implementation. The project conducted research and evaluation to determine the role design thinking might best play in STEM engagement.  1. The project developed design thinking camps, summer and after-school programs, and a model for weekly after-school programming.  2. The project has established a series of training institutes in design thinking and STEM integration for educators and teachers with partner organizations in California and Utah.  3. 143 students registered for and completed the course Educating Young STEM Thinkers at Stanford University over the projectÆs four years. The course introduces students to design thinking, the national conversations about STEM pathways, and provides opportunities to develop activities and mentor middle school students in STEM-based design activities.  4. Project staff and university students in the project-related course developed three, month-long curriculum units (34-40 activities in each). They were used and field-tested in after school, summer school, and school intersession camps.  5. Both research and evaluation studies were conducted. The project conducted research about how the K-12 middle grades students learned design thinking and the STEM content they were engaging.  Research indicates:  1. Middle school children can learn design thinking. Analysis of data indicate that it may add to their sense of efficacy, introduce them to an engineering method and topics for problem solving, and can be a vehicle for them to learn STEM content. Middle school students start with na&iuml;ve ideas about engineers and design thinkers, but are able to develop more complex and accurate ideas through guided design thinking challenges.  2. We conducted design thinking/STEM integrated workshops and curriculum shadowing events (where pre-service teachers observed the curriculum in action) with over 370+ teachers attending. The project initiated curriculum development workshops that resulted in 27 teacher-created curriculum modules that are now posted on the project website (dloft.stanford.edu/resources). Teacher response indicates that design thinking has the potential to become a powerful STEM approach.  3. STEM-integrated design thinking curriculum was effective for introducing middle grades students to STEM topics and content and design thinking methods. We found that design thinking can be integrated in many different STEM topics that are consistent with the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core State Standards.  4. The mentorship model established for Stanford University students with middle school youth was beneficial to both groups. The university students reflected on their own careers, got insights into high-quality and effective educational activities, and saw the value in STEM outreach....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
