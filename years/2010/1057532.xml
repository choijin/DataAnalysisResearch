<AbstractNarration>Project Title:  Fate, transport, and toxicity of engineered nanoparticles in the atmosphere&lt;br/&gt;PI: Richard M, Kamens, kamens@unc.edu; Ilona Jaspers (co-PI) ilona_jaspers@med.unc.edu Michael P. Tolocka (co-PI) fizzchem@hotmail.com, &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Chapel Hill, NC, 27599&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submitted to: Interfacial Transport and Thermodynamics Program, # 1414 NSF (EPA# NI-108)&lt;br/&gt;NSF project Officer: Dr. Robert M. Wellek, and Deputy Director, CBET, Division of Engineering, NSF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Objective:  Determine the atmospheric fate of engineered nanoparticles (ENP) and the effect of aging on the toxicity of this class of materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  The first focus is on the chemical kinetics of ENP atmospheric transformations. ENP will react faster than their micron-sized counterparts found in dusts. The PIs aim to understand how they behave as seed for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) reactions. Because ENP act as photocatalysts, the yield of SOA will be affected. The second focus is to understand the toxicity of this class of materials. They will rapidly screen the ENP for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as measured by a chemical method. Easily reducible species, such as Ni3+ in NixOy will enhance ROS production. The last step is to measure the actual toxicological response of human bronchial epithelial cells. As the materials age, the metal center becomes more oxidized and therefore easily reduced, resulting in increased inflammatory and other biological response to ENP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the kinetics experiments, both flow tube and smog chamber studies will be performed. The flow tube studies will be used to determine kinetic parameters of uptake onto their surfaces as a function of relative humidity and particle size. In this way, we can use these parameters for the models that will be developed for their chemical transformations in real atmospheres. To simulate those atmospheres, the smog chamber experiments will be used to determine the fate of ENP as well as their toxicity measured using chemical and in vitro biological methodologies. The chemical method involves the reaction of the suspended particulate matter with dithiothreitol. For the toxicity analysis, they will use differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells or A549 cells grown on membrane support. Cells will be exposed to the fresh or aged ENP. Basolateral supernatants and RNA will be analyzed for the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and for the levels of intracellular inflammatory mediators as well as markers of oxidative stress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The unique aspect of this research is that the PIs aim to understand the fate of ENP in the atmosphere and their toxicological effect. Accurate measurements of the oxidation and transport of ENP in the atmosphere are essential. The present uncertainties in understanding ENP fate and transport can strongly affect conclusions from studies that may underestimate the potential toxicity of this class of materials, their derivatives, and their influence on atmospheric processes. Detailed kinetic data will benefit modeling efforts by providing a basis to estimate the fate and transport of ENP. Adding these data to existing databases for air-shed models will benefit officials of governmental organizations who use these models to set policies regarding risk assessment and control strategies for generators of ENP. Health effects researchers will benefit from the toxicological data acquired from our experiments as a guide for exposure assessment. In addition, epidemiological studies that aim to locate a causal mechanism for the deleterious effects of ambient particulate matter will benefit from a more precise understanding of what compounds are associated with the aerosol and their toxicity. The proposed research program not only enables the  identification of  ENP reactions and their kinetics in real time, but also the rapid reaction and data analysis provides greater throughput allowing a greater range of nanoparticle studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supplemental Keywords: air, ambient air, atmosphere, tropospheric, chemical transport, exposure, effects, health effects, human health, dose-response, stressor, chemicals, toxics, particulates, oxidants, intermediates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The introduction and use of nanoparticles in everyday products and the environment raises many important questions that can impact our air quality which might negatively affect our climate and health. The unique characteristics of nanoparticles, which are dependent on their size, shape, and composition, actually generates concerns and questions on how best to study these apparently strange and unexpected characteristics and their effects on the environment and peoples health. Improper use of traditional test methods could yield false results giving a false sense of low or high risk from the use of nanoparticles.  In this project there are several significant findings that were made in three principal scientific disciplines needed to assess the safety of nanoparticles: 1) atmospheric chemistry and its impact, 2) exposure science and methods, and 3) toxicology of nanomaterials.  In addition, we feel that our methods, techniques, and experimental design, were developed in a way that resulted in an improvement over other methods commonly used, and serves to illustrate the value of these methods which we feel also has a significant impact on the field and discipline. In addition, the design of our environmental irradiation ("smog") chamber included additional safety precautions to contain the nanomaterials to protect lab personnel and the local environment.         Effect of Titanium Dioxide Particles on Atmospheric Reactivity Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation from Photooxidation of NO-only and Toluene &amp; NOx systems       Because most engineered nanoparticles are made through gas-phase processes, industrial emissions, will be present in the local atmosphere. Subsequently, these nanoscale catalysts may serve as airborne particle surfaces for formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) which is known to be a health risk. Some nanoparticles such as titanium dioxide are also photocatalysts, increasing reactivity by absorbing light and generating the hydroxyl radical. However, the  role of engineered nanoparticles and their possible detrimental health effects remain unclear due to the lack of systematic experimental studies conducted under more realistic atmospheric conditions of full spectrum sunlight and natural variation of temperature and humidity.             In this study, outdoor smog chamber experiments using natural diurnal sunlight, temperature and humidity, of NO-only and toluene-NOx mixtures, photooxidation experiments designed to represent the atmosphere were systematically conducted to investigate the effect of the pre-existing titanium dioxide (TiO2) seed aerosol, as an instance of widely used engineered metal oxide nanomaterials. Our results indicate that compared with ammonium sulphate, which is common in the atmosphere as pre-existing particles, TiO2 enhanced and accelerated secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation of less than 1 micron diameter, from toluene photooxidation, potentially due to the photocatalytic formation of the reactive oxygen species. For example, hydroxyl radicals can serve as the primary oxidant in lower atmosphere, when TiO2 is exposed to sunlight including ultraviolet light. Only 1/4th as much of TiO2 compared to the sulphate was needed to form the same amount of SOA from these toluene/NOx experimental reactive air mixtures; in other words, TiO2 is 4 times more effective in enhancing SOA formation. The implication is that nanoparticles released to the atmosphere can and may have a significant impact on atmospheric reactivity, increased production of SOA, and, therefore adds to the total burden of ambient particulate matter in the respirable range, known to have significant health risk.       A Comparison of Three Dispersion Media on the Physicochemical and Toxicological Behaviour of TiO2 and NiO Nanoparticles       Many toxicological studies in the recent past have and continue to utilize methods which are suspect in causing false positives and negative results depending on nanoparticl...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
