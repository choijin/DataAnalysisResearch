<AbstractNarration>This NSF award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program supports work to develop low-cost bioreactor systems that will enhance the ability to utilize tissue culture to improve agricultural plant productivity.  In addition to the typical paradigm of optimizing the chemical and environmental conditions within the bioreactor, this research seeks to demonstrate the ability to control plant development using transcriptional factors that control the expression of multiple genes.  These transcriptional factors will be delivered to the plant tissues using Agrobacterium, a bacteria that has been developed to transiently deliver DNA to cultured plant tissues (developed with previous NSF support; BCS-0003926).  The genes associated with plant embryo formation will be identified by examining patterns of gene expression during somatic embryogenesis.  The concept of inducing embryo formation will be implemented using Cacao, the source of chocolate, due to its commercial (and social) value.  In addition to providing an instructional case study that demonstrates the use of interdisciplinary principles of bioreactor design and molecular biology, the effort will produce thousands of fungal resistant plants that will be distributed to smallholder farmers in South America. In addition, the low-cost bioreactor technology has potential applications to a broad range of food and biomass crops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SUMMARY:  A goal of this project was to improve propagation of Theobroma cacao, the chocolate tree. Somatic embryos (SE) are those that arise from tissues other than the fertilization of the egg, as normally occurs in seeds.  The ability to induce somatic embryos provides a way to propagate superior plants faster than traditional breeding.  Genes associated with SE formation were explored by comparing whole genome micro-arrays that probe for which genes are turned on and it was found that nearly half the expressed genes of the plant were significantly altered (~10,000) during the embryogenic process. Comparing genes from normal zygotic seed embryos to somatic embryos provides insights to those things in common, and those that are different.  A notable observation was increased stress-related gene expression in SE, which may explain why SE tend to have reduced ability to regenerate into entire plants.  Despite this massive shift in SE gene expression, a single transcription factor (BABY BOOM) was found to dramatically increase SE formation when transformed into the cacao.  Because expression of the transcription factor turns on many other genes to form embryos, having this æonÆ all the time was detrimental to further development as a normal plant. We therefore demonstrated that transient introduction of the gene facilitated improved embryo formation while permitting subsequent plant regeneration. This transient expression could be accomplished either by delivery of the gene using the Agrobacterium infection method, or introducing a transcription factor under the control of chemical that can be added to control when the gene is on. This second approach was demonstrated with a different transcription factor that is called LEC2.  To allow the treatment of the plant tissues with these chemicals and genes, we also further developed a bioreactor system that intermittently floods the plant tissue with media called a temporary immersion reactor (TIB).  In addition to allowing control of media concentrations, the TIB was designed to minimize the use of gasses added to the culture, where demonstrations of improved plant tissue growth were shown for seedless watermelon tissue on CO2 and root culture on elevated oxygen.  Most recently, the growth of cacao in the reactor during the conversion of embryos to plants was observed to dramatically improve the rate of development with root formation on the embryos without specialized hormones.  With supplementary funds provided for undergraduates from both NSF and the University, the project involved two under-represented graduate students and 15 undergraduate researchers over the project duration of 4 years (2 students received awards for presentations at National professional meetings). There was significant international interactions facilitated through supplementary USAID funding as well as assistance to other projects as noted below under Additional Information.   Additional Information:  An NSF PEER-USAID (Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research) supplement was funded in association with this project to the University of Ibadan.  This included a visit by the collaborating scientist (Dr. Morufat Balogun) for training at Penn State with subsequent bioreactor system components being fabricated and taken back to Nigeria as part of a technology transfer effort to propagate the Asian yam, which is a food staple for hundreds of millions of people.  This component of the project was concluded with a workshop meeting of stakeholders including farmers, politicians and other yam research scientists held in Nigeria during summer 2015.  Dr. Curtis recorded several videos of both bioreactor propagation operation and description of the principles of operation which were presented at the workshop.  A scientist from Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, Dr. Sukhada Mohandas, visited the laboratory for a few days to learn more about our propagation methods for possible application to banana pr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
