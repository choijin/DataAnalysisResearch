<AbstractNarration>The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) will continue its collaboration in providing early and mid-career scientists and engineers with opportunities for professional development and public service via the AAAS Science and Technology Fellowship Program.  Annually, Fellows will be selected competitively and placed in offices throughout NSF, working on projects of mutual interest to the Fellow and the host directorate or office. By providing insight into the decision-making process, and learning about current issues affecting the scientific and engineering enterprise, Fellows will discover how NSF funds science, while providing scientific, engineering and educational input on issues relating to NSF's mission support of basic science and engineering research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fellows will work with staff involved in planning, development and oversight of agency programs in all fields of fundamental research. Assignments may involve significant interagency, congressional or international activity, as well as involvement with the National Science Board, NSF's policy-setting body. The program includes an orientation on executive branch and congressional operations, as well as a yearlong seminar program on matters involving science, technology and public policy.</AbstractNarration>

Many AAAS Fellows who have returned to academia report that their research is now more focused on addressing policy challenges.
