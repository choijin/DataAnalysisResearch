<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Biological Sciences Directorate supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Scott Nickolaisen at California State University - Los Angeles.  The research projects supported in this site are in a number of areas of chemistry, but with a number of projects at the Biology-Chemistry interface.  Undergraduates will be recruited to this site primarily from institutions that lack infrastructure to support undergraduate research, including students from underrepresented groups, with a particular emphasis on community college students in the Los Angeles basin.  The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program.  A sample of the projects that undergraduates will work on include:  (1)  the development and application of magnetic resonance techniques for the study of the physicochemical properties of biologically related macromolecule; (2)  the study of the photochemical reactions of environmental pollutants in condensed phases; (3)  the study of how dietary factors regulate the metabolism of high density lipoproteins; (4)  the study of the allosteric activation sites of the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; (5) the preparation of non-spherically symmetric dendrimers with novel, engineered features such as canyons, clefts, and pockets and (6) the study of the reaction kinetics of larger (more than two carbons) alkyl peroxy radicals with other atmospheric constituents.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including training on the responsible conduct of research, laboratory safety, and scientific communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide students without significant research experience a chance to conduct cutting-edge research in the chemical sciences with dedicated faculty mentors at this predominantly undergraduate institution.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for further study in the chemical sciences, graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             The REU site in Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University, Los Angeles hosted 10 community college students each summer from 2011 &ndash; 2013.  The primary objective of this REU site is to provide a comprehensive research experience for community college students who have had little, if any, prior exposure to research activities with the aim of encouraging students from these groups to pursue careers in the chemical sciences.  Student participants work alongside CSULA faculty and students conducting original research using state-of-the-art techniques and equipment.  The purpose of targeting community college students is twofold: to reach students early in their academic careers to make them aware of and excite them about the possibility of engaging in chemical research as a career path, and to tap the vast population of students in the Los Angeles Basin who begin their college experience in a community college where they have minimal access to participate in research activities of any kind.              Because of the diverse population within the Los Angeles Basin, a secondary focus of our site is to engage students in research from groups underrepresented in the sciences including African-American, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian/Pacific Island students.  Of the 30 student participants during this period, 63.3% were Hispanic, 10.0% were African-American, 10.0% were Asian, 3.3% were Pacific Islander, and 3.3% were Native American.                REU participants selected research projects from an array of topics including inorganic and organic synthesis, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared and laser spectroscopy, enzyme kinetics, plant genetics, electrochemistry, organometallic photochemistry, protein assays, mass spectrometry, atmospheric chemistry, lipid biochemistry, environmental analysis, and electrophoresis.  REU participants presented their research result to CSULA students, faculty, and administrator as well as community college faculty at a research symposium hosted by the CSULA Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry at the end of each summer.
