<AbstractNarration>Jon P. Costanzo        IOS-1022788&lt;br/&gt;Physiological Mechanisms in Anuran Adaptation to Extreme Cold &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores mechanisms of freeze tolerance, a remarkable adaptation by which select organisms can survive extreme cold by tolerating the freezing and thawing of their blood and other tissues.  The model organism in these studies is the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), a North American amphibian whose habitat ranges from the Southern Piedmont north to within the Arctic Circle.  Although freeze tolerance in this species was reported nearly 30 years ago, only recently was it discovered that frogs adapted to the subarctic climate are considerably more cold hardy than ones from more southerly locales.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will characterize fully freeze tolerance in frogs from Interior Alaska, comparing their physiological responses to freezing with those exhibited by frogs from a well-studied population in southern Ohio.  Biochemical and molecular approaches will be used in laboratory experiments designed to detect unique adaptations of the cryoprotectant system and cell membrane that contribute to enhanced freeze tolerance in the Alaskan frogs.  The outcomes of this research will improve the understanding of the evolution and physiological mechanisms of freeze tolerance, an important cold-hardiness strategy employed by diverse organisms. They may also suggest new approaches and tools for cryopreserving biological materials and offer insights into certain disease states, such as chronic pancreatitis and diabetes/obesity.  In addition, enhancing understanding the winter biology of amphibians may help predict consequences of climate change for their long-term survival. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance scientific and technological understanding by creating a traveling exhibit, "Nature's Frozen Marvels," to educate the general public about the fascinating adaptation of natural freeze tolerance, drawing special attention to the underlying biological, chemical, and physical principles.  The investigators will work closely with the Hefner Zoology Museum staff at Miami University to plan and implement a special-topic course that will engage undergraduate students drawn from a variety of academic disciplines in designing the exhibit.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Our aim in this project was to identify the adaptations at protein, cell, and organismal levels of organization that contribute to extreme freeze tolerance and winter survival in a population of the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) from near the speciesÃ† northern limit of distribution, which extends into the Arctic Circle.  Our experimental approach was to compare the responses of frogs indigenous to Interior Alaska with those of frogs from a temperate population (southern Ohio) that we have studied over the past 25 years.  We determined that Alaskan frogs survive freezing to temperatures at least as low as &ndash;16&deg;C, much lower than can be survived by their temperate counterparts, and can tolerate being continuously frozen at &ndash;4&deg;C for 2 months.  They readily recover from exposure to &ndash;8&deg;C during multiple freeze/thaw cycles, attesting that they are well adapted to the variable and extreme temperatures occurring within their hibernacula.  However, their capacity to survive freezing is highly seasonal, as frogs that have recently emerged from hibernation die if frozen to temperatures below &minus;5&deg;C.  We found that extreme freeze tolerance in the subarctic frogs is supported by an exceptional cryoprotectant system, which uses glucose and urea to limit cryoinjury. Relative to Ohioan frogs, Alaskan frogs had a superior capacity to accumulate both urea and glucose.  Other studies showed that the northern frogs had a greater abundance of glucose transporters, which helps distribute the glucose throughout the body, and cell membranes that better resist the effects of cold.  One of the most exciting findings was that the frogs break down muscle protein in order to accrue the urea needed to survive in winter.  The skeletal muscles we examined underwent severe atrophy, raising new questions about the fitness costs of hibernation in such a severe climate.  Broader Impacts  The award supported the professional development of three students who obtained M.S., and/or Ph.D. degrees working in the PIÃ†s laboratory.  These students participated in all aspects of the scientific endeavor, publishing 2-8 papers in peer-reviewed journals, presenting research at regional and national professional meetings, and submitting successful funding proposals.  They supervised undergraduate research assistants and played major roles in developing and implementing a special-topics course, "Capstone Seminar ZOO 400: NatureÃ†s Frozen Marvels: Designing an Interactive Traveling Museum Exhibit." Eight Biology undergraduate students (including four females, two minority females, and two males) acquired various research skills, participated in regular meetings of the PIÃ†s lab group, and presented research at regional student research forums.  The PI and his doctoral students developed and taught a three-credit, special-topic (Capstone) course that engaged twelve undergraduate students representing diverse academic disciplines, including Life Science Education, History, and Speech Communication, in the task of researching, designing, and constructing a museum exhibit.  Featured at Miami UniversityÃ†s largest museum, "NatureÃ†s Frozen Marvels" educates the public about the fascinating adaptation of natural freeze tolerance.  We hosted a team from the BBC Natural History Unit which collected interviews and film footage to accompany a program about freeze tolerance in the wood frog.  The segment appeared on "NatureÃ†s Weirdest Events" on 1/3/13.  We also hosted a producer, film crew, and host David Pogue of the documentary series NOVA; "Making Stuff Colder," which aired on PBS on 10/30/13, included film footage and an interview with the PI.   We worked extensively with Humble Bee Films, a production firm for UKTV Eden, which showcased the freeze-tolerant wood frog in "Life on Ice," an episode of the nature documentary, "David AttenboroughÃ†s Natural Curiosities."  Our graduate student transported wood frogs to the U.K. and spent a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
