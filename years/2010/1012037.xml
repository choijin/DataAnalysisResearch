<AbstractNarration>The Environmental chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the collaborative research project of Prof. Michelle Scherer and Prof. Vicki Grassian of the University of Iowa, and Prof. Martin St. Clair of Coe College. The collaborating investigators and their students will study sorption dynamics of organic substances on iron oxide mineral surfaces. The study will make use of advanced spectroscopic methods and computational modeling methods to interrogate this complex and important environmental interface. Advanced surface spectroscopic methods will be used to characterize the molecular level details of the adsorbed surface complexes formed on nanoscale and microscale goethite and hematite particles. The study could significantly increase our understanding at the molecular level of redox processes on the environmentally ubiquitous iron oxide surfaces. Findings from this work will benefit society by providing insights into molecular scale reactions that are important in protecting the health of the Nation's water bodies. The study will provide excellent opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Iowa and Coe College to work on a cutting edge research project in environmental chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Iron (Fe) oxides are ubiquitous. They are present in the soil beneath your feet, the rust on your car, the hard-drive in your computer, and the rocks on Earth and Mars.  Essentially anywhere that iron is exposed to oxygen, Fe oxides form. These colorful red, yellow, green, and black minerals profoundly influence the quality of our water, air, and soil through the biologically-driven redox cycling between ferric (Fe3+) and ferrous iron (Fe2+). The mechanisms of Fe redox cycling, however, remains poorly understood because of the analytical challenge of distinguishing one Fe atom from another. We used a novel approach to overcome these challenges by linking molecular level characterization of surface speciation with isotope selective 57Fe-M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy measurements of interfacial electron transfer.
