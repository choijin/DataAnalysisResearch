<AbstractNarration>This award continues a 30-year study of social behavior of colonially nesting cliff swallows in southwestern Nebraska. Annual survival and colony choice will be studied for a sample of over 200,000 individually marked birds by re-catching birds at different nesting colonies. The data gathered will examine how size of a nesting colony affects annual survival of cliff swallows and whether individuals use the same size colony each year.  The research will also determine why nesting success in most seasonally breeding birds declines with time during the summer. Experimental treatment of cliff swallow colonies with insecticide creates conditions that stimulate some birds to nest much later in the summer than typically seen and will provide the opportunity to compare first-year survival of birds raised both early and late in the season.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many kinds of animals live in groups of different sizes, including humans, and this research addresses fundamental questions about what factors create and maintain diversity in group sizes; what is discovered for swallows may apply to other species that live in social groups.  Undergraduate students will be heavily involved, many of whom are women, minorities, and other underrepresented groups in research.  This work will be relevant for conservation, because understanding colony choice and annual variation in survival probabilities of species such as cliff swallows could help in establishing management guidelines for similar migratory species that are declining.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was for years 30&ndash;34 of a long-term study of social behavior of colonially nesting cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) in southwestern Nebraska.  By catching and re-catching banded birds at different nesting colonies, annual survival and colony choice was studied for a sample of over 229,000 individually marked birds.  Data gathered was used to study survival and colony choice, in which it was determined to what degree size of a nesting colony affects annual survival of cliff swallows and to what extent an individual uses the same size colony each year.  The work also focuses on breeding time, addressing the question of why in most seasonally breeding birds nesting success declines over time during the summer.  Experimental treatment of cliff swallow colonies with insecticide created conditions that stimulated some birds to nest much later in the summer than typically seen and provided the opportunity to compare first-year survival of birds raised both early and late in the season.   Results indicate that colonies of different sizes provide different costs or benefits depending on the season.  In years that are hot and dry, birds occupying small colonies are favored by having higher annual survival, whereas in cool and wet years, swallows breeding in large colonies have greater survival.  This sort of oscillating pattern, along with the fact that cliff swallows are genetically predisposed to always nest in a small or a large colony, maintains long-term variation in group size.  Thus the work also is relevant to the question of how a changing climate leads over time to drastic changes in animal social behavior.    In addition, it was found that infestations of parasitic insects restrict the time that these birds can nest during the summer.  Nests started later in the summer, after parasites have built up, are usually unsuccessful, and many scientists have debated what causes this pattern in birds in general.  By removing parasites, this research demonstrated that birds nesting late (in the absence of parasitism) had relatively high success.  Thus, for cliff swallows, the seasonal decline in reproductive success seems to be caused by parasites, and this also prevents birds from nesting later in the summer.  Blood-sucking parasites thus may be a major ecological factor that determines the timing and duration of avian breeding cycles.  This work also supported a retrospective analysis of road-associated mortality in cliff swallows.  Millions of wild birds are killed by colliding with vehicles each year, and this remains a major source of mortality in natural populations.  In cliff swallows, it was discovered that fewer birds are being killed by cars now than when the research began 30 years ago.  Those being hit had longer wings than those not dying on roads. The results suggest that selection has favored birds with shorter wings because of aerodynamic advantages that make it easier for them to avoid collisions with vehicles.  The results reveal how evolution can operate over short time scales and lead to some animals quickly adapting to urban landscapes that are now so prevalent in many areas.              Many kinds of animals live in groups of different sizes, including humans, and this research addresses fundamental questions about what factors create and maintain diversity in group sizes.  What was discovered for swallows may apply to other species that live in social groups.  Undergraduate students were heavily involved in this work, many of whom were women and minorities (Native Americans), which are underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  This work will be relevant for conservation: understanding colony choice and annual variation in survival, along with factors regulating the timing of breeding seasons, in species such as cliff swallows could help in establishing management guidelines for similar migratory species that are declining.
