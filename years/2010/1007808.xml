<AbstractNarration>The second cumulant tensor  of a multivariate distribution is its&lt;br/&gt;covariance matrix, which provides a partial description of its&lt;br/&gt;dependence structure (complete in the Gaussian case). Innumerable&lt;br/&gt;successful statistical methods are based on analyzing the covariance&lt;br/&gt;matrix, e.g. imposing rank restrictions as in principal component&lt;br/&gt;analysis or zeros in its inverse as in Gaussian graphical models.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, the covariance matrix plays a critical role in optimization&lt;br/&gt;in finance and other areas involving optimization of risky payoffs,&lt;br/&gt;since it is the bilinear form yielding  the variance of a linear&lt;br/&gt;combination of variables.  For multivariate, non-Gaussian data, the&lt;br/&gt;covariance matrix is an incomplete description of the dependence&lt;br/&gt;structure.  Cumulant tensors are the multivariate generalization of&lt;br/&gt;univariate skewness and kurtosis and the higher-order generalization&lt;br/&gt;of covariance matrices, and allow a more complete description of&lt;br/&gt;dependence.  The research investigates a number of problems in theory,&lt;br/&gt;estimation, algorithms, and applications around modeling higher-order&lt;br/&gt;non-Gaussian dependence with cumulant tensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data arising from modern applications like computer vision, finance,&lt;br/&gt;and computational biology are rarely well described by a normal&lt;br/&gt;distribution, though  analysis often proceeds as if they were.  For&lt;br/&gt;example, one cause of the financial crisis and the damage it did to&lt;br/&gt;many investors was an over-reliance on the variance-based risk&lt;br/&gt;measures appropriate primarily for normal distributions. This can&lt;br/&gt;allow risk to be in a sense hidden in the higher-order structure,&lt;br/&gt;where it can be ignored or even made worse by application of&lt;br/&gt;traditional risk metrics.  Cumulant tensors provide a promising avenue&lt;br/&gt;for modeling higher-order dependence.  Success in developing these&lt;br/&gt;models will have broad impacts in the analysis of real-world data with&lt;br/&gt;complex dependence, particularly in modeling and managing financial&lt;br/&gt;risk and in dimension reduction, and could help improve the robustness&lt;br/&gt;of parts of the financial system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We embarked on a study of higher order dependence using decompositions of so-called cumulant tensors, which generalize the notion of covariance matrices.  Just as a covariance matrix measures dependence between pairs of random variables, a third-order cumulant tensor measures dependence among triples, and a fourth-order among sets of four variables.  We found that these are useful, and appealing to range of practitioners with financial analysis backgrounds.  Many such practitioners we talked with have thought about the need for such objects but were not sure how to deal with them mathematically.  The simplest decomposition techniques apply higher-order analogs of matrix decompositions (such as singular value decomposition) to cumulant tensors.  We found ways to perform such decompositions efficiently.  As the project progressed, we found that in the higher-order case, it is likely that such monolithic decomposition techniques will not be most effective.  Instead network-based decompositions are likely to be more successful due to their attractive computational and representational properties.  These types of decompositions introduce hidden variables and make explicit statements about interaction and independence among these new variables and the given variables.  While such models exist for Gaussian random variables, much underlying theory must still be developed for the more general non-Gaussian case.
