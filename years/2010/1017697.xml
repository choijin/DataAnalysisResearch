<AbstractNarration>In the past two years we have observed an explosion in the use of online message streams. With an abundance of information comes information overload and a scarcity of attention: Active message stream users now face thousands of unread messages every day in their personal streams. To date, we are aware of little academic research dedicated to this stream consumption problem, despite the enormous interest among users and businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will establish scientific foundations for our understanding of the consumption of message streams, and engineer, deploy, and evaluate new tools for users built on those foundations. This research has two principle aims. First, construct computational models that characterize the individual preferences of stream readers and predict for each reader the value provided by specific messages, and, in aggregate, specific stream contributors. The second aim is to design novel, personalized and intelligent user interfaces that facilitate better digestion and management of online message streams, and evaluate those designs in large-scale field studies on the popular platforms Twitter, Facebook and Google Reader. The proposed research is among the first to examine online message streams broadly and to characterize message streams from the perspective of consumption. Our modeling will give insights into the nature of online message stream consumption and provide a theoretical framework for further investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hundreds of millions of users worldwide are ?voting with their fingers? to spend time creating, commenting on, communing over, and consuming tweets, wall posts, status updates, and blog posts.  The research proposed here promises to deepen our understanding of the purpose, value, and social mechanisms underlying message streams, and to create new computational resources for modeling the contributors, their contributions, and the process of consumption.  Based on these computational models, innovative visualizations, recommendations, and interfaces will be developed to reshape the user experience, and inform the design of future message stream services.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through the support of NSF through its support of the Net Fishing project, we have advanced the science of recommender systems with specific focus on understanding how to recommend content in domains with streams of content. This work includes five major areas of technical advance:  We experimentally investigated the question of whether recommendation of content creates a "filter bubble" that isolates users in a set of content like they already prefer, rather than exposing them broadly to the range of possibilities.  In this study of one domain, we found that users naturally narrow their tastes (by consuming less diversely) over time with or without a recommender, but that use of a recommender actually reduced the narrowing of consumption.   We carried out detailed experiments to understand the human factors of complex recommender algorithms.  We now better understand how users react to attributes such as diversity (preferred) and novelty (not preferred, surprisingly), and also understand how users select recommendation algorithms when given the opportunity to control them. We carried out detailed explorations of the new user experience (the challenge of recommending to users about whom the system knows fairly little).  We discovered that a widely-used technique in practice works rather poorly, and provide two alternatives that can improve the recommender experience for new users. We carried out detailed studies of preference elicitation -- the process of finding out a user's preferences.  In that work we first developed a measure of how much "net preference information" is gained from some new information (based on information theory) and then evaluated a set of new interfaces to help improve that information gain (largely by helping users more accurately pinpoint their own preferences). We developed a set of techniques of better studying temporal (time-related) data, including a better technique for separating a sequence of user interactions into coherent sessions and a new method for evaluating user behavior over time by tracking received recommendations and matching them against subsequent actions.    Apart from these contributions to science, we have developed a set of tools and systems to further work on the field, including:  LensKit (an open source recommender toolkit) which is a widely-used toolkit for experimenting with or building recommender systems.  In includes a broad library of algorithms, metrics, and scripts to test and tune recommenders against a diverse set of datasets.  It has been used by thousands of individuals and is publicly available at lenskit.org. BookLens, a recommender system integrated into the online catalog systems of the metropolitan libraries in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. An online course, through Coursera, on recommender systems. This course, which has been visited by tens of thousands of learners, provides a deep introduction to the systems and technology behind recommendation.
