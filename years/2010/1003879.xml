<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to expand an existing mechatronics program to include emerging technologies (e.g. sustainable energy/green technology) by partnering with the state of Oregon, middle and secondary schools, academia, and key industry partners. Educational opportunities are delivered to middle, high school and community college level participants from rural communities through a blend of distance education, technology weekends, and career academies to ensure future graduates have the right skill-sets to meet regional, state and national demands. Embedded in the program design are curricular improvements, professional development for teachers and college faculty, and the articulation of career pathways leading from two-and four year colleges to industry. Specifically, the project provides opportunities for middle and high school students to engage in inquiry based learning projects about renewable energy production. Faculty work directly with industry to integrate emerging technologies into the mechatronics curriculum and to develop applied capstone projects that integrate the principles of sustainable energy manufacturing. By partnering with nine Oregon community colleges, the project develops and initiates a one year Oregon Green Certificate program through blended instruction in renewable energy generation, energy conservation, and practical physics.</AbstractNarration>
