<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Coral reefs are some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth.  Unfortunately, coral reefs are under increasing stress due to changes in their environment and with this increased stress their susceptibility to disease is increased.  The majority of organisms that cause coral diseases and disease in other marine organisms are not dedicated pathogens, but are opportunistic.  Opportunistic pathogens attack a host only when the host is stress and its defenses are compromised.  Coral diseases caused by bacterial pathogens are being identified in an increasing number of locations around the world.     My NSF EAPSI project investigated the feasibility of fluorescently tagging a coral pathogenic bacteria, Vibrio coralliilyticus with green fluorescent protein (GFP).  This pathogenic bacterium causes disease after initial attachment through degradation of the coral tissue, leaving behind exposed coral skeleton.  The purpose of the project was to use a fluorescently tagged strain of the pathogen to be able to visualize the location of the pathogen during different stages of infection and disease of the coral host.  Green fluorescent protein fluoresces when viewed under blue light.  This was the first study to attempt to tag a coral pathogen with GFP in order to learn more about the host-microbe interaction during infection by the pathogen.  I worked at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in Queensland, Australia with Dr. David Bourne.     The fluorescently tagged strains of the pathogen were engineered through by inserting the green fluorescent protein into the chromosome of the bacteria.  After construction of the fluorescent strains, the overall fitness and virulence of the bacteria were evaluated.  I found that the addition of the fluorescent protein did not interfere with the bacteriaÃ†s ability to grow or cause disease-like symptoms.  This was confirmed through multiple experiments testing a wide range of behaviors and virulent properties.     Results from this project have set up a continuation project of applying the fluorescent strains of the coral pathogen to coral larvae and juvenile corals in order to trace it through the disease progression.  A new Ph.D. student working at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) is currently conducting this work.  The combined results from my study and the current infection studies will be published in a peer-reviewed manuscript.  In addition, the results of this EAPSI project have fostered a strong collaboration between the University of Florida and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.  In order to continue this project further, an undergraduate student is working in my lab studying regulation of different behaviors in the coral pathogen.
