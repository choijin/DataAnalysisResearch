<AbstractNarration>This support is for a workshop to be held at the University of Alaska in FY2011, bringing together social scientists, policy makers, government agencies, and local community leaders to explore new models of governance for reducing conflict and improving ecosystem-based management of ocean resources. &lt;br/&gt;The workshop has five main objectives: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Foster synergy among social scientist of diverse disciplines with diverse theoretical and applied expertise.&lt;br/&gt;2) Bring insights of social science research to the dialog surrounding institutional design for ocean governance.&lt;br/&gt;3) Generate new knowledge and theoretical refinement in the fields of participatory democracy, administrative complexity and ecosystem-based management. &lt;br/&gt;4) Set an agenda for follow-up research.&lt;br/&gt;5) Produce a policy report identifying issues, framing the theoretical principles and criteria for evaluating alternatives for conflict reduction and ecosystem stewardship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The invitees include a strong list of environmental and legal scholars, as well as academicians in the fields of political science, sociology, environmental science, and economics.  In addition, community leaders (NSB Mayor and AEWC Chairman), and Federal and State agency personnel (NOAA, DOI, State of Alaska) will be participating. This project will support 19 of the 50 plus participants, as well as the organizational expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop addresses the policy questions posed by the Ocean Policy Task Force (2009), applied to the US Arctic, and meets the Environmental Law Institute (2009) prescription for targeted education for state, federal, local and tribal stakeholders. It is all the more timely in the wake of  the Gulf oil spill, as issues surrounding community resilience and oil and gas development will no doubt become more contentious. The workshop may inform institutional developments in the wake of that incident.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From 2009 to early 2011, a dozen social scientists in Alaska&mdash;at both the University of Alaska and in the private sector&mdash;jointly explored ways government and private institutions could better coordinate the management of oil and gas and other offshore resources in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. They particularly considered how to reduce conflicts among groups with different interests and establish ecosystem-based management&mdash;that is, management that takes into account the effects of resource development and other activities on an entire ecosystem, rather than on just individual resources or species within that ecosystem.  With support from NSF, the social scientists organized a workshop and invited representatives of federal, state, and borough governments; co-management groups; and others to join them in talking about these management issues. That workshop, "Strategies for Cooperative Management in the Marine Environment of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas," was held in Anchorage, Alaska, March 3-5, 2011.  The workshop participants spent two days discussing principles for increasing participation and reducing conflict in management of resources in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas; existing data-integration projects in Alaska; marine spatial planning in the Canadian Beaufort and around the globe; and lessons learned from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig and the resulting disastrous oil spill. They talked about current management structures in Alaska and considered ways to modify those structures to reduce conflict, provide for multiple human uses, improve stewardship in the face of rapid change, and increase coordination across institutions with regional stakeholders. They learned that marine spatial planning means different things in different regions&mdash;it can be improving communication and coordination; developing tools to support decisions; or establishing regulation and zoning. Workshop discussions identified ways to improve cooperative management of offshore Arctic resources:  &bull; First define goals and then identify an appropriate management structure  &bull; Define desired outcomes and timelines  &bull; Build on current institutions  &bull; Recognize complexity of systems  &bull; Reduce uncertainty and increase understanding of issues  &bull; Engage a broader range of those with interests in the resources  &bull; Build trust and identify common interests across those with diverse interests  &bull; Identify effective ways of sharing data  &bull; Recognize sub-regions in Alaska  &bull; Learn from management successes and failures in other regions  Participants also discussed possible next steps&mdash;briefing other groups, doing further outreach and education, fostering more discussions to identify management goals, analyzing the interests of diverse groups, and developing data and tools to support management decisions. Further findings will be developed in the final workshop report.  A complete set of workshop materials has been posted to the project website: http://www.iarc.uaf.edu/en/NX2020/SI. The research team developed a series of institutional models and graphics that will be published as part of the final workshop report.  The final report, executive summary, and journal publication are forthcoming.  The workshop content, planning, and related research activities provided early career professional development for one junior faculty member, two doctoral students, two masterÆs students, and one undergraduate who plans to go on to graduate school. The workshop developed ongoing relationships among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. The workshopÆs contributions to the discipline include a method that helps stakeholders understand institutional management alternatives, using graphics to show links among institutions, organizations, and ecosystem services.
