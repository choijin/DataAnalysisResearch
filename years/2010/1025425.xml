<AbstractNarration>Language choice is a key issue for organizations whose workers are distributed across the world. Allowing everyone to speak their native language and using machine translation tools is an imperfect solution because even the best such tools make many mistakes.  However, companies that require all communication to take place in a standard "corporate language" (often English) risk excluding people for whom the corporate language is not their main language, who may feel like second-class members because they fear making mistakes and being judged on their language use. The goal of this project is to better understand and support informal communication in global virtual organizations whose members speak different native languages. Specifically, the research addresses three interrelated questions: (a) What are the experiences of non-native speakers in English-based virtual organizations? (b) What are the benefits and costs of using English as a common language vs. machine translation? (c) How can machine translation be augmented to improve communication?  We investigate these questions through a combination of interviews and surveys, controlled laboratory studies, and the development and evaluation of tools that use additional representations of meaning, such as pictures, to smooth gaps in machine translation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the issues and tradeoffs involved around language choice practices is important both practically, in terms of companies' competitiveness and people's experiences in the workplace, and theoretically, by complementing existing work in psychology and computer-mediated communication on how culture affects relationship-building and teamwork in virtual organizations. This research could help broaden participation of non-native English speakers in virtual organizations leading to increased trust and improved organizational competitiveness.  Developing new tools to support existing machine translation approaches will also help individuals and organizations to communicate and collaborate, while contributing to the existing body of literature in language processing, machine translation, and multi-lingual picture retrieval.  The research also involves undergraduate and graduate students and will result in their further training and education in interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "Virtual organizations"-aggregations of individuals, facilities and resources that span geographic and institutional boundaries-allow large numbers of people to collaborate internationally to achieve important societal goals.   Many virtual organizations use a single common language such as English.  While using a common language helps reduce barriers among team members from different parts of the world, it also creates challenges for non-native speakers of that common language.  For example, non-native speakers of a common language tend to avoid informal interaction that helps to build strong working relationships because the vocabulary can be uncertain, and misunderstandings may be erroneously attributed to their intelligence or skills rather than language fluency.  The goal of this project was to better understand and support informal communication in global virtual organizations whose members speak different native languages.     Specifically, the research addressed three interrelated questions: (a) What are the experiences of non-native speakers in English-based virtual organizations? (b) What are the benefits and costs of using English as a common language vs. machine translation?  And (c) How can machine translation be augmented to improve communication?  We investigated these questions through a combination of interviews and surveys, controlled laboratory studies, and the development and evaluation of tools that use additional representations of meaning, such as pictures, to smooth gaps in machine translation.     Intellectual contributions:  The project had three key sets of contributions.  First, based on field studies, we found that bridging language barriers is a significant challenge to multilingual organizations, even when non-native speakers are very fluent in the common language of the organization. Non-native English speakers often cluster by native language groups during informal activities, reducing opportunities for idea exchange and relationship development across language boundaries.  Second, based on laboratory studies, we found that machine translation (MT) tools are a feasible way to facilitate communication between native and non-native English speakers because they make it easier for non-native speakers to express their ideas.  At the same time, MT alone is not sufficient for communication because MT output is often hard to interpret due to translation errors.  Third, we developed and evaluated several tools to make MT more useful for virtual organizations by adding information to the MT output to help people understand the messages despite the translation errors.   For example, one tool automatically highlighted key words in a translated message and another associated pictures with the text.  Both of these tools led to better comprehension of MT-mediated messages in conversations between native and non-native English speakers.     Broader impacts: The project will have societal impact by providing insights for virtual organizations seeking to maximize the benefits of a globally distributed workforce.  Global organizations can use our MT tools to facilitate strong working relationships between speakers of different native languages and to enable all members to contribute fully to the efficiency and competitiveness of the organization. The project also contributed new findings and methods to information science, computer science and related fields.  The data, materials, results and computer code from the research have been made freely available to other researchers. Finally, the project had educational impact by providing interdisciplinary STEM training for five graduate students and six undergraduate students.
