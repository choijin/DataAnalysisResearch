<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PI will conduct laboratory measurements of the ages and chemical compositions of lunar impact glass samples obtained by the Apollo astronauts. At least 30 samples will be analyzed, using X-ray spectroscopy to determine the abundances of silicon, titanium, aluminum, chromium, iron, manganese, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium, and using the laser step-heating argon-40/argon-39 method to determine the age. By combining chronological and geochemical data, the PI plans to constrain the number and distribution of impacts that formed the impact glasses found at each Apollo landing site, and thereby elucidate the impact history of the Moon. She will assess the evidence for a large impact or increased rate of impacts 800 million years ago, and examine whether lunar impacts can be associated with terrestrial mass extinctions. Conducting this research at an undergraduate institution, the PI will train undergraduate students in geochemical laboratory techniques and the use of extraterrestrial samples.</AbstractNarration>
