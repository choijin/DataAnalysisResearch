<AbstractNarration>Large relatively high-elevation surfaces with low relief are common on&lt;br/&gt;the continents. Such uplifts have a significant impact on the geological &lt;br/&gt;record by influencing drainage networks and sediment supply, on climate by modifying&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric circulation, and on biogeography and the biota. Work in geodynamics has&lt;br/&gt;shown that such uplifts amount to a telling signature of mantle dynamics. Thus, they&lt;br/&gt;provide a means to discriminate among hypotheses about how the continental lithosphere&lt;br/&gt;and the deeper mantle interact through processes that result in uplift and mass transfer in&lt;br/&gt;continental interiors. The Hangay Dome in central Mongolia provides an excellent and&lt;br/&gt;accessible laboratory to investigate these processes and determine the degree to which&lt;br/&gt;mantle upwelling, mafic underplating, lithospheric foundering or plume activity have&lt;br/&gt;been important agents in its uplift. This five-year project proposes to use the Hangay&lt;br/&gt;Dome as such a laboratory to coordinate studies of both the structure and state of the&lt;br/&gt;lithosphere and the sublithospheric mantle as well as the history of surface uplift and&lt;br/&gt;landscape evolution. The project will involve observations and measurements made using&lt;br/&gt;broadband seismology, basalt and xenolith petrology and geochemistry, 40Ar/39Ar&lt;br/&gt;geochronology, stable-isotope and vesicular-basalt paleoaltimetry, geomorphology and&lt;br/&gt;10Be geochronology, molecular genetics of divergent fish populations, and U-Th/He and&lt;br/&gt;4He/3He thermochronology.  The Hangay Dome?s widespread exposures of basaltic lavas,&lt;br/&gt;which were erupted over the past 30 Ma across a broad range of elevations, will be key to&lt;br/&gt;the integration of all these data.  Dating of the basalts will enable linkage of petrologic data&lt;br/&gt;bearing on basalt genesis and the nature of the Hangay-Dome mantle with studies that&lt;br/&gt;use the lavas as time markers for documenting landscape evolution and the history of&lt;br/&gt;surface uplift.</AbstractNarration>
