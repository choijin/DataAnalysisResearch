<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish all belong to Cnidaria, a group of animals characterized by the ability to produce stinging cells.  These cells contain capsules (called nematocysts) with an attached tubule packaged inside.  The tubule is ejected upon stimulation, revealing spines and releasing venom. The nematocyst is one of the most complicated structures produced by any cell, and its discharge is one of the fastest biological reactions. Nematocysts are fundamentally important to the biology of the animals that bear them being used in food capture, defense, and attachment to substrates. The morphology of these structures varies considerably across the group but we currently lack understanding of what this variation means.  Similar nematocyst morphologies might have evolved multiple times to perform similar functions, or they might simply be inherited from a common ancestor.  The complexity of nematocyst structure and their centrality to the biology of cnidarians makes the evolution of these structures a key question for understanding the evolution of cell structures and of cnidarians.    My work documents the diversity of nematocyst morphology and interprets this diversity in an evolutionary framework.  I seek to understand if related cnidarian species have similar nematocyst morphologies and to do so requires the collection of live animals.  The East Asian and Pacific Summer Institutes fellowship allowed me to focus on collecting sea anemones (Actiniaria) to survey the diversity of nematocyst morphologies within this group.  I worked with Professor Jun-Im Song at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.  Prof. Song is the leading authority on cnidarian diversity in Korea and has an active fieldwork component of her research therefore she was best possible host to help me plan and carry out collection trips.  During my time in S. Korea, I participated in three field trips (to Jakyakdo, Yeongjong Island, and Jeju Island).  I was able to collect 11 species of sea anemones from a diversity of habitats (rocky intertidal, mudflat, and subtidal).  Time not spent collecting was focused on processing the samples for microscope work, (both light and electron) some of which was done in Korea, but the majority will be done at my home institution (Ohio State University).     Further work in identifying the unknown sea anemones has revealed that one is a Diadumene species (most likely Diadumene lighti, further work will confirm the species).  This is a new species record not only for S. Korea, but also for Asia therefore this project has directly increased our understanding of Asian biodiversity.  This Diadumene species also has a distinctive nematocyst morphology that is rare; therefore data collected from this sample will increase our understanding of nematocyst morphology and provide new information on the evolution of these complex structures.  Data from other sea anemones collected in Korea has already been submitted in a manuscript focused on understanding the distribution and evolution of a single nematocyst feature across all of Cnidaria.  Further work on these samples will provide the morphological information to look at evolution of nematocyst morphologies among closely related species.
