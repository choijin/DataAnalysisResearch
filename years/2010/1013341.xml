<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;02 June 2010&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1013341&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON)&lt;br/&gt;PI:   J. Malbrough&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI:  D. Guidry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests funding for a fleet-wide group purchase of wire monitoring hardware and software to bring nine (9) vessels in the US academic research vessel fleet into compliance with Appendix A, of the Research Vessel Safety Standards (RVSS), March 2009 including the R/V PELICAN.  Appendix A of the RVSS specifies minimum requirements for cable monitoring systems (tension recording and display rates, alarms, etc.) in order for the vessel to meet specific Safe Working Load (SWL) criteria; the lower the SWL, the more stringent the requirements.  SWL requirements for oceanographic wires and cable are lower than standards used ashore in order to meet science equipment deployment requirements particularly at full ocean depths.  This group purchase will improve safety and enhance science support capability by ensuring oceanographic wire monitoring systems are in compliance with the current safety standards and latest available technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The R/V PELICAN supports federally funded scientific research in the Gulf of Mexico in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, open house events, educational cruises, and involvement in the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center which is an intern-based training program for marine technicians.  The ships included in this group purchase support hundreds of NSF sponsored days in 2010.</AbstractNarration>
