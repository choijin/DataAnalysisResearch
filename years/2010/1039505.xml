<AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program is for the acquisition of a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner  to be housed at Rutgers University main campus in Newark in the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience. It will be available to researchers from all three Rutgers campuses (Newark, New Brunswick, and Camden) as well as to those from nearby institutions, especially New Jersey Institute of Technology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and the Kessler Foundation Research Center.  The scanner will allow work to proceed on investigating brain-behavior relationships. The specific questions addressed are organized around six clusters of research: 1) neuroeconomics, 2) learning, memory, and plasticity, 3) human development, 4) perception and sensation, 5) mechanisms of mental illness, and 6) computational neuroimaging. The overarching theme that links the clusters is that they all broadly relate to the learning sciences.</AbstractNarration>
