<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;This is a new Science Master's degree Program in Quantitative Fisheries and Resource Economics that is designed and managed in consultation with state and federal agencies. The goal of the project is to enhance the preparation and increase the graduation of students in two areas where there is a critical need for experts in the U.S. to manage fisheries resources.  This innovative program prepares graduates with the knowledge, quantitative, communication, and leadership skills required for careers in natural resources, with a focus on fisheries management and conservation. Graduates will have completed 37 or 38 credit hours, including a non-thesis project of three credit hours as part of their internship experience. They will also have completed a 3-month internship at a government agency or a consulting firm.  The program offers courses online and in the evening and weekend.  The curriculum includes courses that enhance students' communication and leadership skills, courses in resource economics, and a curriculum in fisheries science that includes courses essential for training fisheries scientists.  These courses will be made available to other graduate students at University of Maryland Eastern Shore and to other institutions. The program is broadening participation in science through the recruitment and training of talented U.S. citizens, including underrepresented minority groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this NSF funded project was to enhance the training and graduation of students, including underrepresented minority groups, in fish population dynamics and resource economics, two areas where there is a critical need for experts in the U.S. to manage our fisheries resources. This collaborative program between NOAA and the Living Marine Resources Cooperative Science Center (LMRCSC) at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) was designed to provide students with the knowledge, quantitative, communication and leadership skills required to obtain careers in natural resources, with a focus on fisheries ecology, management and conservation.  Twelve (12) students were recruited into the PSM program, including two employees of NOAA or a NOAA contractor.  Several quantitative fisheries and resource economics courses were developed, and offered on-line in real time, using web-based distance learning instructional tools, to students enrolled in the UMES Professional Science MasterÆs degree program (PSM) in quantitative fisheries and resource economics and Marine Estuarine and Environmental Science (MEES) graduate programs.   The program has provided several training and professional development opportunities to the students.  In addition to completing coursework, students gained valuable internship experiences at various agencies, particularly NOAA Laboratories.  Students prepared reports based on their internship research work, and presented their results to faculty and students at a seminar organized during the fall semester at UMES.  Some of the PSM students participated in research cruises aboard NOAA Vessels; others presented results of research conducted during summer internships at professional scientific meetings.  A number of PSM students also assisted in hands-on outreach activities in marine and fisheries science to K-12 students, from Maryland Eastern Shore schools, that visited UMES.  In addition to students who are enrolled MEES graduate degree programs at UMES, several graduate students in the fisheries and wildlife program at Delaware State University have benefitted from the courses developed and offered as part of the PSM program.              Six of the PSM students have completed their degree programs in quantitative fisheries.  One of them is currently working as a Stock Assessment scientist at the Atlantic States Fisheries Management Council.  Another PSM graduate is working for NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office, Annapolis, MD as a Fisheries Biologist, whereas a third graduate has continued to work for NOAA Woods Hole Lab., MA as a Fisheries biologist. Thus, graduates from the program are helping to meet the staff needs of NOAA NMFS, and other agencies such as the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in order to manage effectively the nation's fisheries resources.
