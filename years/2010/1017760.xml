<AbstractNarration>This project develops a geometric approach to the P vs. NP problem, called geometric complexity theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The P vs. NP problem is the foundational conjecture of mathematical sciences, which says that theorem proving cannot be automated. Geometric complexity theory (GCT) is an approach to this and related problems via algebraic geometry and representation theory. This approach reduces variants of these problems over the field of complex numbers to the problem of proving existence of obstructions, which are objects in algebraic geometry and representation theory that serve as proof certificates of hardness in the lower bound problems under consideration. The existence of these obstructions is deeply connected with certain positivity hypotheses in algebraic geometry and representation theory. The goal of this project is to study this connection between hardness in complexity theory and positivity in mathematics in depth and thereby extend the approach further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the boundary between the tractable and intractable problems in science and engineering depends on the P vs. NP problem, the study undertaken in this proposal is of central intellectual relevance to complexity theory as well as several other areas of science and engineering. Furthermore, since GCT reveals a deep connection between the P vs. NP and related problems in complexity theory and fundamental positivity problems in pure mathematics, this study could lead to extensive collaboration between complexity theory and several branches mathematics, such as algebraic geometry and representation theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Geometric complexity theory (GCT) is an approach to the fundamental lower bound problems of complexity theory via algebraic geometry and representation theory. The project funded by this NSF grant focused on the algebraic variant of the P vs. NP problem called the VP vs. VNP problem.     Perhaps the most important outcome of this project during the funding period was the discovery of the essential equivalence between the fundamental problems of complexity theory and algebraic geometry, namely, the problem of black-box derandomization of   polynomial identity testing in complexity theory and the problem of derandomization of  Noether's Normalization Lemma (NNL)  for explicit varieties in algebraic geometry. This equivalence also reveals the existing EXPSPACE vs. P gap in the complexity of derandomizing NNL for explicit varieties, called the GCT chasm. This  may be thought of as the common cause and measure  of the difficulty of these fundamental problems in Geometry and Complexity Theory.   The project also showed that NNL can be quasi-derandomized unconditionally for some exceptional explicit varieties. One such example is the variety associated with the ring of invariants for  any finite dimensional  representation of the special linear group of constant dimension. A key ingredient in this proof shows that a succinct encoding in the form of a symbolic determinant  of a set of  (exponentially many) generators for this invariant ring can be constructed in polynomial time.   This  invariant ring  was the focus of Hilbert's celebrated paper in 1893, wherein Noether's Normalization Lemma  was proved  to show constructively that this ring is finitely generated. This showed then that the problem of constructing a set of generators for this invariant ring is computable. Now, as shown in this project, this problem, allowing succinct encoding, is in P. Thus there has been a rather remarkable change in  the status of this fundamental problem of invariant theory over  the course of a century from a problem that was not even known to be computable  before Hilbert to a problem that is now in P,   as shown in this project.   Another noteworthy  outcome of this project is the recent work of the PI with C. Ikenmeyer and M. Walter. This work took a concrete step towards proving existence of representation-theoretic obstructions as needed in the GCT approach to the VP vs. VNP conjecture. The proof of this result yields results of independent interest concerning the complexity of fundamental quantities in representation theory, called Kronecker coefficients. The first such result is  that the problem of deciding positivity of Kronecker coefficients is NP-hard. The second result  gives the first known instance of a positive  formula for a subclass of Kronecker coefficients whose positivity is NP-hard to decide. This takes a concrete step towards the outstanding classical problem in representation theory of finding a positive formula for Kronecker coefficients akin to the well known Littlewood-Richardson rule.   Overall, this project has thus revealed  deep connections among  three areas in physical sciences, namely, complexity theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory. It  has also led to substantial advances in these three fields based on these connections.                Last Modified: 08/19/2015       Submitted by: Ketan Mulmuley]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
