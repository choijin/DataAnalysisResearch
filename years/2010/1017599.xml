<AbstractNarration>OSSD is a scientific membership society with a mission to enhance the knowledge of the biological basis of sex/gender differences by facilitating interdisciplinary communication and collaboration among basic scientists and clinical scientists from diverse backgrounds. The main objectives of the Annual Meeting are to: 1) advance the understanding of sex differences throughout the organism; 2) explore the role of biological sex differences across the lifespan; 3) highlight research from top scientists in a variety of biological fields; 4) facilitate the establishment of collaborations among national and international scientists who are interested in the molecular, genetic and hormonal bases of biological sex differences; and 5) grow the scientific community interested and involved in sex differences research by encouraging and supporting the participation of New Investigators who will present talks and posters. Importantly, this grant will support the travel expenses for four New Investigators whose research will be highlighted on the opening day of the conference in the Elizabeth Young New Investigator Symposium. Presenters will gain experience in preparing and delivering a talk at an international meeting. This opportunity should lead to enhanced career opportunities for the New Investigators as well as provide an incentive for other trainees.  Additionally, the OSSD is committed to rewarding students and post-doctoral trainees for their intellectual involvement in the field of sex differences.  Travel and Poster Awards are given based on the scientific merit of the research, the effectiveness of the presentation, and the role of the trainee in initiating and carrying out the research. The symposia and poster presentations will enhance the knowledge of those studying sex-based biological differences by highlighting new discoveries and by facilitating communication and knowledge-sharing among diverse fields of study.</AbstractNarration>

The broad variety of topics addressed at the meeting attracts scientists from different disciplines who would not normally attend conferences together. OSSD facilitates an interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and has resulted in new avenues of research and collaborative opportunities among the participants. The participation of new investigators in a New Investigator Symposium and as poster presenters is encouraged vigorously and was supported by the grant from the National Science Foundation.  Thus, our goals for this conference were:  - to provide a forum for intense discussion of the major issues related to the function of sex differences throughout the body.  -  to use the topic of "sex differences" to serve as a common denominator for the promotion of interactions among people working in a wide variety of areas and levels of analysis.   - to actively promote the integration of junior investigators, particularly women and members of under-represented minority groups.  The OSSD has a commitment to training and promoting new investigators in the field of sex differences research.  In the New Investigator Symposium, four outstanding post-docs (2 men, 2 women) presented their research.  This symposium was sponsored by the NSF grant:  Dena B.
