<AbstractNarration>Many insects have bacterial symbionts that live within their cells and are transmitted from mother to offspring in the egg. This project studies the role of such a symbiosis involving a bacterial symbiont, Rickettsia, in adaptation of a host, the invasive sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci, which is an important agricultural pest. The symbiont has increased dramatically in Arizona, from 1% to 97% of whitefly individuals infected, over just six years. The research team will integrate observational, experimental and molecular approaches to understand why the symbiont spread so effectively. The research will improve understanding of how the spread of the symbiont occurred, of the consequences to the host of having the symbiont, and of how these consequences vary with genetic and environmental characteristics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interactions of intracellular symbionts and their hosts are potentially important as sources of rapid and long-term adaptation. Acquisition of a symbiont represents a virtually instant adaptation of the host insects. Because the bacteria are inherited, they become a part of the extended genome of their insect hosts, and the insect biology may be permanently altered, for example making a serious agricultural pest like the sweetpotato whitefly more invasive. The knowledge gained by this research may be used to improve pest management or to develop techniques that support beneficial insects.  This project also will develop and implement a curriculum supplement on symbiosis and insect biology for middle school classrooms and includes undergraduate research opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ About 75% of animals are insects, and insects have relationships with microbes that shape their evolution and biology. Many insects are inhabited by bacteria that live within their cells ("intracellular symbionts") and these bacteria are transmitted only vertically, i.e. from a mother insect host to her offspring. Because the bacteria are not transmitted contagiously ("horizontally") like many pathogens we know, these symbionts often have intimate, long-term evolutionary relationships with their hosts.  In some cases the symbionts benefit their insect hosts by producing nutritional or defensive products that the hosts use.  In others, these symbionts manipulate the hostsÆ reproduction to cause them to produce more females.  The production of more female hosts benefit the bacteria because they are transmitted only by females, and causes the symbionts to spread in a host population.   We studied the interactions of an intracellular symbiont in the genus Rickettsia with its host, the invasive and world wide crop pest, the sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci.  Whiteflies are minute, sap-feeding insects, and cause damage by direct feeding, sap secretion and by transmitting plant viruses. We witnessed a rapid increase in the proportion of whiteflies in the southwestern USA that bore the Rickettsia bacterium, and in the laboratory we found that whiteflies that bore Rickettsia produced more offspring, developed faster, survived better to adulthood, and produced a significantly greater number of female progeny.

In ongoing work we are interested in understanding what factors determine the net benefit of the symbiont to the whitefly host.   The broader impacts of this project were many.  In the course of the project, 4 undergraduate students at the University of Arizona were employed and assisted in the research, three of them from underrepresented groups.
