<AbstractNarration>This project lies at the intersection of dynamics, geometry, number theory, probability theory, and the theory of Lie groups. It centers on the dynamics of group actions on parameter spaces of geometric objects. The particular focuses of the study are the space of lattices in Euclidean space and flat structures on higher-genus surfaces. These projects are inspired by comparing and contrasting these two types of dynamics and geometry. This has been a fruitful approach for the PI and many other researchers, who have found that results in one setting can be translated to the other, and that this process yields insights to both sets of problems. Another common thread is the use of probabilistic language and machinery; in particular using random walks to model and study various flows on these spaces, and also attempting to understand the properties of a `random object' in a parameter space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hoped that these projects will instigate interdisciplinary collaborations and uncover deeper connections between seemingly disparate areas of mathematics. Several of the problems can be stated in very simple, accessible form, and offer a gateway to several important areas of modern mathematics, including dynamical systems, geometry, and number theory. As such, these problems provide mentoring opportunities at several levels, from postdoctoral fellows, to PhD students, to undergraduates, to high school students and teachers. The study of flat surfaces has significant concrete applications to the dynamics of interacting particles, and other important physical systems. The study of lattices and their deformations is important to understanding the structure of crystals, packing problems, and in materials sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The time evolution of simple physical systems can lead to highly complex behavior: for example, an (idealized) billiard ball bouncing around a frictionless square can either return to where it starts (periodic behavior), or it spreads completely evenly all over the table (equidistribution).  An important tool in the study of these systems is renormalization. In this setting, this refers to changing the shape of the table by a linear transformation. Approprate transformations speed up the billiard ball and other rotate or shear the table.  The intellectual merit of this project centered around using renormalization dynamics on an appropriate space of flat surfaces to understand statistical phenomenon for linear flows on these surfaces, which model not only billiard flows but also electron transport and flows in porous media.   The set of slopes of flows which exhibit periodic behavior is a countable, dense subset of the real numbers: for example, for the square it coincides with the rational numbers. I studied the distribution of the spacings between these directions, and showed that there is a surprising underlying limiting distribution which reflects the geometry of the original surface.   Several tools in renormalization dynamics and the geometry of the space of surfaces (and lattices), of independent interest, were developed to study these phenomena, in particular trying to formulate the correct notion of a random surface/lattice and to understand properties of these random objects.  The broader impacts of this project are twofold: one, the physical systems that can be studied using these models are often of interest in applications, and in particular we are developing future projects to understand the structual design of Lithium-ion batteries based on the study of moduli spaces of flat surfaces.  Secondly, the visual and experimental nature of this work makes it a natural gateway to introduce graduate, undergraduate, and even K-12 students to the world of creative and research mathematics, via powerful visuals, animations, and experimenation and self-discovery. As part of this project, I created the Illinois Geometry Lab (IGL) a rapidly-growing organization that facilitates undergraduate research and public engagement with mathematics.
