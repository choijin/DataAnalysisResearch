<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the second edition of the Conference on Modeling High Frequency Data. This year the conference is a joint effort between Stevens Institute of Technology, University of Texas at El Paso and Purdue University. The purpose of the conference is to improve the models used to analyze data sampled with high frequency. Tools available from a variety of areas such as statistics, stochastic processes, statistical mechanics, clustering, and systems will be exposed. Academics, industry professionals, and government regulators will meet to collaborate, with the goal of advancing the quality of research currently under development in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific motivation for the conference arises from the fact that organizing a conference in the trade capital of the world has the potential of bringing together the best mathematicians, practitioners and regulators to help develop and better the modeling aspect of the marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main training objective of this meeting is to expose today's economic and modeling problems to current graduate students in the hope that this will improve the quality of their research problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The conference discussed topics of interest for researchers industry and regulators concerning analysis and models for data sampled with high frequency in finance.  The objectives of this conference were to improve the models used to analyze high-frequency financial data. Specifically the participants met:   to collaborate, with the goal of advancing the quality of research currently under development in the field, to exchange information about practical applications of data modeling to algorithmic trading and high frequency trading, to open doors for future collaboration and networking    In particular the conference discussed market micro-structure theory, empirical research to assess the feasibility of the constructed models, understand trading rules that may be imposed to the market to avoid market destabilization.   There were over 100 participants at the conference and the talks were very diverse and presenting a multitude of interesting topics.   In addition to the conference itself a volume containg a collection of articles related to the topic of the conference will be published by Wiley soon in their Handbook series: "The Handbook of High Frequency data modeling in Finance". All of the papers published in this volume are from participants of the conference and without the NSF support this publication would not have been possible.  Furthermore another publication (a special issue of the prestigious Quantitative Finance Journal) is planned for 2011.  The organizers of the conference wish to thank the National Science Foundation, the organization which provided the starting and the largest support for the conference. Without your help the conference would not have been possible. The number of participants would have been greatly reduced and the quality of the talks would have suffered by not being able to support people coming from the western coast or abroad.
