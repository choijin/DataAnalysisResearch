<AbstractNarration>In this International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Paul J. Chirik, Princeton University, U.S. and Karl E. Wieghart, Max Planck Institute for Bioinorganic Chemistry, MÃ¼lheim, Germany collaborate in a joint effort to understand the electronic structure of base metal compounds with redox-active bis(imino)pyridine ligands that find application in catalysis, small molecule activation and group (and atom) transfer processes. Specifically, the team will focus on the synthesis of iron, manganese and cobalt oxo and nitride compounds that may offer new hydrogenation, C-H activation, and group transfer chemistries of relevance to organic synthesis and alternative energy schemes. Longer term efforts will move beyond the bis(imino)pyridine ligand scaffolds and into new supporting architectures for base metal catalysis, photochemical water splitting and light harvesting technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precious metals such as platinum, rhodium and iridium have found widespread application in catalysis; however these metals, much like petroleum, are scarce natural resources. The use of base metal catalysts, such as those used in this work, may enable new technologies which are less influenced by shortages and political instabilities in the supply chain. The collaboration combines the expertise in synthesis and catalysis (Chirik) with spectroscopy and theory (Weighart) to give members of both groups a broad perspective into science as well as the culture of their partner institution and country. This collaboration also provides new opportunities for scientific outreach and student education including: access to summer schools in high field EPR, resonance Raman and MCD spectroscopy and the creation of freely distributable web-based programs and tutorials for the handling and fitting of spectroscopic and magnetic data. Researchers on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean are involved in engaging women in the sciences through the "Expanding Your Horizons" program in the U.S. and the "Girls Day at the Institute" program in Germany. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DFG will provide support funds for the German investigators while the NSF will support the U.S. efforts.</AbstractNarration>
