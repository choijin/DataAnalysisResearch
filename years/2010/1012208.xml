<AbstractNarration>Data Protection laws that exempt data that is not individually&lt;br/&gt;identifiable have led to an explosion in anonymization research.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, how well current de-identification and anonymization&lt;br/&gt;techniques control risks to privacy and confidentiality is not well&lt;br/&gt;understood.  Neither is the usefulness of anonymized data for real-world&lt;br/&gt;applications.  The project addresses anonymization on three fronts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Textual data, even when explicit identifiers are removed (names,&lt;br/&gt;dates, locations), can contain highly identifiable information.  For&lt;br/&gt;example, a sample of chief complaint fields from the Indiana Network&lt;br/&gt;for Patient Care (INPC) found several instances of "phantom limb&lt;br/&gt;pain".  Amputees can be visually identifiable, but the HIPAA Safe&lt;br/&gt;Harbor rules do not list this as "identifying information".  Any&lt;br/&gt;policy explicitly listing all types of identifying data is likely to&lt;br/&gt;fail.  Through a joint effort with computer science and linguistics,&lt;br/&gt;the project is developing new methods to remove specific details from&lt;br/&gt;text while preserving meaning, eliminating such highly identifiable&lt;br/&gt;information without a priori knowledge of what would be identifying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Current anonymization research is based on unproven measures of&lt;br/&gt;identifiability.  Through a re-identification challenge on synthetic&lt;br/&gt;data (but based on real healthcare data), the project is evaluating&lt;br/&gt;the efficacy of these measures.  Interdisciplinary teams of students&lt;br/&gt;are given challenge problems - anonymized data with hypothetical&lt;br/&gt;healthcare data - and asked to make (hypothetical) inferences about&lt;br/&gt;health information of individuals.  The results can be used to&lt;br/&gt;calibrate the effectiveness of different anonymization measures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) The utility of anonymized data has been a concern among research:&lt;br/&gt;Does anonymized data provide credible research results?  By partnering&lt;br/&gt;with healthcare studies at the Kinsey Institute and Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;School of Nursing, the project is comparing analyses on original data&lt;br/&gt;with analyses on anonymized data, and evaluating the impact of types&lt;br/&gt;of anonymization on research results.  A related issue is determining&lt;br/&gt;the impact on data collection: Are individuals more candid in their&lt;br/&gt;responses if they know data will be anonymized?  Outcomes are broadening&lt;br/&gt;the scope of research that can be performed on anonymized data, while&lt;br/&gt;ensuring that researchers know when access to individually identifiable&lt;br/&gt;data (with attendant restrictions and safeguards) is needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through these tasks, the project is advancing our ability to utilize&lt;br/&gt;the wealth of data we now collect for the benefit of society, while&lt;br/&gt;ensuring individual privacy is protected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL:&lt;br/&gt;http://projects.cerias.purdue.edu/TextAnon</AbstractNarration>
