<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on measuring the absolute cross section of the charge transfer between H/D atom and H2+ (and the isotopic systems HD+ and D2+) with the merged-beams apparatus at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which has been recently made available for molecular ion investigations after being used for atomic ion measurements for years. The target cross section range for these measurements is meV/u to keV/u, which is known to be a very difficult region to investigate both experimentally and theoretically. The emphasis will be more on low collision energies where the collision time is long enough to sample rovibrational modes and to allow charge transfer via nuclear substitution. The results will have important impacts on our understanding of the collision dynamics and will provide important information for various disciplines such as fundamental physics, plasma (laboratory and astrophysical) physics, biophysics, etc. For instance, the entire spectrum which is still missing in the literature to this day is necessary for the modeling of high density-low temperature plasmas as found in cold divertor regions of a fusion tokamak. Also, the measurement will be used to benchmark theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic research supported by this work will contribute a significant incremental experimental progress in fundamental physics. It will generate interest on the part of theorists from different areas. Beyond its scientific implications, the close involvement of undergraduate students from Pacific Union College, a primarily undergraduate institution where PI is a faculty member at, will be of significant value. The project has a rich educational component and would extend a collaboration of PI with the Physics division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The experiments address experimental physics problems of different levels. Some, such as incorporating more sophisticated statistical analysis in the current data acquisition software, will be very exciting undergraduate level tasks. These students will take part in a state-of-the-art measurement at Oak Ridge National Laboratory; otherwise they would have no other opportunity to directly learn firsthand about physics research. Also, as Pacific Union College consistently ranked in the first places for racial diversity, not including international students, in baccalaureate colleges region, the project will potentially have impacts on the underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project "enabling fundamental charge transfer measurements for molecular ions with atomic H" has revealed some aspects of the rich dynamics of molecular ion charge transfer that is naturally of foremost importance in fundamental physics by involving the smallest of all the molecules and atoms, but is also one of the dominant reactions in plasma environments such as the cold divertor plasma regions of a fusion tokamak or in interstellar clouds where the main constituents are H, H+, and H-molecules.  Using the upgraded ORNL ion-atom merged-beams apparatus, we have performed these measurements in two main regimes: at energies, which are high enough so that the internal energies of the molecular ions are not significant and could be neglected, and consequently the rotational and vibrational motions of the molecular ions could be considered as frozen, and, at lower energies where the collision times would be long enough to sample the ro-vibrational modes. These results constitute new data sets of measured absolute cross sections of charge transfer between H and simple molecular ions in a wide range of collision energies.  The systems that we investigated include (H2+, H) and its isotopic variants, (O2+, D), (CO+, D), and (D3+, H). In particular, we have accomplished low energy measurements on H2+ + H and isotopic variants, which span from 20 eV/u to as low as 0.1 eV/u. As far as we know, there are no other measurements done at these low energies for these systems despite their importance. Around 0.5 eV/u, the measured cross section shows structures that are predicted by a full quantal calculation. However, the calculation was systematically larger (not understood yet). We also participated in the investigation of the inverse of the reaction (H+ + H2 &rarr; H2+ + H) at the Universit&eacute; catholique de Louvain in Belgium.  At the same ORNL facility with the addition of a microcalorimeter from Goddard Space and the University of Wisconsin, we analyzed high resolution x-ray emission spectra following C6+ + Kr collisions whose single electron capture is mimicking C6+ + H. This other way to explore charge transfer led to an important diagnostic tool for analyzing astrophysical plasmas.  The accomplished activity had a tremendous educational impact. A dozen students were regularly participating to the research, using a state-of-the-art experimental apparatus, and benefiting from the supervision of highly qualified researchers at ORNL. Four of them are female students and three others from other groups of minorities in the STEM fields. The number of Physics and Biophysics majors at Pacific Union College tripled since 2011. No doubt this project had made a major contribution to that increase.
