<AbstractNarration>This summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in Mathematics at California State University Channel Islands will support 12 REU students each of three summers. Unique features include a focus on targeting talented students who might not otherwise have considered mathematics as a viable career choice, particularly those from traditionally under-represented groups, with a special emphasis on students who are native Spanish speakers or first-generation college students. Our group of experienced faculty mentors includes several bilingual (Spanish-English) faculty including one from a partner university in Mexico. We expect the emphasis on native Spanish speakers and students from under-represented groups will broaden the pipeline into graduate school and mathematical careers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Students will spend the bulk of their time working on research in groups of size four per faculty mentor. Workshops, distinguished visitors and colloquia, exchanges with another regional REU, and social outings are also included in the activities. Our primary goal is for the student participants to conduct original mathematical research leading to publications. In so doing we wish to raise their levels of mathematical maturity and confidence while fostering an enthusiasm for mathematics. We will create and maintain a research community of mathematicians. We will improve the participants' abilities to communicate mathematics visually, orally, and in written form. We expect students to leave the program better equipped to pursue their mathematical studies as well as feeling excited and prepared to perform graduate-level mathematics in an academic or industrial setting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The major goals of CSU Channel Islands Mathematics REU were:  to provide undergraduates with a rich experience of mathematical research, including exposure to the culture and technical tools of mathematics, to encourage students to consider graduate school in mathematics by providing information, exposure, and support, to provide students with the skills necessary for success in mathematics, such as proof-writing, technical reading, oral and written communication, and to target students with limited research opportunities, especially those who are first in their families to attend college or are native Spanish speakers.

In addition to the focus on research, students participated in weekly events designed to build community and instill mathematical culture. Weekly professional knowledge or skills building workshops and weekly mathematics or mathematical careers seminars further addressed Goals 1 - 3.
