<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science Master's Program in Translational Biotechnology  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master's-level trained scientists are needed within academic institutions and America's growing biotechnology industry. There are many attractive and well paying job opportunities that are integral in supporting product discovery, product development, manufacturing, testing, and commercialization. These activities are foundational for companies, and are increasingly gaining importance in the academic setting where new technologies are being tested in humans prior to entering the commercial sector.  The Science Master's Program in Translational Biotechnology will enable students to acquire expertise in both scientific/engineering and business/managerial knowledge and skills that meet the needs of employers and prepare graduates for employment.  The program brings together disciplines in biosciences and business, and is research intensive with deep industry involvement, including a formal internship.  Through this innovative program, the graduate-level curriculum will provide graduates with additional career options, and will create a pathway for displaced and unemployed/underemployed workers for re-training and skill development that can be applied to this high-skill high-wage industry. Talented US citizens will be recruited into this graduate program, educated and trained with knowledge and skills that are highly sought by industry, and placed into full-time employment.  When hired by companies and research institutes, the graduates of the Science Master's Program in Translational Biotechnology will facilitate the development of new therapeutic products, promote economic development, and improve the well being of our citizens.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Science MasterÆs Program in Translational Biotechnology    MasterÆs-level trained scientists are needed within academic institutions and AmericaÆs growing biotechnology industry, in which many attractive and well paying job opportunities exist. Translational Biotechnology includes the development of products such as drugs, biopharmaceuticals, biologics, medical devices, and diagnostics, as well as the processes required to manufacture and test them in support of clinical trials, FDA approval, regulatory compliance, and subsequent commercialization. These activities are foundational for companies, and are increasingly gaining importance in the academic setting where new technologies are being tested in humans prior to entering the commercial sector.  To address this need, the University of FloridaÆs Science MasterÆs Program in Translational Biotechnology was designed to include an interdisciplinary curriculum in science and business that is research intensive, has deep industry involvement, has cutting edge courses, and includes a formal internship at a company; thus enabling students to acquire expertise in both science and business-based knowledge and skills highly sought by industry.  This innovative program has provided graduates with expanded career options in both industry and academia.        In addition, the program has led to broader impacts, serving as a catalyst for building the infrastructure to support FloridaÆs growing biotechnology-based industry.  By solidifying our network of educators and businesses to enhance educational and employment opportunities, we have been able to recruit talented students into the program and provide them with knowledge and skills that traditionally have not been implemented in graduate-level science education.  Students in the program have conducted research in the fields of applied oncology, neuroscience, virology, nephrology, opthomology, and metabolic diseases.  Graduates of the SMP  in Translational Biotechnology have been hired into a broad range of positions which include managers of regulatory affairs, quality control associates, product marketing specialists, process development specialists, and research scientists.  As employees in FloridaÆs companies and research institutes, these graduates will facilitate the development of new therapeutic products, promote economic development, and improve the well-being of our citizens.
