<AbstractNarration>The proposers will investigate the origins of high-energy solar energetic particles (SEPs) using data collected from the space-based cosmic-ray detector named the "Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics" or PAMELA. This instrument was successfully launched on a Russian spacecraft by European partners in 2006 and is expected to remain operational until at least the beginning of 2012. PAMELA measures SEPs in the same energy range as the ground level events (GLEs) measured by ground-based neutron monitors, while covering lower energies as well. PAMELA thereby bridges the gap between low energy in situ SEP observations from spacecraft and ground-based observations of GLEs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By addressing the important scientific problem of the origin of SEPs, this project will provide information that will improve space weather forecasts and enhance our ability to predict charged particle radiation doses to satellites, astronauts, and flight crews. This effort will forge international collaborations with the European and Russian designers of the PAMELA instrument, and provide US scientists access to a very unique and extensive data set that has previously been unavailable to the US community. In addition, two PhD students will be recruited at the University of New Hampshire and at New Mexico State University to work on this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Sun produces very energetic particles that reach Earth.  A debate has raged as to whether those particle episodes that can be measured from the ground are of the same family as those that can only be measured in space.  The question arises because the particles energies are much different in general and their arrival times are for those measured on the ground are more bunched.  The major finding of this work demonstrates that there is a smooth continuum spanning all types of energetic particle episodes and the ones detected on the ground are simply at the extreme end of a larger population of episodes that are measured in space.  Furthermore, the PAMELA data have revealed that the distribuion of particle energies obey the same form, with the ground detected events being simply the most energetic.  The project has also supported the operation of some critical instruments on the ground, so-called neutron monitors.  These devcies measured the solar energetic particles well before the space age.  These instruments are critical to understanding and interpreting the high-energy particle data obtained in space, because it is difficult for a space instrument to measure the full range of energetic particles.  To do the best job of studying these particles one needs a full complement of instrumentation, both in space and on the ground.  Thus, these neutron monitors must be located at a variety of places around the globe to always be in position to measure the particles.  The National Science Foundation has supported these instruments for many years.       Last Modified: 07/19/2018       Submitted by: James M Ryan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
