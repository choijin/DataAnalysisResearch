<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;The Professional Applied and Computational Mathematics program is a collaborative Science Masters Program offered by Buffalo State College and its business partners. The program is educating graduate students for careers in emerging fields that demand a new type of workforce with solid and in-depth background in applied and computational mathematics, as well as effective business and communication skills. This program uses graduate faculty with demonstrated records to educate students in both the classroom and the workplace.  This faculty has created a carefully designed and extremely thorough curriculum that includes 9-credits in each the topics of (1) data analysis, (2) mathematical modeling, and (3) business and communication skills.  As part of the program students also complete a 3-credit internship.  The core courses are broken into 1-credit modules, which are easy to be upgraded or replaced and include "real world" case studies. The research and internship experiences provide students opportunity to analyze and solve "real world" problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the program includes (1) increasing the participation of female students and students from under-represented minorities in graduate studies in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics disciplines and (2) preparing graduate students for careers in business, industry, non-profit organizations, and government agencies with a strong foundation in applied and computational mathematics, as well as business and communication skills, to succeed in those careers that demand a broadly inclusive, well-trained science and engineering workforce.</AbstractNarration>

For instance:  Students      from other graduate programs have taken our Project Management for Math      and Science Professionals course. Math      majors in our graduate program now have Math Education (existing for many      years) and PACM as a choice. From      our relationships with businesses, students in the sciences and      mathematics will have more opportunities to learn about the use of      mathematics in the real world and jobs available.
