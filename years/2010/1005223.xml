<AbstractNarration>An REU Site award has been made to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in partnership with the Desert Research Institute.  The award will allow the institution to provide research training for 12 students in a ten-week summer program, beginning 2011 through 2013. At least three students will participate in an international collaborative research program between the School of Life Sciences and Tongji University (Shanghai). The aim of the REU program is to engage students in challenging, stimulating and formative research projects that combine the fields of molecular biology and microbiology, in order to address current questions in environmental science, ecology and evolution.  The environment of the southwest provides an excellent study in environmental microbiology, with the presence of hot springs and transient water systems, and the environmental stress that microbes are exposed to. In addition to the research training, students will participate in enrichment activities that will prepare them for future careers in science. Activities are scheduled weekly during the entire program, which include sessions on research design and analysis, report writing and presentation, ethics and the responsible conduct of research, and effective scientific communication. The recruitment strategy includes effective ways to reach out to all undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups. Student participants will conduct their research under the supportive supervision of faculty mentors. At the end of the program, students will complete a written research paper and make an oral presentation of their work at the undergraduate research symposium. The program will use an online assessment tool for evaluating the success of the program. More information is available at http://sols.unlv.edu/reu_main.html, or by contacting Kurt Regner (kurt.regner@UNLV.edu) or Eduardo Robleto (Eduardo.robleto@unlv.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The REU Site: A Broad View of Environmental Microbiology at UNLV (DBI 0649267 &amp; 1005223, Æ07-Æ14), was the first and only biology REU program in Nevada.  The primary goal of this REU Site was to provide undergraduates with hypothesis-based projects that would promote science careers and graduate programs.   Student projects focused on microorganisms from diverse habitats such as hot springs, the deep terrestrial subsurface, hypersaline lakes, arid soils and ephemeral water sources. Students also explored the mechanisms of magnetotaxis, sporulation, soil-forming processes, microbial adaptation to stressful and non-host environments. The combined grants funded 78 students mentored by 15 UNLV and 3 Desert Research Institute scientists.   In order to encourage the transition from student to apprentice scientist, each participant attended presentations on research ethics, science careers and best practices for applying to graduate programs. Every REU participant presented his/her data at group lab meetings and prepared a poster for the end of summer research symposium.   Highlights of the UNLV REU program include peer-reviewed publications, awards recognizing research excellence and participants entering science careers.  Summer REU programs are 10-weeks long, but despite this limited time frame 24 participants authored 22 publications,1 book chapter and 10 abstracts for national meetings.  3 REU participants went on to receive prestigious NSF Graduate Research Fellowships; 1 was awarded a Louis Stokes Graduate Fellowship; and another, the American Society for Microbiology Sarber Award recognizing undergraduate research excellence.  A 2014 survey determined that 57% of the program alumni either work in science or entered a graduate program (MS, MPH, PhD) after receiving their baccalaureate degree.  The leadership team recruited members of underrepresented groups in science and 54.4% of the past participants self-identify as American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, African American and Hispanic.  There was also significant representation among women (65%) and students from institutions that do not grant doctoral degrees (52%) including two-year colleges and local high schools. The REU Site received supplemental funds to support summer research experiences for 5 Clark County School District high school teachers and 4 faculty members from institutions lacking a strong research infrastructure.  The teachers worked with a REU mentor, received a stipend and funds to support science education.  Each of the high school teachers spoke to the REU participants about their careers as a science educator.   The visiting faculty conducted collaborative research, co-mentored REU participants and spoke to the summer cohort about their own career path.   The REU Site partnered with the Tengchong PIRE Project (OISE 0968421; PI, B. Hedlund) to sponsor international undergraduate research on the diversity and metabolic processes of microorganisms inhabiting the Rehai geothermal field in western Yunnan Province.
