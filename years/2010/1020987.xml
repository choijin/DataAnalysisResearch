<AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of this project is to understand the regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis.  The yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been an outstanding model system for the study of this biological process.  The primary mechanism for inositol-mediated repression of phospholipid biosynthetic gene expression employs the Opi1p repressor.  Opi1p is tethered in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by association with phosphatidic acid (PA) under derepressing conditions.  In the presence of inositol, PA levels drop and Opi1p translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with the Ino2p activator to repress transcription.  Opi1p was first defined by the identification of overproduction and excretion of inositol (Opi-) mutants.  These mutants are generally associated with constitutive derepressed expression of the phospholipid biosynthetic genes.  The Lopes lab has reported a genomic screen that identified 91 Opi- mutants.  The goal of this project is to define how the Opi- mutants affect regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis.  Dr. Lopes will define the molecular role of each Opi- mutant by testing for several phenotypes.  He will also determine the epistatic relationships between the Opi- mutants.  Lastly, he will identify the Opi1p-independent PA-sensing mechanism.  This research addresses two important biological processes, repression of gene expression and phospholipid biosynthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will serve as a training vehicle for graduate and undergraduate (UG) students.  Dr Lopes has a track record of training UG students, many of whom have been authors on published manuscripts.  The foundation for this project was published in Genetics and co-authored by an UG student.  Many of the Graduate and UG students trained in the Lopes lab are women and members of groups under-represented in science.  The results of the research will appeal to a broad research community and will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals.  Dr. Lopes has a track record of incorporating basic research into courses and genetic experiments in this project will be modules in a senior level undergraduate laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All cells are defined by membranes.  These membranes are composed of phospholipids and proteins.  Our lab has been focused on understanding how phospholipids are made and how their synthesis is regulated.  These studies are conducted in a model organism, yeast, which has been an exceptional proxy for understanding basic biological functions of all eukaryotic cells.  Previous efforts been focused on understanding how different nutrients (inositol and choline) affect expression of phospholipid synthesis genes culminating in different phospholipid compositions.  This regulation is dependent on activator proteins (example: Ino2p and Ino4p) that turn on genes and a repressor protein (example: Opi1p) that turns off genes.  However, there are many other genes that when mutated have similar effects to mutating the activators and/or repressor.  This study was based on the identification of some 200 genes that behave like the OPI1 gene when mutated.  The study identified that these opi mutants have novel effects on expression of phospholipid synthesis genes and on phospholipid composition.  Most notably, the opi mutants revealed new details about the mechanism for the previously understudied growth phase regulation.  Phospholipid synthesis genes in yeast are unusual because their expression is turned off when cells in a culture enter into what is called stationary phase (latest stage of growth).  Many of the opi mutants tested here failed to turn off the phospholipid synthesis genes in stationary phase.  The results support the model that as cells enter into stationary phase they degrade the activators.  Thus, the opi mutants fail to degrade the activators.  These observations provide the foundation for a new area of study towards understanding membrane synthesis.          Last Modified: 11/25/2015       Submitted by: John M Lopes]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
