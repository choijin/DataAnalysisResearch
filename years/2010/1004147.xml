<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project addresses three related research areas: double wall carbon nanotubes, resonance windows in single wall carbon nanotubes, and graphene studies. A systematic resonance Raman study of individual double wall nanotubes is planned along several research directions--complementary studies for the four DWNT configurations to investigate charge transfer behavior and strain effects with an effort to distinguish between the role of each of the mechanisms present in DWNTs. A study of the wall to wall distances associated with the above phenomena will also be investigated. Resonance windows of features in the Raman spectra of SWNTs, paying attention to  effects of the diameter and chiral angle dependence, of each spectral feature, and to the effects that have been revealed for (2n+m) families of M-SWNTs and S-SWNTs. The project also includes collaborative research to improve the synthesis process for CVD large area growth of monolayer, bi-layer and few layer graphene samples. The main tool used to characterize the various graphenes will be the D-band, G-band and G0-band, regarding layer number and structural order, with special emphasis given to interlayer stacking. The behavior of all features in the Raman spectra for CVD grown graphene will be compared with samples produced by the mechanical exfoliation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Systematic Raman studies of CVD graphene will be carried out for samples grown by Jing Kong's group at MIT and annealed at a variety of temperatures in the range 1500-2800Â±C by collaborators Professors M. Endo and Y. A. Kim at Shinshu University in Nagano, Japan. Raman studies of the edges of graphene ribbons will also be carried out in an effort to clearly distinguish the differences between armchair and zigzag edges. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science and condensed matter physics with technological relevance, and is expected to provide unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate training in an interdisciplinary field. This research project is also expected to have broader impacts through the training of women and men leaders in this research field, through the wide dissemination of the findings of this research through invited talks and publications and through the preparation of tutorial review articles to relate the findings of this work together with other state-of-the-art work in this research field. The PI will continue to disseminate advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology to the public through invited talks to general audiences, industrial laboratories and professional societies, as she has done in the past. Her service in holding mentoring sessions for students and postdocs at numerous universities is expected to continue, as is her service to professional societies. This project is co-supported by the DMR Electronic Materials and Condensed Matter Physics Programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recently, it has been shown that graphene can be assembled into designer heterostructures that are made layer-by-layer in any determined sequence [see Fig.1(a)]. These nanostructures inherit some of grapheneÃs unique characteristics and at the same time acquire new features due to nanoscale heterogeneities. As a result, experimentalists become architects who can themselves design the electronic properties of the nanostructure. This has resulted in an emerging research area which has been gaining strength in the last five years under the heading of graphene-based nanostructures. In this study we explored novel structures and the related novel electronic behaviors which emerge in this fashion.  The large number of layered materials that can be exfoliated and combined with graphene opens additional new grand vistas in graphene research. This allows researchers to tune the band structure characteristics and design the current-bias response. As a result, numerous transport behaviors, such as negative differential resistance [1], enhanced photo-response [2] and hysteretic I-V characteristics [3], can be achieved.  In particular, this research has shown that graphene-based heterostructures can host a special kind of photo-response which is distinct from the conventional photovoltaic effect in silicon-based systems [1,2]. The photo-response in such heterostructures originates from the dynamics of photo-generated hot carriers: the power pumped into the system is used to heat electrons, and the temperature differential between the electrons and the lattice drives the electronic current [see Fig. 1(b)]. This configuration unveils a completely new paradigm for sensitive photo-detectors, surpassing ideal internal responsivities of photodetectors based on conventional transport by the photo-voltaic effect. One advantage of vertically stacked graphene nanostructures over typical commercial devices is the substantially simpler and thinner architecture. This also enables uniquely fast switching times, making them ideal for use as photo-active switches or light detectors with high gain.  Heterostructures between atomically thin metallic (e.g., graphene), semiconducting (e.g., transition metal dichalcogenides), and insulating (e.g., hexagonal boron nitride) materials are critical for constructing the building blocks of future multifunctional nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. Here, with selective "sowing" of aromatic molecular seeds during the chemical vapor deposition growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), we demonstrate the construction of arbitrary geometries of heterostructures between MoS2 and diverse two-dimensional materials, both in the parallel and vertical directions. In particular, the direct and controllable large-scale synthesis of various 2D-material&ndash;based lateral heterostructures has been achieved (Figure 2). Their geometrical and physical uniqueness to make materials combinations not found in nature makes graphene-MoS2 lateral heterojunctions potentially useful in high-performance electronics and optoelectronics, such as for the 1D contacts to 2D semiconductors, parallel tunneling field effect transistors, and photo-detectors.
