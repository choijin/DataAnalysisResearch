<AbstractNarration>Eitan Tadmor of the University of Maryland is supported by an award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods program and the Computational Mathematics program for activities related to a workshop entitled "Quantum-Classical Modeling of Chemical Phenomena" to be held on March 8-10, 2010.  The Center for Scientific Computing and Mathematical Modeling at the University of Maryland is hosting the workshop. In addition to Tadmor , the organizing committee consists of Victor Batista (Yale), Shi Jin (University of Wisconsin), and Millard Alexander (Maryland). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the meeting is to bring together a group of experts to examine the current state of development of numerical techniques and to foster interdisciplinary research in the development of computational methods at the interface of quantum and classical dynamics. The list of invited speakers is multi-disciplinary, international and very diverse. The workshop organizers actively encourage participation from graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty and members of under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information may be found at  http://www.cscamm.umd.edu/programs/qcp10/</AbstractNarration>

Combined with the development of novel algorithms, scientific computation has not only joined experiment and theory as one of the fundamental tools of investigation, but it has also altered the kind of experiments performed and expanded the scope of theory.

Broad Impact:  Listed below are the 39 workshop participants. Funds provided by the NSF supported the participation of faculty members at the early stage of their career and representing diversity of gender, ethnicity and geography.
