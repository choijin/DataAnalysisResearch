<AbstractNarration>While information technologies (IT) promise to liberate us of hard labor and save us time by offering efficiency and productivity, improving our quality of life, at the same time they raise the standards of what we should accomplish and increase the amount of information we need to deal with and foster a sense of increased pace and accessibility. As such, the value of busyness may be implicitly embedded in IT design. This award funds a research workshop to create a research agenda on the design of future IT to account for the culture of busyness. The workshop participants will address two question: (1) What are the roles of IT in coping with and/or promoting a culture of busyness?,  and (2) To what extent is it possible to intervene in the culture of busyness by altering the design of IT or its use practices? Through these initial questions the participants will identify theoretical and empirical gaps in understanding sociotechnical aspects of busyness at the individual, organizational, and societal level and will identify both technical and social opportunities and challenges in the design and application of IT interventions for this purpose. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop participants will be recruited and selected in three ways: (1) specific scholars who have done research related to this topic will be individually invited; (2) a general solicitation to submit position papers will be sent out through relevant mailing lists; and (3) local graduate students with interest in this topic will be invited to take part. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this workshop will be to develop a research agenda for better understanding and addressing the value of busyness embedded in IT. Specifically, we plan to submit an article to a general audience journal to describe this research agenda. Further, as we identify specific research being done, we plan to propose a special issue at a major journal in order to group together results about this topic.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcome of this grant was a workshop entitled " 'Slow Down, You Move Too Fast': Rethinking the Culture of Busyness and IT," which took place over two and a half days in May 2011. Thirty junior and senior researchers in areas such as information science, interaction design, anthropology, and media studies gathered to discuss the relationship between contemporary information technology and Western societies in which busyness tends to hold a high cultural value but is also known to lead to serious medical, psychological, and social problems.  Do software applications and gadgets such as mobile phones cause busyness and overwork, or is any technology likely to be used for overwork in a society  which values productivity? Is it possible for technologies to be designed to support calmness and a healthy pace of work, and would doing so be practical in comtemporary society?  The intellectual merit of the workshop was to establish interdisciplinary conversations and develop an emerging research area around these topics. The broader impact of the workshop was to foster awareness of and  develop conceptual support for IT software applications and for social  approaches to technology that could improve Americans' everyday quality of life by addressing Americans' pervasive sense of overwork and overload.  These outcomes were achieved over the course of the workshop by developing an emerging understanding of the potential and pitfalls of intervening in the relationship between IT and a culture of busyness. Participants identified key emerging research questions in the area.  They noted both areas of broad consensus among disciplines the field can build on, as well as areas of controversy needing more research and discussion.  Paticipants identified theoretical and empirical gaps in understanding sociotechnical  aspects of busyness at the individual, organizational, and societal  levels, and technical and social opportunities and challenges in the design and application of IT interventions in a culture of busyness. A key workshop outcome was the development in small groups of preliminary funding proposal ideas to support interdisciplinary collaborations.
