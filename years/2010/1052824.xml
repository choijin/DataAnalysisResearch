<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, Jimmy Wu of Dartmouth College will explore novel methods for the synthesis of sulfur-containing molecules.  This will be accomplished via two methods: 1) UV-promoted or gallium-catalyzed substitution of alcohols, ethers, silyl ethers, or benzoates, and 2) gallium-catalyzed hydrothiolation of unactivated alkenes.  The second objective of this application is to demonstrate the utility of phosphorothioate esters in stereoselective syntheses of sulfur-containing molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many well-known bioactive drugs such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, and anti-ulcerative agents, contain sulfur.  Sulfur-containing compounds also play an important role in organic synthesis as they are useful intermediates in a wide range of reactions.  Given the importance of sulfur in chemistry and biology, it is rather surprising that comparatively little effort has been devoted to this research area.  This project seeks to develop new technologies for the preparation of this important class of compounds.  A primary broader impact of this proposal includes increasing the awareness and knowledge of organic chemistry in the general population by creating a series of short, animated films which focus on central topics in organic chemistry.  Through the integrated educational and research activities of this project, undergraduate and graduate students will receive training and be prepared for careers in either academia or industrial settings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biologically active natural products and drugs that contain sulfur are abundant, but the technology to incorporate this important element into molecules lags behind that of oxygen and nitrogen.  We have developed exciting new reactions for constructing carbon-sulfur bonds, thereby facilitating the synthesis of sulfur-containing bioactive molecules.  Some of the techniques we have discovered also permits sulfur containing molecules to act as intermediates in the synthesis of other important types of compounds.  For instance, phosphorothioate esters allow the construction of carbon-carbon and carbon-fluorine bonds by means of copper or palladium catalysis, respectively.  The rapid incorporation of fluorine into molecules has important implications in the preparation and discovery of radiolabeled PET tracers which rely on radioactive 18F (half-life only 109.8 minutes).  As part of our outreach, we have teamed up with Prof. Lorie Loeb (Dartmouth Computer Science Department and Digital Arts Program) to create three short animated films concerning central topics in chemistry.  The first two films are entitled "Adam and StereochemistryÃ†s Big Adventure"  and "The Polymer Party".  For our 3rd film, "In Hot Pursuit: Cars, Carbon, and Climate Change", we also collaborated with Prof. Alan Goldman (Rutgers University Chemistry Department) to create an animation that focuses on global warming and the role that humans play in climate change.  Despite its pervasiveness in the news and often divisive nature, climate change is a poorly understood topic to both supporters and opponents alike.  The purpose of this current film is to explain the widely accepted anthropogenic model of global warming in plain and easy-to-understand language.  Like our previous two movies, the use of graphics and animation will be tremendously helpful in explaining to the public what scientists believe are the primary causative factors of climate change.  Given the significance of this subject, the production of this film is timely and enormously relevant.    Each of these films have been distributed on YouTube and have been well received by viewers.       Last Modified: 03/31/2016       Submitted by: Jimmy Wu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
