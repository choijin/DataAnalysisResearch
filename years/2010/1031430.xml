<AbstractNarration>Growing concern related to the epidemic of obesity in the U.S. has prompted exploration of causal factors and interventions.  Several recent epidemiologic studies have noted statistical associations between the spatial accessibility of various types of retail food sources such as supermarkets, groceries, convenience stores, and restaurants of all types, and individual characteristics such as weight, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity.  These studies typically use the proximity of retail food sources to individuals' residences as the measure of accessibility, and often rely on areal units, such as census tracts and zip codes.  Assessing accessibility in this manner, however, could result in ecological fallacy.  Since most people travel outside of their census tract on a daily basis, the number and types of retail food sources available to individuals residing in the same area could vary widely.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral student Jay Christian under the guidance of Professor Gary Shannon in the Department of Geography at University of Kentucky will develop a model of accessibility based upon individuals' activity and travel patterns (their activity space) rather than residential location alone.  Researchers previously have used travel diaries to study activity and travel behavior, but these require a significant degree of commitment from study participants, and are prone to recall error and other inaccuracies.  This study will explore the use of the global positioning system (GPS) to identify participants' activity spaces, and employ a geographic information system (GIS) to assess the number and types of retail food sources located within these spaces.  It will thus produce an alternative measure of individual retail food accessibility that does not rely on areal units, nor require the use of travel diaries.  This study will recruit 200 residents of a single census tract in Lexington, Kentucky to carry GPS data loggers to track their movements for two workdays.  Participants will also complete surveys regarding their socioeconomic, demographic, biometric, and dietary characteristics, and to assess where they purchased food during the GPS data logging period. Reported food purchase locations will be registered against data derived from the GPS data loggers.  Using these data, this study will assess the relative utility of a new activity-based model of accessibility compared to previous models, and explore the link between accessibility, food purchasing, and diet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By addressing the effect of individuals' daily movements on their access to food, this research will contribute to scientific literature addressing the causes of, and potential solutions to, the obesity epidemic in the United States.  As such, it will provide insight for policy formulation by multiple government agencies, including those related to public health, transportation, and planning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This dissertation research project investigated the novel use of Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking devices to characterize individuals' daily movements, and thus identify the types of food stores and restaurants accessible to them.  Previous obesity-related research has shown, for example, that neighborhoods with large supermarkets, where fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are commonly sold, tend to have lower rates of obesity and related medical conditions.  This research project, however, used three days of GPS tracking to extend the view of what is accessible beyond neighborhoods, since so many people travel outside their neighborhood on a daily basis.  An accompanying survey gathered information on participants' dietary habits, food shopping, and height/weight.  The findings of this cross-sectional study, conducted among 121 adult volunteers in a single census tract of Lexington, Kentucky, suggest that focusing on food stores and restaurants within individuals' neighborhoods alone is likely inadequate for capturing all accessible food stores and restaurants. Furthermore, results show that, even when they live within the same neighborhood, people can have widely varying access to these establishments when one considers their daily movements.  Also notable were interesting differences observed in the types of food stores and restaurants available to participants from various socioeconomic groups.  For example, younger participants generally encountered a higher density of limited-service restaurants in the course of their daily activities.  Lastly, statistical analysis of the survey data in relation to the GPS tracking data suggested that participants were more likely to be obese, and less likely to eat a lot of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, if they encountered a higher ratio of fast food restaurants and convenience stores in their daily lives.  While these latter findings especially are by no means definitive, this research has contributed to scientific knowledge by demonstrating potential for a particular bias in previous research, and in the process exploring new techniques that could be used to address it.  A research article highlighting some of the findings was recently published by a peer-reviewed scientific journal, Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Epidemiology, and research findings were also presented at the Association of American Geographers (AAG) and American Public Health Association (APHA) annual meetings.  Furthermore, this research study employed both undergraduate and graduate research assistants to fill key roles in the project, and thus contributed to the training of future scientists.
