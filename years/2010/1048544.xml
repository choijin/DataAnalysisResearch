<AbstractNarration>Led by STEM educators at Texas A&amp;M University, this project is analyzing and sharing baseline data on the achievement of African American and Hispanic girls on national and state assessments. The objectives of the project are: (1) To conduct a critical analysis of National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) achievement data for African American and Hispanic female students in grades 3-6 with a focus on sub-test objectives for science, mathematics, and reading over the years 2000-2010; (2) To organize a one-day conference for 100 teachers, administrators and parents from urban, rural and suburban school districts featuring presentation of the data analysis and a national speaker who will share information and lead discussion on why African American and Hispanic girls at the elementary level should begin to think about seeking STEM careers and the required expected academic preparations; (3) To provide conference participants with STEM career information and materials; and (4) To share results of the achievement data analysis at international/national conferences (National Council for Teachers of Mathematics, National Science Teachers Association, American Educational Research Association) and submit papers for publication in scholarly journals,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantitative and qualitative methodology will be used to respond to three research questions: (1) What are the differences in the academic achievement of African American and Hispanic girls in grades 3-6 on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) during the years 2000-2010? (2) What are the voices of African American and Hispanic 6th grade girls about their TAKS test from third grade to sixth grade? (3) What is the impact of a one-day conference on raising the awareness level of educators and parents about academic achievement among African American and Hispanic girls on national and state assessment in grades 3-6 in reading, mathematics, and science? To address question number one, the study will determine if statistically significant differences exist among the variables of race, class, and gender by grades and subject on student performance on the NAEP and TAKS tests and sub-tests in the areas of reading, mathematics and science. To address question number two, a qualitative analysis will be conducted. Students will be interviewed and data will be transcribed, sorted, and categorized into themes. Member checks and triangulation of data will be used to establish validity and reliability of the findings. To address question number three, descriptive statistics will be used to analyze a Likert-type survey instrument that will be developed by the project PI and CoPIs to assess conference objectives. In addition, a purposive sample of participants (teachers and parents) will be interviewed about their participation in the conference and their responses analyzed using qualitative analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a focus on African American and Hispanic girls' academic achievement, the project will provide educators, parents and students through a conference venue and other outlets with valuable information to understand their competency in subjects that can impact their decisions to seek STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cultivating Hispanics and African AmericansÆ Reading, Math, Science (CHARMS) in Elementary Schools for Girls Conference: Project CHARMS for Elementary School Girls      Project Summary. The Cultivating Hispanic and African AmericansÆ Reading, Math, Science (CHARMS) in Elementary Schools for Girls Conference highlighted the academic underachievement of elementary African American and Latino (AA/L) girlsÆ performance in STEM subjects (reading, math, science). Two large achievement data sets were analyzed-- the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (2000-2011)-- followed by the State of Texas  Analysis of Academic Readiness (2012-2013); sub-test objectives for  science, math and reading (same years) also were examined. Findings (2003-2011) were shared during a one-day conference with 58 teachers, administrators and parents from urban, suburban and rural school districts with significant populations of AA/L females across the State of Texas. A nationally prominent speaker with STEM expertise shared information on the relevance and academic requirements of STEM careers; conference participants were provided career materials designed specifically for them by CHARMS researchers. AA/L girls were interviewed about their personal schooling experiences, with findings shared at CHARMS.  Project Findings:  National and state achievement test data documented a large and consistent performance disparity between elementary AA/L girls and the rest of their counterparts in STEM-related subjects.  AA/L girls, grades 3-6, scored the lowest on reading, mathematics and science compared with other same-age females; AAs scored lowest.  AA girls were the only females who scored higher than their racial male counterparts in mathematics. STEM participation requires comprehensive reading skills, as well as, a commitment to culturally responsive reading, math and science instruction and materials. Without that, positive change in STEM participation cannot be realized by AA/L girls. Five themes emerged from the voices of 15 AA girls (AAGs), with six themes from 15 Latino girls (LGs). AAGs revealed that each girl had high academic aspirations and wanted to go to college, which is inconsistent with their current math skill development; they did not feel comfortable with their math skills.  LGsÆ shared a similar favorite subject (science) and teaching strategies, as well as similar attitudes toward science, math and reading. LGs noted their "dislike for math and reading" and for "liking science teachers the most" but they did not mention math or reading teaching strategies.  For science, LGs were very positive, seeming to like the "action" and instructional varieties.       Intellectual Merit: The CHARMS Project provided national and state evidence of a consistent pattern of reading, math and science underachievement by AA/L females in grades 3-6.  Most research on AA/L girls focuses on feelings, perceptions and attitudes about their school experiences, or on male-to-female comparisons.  This study disaggregated the data and highlighted clear performance differences by gender and ethnicity in subject and sub-test objectives in reading, math and science.  The Project interviewed AA/L girls about their schooling experiences. AA/L girls emphatically did not feel comfortable with their math skill development and many admitted having no interest in math. Most described math as "boring" and "unchallenging." In science though, several students talked excitedly about the varied activities done in science classes, which indicated their positive attitudes toward science. Additional in-depth findings from the girls provided implications for improved science and mathematics instruction. Since reading and math skill development are indisputable trajectories for academic success in STEM courses, elementary instruction for elementary AA/L girls is an important portal to their ultimate participation in STEM careers.
