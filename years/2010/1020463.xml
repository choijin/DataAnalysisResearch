<AbstractNarration>Lake Victoria is the largest freshwater lake in Africa and the second largest in the world. The lake's watershed is home to more than 30 million people, a region with one of the highest population growth rates in the world.  The watershed faces a myriad of environmental problems that seriously impact the quality of its waters and hence the availability of fish and other resources. Increasing population pressure, fisheries mismanagement, poor waste management, lack of adequate sewage treatment, introduction of exotic species, inappropriate agricultural practices, unregulated small scale gold mining, unchecked industrial activities, deforestation and intense grazing pressures within the lake's watershed have had repercussions such as excessive sedimentation, eutrophication, oxygen depletion (hypoxia), contaminated drinking water supply, and an increased incidence of water-associated diseases (e.g., schistosomiasis, dysentery, and cholera).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit.  This US-Africa planning visit will support the travel of three senior researchers from the US to the Lake Victoria region to meet with East African scientists from Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda including Prof. J. Machiwa (University of Dar es Salaam - Tanzania), Dr. Nicholas Lwambo (NMRI - Tanzania), Prof. Daniel Olag (Univiversity of Nairobi - Kenya), Dr. John Gichuki, (Kenya Marine Fisheries Research), Dr. Fredrick Muyodi (Makerere University - Uganda), and Dr. J. Balirwa (Fisheries Resources Research Institute - Uganda). The visit will help the US scientists establish long term collaborations with scientists in the African great lakes region, an area that is well suited for study in many NSF priority areas including climate change science, biodiversity, and water use/water dynamics. Discussions will focus on future collaborative projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. New collaborative projects will aim to synthesize new and extant data sets into a coherent model that both describes the synergistic effects of anthropogenic pressures including climate change on the local environment and predicts the effects of abatement measures versus continued inaction on the productivity and sustainability of ecosystem services provided by this large tropical lake.  Understanding these issues has the potential to improve the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of this vulnerable ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  A team of four persons from U.S. partner institutions travelled to the East African countries of Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania between January 11 and 21st, 2011. The purpose of the visit was to meet with East African scientists and lay the groundwork for collaborative research in the Lake Victoria watershed. The team met with 52 representatives from 8 institutions. We discussed research priorities, educational needs for capacity building, and strategies for submission of a full research proposal by U.S. scientists to the National Science Foundation (NSF). We also examined possible study sites, requirements and logistics for data collection including research vessels, laboratory space and equipment, teaching facilities, and logistical matters ranging from transportation, housing and catering for the participants, and governmental requirements.  East African Partner Institutions  Kenya: Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, Kisumu Kenya: Maseno University, Maseno Kenya: University of Nairobi, Nairobi Tanzania: National Institute of Medical Research, Mwanza Tanzania: Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute, Mwanza Uganda: Makerere University Uganda: National Fisheries Research Institute, Jinja Uganda: Vector Control Division, Ministry of Health   U.S. Partner Institutions  Stony Brook University, New York University of Connecticut, Connecticut   Research Priority Areas  The areas identified as high priority for research on impacts of climate change were largely similar across the institutions we visited.  As a study site and natural laboratory, the Lake Victoria watershed provides a tremendous opportunity for research.  There is a significant body of basic information on topics ranging from fish populations and fisheries, invasive species, nutrient inputs and levels, human diseases, to the interactions of people who depend on the Lake for their livelihood. Much of this information has been obtained through external grants to individuals and research institutes to address specific research questions and through collaborations with foreign scientific groups from the U.S., Europe, or Japan. Funding for research and institutional infrastructure from the governments of all three countries was uniformly scant. The scientists we met were dedicated to acquiring external funding and were engaged in making fundamental contributions to understanding of the LakeÆs systems.  Aside from scant funding, another factor limiting progress was that much of the local knowledge about Lake processes is poorly documented, and/or is scattered among research groups and institutions.  While the fisheries institutes closely follow temporal trends in fish stocks, there is a limited understanding of the factors affecting yearclass strength.  Basic information on topics including mixing rates and Lake circulation, residence times and turnover rates, the influence of weather and climate on physical, chemical, and biological processes, and the balance between atmospheric and riverine inputs of nutrients was either lacking or not consistently obtained.  Apart from the International Decade for East African Lakes (IDEAL), there has not been an interdisciplinary research campaign.  We found all the groups to be incredibly knowledgeable and prepared to tackle many of the questions they raised. Limited governmental support is the principle reason why some of the topics described below have not heretofore been addressed.  Capacity building   In all three countries there is a need to have research personnel who have skills in the following fields:  Fisheries hydroacoustics; GIS for mapping of breeding and nursery habitat as well as migration patterns; Modeling of atmospheric (weather and climate) and limnological (general circulation, water column structure) processes; Modeling of ecological processes such as energy flow and population dynamics, coupled with modeling of epidemiological processes;  Commercial aquaculture; Database development and main...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
