<AbstractNarration>This 3-year research project will undertake two major tasks. The Task 1 will be to develop and refine a theoretical framework and self-report instrument for measuring affective engagement in the mathematics classroom. Instrumentation and measurement work will involve the establishment of the psychometric properties of the instrument, primarily its construct validity. Task 2 will examine how engagement and learning in a mathematical activity may be malleable depending upon the characteristics of the activity, qualities of the learning environment, and students' prior attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge. To that end, a quantitative empirical study will be conducted and data will be analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). The research questions are as follows: How is student engagement in a mathematical activity differentially evoked depending upon (1) characteristics of the activity itself, (2) qualities of the learning environment, and (3) students' prior attitudes and beliefs? What are the effects on engagement of students? prior knowledge and the interactions among these factors?  How does a student's engagement in a mathematical activity relate to the mathematics she or he learns? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will yield a validated instrument that can be used by researchers and practitioners to measure key aspects of student engagement situated within the mathematics classroom. The reserach results will advance  theory about the antecedents of student engagement, with an emphasis on examining ways of engaging underserved student populations. The study will generate recommendations and guidelines that math education researchers and practitioners can use to devise theoretically based strategies in curriculum and teacher professional development for increasing and sustaining student engagement and learning in mathematics. The findings will have implications for curriculum redesign and classroom pedagogy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Defining and measuring engagement are challenging because engagement is complex, dynamic, and context dependent and there is no scientific agreement about the nature of engagement. The Math Engagement Project (MEP) developed a set of measurement design tools and processes to bring greater systematicity and rigor to defining and measuring engagement in mathematics learning.  The research grew from findings of two large-scale randomized experiments in the Scaling Up SimCalc Project on the impacts of technology-integrated replacement units in middle school mathematics. While the experiments yielded large treatment effects across samples in over 150 classrooms, observational studies suggested that how students engaged with the mathematics in the units varied in important ways. MEP was undertaken to improve development of measures of engagement, with an eventual goal of increasing capacity to design engaging learning environments for a broader spectrum of students.  This multidisciplinary project used evidence-centered design (ECD)&mdash;a well-established measurement design methodology from the assessment community&mdash;and learning sciences research on designing engaging learning environments. MEP was conducted in two phases. Phase I focused on measurement design using the ECD approach. ECD processes provide tools and structures to make explicit the underlying assumptions about the constructs of interest, the role of context in measurement, and connections between evidence produced in this context and the inferences that are drawn from it. ECD processes were used to design five measures of engagement in mathematics learning in one of the SimCalc units.

The intended Intellectual Merit is to provide learning scientists with measurement design tools built on rigorous methods from the assessment community so they can systematically develop measures of engagement in mathematics learning. The design tools promote the articulation of connections between the constructs to be measured and the instructional and social features of the learning environment. This supports the study of engagement, its relationship to learning mathematics, and implications for the design of learning environments. Broader Impacts. Through more rigorous measurement development processes, the intended Broader Impacts are to deepen the capacity in the learning sciences to build and evaluate engaging learning environments. This is intended to increase a broader spectrum of studentsÆ equitable access to engaging learning resources that promote the development of conceptual understanding.
