<AbstractNarration>This grant is to support the organization of a symposium on the design, analysis and modeling of low carbon footprint supply chains. The symposium will be held over two days in the fall of 2010 at the headquarters of the National Science Foundation (NSF). The Symposium will bring together researchers with backgrounds in Supply Chain Management, Energy, the Environment, Economics, and Public Policy, among others. It will also involve representatives from governmental agencies, non-profit organizations, and industry. Although there is growing interest in industry in minimizing the carbon footprint of supply chains, the research community, particularly in supply chain and operations management, has been noticeably absent from the discussion. Some of the questions that will be addressed in the symposium include:&lt;br/&gt;1)How should the carbon footprint of a supply chain be measured and how  &lt;br/&gt;  should it be allocated across the participating firms and across products&lt;br/&gt;2)How would various types of regulation and environmental policies affect the  &lt;br/&gt;  design and operation of supply chains? &lt;br/&gt;3)Is it possible to reconcile the needs of cost efficiency, customer  &lt;br/&gt;  responsiveness, system reliability and lower carbon emissions? &lt;br/&gt;4)What analytical methods, computational tools, and data are needed to  &lt;br/&gt;  support the design, planning, and coordination of low carbon emission  &lt;br/&gt;  supply chains?&lt;br/&gt;5)How should products be redesigned to support low carbon emission supply  &lt;br/&gt;  chains?&lt;br/&gt;6)What data are needed to support the monitoring and analysis of supply chain  &lt;br/&gt;  carbon footprints?  Who should collect the data and who should pay for its  &lt;br/&gt;  collection? &lt;br/&gt;7)What impact would product carbon labeling have on consumer choices?  What  &lt;br/&gt;  impact would such choices have on decisions made by suppliers?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the symposium will accomplish the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1)It will create greater awareness of issues surrounding carbon footprint,  &lt;br/&gt;  energy efficiency, and the supply chain.&lt;br/&gt;2)It will support the development of a research community that draws from  &lt;br/&gt;  different disciplines around these issues and will support this community in &lt;br/&gt;  articulating a research agenda. &lt;br/&gt;3)It will encourage collaborations between academic researchers, government  &lt;br/&gt;  agencies, non-governmental organizations, and industry in the design,  &lt;br/&gt;  analysis and modeling of low carbon footprint supply chains.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Carbon emissions adversely affect the global climate; this effect may be irreversible in the near-term.  Many adverse health effects are linked to high levels of carbon emissions.  Consequently, reducing and mitigating carbon emissions is a concern for both industry and government.  Many firms are now monitoring their carbon emissions.  Some retailers are developing carbon emission tags to provide consumers with information on the carbon that was expended in producing the product and delivering it to the store.   Many countries are enacting strict legislation to curb carbon emissions. Carbon offsets, cap and trade legislation, and carbon caps are among the instruments being considered and adopted.   While many academic disciplines have considered carbon emissions, there is scant literature on the impact of operational changes within and across firms on carbon emissions.  Similarly, while technologies have been developed to reduce the carbon impact of individual manufacturing processes or production plants, relatively little work has focused on the impact of decisions made by the various actors within a supply chain on the carbon impact of the entire chain.    This symposium focused on the operational and strategic impacts of supply chain decisions on carbon emissions.  The goals were to highlight many of the issues associated with reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain, to stimulate research in this area, and to begin building a community of researchers interested in the topic.   The symposium included four keynote speakers:  Michael, Grubb (Cambridge University). Larry Burns (University of Michigan and Columbia University), David Simchi-Levi (MIT) and Gerard Cachon (University of Pennsylvania).  Other sessions discussed (1) Supply chain carbon footprint measurement, (2) carbon footprint and supply chain management, (3) carbon footprint in transportation and logistics, (4) carbon emissions and supply chain design, (5) emissions allocation in supply chains, and (6) supply emissions reduction, emissions offset, and emissions trading.  The symposium included a wide range of participants from academia, industry and government.   Future research should examine the impact that concerns for carbon emissions will have on the supply chain network structure.  Similarly, individual firms and entire supply chains are likely to respond to increased concerns for carbon and other GHG emissions with operational changes, which also clearly warrant study.   Life cycle analysis is critical in the assessment of carbon impacts throughout the supply chain.  This should include all steps of the process from sourcing through final distribution to the customers as well as consumer use of the product (or service) and final disposal or reuse or recycling of the good.  Life cycle analysis must account for operational decisions made by firms as well as consumer behavior and options for alternative designs of the products.  There is a need to incorporate dynamics into life cycle analysis.   Data will be needed to feed any models that are developed.  Many sources of publicly available data are already on the web including WRI and the CarbonTrust.  One corporate participant suggested that companies that amass these databases might be willing to share them with academic researchers under appropriate conditions.  Models in this area need to account for data errors and biases.   Allocation of carbon emissions across companies and across multiple products produced by the same company is a critical issue deserving research.  This research will draw heavily on constructs from economics, game theory, and other fields.  Key questions include:  How should carbon emissions be allocated to different companies within the supply chain?  What incentives to reduce carbon emissions do different allocation schemes create for the actors in the supply chain?  What operational and strategic decisions are likely to emerge as a result of different allocation schemes?    An...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
