<AbstractNarration>The project will study the evolution and structure of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases, which are the enzymes that control the production of starch in plants and glycogen in bacteria. This is an interesting case study because this enzyme evolved to acquire different catalytic and regulatory roles according to the necessities of the organism.  Despite the divergence in catalysis and regulation between plant and bacterial forms, it seems that there is a common mechanism to trigger the regulation. Specifically, this project will try to identify how catalytic function has diverged along the evolutionary tree of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases and identify the responsible regions for the common regulatory trigger for activation. Different techniques will be used, including molecular cloning, mutagenesis, computational and biochemical studies. The characterization of conserved and divergent functional elements of this enzyme will explain how new roles can evolve in an enzyme family such as the one from ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of the functional evolution of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase could lead to a rational manipulation of their properties. Consequently, transgenic plants with modified ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases may improve agriculturally important crops or algae for biofuel production. Several aspects of the research will have an educational impact in the society. 1) Undergraduate students will be trained to perform research and learn the ethic of science, which will be an irreplaceable experience for a future professional, or a deciding factor to become a scientist. 2) Two graduate students will be trained, who will possibly become either a future scientist or teacher. Considering that there are several underrepresented minorities in science and women studying in the Department of Chemistry at Loyola University Chicago, it is likely that this project will benefit an underrepresented fragment of the population. 3) International workshops will be organized in Santa Fe (Argentina) and Chicago (USA) to enhance the research education of American graduate and/or senior undergraduate students. 4) Faculty and staff of Loyola's Center for Science and Math Education will collaborate to develop model lessons for high school teachers based on the scope of this proposed research.</AbstractNarration>
