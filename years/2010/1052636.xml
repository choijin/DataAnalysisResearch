<AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of this research is to understand how salt marsh ecosystems respond to changes in sea level. The investigators will examine whether and how increases in nitrogen supply alter growth rates of the dominant vegetation, and in turn affect sediment accretion rates in salt marshes.  Sediment accretion increases the elevation of the salt marsh and helps keep it in equilibrium with sea level. The researchers expect that as the rate of sea level rise increases, a tipping point will be reached beyond which sediment accretion no longer keeps pace and the salt marsh ecosystem ceases to function.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Salt marshes are vulnerable to increases in sea-level. This project continues over two decades of observations in North Inlet estuary on the productivity of marsh cord grass, Spartina alterniflora. This research has led to new insights about the regulation of marsh productivity and the feedbacks that maintain marshes in equilibrium with sea-level.  Salt marshes are among the most productive environments on earth and they are highly valued for the ecosystem services they provide.  These services include provision of habitat and food for many commercially important marine species, maintenance of high biodiversity, protection against storm surge damage, and land building.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal presented a decadal research plan that addresses questions about tidal marsh stability and the responses of marshes to rising sea level.  It builds on long-term measurements of plant growth, relative (to sea level) marsh elevation, and porewater chemistry conducted on permanent plots in North Inlet estuary, SC since 1984.  Three hypotheses are being tested: 1) The optimum elevation for growth of marsh grass, Spartina alterniflora, and its range of tolerance will increase with increasing nutrient supply; 2) The optimum elevation for production of roots and rhizomes will exceed that of aboveground biomass; and 3) as sea-level rise accelerates, the relative elevation of North Inlet marshes will decrease and pass a tipping point.  Experiments testing hypotheses 1 and 2 focus on belowground processes and the effects of nutrients on the growth and optimum elevation of Spartina.  They contribute to the interpretation of long-term data collected as part of the testing of hypothesis 3.  A test of the tipping point hypothesis (H3) will require measurements spanning a decade or longer.  The existing long-term data, which consist of monthly measurements of population density and growth of marsh cord grass (S. alterniflora), porewater chemistry, herbivore (Littoriaria irrorata) density, and marsh surface elevations are unique and set the stage for this proposed research.  The outcomes of the first five years of this research can be summarized as follows:  1) North Inlet salt marshes are not keeping pace with rising sea level.  2) Elevation gains on plots that were previously fertilized with nitrogen and phosphorus have slowed and the elevations of control (not fertilized) and fertilized plots are converging.  3)  The initial excessive elevation gains in fertilized plots can be accounted for by the additional mass of roots and rhizomes produced by the plants.  4) Bioassay experiments that involved growing Spartina plants at different elevations for periods of 1 to 5 years, a test of H2, were inconclusive with respect to differences in the optimum elevation between roots/rhizomes and aboveground biomass, but showed that total root and rhizome biomass increase over a period of 2 or more years.  Rhizomes, which are perennial organs, turnover slowly.  This has led to the concept of a marsh (or perennial grasslands in general) as a subterranean forest.  Rhizomes are functional equivalents of the branches of a forest canopy.  5) Concentrations of the major plant nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus, and the decomposition product, sulfide, and monthly plant growth all cycle In synchrony.  The summer season when plant growth rates are greatest is also the time when the concentrations of nutrients and sulfide are greatest.   This may be a result of the leaking of carbon compounds from the plants and their effect on microbial activity and sediment chemistry, i.e., the plants may be responsible for generating their nutrients as they need them.  This is a new concept for marshes.  Previously the regeneration of nutrients was viewed as being largely decoupled from the live plants.
