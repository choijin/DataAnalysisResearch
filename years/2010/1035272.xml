<AbstractNarration>The Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) community generates much of the data in science.  Major experiments and facilities are now generating petabytes of data per year that must be distributed globally for analysis. Projects already in development will generate much larger&lt;br/&gt;volumes at faster rates, approaching an exabyte per week, with exaflop computing capacity needed to perform the analysis. In addition to this growing number of prodigious data generators, virtually all of science is becoming data-intensive, with increasing size and/or complexity, even at the level of PIs in individual labs. This trend extends beyond MPS disciplines to:&lt;br/&gt;biological data; financial, commercial, and retail data; audio and visual data; data assimilation and data fusion; and data in the humanities and social sciences. Virtually all disciplines need potentially radical new mathematical and statistical ways to handle future data sets if scientific advances are to be realized. The proposed MPS Workshop on Data-Enabled Science will provide a high-level assessment of the needs of the MPS communities, including anticipated data generation, capability and inability to mine the data for science, strengths and weaknesses of current efforts, and work on developing new algorithms and mathematical approaches. The workshop will also provide an assessment of the resource requirements for addressing these needs over the next five years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Report on Data-Enabled Science in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences  Science has always been data-driven, but what is changing dramatically is the amount of data with which scientists now engage. The Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) community generates much of this data.  Major experiments and facilities are now generating petabytes of data per year that must be distributed globally for analysis.  Projects already in development will generate much larger volumes at faster rates, approaching an exabyte per week, with exaflop computing capacity needed to perform the analysis.   In addition to this growing number of prodigious data generators, virtually all of science is becoming data-intensive, with increasing size and/or complexity, even at the level of PIs in individual labs. This trend extends beyond MPS disciplines to: biological data; materials and manufacturing data; financial, commercial, and retail data; audio and visual data; data assimilation and data fusion; data in the humanities and social sciences; web-based data; and governmental data. Virtually all disciplines need radical new ways to manage this data, as well as major mathematical, statistical, and computational advances to utilize these data sets, if the enormous potential scientific advances are to be realized.  This so-called "data-crisis" facing science and society has been widely recognized (see, e.g., The Data Deluge, in The Economist, Feb. 27, 2010). But it is particularly relevant to the MPS community both because of the severe challenge, yet enormous potential reward, inherent in dealing with the data-crisis and because much of the solution will require fundamental advances in the data sciences, of which mathematics and statistics within MPS is a highly prominent part.  To realize the extraordinary potential for scientific advance inherent in the data-crisis, two major hurdles need to be overcome: (1) Data Management and (2) Scientific Inference from massive or complex data. We summarize the major issues involved in each hurdle below.   Data Management: Handling the enormity of arriving and soon-to-arrive scientific data requires complex and new strategies and understanding. Components of this management include:  Designing the data collection strategy. This includes new strategies for data generation, storage, and long-term archiving and preservation. Collecting the data, from either single or distributed sites, with appropriate meta-data to ensure usability. Preprocessing (if necessary) to keep only the most essential data. Storing the data.  Ensuring accessibility of the data by scientists, possibly through layered distribution of the data to multiple sites. Providing platforms and software that enable efficient use of the data by scientists, as well as allowing for capture of the scientistsÆ post-processing of the data, with appropriate links among related data sets Ensuring curation and preservation of data.   Scientific Inference from Massive or Complex Data: There are major challenges in producing breakthrough science from massive or complex data. Note that we emphasize complex data in this discussion as well as massive data; what might appear to be of modest size today (e.g. the number of genes in the human genome) can cause as severe of inferential difficulties as massive data when consideration is given to complexity (e.g., the need to consider the vast multitude of possible gene networks). A few of the overarching challenges are given here; others are in later sections.  Scalability is a primary concern; much of science today uses æsmall dataÆ methodologies for scientific inference, strategies that are ill-equipped for todayÆs massive or complex data. There will be a dynamic tension between the desirability of broadly useable approaches to data-enabled science &ndash; across applications and disciplines &ndash; and the frequent need for solutions tailored to a specific setting. Data-enabled science is not just data exploration a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
