<AbstractNarration>The WashingtonBaltimore-Hampton Roads Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (WBHR Alliance) is led by Howard University (HU) with Morgan State University (MSU), Bowie State University (BSU), the University of the District of Columbia (UDC), Hampton University (HAU), Norfolk State University (NSU) and Virginia State University (VSU) along with the community colleges associated with these HBCUs.  Community college participation in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and Virginia include:  Prince George?s Community College, Danville Community College, J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, Howard Community, Germanna Community College, Cecil College, John Tyler Community College, Southside Virginia Community College &lt;br/&gt;Over the past fourteen years of the Washington Baltimore Hampton Roads-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (WBHR-LSAMP) Program, there has been significant research and teaching infrastructure building at all of the WBHR-Alliance Institutions; strategic expansion of STEM degree offerings at the BS, MS, and Ph.D. levels; new courses in STEM; increased degree production at all levels; improved retention; significant increase in the number of technical publications in refereed journals; progression and graduation rate increases at all institution; awards of nationally recognized fellowships including the Rhodes Scholarship, Hewlett Packard Fellowship, NSF graduate fellowship; and increased collaboration with major research institutions, national laboratories, and industry. &lt;br/&gt;This project will (1) position the WBHR-Alliance for sustainability by integrating its most effective interventions into the institutional operations at member campuses, and by building enduring relationships within the Alliance and with other major research institutions; (2) interest students in and prepare them well for STEM graduate study, institutionalize research experiences for undergraduates throughout the alliance, along with GRE tutorials, state-of-the-art STEM seminars, and other assistance; (3) create pathways to a STEM baccalaureate for students at community colleges, by including them in WBHR-LSAMP summer programs and academic-year courses, facilitating their transfer into STEM B.S. programs at WBHR-LSAMP institutions, and ensuring their successful completion of the STEM degree, ready for graduate study or a STEM career; (4) Increase the number of STEM students participating in international research experiences at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes from this project are expected to result in a 5% increase in STEM B. S. degrees and an increase in students from underrepresented minority populations entering STEM graduate studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Washington Baltimore Hampton Roads &ndash; Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program (WBHR-LSAMP) is one of the largest producers of STEM degrees in the nation.  What began as a partnership with four HBCU institutions in 1993 under a cooperative agreement through the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) of the National Science Foundation has now expanded into a 13 member alliance inclusive of seven HBCUs and six community colleges. This alliance has produced over 16,000 minority students with BS degrees, 1,603 with MS degrees, and 460 with Ph.D. degrees in STEM fields.  Howard University has successfully served as the lead institution for the alliance for the past 22 years  The Washington Baltimore Hampton Roads - Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (WBHR-LSAMP) was established in 1993 under a cooperative agreement through the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) of the National Science Foundation. The all- HBCU alliance of Howard University (HU), Hampton University (HaU), Morgan State University (MSU), and the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) formed a working alliance in the middle-Atlantic region of the nation with Howard serving as the lead institution. At the end of the first five years in 1999, the alliance had produced almost 3,600 B.S. degrees in STEM fields. In 2000, an expanded alliance was formed with three additional HBCU partners including Bowie State University (BSU), Norfolk State University (NSU), and Virginia State University (VSU).  The alliance moved forward with its focus on increasing the number of historically underrepresented minorities who choose careers in STEM fields and to substantially increase the number of minority students earning B.S. degrees, and subsequently continue their education by pursuing M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in STEM disciplines.   Now an established senior level alliance, the WBHR-LSAMP has developed into a 13 member alliance inclusive of the original seven HBCU members and six new community college partners.  The Alliance has continued to build on each previous yearÆs success to ensure:                           1) An increased rate of graduation of underrepresented minorities at the baccalaureate.                           2) A substantial impact on the rate of attendance in STEM graduate programs by program participants through the Bridge to the Doctorate fellowship activity, graduate symposia, seminars, workshops, and research.                           3) Institutionalizing best practices via peer mentorship, tutoring, GRE prep, tutoring in gate-keeping courses, curriculum development, increased faculty mentored research, facilitating the transfer of community college students into STEM areas, and involving our students in presenting at state, regional and national conferences.                           4) Increased emphasis on collaborations with other NSF projects, national laboratories and private corporations/industry and expanding opportunities for student engagement in international activities.     For 2015-2020, we will continue to foster these goals and add an emphasis on working with community colleges and accommodating community college transfer students and graduates.
