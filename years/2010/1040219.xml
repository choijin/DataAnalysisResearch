<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to advance several programs in nanoscale materials and devices in Georgetown University?s Physics/Chemistry departments through acquisition of an atomic layer deposition system ? a fundamental tool for nanotechnology applications.  The system will complement the existing micro-/nano-fabrication processing instrumentation within the Georgetown Nanoscience &amp; Microtechnology Laboratory shared cleanroom facility.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to advance the nanoscience component of several funded and pilot research projects.  If awarded, the atomic layer deposition system?s utility will have an immediate impact on projects including: synthesis of application-specific porous and magnetic nanoparticles; deposition of ultra-thin-films for micro-/nano-structure fabrication; and development of ultra-sensitive carbon nanotube field-effect transistors for bio-chemical sensing, terahertz detection, and superconductivity studies.  The approach is to provide easy accessibility of the deposition tool to the PIs and other science faculty by housing it in the shared cleanroom.  External use of the system from within and outside Georgetown University will be encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of an in-house atomic layer deposition system will be expansion of the internal/external user-base, thereby creating opportunities for new collaborations.  The system will be an educational tool for graduate and advanced undergraduate physics/chemistry curricula.  Many projects will serve as a platform to stimulate and enhance science education and generate excitement in high technology sectors such as micro-electromechanical systems, nanotechnology, and materials engineering. All PIs have actively involved high school and undergraduate students in their research programs, and will continue to expand their respective outreach activities, such as increasing participation by underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF-MRI award was for the acquisition of a state-of-the-art atomic layer deposition (ALD) system allowing the growth of nano-thickness layers of instulating and conducting materials.  Over the grant period, the PI's were initially involved in establishing the best system for our needs, based on the funds available through the grant.  Two major ALD manufacturers were chosen and ????we down-selected and purchased the TFS-200 ALD system, manufactured by Beneq, Oy of Finland.  Negotiating with the company allowed for maximizing system performance and capabilities within the constraints of our budget.  The system arrived in Feb. 2012 and was commissioned in late Sept. 2012, all in conjunction with a Beneq technician.  One final element of the system will be installed in early 2013, however, the system functionality has not been affected by this add-on.  Since commissioning, several users have been trained on its operation by the Beneq technician, as well as our cleanroom technician.  To date, the system has been predominantly used to deposit a high quality ielectrically nsulating film called aluminum oxide.  Users now include the PI's, post-doctoral and graduate researchers, and a few undergraduate students.  The system has been used to gather preliminary data for novel devices for which grant applications and patent disclosures have been submitted.  The cleanroom facility will be moving in late April 2012 from its current location into Georgetown's new science center in Regents Hall.  The new facility will boast better infrastructure, air handling, and increased level of cleanliness.  Once moved, the PI's will be involved in holding an open house, to give tours and illustrate capabilities in the new cleanroom highlighting nanotechnology as a core  thrust.  The ALD system will be showcased in this demonstration.       Last Modified: 12/31/2012       Submitted by: Makarand Paranjape]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
