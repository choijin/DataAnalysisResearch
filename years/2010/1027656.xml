<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel of U.S. participants in the workshop "Poly and Polymer Electrolytes for Energy Conversion: Ab Initio, Molecular, and Continuum Models," held at the Lorenz Center within the University of Leiden, The Netherlands, 23-27 August 2010.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to facilitate communication among the disparate groups of researchers applying ab initio, molecular, and continuum approaches to the modeling of nanostructured polymer electrolyte materials used in energy conversion and storage devices.  The meeting features invited talks by leading researchers, as well as formal directed discussion sessions and a session of presentations contributed by junior participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop brings together mathematicians, computational chemists, computational materials scientists, and experimentalists to facilitate research progress in areas that address the pressing need for a more efficient energy infrastructure to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.  Funding is directed to ensure broad participation by students, postdocs, junior faculty, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2010/404/info.php3?wsid=404</AbstractNarration>
