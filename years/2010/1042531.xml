<AbstractNarration>The Science Coordination Office (SCO) serves the scientific community, NSF/OPP, and the arctic logistics contractor by coordinating input and providing an organized mechanism for OPP to consult with regarding decisions at Summit Station. SCO makes recommendations to CPS about ways to accommodate or mitigate conflicting requests from different science teams, as well as suggesting ways investigators might accomplish science objectives with smaller logistical impacts. SCO advocates on behalf of the community, suggesting science-based priorities for capital investments by OPP at Summit that will maintain and enhance the value of the site for research while striving to keep the station financially sustainable. This proposal includes two new members to SCO in order to represent the broader research community and diversify generations of researchers. This proposal adds functionality to the existing SCO. SCO will discuss research projects on the Greenland Inland Traverse and future research sites on the Greenland Ice Sheet hosting investigations similar to work done at Summit Station. Activities that expand communication in this proposal include significant updates to the current GEOSummit webpage such as incorporation of a virtual tour, Summit bibliography, and Summit GIS. SCO will create a Summit Listserv and host communication events such as a town hall style meeting at the Fall AGU meeting, increased effort at informal direct contact, and semi-annual teleconferences involving the scientific community. The SCO role in long-range and annual planning is to focus on the economic and environmental sustainability of the station in parallel with the preservation of core station scientific activities. These objectives are captured in a developing Long-range Plan for Summit Station.</AbstractNarration>

The resources come in multiple forms including: i) funding, ii) operational and logistical, iii) planning at multiple levels, iv) strategic development. The purpose of the Science Coordination Office for Summit Station and the Greenland Traverse is to facilitate in the utilization of these resources.</p> <p>In particular, funding is becoming increasingly challenging to obtain to support the activities at Summit Station. At the same time, the user base is continuously changing and the requirements vary. Summit was established as an ideal location for pristine measurements of air-to-snow transfer of atmospheric constituents for improved understanding of paleo-climatic records preserved in ice cores. Since the earliest days of Summit, there have been several new communities wishing to conduct research at the facility. These include remote sensing scientists wishing to validate satellite signals (e.g. NASA ICESat), the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to measure more broadly in the region of Summit, new drilling technologies, autonomous robots for radar profiles, and most recently an increased interest from the astrophysics community. All of these scientific endeavors have potentially conflicting demands on the facility as a resource.</p> <p>The Science Coordination Office (SCO) is tasked with facilitating the optimal use of the aforementioned resources. For instance, how will the facility be developed over the long-term must take into consideration the development of snow drift so as not to impact the long-term observations of ice sheet changes in snow height that are used to validate NASA satellites. New energy resources required to conduct more energy-intensive astrophysical experiments should not pollute 'clean air and snow' sectors that have been intensively investigated for nearly two decades.</p> <p>Moreover, it is important for a facility such as Summit to have an appropriate level of international representation and participation. Summit is a cornerstone location of Greenland research, providing an essential logistical hub for some deep field activities. The Greenland Traverse has historically delivered resources and created fuel caches for deep some of the international ice coring projects conducted at NEEM and now East GRIP. These projects rely on the NSF C-130 aircrafts for support as well as stop-overs of smaller aircraft at Summit for fueling.</p> <p>All of these myriad of activities and utilization of resources creates a complicated and challenging requirements matrix that must be worked out each field season to deliver optimal scientific results. The SCO works closely with the NSF project managers and contractors to facilitate the optimal use of resources toward improved scientific deliveries. To accomplish this, the SCO conducts weekly tele-conference calls, semi-monthly tele-conference calls with the NSF contractors, and monthly calls with NSF program managers. A website (www.geosummit.org) is developed with updated information about what science is being conducted, links to available data archives, and updates specifically regarding the Long-Range Planning (LRP). This last point is perhaps the most critical of the SCO. Given the dynamic nature of funding and scientific demands for the facility, it is important to have a flexible planning horizon for the station. While the SCO attempts to develop a "Vision" for the facility, it is challenged frequently due to unforeseen developments, and must be regularly revisited. The SCO strives to deliver a "Vision" that is representative of the demands and interest of the scientific community first and foremost with reverence to the realities and constraints placed on the development process due to funding and logistical constraints that come naturally with working on top of the Greenland Ice Sheet.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2017<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;F&nbsp;Burkhart</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1042531/1042531_10128251_1512035140223_IMG_2619--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1042531/1042531_10128251_1512035140223_IMG_2619--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Summit Station and the 'Big House'"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1042531/1042531_10128251_1512035140223_IMG_2619--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Summit Station and the 'Big House'"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The array of facilities at Summit Station including.
