<AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports Danna Freedman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. Freedman will work with Prof. Dan Nocera to create compositionally-pure crystals of materials which can be used to make high-temperature superconductors, according to Anderson's resonating valence bond (RVB) theory.  The synthesis of these crystals will be guided by results from a new kind of anomalous x-ray scattering measurements made at the ChemMatCARS beamline of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory.  Dr. Freedman will be collaborating with Dr. Yu-Sheng Chen, a Research Beamline Scientist at ChemMat CARS.  For her plan for broadening participation, the PI will work with the Center for Materials Science and Engineering to develop curriculum on chemistry and how this relates to energy issues, including superconductivity, to be used with local middle school students, including a significant fraction from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Freedman is aimed ultimately at developing more efficient electrical conductors -- a technology area that can yield greater efficiencies in e.g. electrical power distribution.  The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Freedman are aimed at encouraging young people from all walks of life to develop a better understanding of science and to possibly pursue careers in science.</AbstractNarration>
