<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to understand the underlying device science of the how such organic transistor and sensors operate and to create a comprehensive model that includes physical, chemical, and device design effects.  The approach is to utilize a series of semiconductors as active layers in sensors along with receptor molecules and characterize them in detail. A large number of semiconductors and receptors will be employed and scanning probe measurements that can probe the potentials and local charge carrier densities along the polycrystalline channel will be employed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The response of organic transistor based chemical sensors depends on many factors.  Most of the active semiconductor films are polycrystalline and grain boundary effects are very important in determining sensor behavior.  It is expected that new insights into the materials physics of sensors will be gained by employing such diagnostic structures.  Correlated charge transport and sensing measurements will be performed.  Since the sensing process is closely dependent on charge transport and trapping in organic semiconductors, it follows that simultaneous measurements of transport and chemical sensing will throw light on both charge transport phenomena and details of sensor behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has the potential to impact industrial efforts to commercialize organic and hybrid electronics products in the US.  From an educational perspective, the impact will be research-oriented education of both graduate and undergraduate students in Electrical Engineering, Materials Science and Natural Sciences, at UT Austin.  This project will also help recruiting and retaining women/minority graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI has a vision of making a ubiquitous "olfactory camera" or "smell camera" that anyone can use to store smell information and can be easily operated with a smart phone.  People can store olfactory snapshots of their favorite recipes and foods for later comparison.  Some consumers can evaluate perfumes, wines, cheeses, etc.  Such a device can also function as a personal warning system for hazardous environments, allergen containing environments, carbon monoxide levels, etc.  To make this vision a reality, new and better chemical sensors need to be developed. These sensors must be able to sense a range of analytes (by having multiple sensors for any analyte and using a fingerprint type detection method).  Additionally, these sensors must be stable, robust, and reusable.  The design of such sensors presents unique challenges and opportunities.  The sensor we have worked on is based on organic field-effect transistors.  The response of these transistors is influenced by the chemical environment in which the transistor is placed. We have made progress as summarized below.  Intellectual Merits:   1) We have made substantial progress in establishing a clear correlation between charge transport and chemical vapor response in organic field-effect transistors (FETs). We have been able to relate analyte concentrations to activation energy changes.  2) We have been able to shed light on the physical role played by receptor molecules in enhancing sensor response of organic FET chemical sensors.  3) We have demonstrated combinations of semiconductor and receptor that provide enhanced response as well as reasonable stability.   The broader impacts:  1. Graduate students have been trained in the experimental and laboratory skills that are likely to be useful to them in their subsequent employment.  Some of the experimental methods used are very unique and offers the students a good opportunity in developing a detailed understanding of experimental work.  2.  Students have made several presentations at International Conferences, including the IEEE Sensors Conference, the MRS Meeting, SPIE, etc.  This provided greater visibility to the work as well as to the students and allowed them to enhance their professional standing.  3.  Undergraduate students were also involved in aspects of this project. This helps increase the degree of interest among undergraduates in advanced degrees in STEM fields.
