<AbstractNarration>1039846&lt;br/&gt;Tarduno&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports development of an ultra-sensitive (1 x 10-16 Am2) spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) atomic magnetometer capable of routine measurement of all three components of the remanent magnetic moment recorded in very small Archean refractory accessory phases (e.g., zircons).  Should the development prove fully successful, the SERF magnetometer will allow PI Tarduno, students and collaborators to continue the search for mineral recordation of the birth of the geomagnetic field using a technology that could have up to three orders of magnitude better measurement sensitivity than currently available SQUID sensor based rock magnetometers.  Assessment of the timing of onset of core formation and dynamo activity on early Earth has implications for constraining the development of the Earth?s atmosphere and the earliest possible emergence of microbial life on Earth as the magnetic field shields the Earth from the intense cosmic radiation and the solar wind.   The development will be done in collaboration with a small U.S. company, Twinleaf, and will engage a graduate student.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
