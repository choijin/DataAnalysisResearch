<AbstractNarration>While there are many methods and devices for detection of nucleic acids in vitro and in vivo, no general solution has emerged that provides simple, rapid, nucleotide sequence selective quantification of nucleic acids.  A highly sensitive, highly selective nucleic acid biosensor based on a competitive equilibrium between a probe and a target nucleic acid in conjunction with a newly developed instrument will be developed. The nucleic acid biosensor, founded on a novel thermodynamic formalism for describing the interactions of a duplex probe with its target, provides means for sensitive, highly selective quantification of the target. &lt;br/&gt;Successful development of the competitive equilibrium nucleic acid biosensor will provide scientists with the means to detect and quantify, at high sensitivity, any nucleic acid with single base nucleotide sequence selectivity.  Further development of sensitive and highly specific nucleic acid biosensors is critical for fully exploiting the rich genomic information resulting from the sequencing of the genomes of myriad microorganisms, plants and animals, including humans. In addition, recent discoveries about the regulation of gene expression by small ribonucleic acid molecules operating at the level of messenger RNA have vastly increased the number and variety of nucleic acids that must be identified, detected and quantified if one is to understand, and potentially modulate, a range of critical biological processes; including, but not limited to development, apoptosis, stress response and differentiation. The nucleic acid biosensor developed here will yield the requisite experimental capacity to detect and characterize biological targets for diagnostic applications, as well as for basic knowledge/understanding of biological regulatory mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A sensitive, highly discriminating nucleic acid based biosensor has broad potential applications in diagnostics and analysis, including, but not limited to medical diagnostics, detection of foodborne pathogens and other biohazards. Most nucleic acid detection methods based on hybridization (that is, the recognition and binding of complementary DNA or RNA strands to form a double helix) do not provide reliable quantitative information.  The competitive equilibrium method that we have developed in this project overcomes this deficiency and moreover does so in a manner that is exquisitely selective. In contrast to commonly used single-strand based probes, the competitive equilibrium technology offers single base selectivity independent of the length of the probes.  The competitive equilibrium technology is further superior to current methods because the selectivity is independent of concentration; therefore, the limits of detection are determined solely by the sensitivity of the associated instrumentation.  A further advantage of the method, is that the target nucleic acid can be measured in solution or on a surface. In collaboration with IBET, Inc. (Columbus, OH) and Artann Laboratories (Trenton, NJ), a unique instrument was developed to monitor light signals resulting from target binding either in solution or with probes attached to a surface over a range of temperatures.  In addition, the instrumentation and techniques developed here provide unprecedented precision  for measurment of the thermodynamic stability (free energy change) of nucleic acid duplexes. High precision free energy data are necessary for improved predictive understanding of nucleic acid hybridization, which is relevant to the design of nucleic acid probes for a wide variety of practical applications and is vital for understanding the forces that hold the double helix together.  This, in turn, is essential for developing an understanding of how damage to the DNA can result in failure of the cell's DNA repair mechanism, which may then result in a mutation.
