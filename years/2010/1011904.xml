<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this proposal is to obtain funding for the third annual inter-Science of Learning Centers (iSLC) Conference entitled "Learning in Action: Applications and Implementation? and hosted by the NSF-funded Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science, and Technology (CELEST) in Boston, Massachusetts on May 23-25, 2010. These funds will be used to cover participant costs including travel, meals, and accommodations as well as facilities at Boston University. The 2010 Conference will build upon the previous Conferences by including cross-Center collaborative oral presentations in both symposia and methodology workshops. In addition, this Conference will contain a CELEST research highlight giving iSLC participants the opportunity to learn more about CELEST research and to engage in research level discussions with CELEST faculty. Finally, the Conference will immediately follow CELEST?s annual International Conference on Cognitive and Neural Systems (ICCNS), giving participants the opportunity to attend both Conferences.</AbstractNarration>
