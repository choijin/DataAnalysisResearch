<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the development of Sensor-Enabled Geosynthetics (SEG) as a new generation of geosynthetics with embedded sensing capabilities that will allow their mechanical strain to be measured without the need for conventional instrumentation such as strain gauges and extensometers. The focus of the study is on polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-coated, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) yarn geogrids which are commonly used in soil reinforcement applications. Carbon black (CB) will be used as the primary type of conductive filler material. An advantage of this geogrid material is that only the coating will contain the CB content that is required for strain-sensing capability. This will help ensure that the underlying mechanical properties of the geogrid will not be affected, since the inner PET yarns are the load-bearing component of the geogrid. The primary objective of this proof-of-concept study is to solve the chemical and materials aspects of developing SEG specimens to attain reliable, accurate and reproducible strain-conductivity properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon successful proof-of-concept, and future verifications involving large-scale in-soil testing in the lab and in the field, this study will result in a novel approach to measuring mechanical strain in geosynthetics with important advantages over existing technology. These advantages include: 1) ability to measure reinforcement strains at greater number of locations within the structure, 2) a less complex and costly data acquisition system, 3) reduction/elimination of mechanical interference of the sensors at the locations of measuring strains, and 4) measuring larger strains than what is currently possible using strain gauges. Through these advantages, the SEG technology will facilitate health monitoring of geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures using smart materials leading to a better understanding of their field response and improved design methodologies with respect to their safety and economy. Consequently, it will help engineers prevent costly failures and repairs of infrastructure involving geosynthetics resulting in significant savings in both private and public sectors. The study will also provide a better understanding of the piezoresistivity of conductive-filled polymers at very low strains; a region that is of practical significance in multi-disciplinary applications including civil and chemical engineering.</AbstractNarration>
