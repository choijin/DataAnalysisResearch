<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award supports an interdisciplinary training program for Ph.D. students at Brandeis University, carried out in partnership with the New England Center for Complex Systems (NECSI). The goal is to create a group of mathematical scientists with the computational skills, intellectual flexibility, and global perspective needed to attack pressing problems in pure science, applied science, and public policy that require a mathematically sophisticated, interdisciplinary approach.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Fundamental problems in the theory of fundamental particles, quantum gravity, the science of materials, the emergence of cognition, disease epidemiology, and economic forecasting all draw from a set of common mathematical concepts and techniques in geometry, complex classical and quantum systems, and probability theory. Students trained in a variety of mathematical techniques, broadly educated in the applications of these techniques, and experienced in communicating their ideas across disciplines will best be able to respond to new scientific problems whose solution requires advanced mathematics, sophisticated modeling, and the management of large data sets. The IGERT program will therefore include: hands-on experience through interdisciplinary research rotations; interdisciplinary coursework; co-advisors outside of the students? discipline; intensive NECSI-led summer institutes; an IGERT seminar series; and the opportunity for internships at the International Center for the Theoretical Sciences in Bangalore, India. Broader Impacts: Students will learn to communicate their work to prospective science students and the public via public lectures, the Brandeis Science Posse program, and the Acton Discovery Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

In addition there were numerous faculty associates who lectured and supervised IGERT trainees.  The first main component of the IGERT program were interdisciplinary courses: in addition to existing courses with an interdisciplinary audience, two courses were designed or re-designed for the IGERT program.  Co-PIs Albion Lawrence (Physics) and Daniel Ruberman (Mathematics) designed and taught a course in of a branch of mathematics known as differential geometry, to the question of how cats turn themselves while falling, and to a quantum-mechanical phenomenon known as Berry's phase.  Faculty associate Mark Adler (Mathematics) and co-PI Paul Miller re-designed and co-taught a mathematics course in "stochastic processes" -- phenomena which include a random element -- so as to include applications from neuroscience and economics.  The second main component was a seminar series during the school year, by external speakers and Brandeis trainees, combined with a yearly summer institute with longer-form pedagogical lectures on interdisciplinary topics by speakers from inside and outside of Brandeis.  By bringing different subjects (and the lecturers) into close contact, the summer institutes highlighted deep connections between diverse fields: for example, relationships between the motion of barely rigid materials and the climactic phenomena known as El Nino.  The third main component was a partnership with the International Center for the Theoretical Sciences (ICTS) in Bangalore, India.
