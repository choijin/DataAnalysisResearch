<AbstractNarration>This project tackles the development of new tools for the semantic &lt;br/&gt;analysis of temporal signals, in particular (but not restricted to) &lt;br/&gt;video sequences. While most of the emphasis in video analysis so far has &lt;br/&gt;been at the low-level, the investigators plan to explore the use of &lt;br/&gt;Causal Analysis to perform inference and decisions to analyze video &lt;br/&gt;signals. The challenge in this project is to bridge the gap between &lt;br/&gt;basic descriptor at the signal level and Causal Calculus, that acts on &lt;br/&gt;semantically meaningful representations. In particular, long-range &lt;br/&gt;prediction, not just short-range continuous extrapolation, requires the &lt;br/&gt;development of new tools that allow "interventions" into the model. How &lt;br/&gt;would the state "X" evolve if event "Y" were to occur? To attain the &lt;br/&gt;goals set forth in the proposal, the investigators must tackle &lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems in the analysis of time series, both at the &lt;br/&gt;low/mid-level (defining a proper notion of ``distance'' between time &lt;br/&gt;series that respects their intrinsic dynamics), at the mid-level &lt;br/&gt;(defining clustering schemes for action segments), and at the high-level &lt;br/&gt;(develop action semantics in an abductive framework). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this pilot one-year project, the investigators plan to explore the &lt;br/&gt;feasibility of using causal analysis for performing long-range temporal &lt;br/&gt;prediction of events and actions from visual data. Sample applications &lt;br/&gt;that are impacted in case of success are broad ranging from &lt;br/&gt;surveillance to environmental monitoring to driver assistance in &lt;br/&gt;transportation, with significant societal impact in reducing traffic &lt;br/&gt;accidents.</AbstractNarration>
