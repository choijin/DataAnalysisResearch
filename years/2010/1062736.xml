<AbstractNarration>This award will support a new REU site for Undergraduate Research in Computational Astrophysics (URCA) at North Carolina State University. This program will support eight students for ten weeks of summer research per year, with computational projects involving numerical simulations, data analysis and modeling. The science applications will include supernovae and supernova remnants, interacting binary stars and accreting compact objects, gamma-ray bursters, accretion disks, stellar winds and jets, r-process nucleosynthesis, and neutrino astrophysics. These original, independent research projects will be complemented by a comprehensive introduction to scientific research that includes classroom lectures to build a solid background in the relevant astrophysics topics, hands-on training exercises in computational physics, and a structured training in scientific communication. Through this extensive training and close interaction with faculty mentors, the students will make real and lasting contributions in a research experience at the forefront of computational astrophysics.  By targeting students who have completed a first year of university-level physics and calculus, but who might not yet have chosen science as a career path, this program seeks to increase the number and diversity of students entering careers in computational science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our goals for URCA were to introduce students at early stages of their careers in physics to the excitement and rewards (and frustrations) of real scientific research, using powerful modern-day computational resources.  We hoped to encourage them to continue in the rigorous paths to technical degrees.  We brought in 8 undergraduate physics majors, most with only a single prior year of college, for ten weeks in each of the summers of 2012, 2013, and 2014.  The program began with lectures on astrophysics, programming (Python), and available research topics, and included instruction in writing abstracts, proposals, and papers.  After two days, students had chosen a topic and drafted an abstract; after a week, they made PowerPoint presentations on their projects to the group.  Lectures continued for about four weeks, after which all the students' time was spent on their research projects.  Mid-summer poster presentations served as progress reports, and were exhibited at various venues including at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Final posters were presented at NC State's Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium.  In 2014, students also gave five-minute general-public talks on their work at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.  Detailed descriptions of the program, and of student projects, can be found at the URCA I website http://astro.physics.ncsu.edu/urca/index.html.  The students worked on an array of projects in high-energy astrophysics, centering on the research interests of faculty: supernovae and remnants, nucleosynthesis, supernova neutrinos, and binary X-ray sources.  To date, three refereed papers and eight presentations at national and international meetings (primarily the American Astronomical Society) have resulted, with five more papers in preparation.  Even though the students were at the beginning of their college careers, they made significant progress on complex research projects.  The increase in their scientific knowledge, understanding, and sophistication over the course of the summers was truly astonishing.  URCA I funds were used to support seven of the students from the 2013 class to present posters at the American Astronomical Society meeting in January, 2014 in Washington, DC.  Particularly outstanding work was done by A. Mao from the 2012 class, who performed 2-D hydrodynamic simulations of a supernova remnant expanding into a medium with a density gradient.  The basic result,  that a remnant can remain roughly spherical even in a fairly strong gradient, but with its center of symmetry significantly displaced from the true location of the explosion, has important implications for searching for surviving companions of supernova progenitors.  The work made up a significant part of a paper reporting just such a density gradient in the remnant of Tycho's supernova (Williams et al. 2013). Neutrino-driven winds in core-collapse supernovae were studied by Camille Samulski and Daniel Hatcher from the 2014 class.  Dr. Carla Frohlich, who supervised the research, presented results in talks at meetings of the APS Division of Nuclear Physics (October 2014) and at a workshop in Cyprus (June 2015).  Parameter studies were done, as well as identification of the most important nuclear reaction rates for determining ultimate abundances.  Each year of URCA I was assesssed quantitatively as well as qualitatively.  Over the three years of the project, the 25 students responded with an average score of 3.88 out of 5 to the question, "Are you more likely to pursue advanced study in computational physics?", 4.56 to the question, "How well did the summer meet your expectations?"  and 4.84 to the question, "Would you recommend the program to students with similar interests?"  This enthusiastic support was demonstrated in written comments and in discussion transcribed by the faculty facilitator as well.  Several students described the program as a "great experience."
