<AbstractNarration>The PI's request MRI RAPID funding to acquire a GCMS, solvent extractor and evaporator to aid in processing the massive number of samples they are collecting for an NSF OCE RAPID funded to investigate the fate of buried oil and its degradation rate in order to allow predictions of potential toxic effects originating from buried oil. They are currently running their samples on a shared instrument at the FSU Department of Chemistry. The sample load on that machine is already high and now many more samples need to be processed with oil research expanding at FSU. The analyses take a relatively long time and samples are already getting backlogged. With increasing number of researchers at FSU getting involved in the Gulf oils spill research the addition of another shared use GCMS will benefit numerous NSF funded oil spill projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oil pollution presents a major threat to the Gulf beaches that may impact these environments over many years. Previous research indicates that buried oil can persist in beach sediments for decades, but no information presently is available on the degradation rates of the oil from this spill buried in Gulf beaches. Understanding the uptake, transport and degradation of oil in sandy Gulf beaches is prerequisite for assessing beach toxin release and thus impact on tourism and fishery industries. This instrumentation will enhance collaboration between Gulf institutions and departments at FSU, and provide training for students on a state of the art GC/MS system in a rapidly expanding field of research.</AbstractNarration>
