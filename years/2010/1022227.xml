<AbstractNarration>The cuticle (the insect equivalent of skin) is one of the structural innovations responsible for the ascendancy and predominance of insects in nature. This research project is a molecular genetic and biochemical approach designed to identify specific components of the cuticle that are critical for its assembly.  The organization of the cuticle in the maturing elytron, a modified wing structure of the red flour beetle, will serve as a model tissue system for cuticle morphogenesis, a critical step in arthropod development. This research will lead to a greater understanding of the molecular basis and the dynamics of how various proteins and chitin interact to assemble the multi-layered cuticle with its distinctive chemical and mechanical properties.  In addition, this project will allow training of three graduate students, several undergraduate students and a post-doctoral fellow, and also encourage them to pursue careers in pure or applied science.  As a result of this research team's efforts in training and outreach to high school biology teachers, many high schools across the country now use the red flour beetle for genetics experiments and promotion of its use in education will continue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results obtained from the pursuit of this research will be broadly disseminated in national and international meetings in the form of poster/oral presentations and in the form of refereed publications in mainstream journals.  Resources (mutants and genetically engineered beetles) will be supplied to other researchers and high school teachers when requested.  Details of available resources will also be uploaded in the popular Tribolium Genetics Website, which is maintained by this research group, and in the Tribolium genome database, "Beetlebase".</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The insectÃ†s exoskeleton or the cuticle (the equivalent of the composite of human skin and bones) is responsible for their evolutionary success on earth.  The cuticle is composed of the mechanically strengthening rebar-like polymer, chitin, and a large and variable assortment of proteins that contribute to the diverse properties of the cuticle ranging from the light weight flexible hind wings and the strong and rigid sclerotized forewings of the red flour beetle, our model insect.   We have gathered genetic and functional information on nearly 100 components of the beetle cuticle with the purpose of identifying vulnerable targets in the insectÃ†s armor.  The genes that we have studied include several key proteins necessary for the synthesis and modification chitin as well as its turnover.  We have found that there are multiple members in each family of enzymes involved in each of these processes that have distinctly different functions.  In addition, a large assortment of structural proteins binds to the chitin rebar to form layers of coaxial bundles.  These layers are stacked on top of one another in twisted plywood type of the composite cuticle.  Most importantly, we have discovered a unique protein that is the target of the insecticide, diflubenzuron that reduces the amount of chitin and its laminar organization in the cuticle.  We have delineated the mode of action of this insecticide using an in vitro chitin-synthesizing system that mimics the production of cuticle by the underlying epidermal cells.  We know a lot more about the steps involved in molting consisting of simultaneous degradation of the old exoskeleton even as a new cuticle is being built underneath. Thus cuticle deposition and molting are the most vulnerable periods in the insectÃ†s life cycle and represent chinks in their armor.   Our work has the potential to lead to the development of insect control strategies that utilize environmentally friendly biotechnological approaches.  The strategies are currently used by Monsanto Company to control corn rootworm.  Our work provides additional targets based on control of chitin metabolism.  Since chitin is essentially absent in vertebrates and plants, it represents a safe target.  Further, RNA interference strategies can destroy the chitin metabolic machinery of pest insects while sparing beneficial insects such as honeybees and pollinators, providing a species-selective specificity in attacking target pests.
