<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to investigate the impact of earth surface processes on the application of cosmogenic exposure dating in Antarctica by combining multi-nuclide techniques, detailed field experiments, rock-mechanic studies, and climate modeling. They will analyze cosmogenic-nuclide inventories for a suite of six alpine-moraine systems in inland regions of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. This area is ideally suited for this study because 1) the targeted alpine moraine sequences are critically important in helping to reconstruct past temperature and precipitation values over the last several million years, 2) the production rates for cosmogenic nuclides are typically high and well-known, and 3) the complexity of surface processes is relatively low. Their work has two specific goals: to evaluate the effects of episodic geomorphic events in modulating cosmogenic inventories in surface rocks in polar deserts and to generate an alpine glacier chronology that will serve as a robust record of regional climate variation over the last several million years. A key objective is to produce a unique sampling strategy that yields consistent exposure-age results by minimizing the effects of episodic geomorphic events that obfuscate cosmogenic-nuclide chronologies. They will link their moraine chronology with regional-scale atmospheric models developed by collaborators at University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This research is interdisciplinary and includes two early career scientists. Results of this work will be used to enhance undergraduate education by engaging two female students in Antarctic field and summer research projects. Extended outreach includes development of virtual Antarctic field trips for Colgate University?s Ho Tung Visualization Laboratory and Boston University?s Antarctic Digital Image Analyses Laboratory. The PIs will continue to work with the Los Angeles Valley Community College, which serves students of mostly Hispanic origin as part of the PolarTREC program. This project will contribute to the collaboration between LDEO and several New York City public high schools within the Lamont-Doherty Secondary School Field Program.</AbstractNarration>

The Dry Valleys are the largest ice-free region in Antarctica, providing a unique window into millions of years of Antarctic climate history. Additionally, the Dry Valleys are home to distinctive microbial communities and rare landforms that have evolved under cold hyper-arid conditions for millions of years, making the Dry Valleys the focus of significant scientific research.   This project focused on a technique known as cosmogenic exposure dating, which is a method of measuring how long a rock has been sitting at the EarthÃ†s surface. It is often used to date glacial deposits such as moraines. Given the unique environmental conditions encountered in Antarctica (low erosion rates and potentially old deposits), a major goal of this research was to isolate and study the different sources of error in exposure dating in Antarctica. Additional goals of the research were to obtain a record of climate for the Dry Valleys and to study erosion in a cold, hyper-arid environment.  The primary scientific results of this research were:  a)     We mapped and dated glacial deposits in the Dry Valleys that span the last one million years, providing information on regional climate during multiple glacial and interglacial cycles. Most notably, we sampled the first glacial deposit in the Dry Valleys that dates to 400,000 years ago.

The major implications of these results are 1) the development of improved sampling strategies and laboratory techniques that will increase the efficacy of future exposure dating studies, especially in Antarctica, and 2) the discovery of glacial deposits in the Dry Valleys that will provide regional climate information during key time periods that are of interest to the scientific community.
