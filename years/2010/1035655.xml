<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop new foundations of composition in heterogeneous systems, to apply these foundations in a new generation of tools for system integration, and to validate the results in experiments using automotive and avionics System-of-Systems experimental platforms. The approach is to exploit simplification strategies: to develop theories, methods, and tools to assist in inter-layer decoupling.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. The research program has three focus areas: (1) theory of compositionality in heterogeneous systems, (2) tools and tool architectures for system integration, and (3) systems/experimental research. The project develops and deploys theories and methods for inter-layer decoupling that prevent or decrease the formation of intractable system-wide interdependences and maintain compositionality at each layer for carefully selected, essential system properties. Compositionality in tools is sought by exploring semantic foundations for model-based design. Systems/experimental research is conducted in collaboration with  General Motors Global R&amp;D (GM) and focuses on electric car platforms. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact. The  project is contributing to the cost effective development and deployment of many safety and security-critical cyber-physical systems, ranging from medical devices to transportation, to defense and avionics.  The participating institutions seek to complement the 30-year-old conventional curriculum in systems science with one that admits computation as a primary concept. The curriculum changes will be aggressively promoted through a process of workshops and textbook preparation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As engineered systems are increasingly designed as the networked interactions of physical and computational processes, their integration is becoming the most unpredictable and risky part of the development process. At the heart of the problem is the prevailing practice that relies on ad-hoc methods:  After all the components have been designed and manufactured, existing integration methods simply aimed at ?making it work somehow?. The goal of our project was to address two research questions: (1) What are the new systems science foundations and engineering disciplines that enable the predictable integration of independently developed system components? (2) What are the new integration platforms that facilitate the rapid construction of design tool chains that extend to heterogeneous design domains?  Answering the first question has great practical significance for users of cyber-physical system (CPS) products. For example, future generation automotive safety systems include advanced control features, such as Lane Departure Warning, Adaptive Cruise Control, and Auto Collision Mitigation Braking. While each safety feature can be verified and tested individually, their combinations may result in unsafe behaviors due to interference and un-modelled side effects. The question is how to guarantee key safety properties without the need of re-verifying all variants? The underlying scientific challenge is to establish compositionality for fundamental safety properties, such as stability.  Answer to the second question has great importance for industry designing CPS.  Heterogeneity of the multi-physics, multi-abstraction and multi-fidelity CPS design space, and the need for rapidly evolving/updating design flows require the use of a rich set of modeling methods that are usually influenced/determined by existing and emerging verification and simulation technologies and tools. To address both heterogeneity and evolvability simultaneously is a significant scientific challenge because the solution requires to make models of semantics &ndash; the metamodels - explicit, composable and supported with a formal framework that includes tools for the validation and verification of language designs.  The basic hypothesis of the research approach was that model- and component-based design can be extended to heterogeneous systems and to the construction of tool chains.  Model-based design process is a progressive refinement of models &ndash; composing and verifying mathematically sound design models while adding implementation details by systematically mapping models from higher level abstractions onto models closer to implementations.  Component-based design means that system-level models can be constructed by reusing models of components, and system-level properties can be computed from the properties of components.  The project accomplished the following key results:  1. Developed passivity-based design for control design and integration. The theory has been studied and evaluated for both traditional control such as composition of throttle and brake control in Adaptive Cruise Control system, and advanced control such as semi-autonomous driving. Both management and control researchers at GM R&amp;D recognized the value of such method.  2. Developed co-design methods for physical, control, and software architecture.  This was performed in an integrated end-to-end modeling and hardware-in-the-loop automotive simulation test bed developed by the research team. A transition plan has been created by GM R&amp;D to adopt the method and the environment in GM product design.  3. Developed coevolving multiple graph models and distributed algorithms for networked CPS. The approach was used to resolve the problem of "vehicle platooning coordination using only local information" which is an excellent example of the interaction between the control and communication graphs (networks). More generally, a framework was developed for distributed consensus problems that provide a generic example of networked CPS such as collaborative robots.  4. Recognized the need for and developed a horizontal Model Integration Platform complementing the current vertically integrated tool suites. The key innovation in the information architecture of the Model Integration Platform is the dynamic model integration language used for modeling cross-domain interactions using semantic interfaces to integrated domains.  5. Developed Semantic Backplane for model- and component-based design automation tool suites. The Semantic Backplane is the formal framework for the Model Integration Platform. It includes the formal specification of semantic interfaces for design domains, the formal specification of composition semantics and model transformations used in the model-based design flows.  6. The initial design of the Semantic Backplane was transitioned to a major DARPA CPS design automation project, Adaptive Vehicle Make (AVM).  The OpenMETA tool suite of the AVM program includes a complex version of a model integration language, CyPhyML, and a full formal specification library for semantic interfaces and model transformations for a tool chain targeting the design of military vehicles. The OpenMETA tool suite is transitioned to industrial use via the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute program of DoD.  7. Education and training. GM hosted multiple visits of the research team, and sponsored summer interns during the project.
