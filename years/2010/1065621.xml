<AbstractNarration>The Máíhiki Project is a three-year, team-based project that will thoroughly document Máíhiki (ISO 639: ore), the highly endangered language of the Máíhuna people. Máíhiki is spoken in northern Peruvian Amazonia, and belongs to the Tukanoan language family, which has played an import role in recent years in linguistic typology and theories of language contact. The Máíhiki Project's concrete products - including a dictionary, a grammatical description, and a collection of Máíhuna narratives and oral history texts -  will serve both scientific goals and objectives set by the Máíhuna people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spoken by 90-100 individuals out of an ethnic population of approximately 400 people, Máíhiki is presently highly endangered, and language revitalization a major concern of the Máíhuna people. The Máíhiki Project will train Máíhunas as linguistic researchers so that they can participate fully in the documentation of Máíhiki, and will also develop and test innovative family-based language revitalization techniques with an eye towards applications in other language endangerment situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on Máíhiki is scientifically important in three ways. First, it will provide crucial data for reconstruction of the proto-language from which the modern Tukanoan languages descended, thereby yielding insights into the cultural history and peopling of the Amazon Basin. Second, because of its geographical isolation from other Tukanoan languages, Máíhiki has not participated in the Vaupés Linguistic Area (VLA), one of the most theoretically important language contact areas in the world, centered on the Brazilian-Colombian border. As a result, Máíhiki can provide crucial insights into which linguistic features characteristic of the VLA originated from the Tukanoan languages that participate in the area, and which features derive from other languages families in the area, such as Arawak languages. This knowledge will allow linguists to better understand what kinds of linguistic features flow between languages in circumstances of intense social contact. Finally, Máíhiki exhibits a number of theoretically interesting grammatical subsystems, including morphological frustratives (i.e. suffixes which indicate that an action failed to be carried out, or failed to realize its intended goal) and a system by which the grammatical relations between nouns and verbs are inferred from context, rather than marked grammatically. These phenomena will allow linguists to better understand the ways in which human languages can vary, including how social and interactional factors are relevant to linguistic structure.</AbstractNarration>

M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki is a language of the Tukanoan family spoken in northern Peruvian Amazonia that is currently highly endangered, with approximately 100 speakers out of an ethnic population of 400-500 individuals. Prior to the research carried out by the M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki Project, the only data available on this language were limited lexical materials, grammatical descriptions, and written narratives collected by missionaries in the 1960s and 1970s that, useful and valuable as they were, fell far short of modern standards of language documentation, description, and analysis.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Documentation and analysis of M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki is important for both scientific and humanistic reasons that give this project broader social impact. Scientifically, documentation, description, and analysis of M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki promises to give us important insights into processes of language contact (where one language affects the structure of another in contexts of multi-lingualism) by virtue of M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki's relationship to the Vaup&eacute;s Linguistic Area (VLA) of the northern Colombian-Brazilian border area. Briefly, the languages of the VLA show convergence in grammatical structure without corresponding lexical borrowing, despite the fact that lexical borrowing has been theorized to necessarily mediate grammatical convergence. The fact that the languages of the VLA contradict this otherwise valid generalization has important consequences for theories of language contact. Significantly, most of the VLA languages are members of the Tukanoan family, like M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki, but crucially,&nbsp;M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki does not participate in the VLA. This means that data from M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki can give us critical comparative insights into the way language contact in the VLA has altered the structure of the languages in that area, contributing to our understanding of the ways in which language contact can produce grammatical convergence without mediating lexical borrowing. In addition, the close analysis of the sound system (phonology) and grammar (morphology and syntax) of the language has yielded specific insights into the structure of the language that will contribute to developments in other aspects of linguistic theory, and to our understanding of the history of the Tukanoan language family. In terms of the broader humanistic impacts of the project, the project trained community members in fundamental aspects of linguistics, empowering them to successfully develop a writing system for the language, which exhibits challenging features such as nasal harmony and tone. This community-developed writing system was subsequently given official recognition by the Peruvian department of education. In close collaboration with community members, the project also developed a community-oriented dictionary, and both written and video pedagogical materials for use in community efforts to revalorize and promote education in, and about, M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Primary data collection and analysis was carried out between June and August of each year in the Amazonian communities in which M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki is spoken, involving intense collaboration between the visiting UC Berkeley linguists of the project team and the community members who actively participated in and were trained as part of the project. Further focused analysis and data-processing was carried out at UC Berkeley during the remaining months of the year.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The data collected by the M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki included a large number or digital audio recordings of M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki language use, including traditional mythical narratives, shamanic songs, community and personal histories, and everyday conversations, transcribed and morphologically parsed in a searchable database; a considerable quantity of lexical data organized into a bilingual M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki-Spanish dictionary; and elicited grammatical data, which includes sentences and word forms, as well as carefully recorded utterances used for phonetic analysis. This significant corpus of materials served as the basis for analyses and grammatical descriptions on a range of topics, including the nasal harmony and tone systems of the language, the morphosyntax and semantics of noun classifiers and quantification, variable affix ordering on verbs, the semantics of tense and aspect, morphosyntactic alignment, the grammar of spatial expressions, and the syntax of clause-linking, among others.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All materials and data collected by the M&aacute;&iacute;h??ki Project, as well as grammatical descriptions written during fieldwork, have been archived at the California Language archive and are available to scholars and community members who wish to learn about the grammar and lexicon of this language, as well as the verbal traditions and history of its speakers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/15/2017<br>      Modified by: Lev&nbsp;Michael</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div
