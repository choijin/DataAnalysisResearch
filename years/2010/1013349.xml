<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research performed with the NSF EAPSI funding was done at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), in Singapore, under the supervision of Professor Subodh Mhaisalkar.  Dr. Mhaisalkar is a leader in the field of electronic materials, focusing mostly on semiconductors.  His research was complementary to my current research in semiconducting materials as chemical sensors.  This award allowed me to do research on an exciting new material called graphene.  Graphene is a one atom layer thick sheet of carbon atoms, and exhibits very unique electrical characteristics.  Graphene also promises future devices that can be transparent, flexible and low power.  This past fall (after my time at NTU) the researchers who discovered graphene were awarded the Nobel Prize.  The research I performed with graphene, used the material as a chemical sensor.  The graphene was used as the semiconducting material in a transistor.  The transistor architecture allows for an enhanced signal response due to the amplification from the electric field applied by the transistor gate electrode.  This allows for multiple variables to be measured instead of just electrical current, as in the case of a resistor.  The multiple variable measurement allows for a more selective sensor, which can be placed in an array that acts as an "electronic nose" and would respond to multiple molecules of interest.  Nitrogen dioxide, a toxic gas, was a molecule investigated with our sensors.  We found that by altering the metal electrodes from gold to aluminum gave inverse responses to the NO2.  Sensors with gold contacts showed an increase in current upon exposure to the NO2, while the aluminum contact sensors showed a decrease in current.  This was the first time this behavior was shown for a graphene sensor.   Learning to manufacture graphene devices has helped me learn a new field in organic electronics, to complement my existing knowledge in small molecule and polymer, organic semiconductors.  Getting familiar with the various techniques used in the creation of the graphene transistors will help me create new graphene based devices in the future.  This experience, both the new graphene knowledge and the  cultural exposure I was able to receive in Singapore, will help me better interact with my peers in the scientific community.
