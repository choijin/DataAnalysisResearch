<AbstractNarration>This award supports a workshop to develop an intellectual and research agenda on the topics of citizen diplomacy and citizen networks. Citizen diplomacy and citizen networks are conceptualized as a technologically mediated form of soft-diplomacy. Citizen diplomacy raises intellectual scientific challenges for researchers that are by nature interdisciplinary: technical, economic and political, and social. Technical scientific research questions concern developing new capabilities for the mobile phone for use as a primary client, novel multimodal interaction environments, the reliability of a country?s infrastructure, and using technology to create incentives to participate. Political and economic research questions include studying government policy, Internet censorship, the cost of network use, and the instability of political climates. Social and cultural research questions include dealing with illiteracy, language differences, cultural awareness, finding others to participate, developing trust in others and in technology, managing system abuse and malicious behavior, and dealing with time zone differences. There is a critical need to develop a focused research agenda that outlines the scientific and technical challenges that effectively integrates these and other research topics to benefit from the socio-technical transformations of the world wide network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of technologies to support citizen diplomacy will benefit citizens of the United States as well as those in developing countries. Creating citizen networks between the developing and developed worlds will help to break down cultural, social, and political barriers. Taking such a ?bottom-up? approach with citizens may influence policy at national levels. People in both developed and developing countries will gain by learning new ideas and cultural practices. Above all, we expect that citizen diplomacy can expose young people to alternative life paths, thus limiting the impacts of local extremist views.</AbstractNarration>

Citizen diplomacy combines the objectives of soft diplomacy with the use of social media to connect citizens in the developing world with the developed world. Discussion led to the following themes.  Purpose, use, and sustainability: An important factor for technologies for citizen diplomacy to succeed is that they need economic sustainability. Given the myriad of possible direct and indirect citizen diplomacy applications, different approaches are possible. Of special note are those based on freemium models where access to services are charged at different rates depending on their value with respect to basic human rights (e.g., healthcare and education vs gaming), and those that support the free software and content movement.

Such technologies need to provide anonymity and privacy guarantees (specially for direct diplomacy activities such as conflict management). They should also consider the possibility of a moderator and should be resilient to poor IT infrastructure. Above all, they need to provide translation capabilities given the language (and cultural, and socio-economic) differences among participants.  Given the adoption rates of mobile technology and social media in both developed and developing countries, these two particular technologies present an opportunity to connect to a variety of information sources and participants.  By mining all the data produced by such mobile social networks it is possible to then identify feelings, topics, sentiments, and other relevant information that, if properly visualized, is useful to support citizen diplomacy activities such as relief efforts in crises.  Social aspects surrounding the technology: The citizen diplomacy user base is plagued with inequalities including race, age, education, access to technology, culture, language, beliefs, power, and opinions.
