<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT: EAPSI  BIOGEOGRAPHY AND EVOLUTION OF MERTENSIA IN ASIA AND   NORTH AMERICA  M. Nazaire  Washington State University     Understanding why biotic diversity differs among geographic regions is a fundamental challenge in evolutionary biology and ecology. My dissertation research combines phylogenetic analyses with biogeography and ecology to examine diversification of the bluebell genus, Mertensia, an alpine/montane plant genus, which has its greatest species richness in western North America but also occurs in Asia. The research aims to (1) produce the first molecular phylogeny for Mertensia; (2) test for the ancestral area of Mertensia; (3) estimate the time of MertensiaÆs origin and identify shifts in diversification; and (4) test for effects of geographic and ecological change on diversification rates. Chloroplast DNA sequences are being used to reconstruct a phylogenetic hypothesis of species relationships. A time-calibrated phylogeny is being used to test hypotheses of geographic and ecological change.  This dissertation research will advance our understanding of the evolution of biodiversity and global patterns of species richness. This research will help explain the ecological and geographical dynamics of plant diversification and have implications for understanding effects of anthropogenic climate change. Anthropogenic climate change may threaten high elevation and high latitude species of Mertensia. Studies already point to shifts in flowering times for some montane Mertensia species and anecdotal evidence from Alaska, Maine, Canada, and Norway indicates declines in populations of the circumboreal M. maritima. Results from this research will provide a framework to address conservation concerns.  Through NSFÆs program, East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute, a portion of this dissertation research was conducted in China, with my host, Dr. Xiao-Quan Wang at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Botany in Beijing. Dr. Wang studies a diverse range of plant groups and has specific research expertise and relevant experience in the biogeography of Asian plants and Asian-North American plant disjunctions. The combination of Dr. WangÆs research focus, the excellent research facilities available at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and access to populations of the Asian species of bluebells in China were key in selecting this particular researcher and location to conduct my dissertation research.  Preliminary results generated from time diversification analyses suggest that the bluebells may have originated during the Miocene, a period of global cooling. One possible explanation for the origins of Mertensia at this time is that a shift in climate could have lead to the migration of closely related plant groups into higher elevations, which may have lead to the origin of new species. Preliminary biogeographic analyses suggest a high likelihood that Mertensia had an ancestral origin in Asia, with one migrational shift to North America.  Results from this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, and deposited in online databases. Outreach from this research has been directed toward native plant societies, popular periodicals, and working with the National Girls Collaborative Project, sponsored by the STEM Education Coalition. In addition, collaborative efforts continue with Dr. Wang as well as with other Chinese botanists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Xinjiang Agricultural University in Xinjiang Province.  Future research will follow in this line of thinking, but expand to investigate other plant groups of montane and alpine habitats. It is particularly relevant to direct future research efforts in this area, where climate change may threaten the biodiversity of our high elevation plants. Moreover, ongoing collaborative efforts with researchers worldwide are imperative for addressing such issues on a global level.             Last Modified: 06/1...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
