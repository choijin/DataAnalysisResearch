<AbstractNarration>This workshop brings together government research program managers, experienced researchers, and some new researchers in fields covered by the Trustworthy Computing program to create a set of publicly available materials an presentations that will help broaden the pool of researchers capable of proposing to the program.  The program and its predecessors, the Trusted Computing and Cyber Trust programs, now fund more than 400 Principal Investigators. New researchers entering the field need to understand the research areas these programs cover, how they relate to other NSF programs, and how they relate to programs funded by other U.S. government research funding agencies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A trustworthy cyber infrastructure is vitally important to the future security of the country.  It is imperative that researchers focus on the key challenges in building a trustworthy cyber infrastructure. To this end, this project consisted of the organization of two events aimed at training researchers, formulating long-term research agendas and strengthening the scientific communities in computer security.  The first was a Workshop on Trustworthy Computing, held October 24-26, 2010 in Arlington, Virginia. The second was a Summer School on Cryptography and the Principles of Software Security, held May 30 to June 1, 2012 at Penn State's main campus in State College, Pennsylvania.  Workshop on Trustworthy Computing http://tc2010.cse.psu.edu/  The workshop focused on the NITRD Cybersecurity R&amp;D Themes from the Federal Cybersecurity Game-Change Research Agenda ("NITRD themes", hereafter) and the general challenge of improving the Science of Cybersecurity.  The result of this workshop is a set of research challenges identified by the workshop participants proposed as key areas for scientific investigations for a future trustworthy cyber infrastructure.  The workshop was attended by over 95 security researchers, at a variety of levels of seniority, with experience in research topics related to the NITRD Themes and Science of Cybersecurity, and some of the researchers with the potential to impact these themes in the future.  The focus included not only research topics and potential directions, but also information about the government agencies' interest areas to foster future collaborations. Additionally, many of the sessions provided general guidance for junior researchers on research directions and sources of funding. Participants included representatives from academia, industry, and program management.  The main body of the workshop was organized around four keynotes, an NSF TC program overview, four technical panels, and two project management panels.  As the keynote speakers and panelists represented academia, industry, and program management, a variety of perspectives were presented.  In addition to the keynote speakers and panel sessions, a breakout session was held to collect the key research challenges for the NITRD themes and Science of Cybersecurity.  The breakouts offered the prospective PIs a chance to ask questions to the panel speakers in a smaller group and brainstorm together to develop sets of key research challenges.  NSF funding was used to support the travel and local costs of attendees as well as for the meeting space and audiovisual costs.  The workshop agenda, slides, videos and a the full final report are available from the workshop website: http://tc2010.cse.psu.edu/   Joint Summer Schools on Cryptography and Principles of Software Security  http://cpss2012.cse.psu.edu  The Joint Summer Schools on Cryptography and Principles of Software Security were held May 30 to June 1, 2012. Over 75 students, postdocs and researchers from over 30 institutions attended the in-depth tutorials and hands-on lab sessions, delivered by 12 outstanding speakers. The lectures were held over three days, with additional activities scheduled to allow attendees to meet each other and the speakers and discuss research. Activities included a poster session where attendees presented recent work on topics related to the summer schools.   NSF funding was crucial to the summer schools' organization, providing support for speakers' and participants' travel and local costs. Approximately half of the participants were supported (in part or in full) by the award.  The speakers' slides and materials and a list of attendees and posters are available on the school website: http://cpss2012.cse.psu.edu       Last Modified: 01/11/2013       Submitted by: Adam Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
