<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the development of manufacturing methods of mixed ionic-electronic conducting thin film cathodes for intermediate temperature (IT) solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) based on novel additive deposition and patterning techniques.  The major advantage of the proposed method is that variable and precisely-controllable cathode material composition and morphology can be rapidly produced and studied.  In particular, the researchers will attempt to produce La1-xSrxFe1-yCoyO3 (LSCF) cathodes with various composition (stoichiometry) and morphologies by magnetron sputtering with multiple targets.   This enables systematic study of electrochemical activities of LSCF based cathode surfaces and interfaces by a variety of in situ and ex situ methods such as Raman spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).  Hence it allows the selection of an optimal LSCF thin film cathode for IT SOFC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to a low-cost and rapid manufacturing method for high performance IT SOFCs, which can generate electricity from a variety of fuels, such as hydrogen, methane, or carbon monoxide in an efficient and environmental friendly fashion.  The proposed research can potentially transform the current manufacturing practice of SOFCs and accelerate its commercialization process.  The multi-faceted research program involves tasks in advanced manufacturing, materials characterization, electrochemical and mechanical testing and modeling.  It provides an ideal setting for both materials science and mechanical engineering students to actively participate in project-based and hands-on research and learning. A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Central Florida and the University of South Carolina will have the opportunity to participate in various integrated team research and educational activities afforded by this program.</AbstractNarration>
