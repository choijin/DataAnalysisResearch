<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biofuels are of significant interest because of concerns over global warming and finite amounts of fossil fuels.  Today, most biofuels are produced from food crops (such as corn), and pose their own societal and environmental hazards.  The main obstacle in using non-food crops for biofuels production is the presence of lignin in the plant material.  Lignin is a complex compound that gives the plant material its structure, and must be separated from the more useful components of the plant material before further processing.  This is hard to achieve because of its complexity, and current industrial practices require harsh chemical processing that is more energy and cost intensive.  For this reason, biological alternatives for the breakdown and separation of lignin are currently under investigation as benign alternatives.  In this study, a biological catalyst (called an enzyme) was attached to a surface in order to make it more stable and reusable for industrial applications in biofuels processing.  Testing was carried out in Australia at the Commonwealth Scientific &amp; Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) under the guidance of Victoria Haritos, Andrew Warden, and Greg Dojchinov.  Their research group had previously been successful in immobilizing other enzymes to commercial surfaces, making them a great fit for collaboration.  Lignin peroxidase was the enzyme used, as it is found in nature as a means to break down the lignin in plant material and recycle carbon.  The lignin peroxidase was immobilized to CSIROÆs commercial surfaces, in order to compare its behavior to the enzyme unbound in solution.  I was also able to compare these results with novel immobilization techniques when I returned from Australia; this research made up the majority of my Masters thesis.  Attachment of lignin peroxidase to commercial carriers was successful, but once bound, the enzyme became inactive due to interactions with the surface.  However, this experience helped set up a protocol for immobilization of lignin peroxidase to a surface, and was useful when testing other locations on the enzyme for attachment in novel ways.  Using this knowledge, I was able to attach the lignin peroxidase to a glass surface through its carbohydrate groups, retaining some initial activity and making the enzyme reusable.  This is an important step in making biological catalysts an economically feasible alternative to current industrial practices used in biofuels processing.  Future work will focus on a better measurement technique for the enzymeÆs behavior on a surface, as well as optimization of the enzyme-surface environment.  Additionally, a paper for publication has been planned which includes this immobilization procedure.       Last Modified: 08/28/2011       Submitted by: Amanda R Grill]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
