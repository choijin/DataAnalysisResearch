<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This research develops a novel framework for interpolation and approximation of multivariate data.&lt;br/&gt;The research introduces a method for construction of non-separable multivariate splines that are geometrically&lt;br/&gt;tailored for general sampling lattices with emphasis on sphere packing and covering lattices&lt;br/&gt;in multidimensions. These multivariate splines lead to the design of multidimensional signal processing&lt;br/&gt;tools, that have proven degree of continuity and approximation order for sampling lattices.&lt;br/&gt;The splines under investigation, called Voronoi splines, are B-spline-like elements that inherit the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of any sampling lattice from its Voronoi cell and form basis for reconstruction. Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;the relationship of the proposed splines with the well-known multivariate box splines are investigated&lt;br/&gt;and used for evaluation purposes. Compared to other polyhedral splines, Voronoi splines form shiftinvariant&lt;br/&gt;spaces for approximation. This property makes them uniquely suitable for multidimensional&lt;br/&gt;signal processing.</AbstractNarration>
