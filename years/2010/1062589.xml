<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Georgia to provide research training for 9 weeks for 10 students, during the summers of 2011-2013.  The program focuses on the diverse functions of microorganisms using modern, interdisciplinary approaches.  The program involves the participation of over 20 faculty mentors from the Departments of Microbiology, Marine Sciences, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Genetics, Infectious Diseases, Population Health, Environmental Health Sciences, and Entomology.  Students do research that addresses broad questions ranging from the activities of microbes in environmental and geochemical processes to their symbiotic relationships with plants, animals and insects. Each student is expected to do full-time lab research under the supervision of a faculty mentor.  Additional supervision is provided by postdoctoral fellows and graduate students who receive training in best practices for undergraduate mentoring through an "Entering Mentoring" program.  Students are also expected to participate in seminars and workshops on the responsible conduct of research, the communication of scientific results, career opportunities in microbiology, and the graduate school application process. In addition, students present the results of their research in a poster session at the end of the program. Students have access to state-of-the-art research facilities in individual faculty mentors' labs, as well as departmental and interdepartmental core facilities.  Recruitment practices for the program include both mailings and digital-based advertising and are designed to generate a culturally and ethnically diverse pool of applicants. Students are selected based on their academic performance, interest in microbiology, and potential for conducting outstanding research in microbiology. Students are tracked to determine their career paths and the impact of their participation in the program on their career choices. The quality of research experiences for the undergraduate participants in the program will be assessed by a variety of methods, including use of common assessment tool for REU Site programs. Additional information about the program is available by visiting http://www.uga.edu/mib/reu/REUindex.htm, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Timothy Hoover at trhoover@uga.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Eric Stabb at estabb@uga.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the four years spanning 2011 to 2014, the University of Georgia NSF REU Site Award: Research in Prokaryotic Biology has trained a total of 41 undergraduate students in cutting-edge microbiological research techniques.  Thirty-seven of these students were directly supported by this funded NSF proposal, while the remaining four were supported by supplementary funding mechanisms.  Of the 37 directly supported students, nineteen were undergraduates at liberal arts schools or community colleges (51%), where focused research opportunities for these undergraduates rarely exist.  Twenty-two of those participants (59%) were members of underrepresented minority groups in STEM fields, or identified as deaf/hard-of-hearing.  Therefore, our program successfully provided research opportunities to student groups who are poorly represented in scientific careers.  Furthermore, this program has continued its strong support of training the deaf scientific community.              As a part of this program, all participants were offered a number of graduate-level seminar opportunities from faculty members external to UGA, thus diversifying their exposure to scientific programming at other Universities.  A number of workshops were held to provide information regarding professional careers in science that could be attained with a degree in microbiology (or other sciences), and to introduce students to ethical behaviors in data collection, scientific publication, and data ownership.  All 41 students presented a final poster presentation to the UGA at-large scientific community, and were able to hone their scientific presentation skills in front of their peers.  Finally, all faculty and graduate student trainers who were involved with this program had access to  "Entering Mentoring" workshops a premier workshop for the training of scientific mentors.              Thirty-four of our 41 participants have graduated from their home institutions, and the vast majority of those students have enrolled in either graduate or professional schools to further their educations.  Four of these thirty-four students (12%) came back to UGA to enroll in Ph.D. programs (Microbiology, Integrated Life Sciences), and one student from the 2014 training period was accepted into the NIH-funded PREP post-baccalaureate program in Infectious Diseases at UGA.  Therefore, five total REU students have come back to the University of Georgia for their post-baccalaureate education in the sciences, making this REU Site Award an extremely effective tool for recruiting graduate students back to UGA in STEM fields.              Over the four years of this award, our participants have made (and continue to make) important contributions to scientific discovery and in the dissemination of research to the community.  Two of our participants have successfully published their summer REU work in the primary scientific literature, in the Journal of Bacteriology (2012) and PLoS One (2015).  An additional two participants were selected to present their work at national symposiums: one at the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Symposium (REUS, 2013) and one at the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS, 2014).  Many of our participants presented their work at smaller, local symposia and conferences at their home institutions upon leaving our REU program.  Taken together, our participants have been successful in publishing their work in scientific journals, as well as being competitive for selection into nationally-recognized conferences.
