<AbstractNarration>Full Center Proposal (Phase I) for an I/UCRC for Advanced Space Technologies Research and Engineering Center &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0832517 University of Florida; Norman Fitz-Coy &lt;br/&gt;0832508 North Carolina State University; William Edmonson &lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Advanced Space Technologies Research and Engineering Center (ASTREC)" that will develop new knowledge, tools, hardware, and personnel required for advanced space technologies. ASTREC will establish this multi-university collaboration between two research institutions in the southeast, University of Florida (UF) and North Carolina State University (NCSU).  The proposed research aims at advancing knowledge by performing multidisciplinary research and providing breakthrough technologies in each of the satellite subsystems for pico/-nano-class of satellites. By focusing on small satellites of the pico- and nano-class drives the technology research to be constrained by low power, mass and volume. Through a Design-Build-Fly (DBF) philosophy, the center?s research mission is to perform leading-edge research that is industry driven to produce technologically small satellites and components, which will be on-orbit validated and demonstrated. The proposed work is important because it seeks to develop more agile space assets through developing innovative technologies and processes.  Due to the diverse technologies that make up a satellite, those involved in the center?s research will come from engineering, the physical sciences and biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The efforts of ASTREC will provide the space industry with a class of satellites that cost less to develop and build without becoming technologically dated at launch.  Through the success of its DBF philosophy, ASTREC will assist in the transformation of the space industry from risk adverse towards risk tolerant design.  The Center plans to engage K-20 students in all aspects of small satellite design through hands-on cradle-to-grave experience to create the next generation of "rocket scientists". ASTREC has a strong diversity plan that ensures the participation of underrepresented groups in all levels of the Center. Extensive experience in fostering participation of underrepresented in research and education will add value to the center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Advanced Space Technologies Research &amp; Engineering Center (ASTREC) formed in August 2008 as a multi-university center represented by the University of Florida (UF) and North Carolina A&amp;T University (NCAT)  Although the Center primarily serves the space industry, its technology has spin-off applications for many industries that use lightweight low powered devices that operate in extreme environments (e.g., search and rescue, micro-aerial vehicles).   The mission of ASTREC is to serves the space industry through fundamental and applied research that results in innovative technologies for the industry and an active program of technology transfer. The Center provides a global research, education, and training resource for the space industry by developing innovative materials, processes, and systems that sustain and improve the economic well being of the industry.   The technical goals of ASTREC consist of the following:  Advance, develop and promote research into the principles and technology of responsive, cost efficient spacecraft systems through research, development, education, and technology exchange among academic, industrial, and government entities Increase the quantity and quality of professionals prepared to work in this area Involve the faculty of the Center universities in research in areas of common interest to sponsors and the universities Perform research that will promote the global competitiveness of U.S. space technologies   The specific research projects investigated in this Center focus on areas such as:  guidance, navigation &amp; control command and data handling communications (tracking, telemetry &amp;      command) propulsion/reaction control system electrical power system structures, mechanisms, thermal control payload   The outcome of this center's activity has resulted in the publishing of many papers on small satellite technology and systems development, the graduation of students whose research was in this area, and the exposure of K-12 teachers to satellite engineering and Earth and space science. The research and development at NC A&amp;T University focused on developing best system engineering processes for the design of small satellites, radiation-hardened power supply, flexible data bus, and solar-thermal micro-propulsion system.
