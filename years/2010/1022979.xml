<AbstractNarration>This is an iterative data-model investigation of the relationship between paleoclimate and long-term carbon accumulation from Alaskan arctic peatland archives. The hypothesis is that climate controls carbon storage in peatlands through shifts in temperature and moisture related processes of production and decomposition. Use of an existing set of peatland cores from two arctic regions from the late-glacial to the Holocene offers a variety of climate scenarios to examine carbon sequestration. For example, the group hypothesizes that warm, dry intervals result in peatland carbon storage decline, while cool, wet climates result in increased carbon sequestration. Using new tools, including compound-specific isotope and biomarker analysis, and existing traditional paleoclimate proxies such as pollen, macrofossils, and bryophytes, the researchers will produce detailed climate and hydrological reconstructions, and high resolution AMS-14C dating, C and bulk density measurements will provide carbon accumulation rates from the late-glacial to the present and enable the team to test their carbon sequestration-climate hypotheses using a newly-developed mechanistic peatland accumulation model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As high latitudes warm and arctic and subarctic peatlands provide positive and negative carbon feedbacks to the climate system, it is important to add the paleo-perspective to our understanding of magnitude and temporal and spatial scales. This research will couple detailed analysis of changes in paleoecology/paleoclimate (through bryophyte, compound-specific isotope analysis, pollen, and macrofossil analysis) in high latitude peatlands over the last glacial-interglacial cycle with quantification of carbon sequestration in different environments (i.e., wet vs. drier muskegs). These paleo-peatland histories will provide long-term carbon sequestration records, which can be used for comparisons with paleoclimate reconstructions from the same sediments, as well as ice cores, marine records, and lake stratigraphy. The independent paleoclimate data will be utilized by the new Holocene Peatland Model to simulate coupled carbon and water dynamics of northern peatlands at an annual time step over time scales of decades to millennia. The model-simulated carbon accumulation record can be then compared with the peatland histories, and differences evaluated in terms of plant composition, productivity, and decomposition. This iterative model-data research will provide long-term empirical information necessary to evaluate the role of the hydrological cycle in future wetland carbon cycling, and the past importance of climate and vegetation in sequestering carbon over millennia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The selected sites for new sampling include peatlands of Alaska?s North Slope at Toolik Lake where an extensive ecological database exists as well as the arctic foothills of the western Mesa site. AMS 14C ages, as well as Pb-210 and Cs-137, will be used in conjunction with C and bulk density to determine carbon accumulation for each site. Analysis of bryophyte and isotopes/biomarkers will provide defined moisture regimes as well as possible water chemistry changes due to volcanic ash deposition in these sites. Of particular interest are climatic intervals such as the Bolling-Allerod/Younger Dryas, the early Holocene, the Preboreal and 8200-yr events, mid-Holocene, the Neoglacial, Little Ice Age, and the last 50 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve at least 4 undergraduate theses and one postdoc. The PI has a well-documented record of mentoring undergraduates and advising graduate students in field and lab-based programs, with many of her former advisees publishing their results in peer-reviewed journals. Students will have an opportunity to present results at the local, state, and national levels. The group will continue its long leadership in science programs training high school students and teachers at NASA/GISS summer program for minorities and Columbia University?s Department of Earth and Environmental Science graduate and undergraduate students, as well as local outreach to museums and public programs. They intend to engage a K-12 teacher in their field and lab research in the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory VAST (Visiting Arctic/subarctic Summer Teacher) program for far-ranging impact. Additionally, their analyses can be utilized for the Columbia University courses the PI teaches on Wetlands and Climate Change, Terrestrial Paleoclimate, as well as seminars in Plant Ecology and Paleoecology, and in courses the UNH PI teaches (Biogeochemistry and Environmental Modeling). The results and conclusions of this work will have implications for arctic climate policy, ecosystem management, and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ OUTCOMES  I. We participated in northern peatland carbon accumulation compilation of 127 sites (Loisel et al., 2014) showing that highest carbon accumulation in peatlands (127 sites) at 25-28 gC/m2/yr was in early Holocene, when climate was warmest (Loisel et al., 2014).  The database is publicly available at https://peatlands.lehigh.  II.  We presented a novel method for quantifying the proportion of carbon Sphagnum assimilates from its methanotrophic symbionts using stable isotope ratios of leaf-wax biomarkers (Nichols et al., 2014).  With this new approach, d13C of Sphagnum compounds are now a useful tool for investigating the relationships among hydrology, vegetation, and methanotrophy in Sphagnum peatlands over the time scales of entire peatland sediment records, vital to our understanding of the  global carbon cycle through the Late Glacial and Holocene. Data are available on Nichols LDEO website, (http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~jnichols/) and will be submitted to NEOTOMA.  III.  Climate Controls on Vegetation and Carbon in Coastal Alaskan Peatland (Nichols et al., 2015; Peteet et al., 2016)  The last 11,500 years of vegetational change as revealed from pollen and macrofossils in an Alaskan fen near Cordova (Corser Bog, 60.5296364&deg;N, 145.453858&deg;W) reveals how this remote part of the Alaskan coastline shifts with climate change.   Initially, a shallow lake formed as glaciers melted.  Aquatics plants such as water lilies and pondweed are found along with pioneering alder shrubs which colonized the adjacent mineral landscape, fixing nitrogen which make the soil richer for other plants to grow through the promotion of bacterial and fungal communities in the soils.  Alder continued to thrive as a foundational species throughout the early Holocene warming and as Sphagnum moss arrived, peak carbon accumulated (27-50 g/m2/yr), a pattern found throughout Alaska and the northern hemisphere (Loisel et al., 2014).    About 7500 years ago, a shift from moss to sedge peat in the sediment core is paralleled by an increase in sedge pollen, very few macrofossils preserved, and a generally more evaporative climate with a lower water table. Nearby lake sites have a hiatus due to drier conditions during this interval, and peatland records both to the north and south along the coast indicate similar climatic conditions.   Carbon accumulation rates slow down considerably during this mid-Holocene interval, with rates as low as 13 grams of carbon per meter squared per year.   About 3.7 ka a regional shift in climate is indicated at this site and northward as well southward, through the change from sedge peat to mossy Sphagnum peat and the arrival of first sitka spruce and then western and mountain hemlock in the region.  These trees migrated northward along the coastline, and the conditions were right for their establishment near Cordova.  Alder (Alnus) pollen provides an an early warning signal for warming and ice melt as the shrub increases in the twentieth century due to colonization of bare ground after glaciers recede and ice melts due to documented temperature increase. Data is being archived in NEOTOMA and is available on Nichols LDEO website, (http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~jnichols/).  IV.  This grant has supported postdoc Jonathan Nichols, four undergraduates (one who finished her senior thesis on one of our bog sites), and three high school students as well as two high school teachers throughout the course of the project.  One of the high school teachers participated in the field research in Alaska.  Two international workshops were organized by Nichols and held at LDEO, and we participated in a climate change in the classroom workshop at NASA/GISS.   Four papers have been published and one is in review&hellip;several more are forthcoming.             Last Modified: 11/30/2015       Submitted by: Dorothy M Peteet]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
