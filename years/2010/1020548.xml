<AbstractNarration>This project builds upon the successful Phase 1 project, STEM Real World Applications Modules. New modules are developed which are closely tied to classroom concepts with mathematics used in industry. The team of investigators includes leaders in the mathematical research and educational communities, and mathematicians with years of industry experience. The overarching goal of this team is to show undergraduate students that strong mathematical skills leads to more employment options and greater chances of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dissemination plan has three main components. The project impacts students and faculty members nationwide through distribution of effective teaching materials. A key part of the dissemination starts with 12 faculty members at 7 additional institutions beta testing the developed modules. After beta-testing, the modules are made available on the project website. Finally presentations about the modules and their effect on student learning are given at conferences, and articles about the modules are submitted to educational and research journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the main tools for dealing with massive data sets is to use the information networks which represent the relations among the data points. There are many challenging mathematical and algorithmic problems when we deal with complex and massive information networks. Guided by real world examples, graph theory is particularly suited for the study of complex networks. Several graduate and undergraduate projects have been developed under this grants.  Instead of the question of ``Can you hear the shape of a drum?", we consider the question of ``Can you hear the shape of a network?"   The eigenvalues of the graphs are closely related to the structures and behavior of the graph. The topological invariants such as connectivity is related to the multiplicities of the eigenvalues. The graph distances and diameters are associated with the size of the spectral gaps. In particular, the visualizations of graphs by giving geometric representation of the linkage patterns serve as research topics for independent studies for  students with computing skills. Some graphs drawings of real world networks are illustrated in the attached images.  In addition to undergraduate projects,  five Ph. D. dissertations on these topics  were completed which were supervised by the PIs and were partly supported by this grant. A dozen or so research papers have been published.
