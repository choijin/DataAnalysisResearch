<AbstractNarration>Growth of an animal from an egg to an adult requires the generation of thousands of different kinds of cells. Each cell must respond correctly to the molecular signals that specify its ultimate fate, for the consequences of mistakes are death or disease. The question of how cells discriminate between signals that differ only subtly from one another is particularly challenging. A textbook example is sex determination in the fruit fly, Drosophila, yet, as shown in this work, the textbook version is wrong in fundamental details. This project exploits unique genetic tools to determine how flies tell whether they have one X chromosome and develop as males or two Xs and grow as females. The expectation is that responses to signals occur in small steps and that the steps reinforce one another. The result is an amplification of a small initial difference into a reliable response. Females initiate development first because of the slightly higher two-X signal. This leads to a chain of events that simultaneously increases the female program while dampening the male one, thus ensuring proper female development. Reciprocally, the lower initial signal in males promotes male development by making it progressively harder to carry out the female program. Because the molecules involved are general regulators of animal development, the mechanisms by which they work in fly sex should apply to many aspects of animal development. The broader impact of this work rests on the principle of analogy. Experimental systems like the fly can reveal levels of detail that approaches what actually exists in the living organism. This lets researchers in less tractable systems take shortcuts to the correct answers. The textbook status of sex determination reinforces the educational and scientific impacts of the lessons and analogies, but also makes it imperative to correct the textbooks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Normal growth and development of animals often requires cells to reliably distinguish subtle differences in the molecular signals that tell a cell what to become, how to become that cell, and how to maintain that identity in the face of competing information.  Mistakes anywhere can lead to disease or developmental abnormalities.    Sex determination in the fruit fly Drosophila is an experimental system ideally suited to understand how small molecular differences elicit completely reliable cellular fates.  Indeed, fly sex determination serves as a textbook example of these questions.  For the fly, the question is how to tell whether it has one X chromosome or two so that it can develop appropriately as a male or a female.  The subtle two-fold differences in the molecules that signal X chromosome dose are challenging to measure in the test tube yet the fly carries out the process with perfect reliability.  We have made important advances in understanding how this dose-sensitive genetic process operates.  We have identified the specific sites were several key molecules function in the cell and revealed details about how, where, and when the key molecular decisions are made.  One of our most striking findings is that one protein thought to directly activate the genetic program of sex, paradoxically functions by silencing the activity of other proteins that repress the genetic program.  Perhaps the most outcome part of this project was the development of powerful new experimental tools that should allow the identification of every important gene involved in assessing X chromosome dose.  Achieving this long-sought goal of Drosophila sex determination should lead to a sophisticated understanding of how this exquisitely dose-sensitive genetic program operates inside the cell.     The importance of this, like all work with "model organisms", is that it provides deep insight into the logic controlling the functions and fates of cells.  This insight serves as a foundation that facilitates the making of analogies with more complex, or less experimentally tractable, organisms.  The analogies in turn guide experiments that foster deeper understanding of human health and disease.          Last Modified: 03/14/2017       Submitted by: James Erickson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
