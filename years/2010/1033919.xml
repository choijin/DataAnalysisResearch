<AbstractNarration>1033919 &lt;br/&gt;Zhigilei&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) suggests they are a promising candidate for an array of thermal management solutions. However, the measured thermal transport properties of CNT mats and films range from those characteristic of thermal insulators to effective heat conductors. The objective of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of how the thermal properties of composite mats, films and other structures that consist of thousands of interacting CNTs depend on the structural arrangement of the CNTs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: A model will be developed to simulate the coupled thermal, structural, and mechanical effects that ultimately determine the thermal transport properties of CNT-based nanocomposites. The model will include description of tube-to-tube interactions, and atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations will be used to guide the design of a mesoscopic model.  Systematic analyses will reveal the relationship between the CNT structure and thermal transport properties of the nanocomposite material. The effect of mechanical deformation of CNT-based materials on heat transfer will also be investigated and related to the changes in the structural characteristics of the materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  This research may be useful in modeling other types of nanofiber and nanowire structures, as well as in computational studies of biological systems. The educational program involves student participation in various aspects of high-performance computing, incorporation of the research results into graduate and upper-undergraduate courses, and the development of an interactive web-site that will provide a non-technical description of general concepts of the linkage between heat transfer and the mechanical behavior of CNT-reinforced nanocomposite materials to a broad audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The design of new materials for thermal management at micro/nano scales is crucial for sustained advancement and miniaturization of microelectronic devices. Due to the high thermal conductivity and large surface area of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), CNT-based materials are considered to be promising candidates for the design of tiny heat sinks for cooling of microprocessors and other microelectronic devices. To fully realize the potential of CNT materials in thermal management applications, an improved understanding of the structural and thermal properties of these complex network materials is needed.  In the NSF-sponsored research, Professor Zhigilei and his team at the University of Virginia have developed a coarse-grained dynamic model capable of computationally efficient simulation of structural self-organization in systems composed of tens of thousands of nanotubes and applied the model for investigation of the relationship between the structure of CNT materials and their thermal properties. The ability to connect the elementary steps in the heat transfer (heat transfer within an individual CNT and through CNT-CNT contacts, thermal resistance of buckling kinks and other defects) to the average heat conductivity of a system consisting of thousands of CNTs is the unique feature of the model.  The mesoscopic calculations, thus, provide an important and currently missing link between the results of experimental measurements of the macroscopic (effective) thermal conductivity of CNT materials and the results of atomistic simulations that reveal detailed information on the heat transfer within and between the individual structural elements of the CNT materials.  Some of the results obtained in this project are illustrated in the attached Figure and include:  (1) identification of bending buckling as a critical factor responsible for stability of CNT network structures (Figure A) and quantitative evaluation of the effect of the thermal resistance of buckling kinks on the thermal conductivity of CNT materials (Figure B);  (2) prediction of a strong effect of the finite thermal conductivity of individual nanotubes on the effective (macroscopic) conductivity of CNT materials; derivation of an analytical equation describing the effect of finite intrinsic thermal conductivity of CNTs on thermal conductivity of different CNT materials (Figure C);  (3) establishment of several distinct regimes of the mechanical energy dissipation in stretching and bending oscillations of CNTs; identification of the onset of axial or bending buckling as the condition for the transition from the regimes of slow thermalization to rapid damping of the acoustic oscillations (Figure E);  (4) design and parameterization of a "heat bath" description of thermal energy in a mesoscopic model capable of simulating systems consisting of thousands of interacting CNTs;  (5) conclusion (based on results of atomistic simulations) on negligible effect of van der Waals interactions between defect-free well-aligned CNTs in a bundle on the intrinsic conductivity of the CNTs (Figure D);  (6) conclusion (based on results of atomistic simulations) on direct proportionality of the inter-tube conductance to the length of the overlap region between the CNTs;  (7) derivation of general scaling laws predicting the quadratic dependence of the bundle conductivity on the length of individual CNTs in the case when the thermal transport is controlled by the inter-tube conductance and the independence of the CNT length in another limiting case when the intrinsic conductivity of CNTs plays the dominant role;  (8) quantitative evaluation of the structural dependence of gas permeability in films composed of continuous networks of CNTs;  (9) demonstration of the ability of the MAPLE technique to eject and transfer large bundles and tangles of CNTs that can be incorporated into nanostructured films and coatings deposited by MAPLE (Figure F).
