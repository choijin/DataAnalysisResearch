<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to integrate multiple quality-constrained cell-phone-based pico-projectors as to create quality output and improve the viewing experience of users 'on the go' during a multimedia session, i.e., watching a video, or sharing a multimedia presentation. The proposed approach is to develop coding and decoding schemes to allow flexible split stream media delivery that takes into account the number of displays for image partitioning and accommodates a range of resolutions, frame rates, and device power resources. Additionally, novel synchronization schemes that integrate display synchronization and video/audio stream synchronization across multiple devices will be investigated. Current multi-projector registration techniques need to be modified for resource and quality sensitivity for use in low-quality pico-projectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes a new paradigm of resource management, device synchronization and video coding/decoding for portable multimedia devices to collaboratively deliver an enhanced viewing experience for users, where 'enhanced' refers to frame rate, image resolution, brightness, audio quality, and power savings for longer viewing. This paradigm parallels the MIMO concept in wireless communications by introducing spatial diversity in video display. MIMO enhances the data rate and/or the signal quality, the results of this project is expected to enhance the image resolution and/or brightness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed paradigm will allow multiple users to pool the resources of mobile portable devices to produce a higher quality, energy/resource efficient output, anywhere, anytime. This will impact users 'on the go' in ad hoc settings, ranging from media sharing in social milieus to first responders and emergency workers requiring higher quality image output in the field.</AbstractNarration>
