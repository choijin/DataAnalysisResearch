<AbstractNarration>Noyce Abstract 1035322&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirty-four secondary STEM teachers are being certified through one of three program options:  traditional four year program leading to a BA or BS in mathematics or BA in biology; a two year MAT pathway for STEM professionals seeking a career change; and, a new fifth year MAT program (MAT5) for students who first wish to complete the STEM degree and continue for a fifth year to earn teacher certification.  Projections are for the production of seven teachers via the traditional route, six MAT career changers and twenty-one MAT5 graduates during the five year program.  The thirty-four Noyce scholar-teachers are in addition to the anticipated thirty new teachers to graduate without Noyce support.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Noyce program builds on the existing Center for Educator Recruitment and partnership with College of Education Teacher Quality program, NetSCOPE.  Connections to high needs schools have been established by NetSCOPE and provide Noyce scholars interaction with students, observation of classrooms and teleconferences with teachers and administrators in various school districts and opportunities to investigate research-based practices on working with diverse student needs.  There are seven high needs school districts that are collaborating with the Noyce program: Cherokee County Schools; Chester County Schools; Fairfield County Schools; Lancaster County Schools; Union County Schools, York School District 1; and, Rock Hill Schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Winthrop Initiative for STEM Educators (WISE) at Winthrop University was a collaboration between faculty in the Colleges of Arts and Sciences and Education.  WISE consisted of two primary components: an Internship; and a Scholars Program. The Internship introduced 65 first- and second-year Winthrop and York Technical College STEM majors to disciplinary research, career options, and STEM education in public schools.  The Scholars Program provided 44 scholarships with mentoring for students in the final two years of a certification program.     WISE had four main goals:    Enhance students? understanding of potential teaching careers Increase the number of students in math and science teaching certification programs Enhance WISE scholars? preparation in math and science teaching certification programs Enhance the capacity of recent WISE graduates as they enter the workforce      Internship  The Internship addressed all goals and was open to all high-achieving STEM students as an early opportunity for exploration; a total of 65 students participated. Interns broad range of STEM and education topics and developed as STEM majors regardless of their ultimate desire to teach. Internship provided participants opportunities to work in area high-need middle and high schools.  This aspect allowed the Interns to experience public education as a prospective teacher, thereby discovering the role that all STEM professionals can play in the development of STEM knowledge through schools. Further the WISE Interns visited STEM-related businesses to explore careers beyond education, while panels of STEM professionals discussed paths to various environments.     Research experience was another significant portion. Interns worked in disciplinary teams to engage in group and individual exploration that served as a springboard for future opportunities. In various years, Interns explored levels of microscopic life in a local wetlands area, examined sustainable approaches to agriculture, determined efficient means of water purification, and mathematically modeled both the spread of disease and the efficacy of certain types of cancer treatment. The Interns worked with educators to explore best-practices in classroom teaching, and developed an understanding of STEM education research.     Beginning in 2012, the structure and approach for the WISE Internship was examined by other on-campus research groups as a model for distinguishing between first experiences in content research and the research done by upper-level students. The small-group, intensive morning/day sessions in labs and/or in the field along with related field trips were incorporated into two subsequent undergraduate research experience programs on the Winthrop campus.     A significant aim of the WISE Internship was to recruit students to the teaching profession; however, we recognized that not all of the interns would choose teaching. Therefore we consistently integrated the impact citizens have on local schools and ways that STEM professionals can contribute to local schools.  Topics included the influence of voters, issues of school finance, the impact and outcomes of grants, and volunteerism as a responsibility that accompanies STEM expertise.     Overall, the WISE Internship was a fast-paced experience that utilized a high-touch, high-impact design to provide a lasting experience for participants.  It engaged talented STEM majors early in their college career, and resulted in retention of 92% of participants as STEM majors; 18 participants pursued STEM teacher certification; and the development of research agendas and/or skills in research that quickly advanced participants as STEM professionals.     Scholars   The Scholars program was designed to support STEM education teacher candidates both financially and professionally, and it addressed all four WISE goals.  Grant funds provided 44 students up to $20,000 in direct support to pursue teacher certification in biology, chemistry, or mathematics through any of the Winthrop University teacher education options. In addition to direct financial support, Scholars received (a) specialized, STEM-focused mentoring into the crucial first-year of teaching; (b) access to state and national professional organization memberships; and (c) support for participation at regional STEM education conferences. The Scholars program was a significant recruitment opportunity in addition to the benefit of studying at an institution that leads our state in teacher preparation both as an initial profession and as a career change.     A total of 33 WISE Scholars now teach in the Southeast in high-need schools with 6 still finishing coursework.  Many of our Scholars have been identified both on and off campus for excellence.  Two WISE Scholars were as Knowles Scholars, and one was among the first three teacher candidates selected to participate in an international teaching experience through a Winthrop partnership with a school in China.       Summary  WISE produced an impressive record of results, including the fact that of the 92 individual students impacted by WISE, 43 (47%) conducted additional STEM research beyond the WISE. With 33 Scholars now teaching in high-needs schools, 92% of Interns retained in STEM majors, and an influence on the design and implementation of other undergraduate research experiences at Winthrop, WISE will have lasting impacts on the region?s students and the STEM disciplines for many years to come.
