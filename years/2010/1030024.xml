<AbstractNarration>SES-1030024&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Francisco Ramirez&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Susan Garnett Russell&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the politics of curriculum reform and the role of education policy in promoting reconciliation, social reconstruction, and civic identity at the community level in Rwanda in the post-genocide period. This research will utilize a mixed methodology approach combining quantitative data from surveys with qualitative data from interviews, classroom observations, and content analysis of textbooks and policy documents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This research informs education and curricular policy in post-conflict nations. In societies that have undergone inter-group conflict and must deal with past human rights violations and mass atrocities, the construction of a new civic identity and interpretation of past events is paramount for societal reconstruction and for preventing future conflicts.</AbstractNarration>
