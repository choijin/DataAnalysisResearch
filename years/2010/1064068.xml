<AbstractNarration>Although computers can help us find documents about various topics and even answer a great number of factual questions -- just consider IBM's Watson -- they are still far from showing a human-like capability to reason on the basis of natural language statements. This workshop aims at improving these capabilities by concentrating on a manageable step in the process: figuring out how to have a computer make inferences on the basis of textual input. For instance if the system is given two sentences, can it figure out whether one implies the other or whether one contradicts the other? Or whether they have nothing to do with each other? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building systems that can match this performance requires the collaboration of researchers in computational natural language understanding and semanticists.  It moreover requires a form of semantics that is appropriate to this task, which, unfortunately, is not the form practiced by most academic semanticists at the moment. This workshop intends to improve the collaboration between the computational community and linguistic semanticists as a step to a common framework for natural language based reasoning.</AbstractNarration>
