<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, the EPSCoR Office, and the Office of International Science and Engineering, Professors Jerzy Maselko and Jim Pantaleone of the University of Alaska at Anchorage will study the self-construction of complex chemical precipitation structures. These structures occur in relatively simple chemical systems such as Cu[II] - oxalate; however, preliminary experiments have revealed very unusual structures on the scale of millimeters to centimeters that are some of the most complex inorganic chemical structures known. The network of chemical and physical processes that controls the trajectory of structure formation will be explored and quantitatively described.  This project will deepen our understanding of how complex structures form in biological systems and may also lead to technology for "growing" complex structures on scales of nanometers and above. In addition, Alaskan undergraduate students will reap cultural and academic benefits from research stays at a Polish university.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This was a study of chemical structures whose complexity increases continuously.  These structures develop from a chemical "seed" into structures that resemble those found in biology.  Similar systems have been known for a long time and are usually called "chemical gardens" or "silicate gardens".  However for our systems the dynamics are more complex than previously reported in traditional chemical gardens.   The behaviors of these systems are controlled by a network of physical and chemical processes that are precisely organized in space and time.    The process of growth begins with the formation of a semi-permeable membrane around a chemical cell.  Chemicals then diffuse into the cell, react and cause changes in the cell structure.   For example, the cell may "sprout" tubes, move or turn over.  The structures shown in the previous two figures were made by pumping one chemical into another  or by dropping a pellet of one chemical into another   The structures produced are obviously sensitive to how the one chemical is introduced into another.  Thus in another set of experiments we used a different method, dripping one chemical into another.  These experiments explored how hydrodynamics can be used to control the shape of the chemical cell produced.  In addition to the structures shown above, we have found ways to make chemical cells whose membranes are made from elastic, inorganic 3-D polymers.  These cells are a source of interesting behaviors that have never been reported before.  For example the cells, due to osmotic pressure, can increase in volume by a factor of at least fifteen.  The structures we have observed are made from many different physical and chemical processes.    It is hoped that by learning to control these processes may lead to new technology.  This technology would be very different from conventional human technology where structures are assembled by agents from previously prepared parts.  Biological-like growth technology is more efficient for nano and micro structures and also for soft matter.  We believe that this new chemical technology, based on the biomimetics, will be an important technology of the future.  Intellectual merit:  Our research makes important contributions to the fields of Complex Systems, Systems Chemistry, the Origin of Life, and Artificial Life. For example, the formation of a chemical cell that can exist far from thermodynamic equilibrium, and can perform some simple tasks, was probably the first step in the origin of life.  The fact that cell formation can happen spontaneously in simple, two component, inorganic systems suggests that the origin and evolution of life is not so improbable. In addition, our research may be the beginning of a new technology mimicking biological growth.  Broader impact:  Nine undergraduate students participated in this project.  Our undergraduate students learned how to plan and design experiments and how to collect data using electronic devices.  The students worked in interdisciplinary teams involving chemists, physicists, mathematicians and engineers.  The project was international, with the students conducting research at the University of Alaska, Anchorage and also at the Wroclaw University of Technology in Wroclaw Poland (the best technical university in Poland).  Our students had the opportunity to learn about European history and culture.  They cooperated with the Polish researchers and two articles about the cooperation were published in a bulletin at the Wroclaw University and one at UAA, and more are preparation.  Our group organized an international conference in 2013: "Emergence in chemical Systems 3.0".   Students had the opportunity to present posters and talks with the best scientists in the country.  Without this grant it would not have been possible to organize this conference.  Two papers where published in scientific journals, two were submitted and two are in preparation.  Videos from many of these experiments will be posted on Y...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
