<AbstractNarration>The workshop aims to bring together experts in selected fields of geophysics and&lt;br/&gt;physical volcanology, qualified graduate students, and early career scientists to discuss oscillatory source processes in volcanic fluids and plumes.&lt;br/&gt;There are two primary objectives for the FOVSys II Workshop. The first is to bring more cohesion to the fields of volcano geophysics and physical&lt;br/&gt;volcanology. The second aim is to take the original orkshop topic, escalate the eruptive intensity, and consider processes closer to the vent and aloft. The conveners propose to address the increasingly available geophysical data sets for Vulcanian to Plinian eruptions, and consider how researchers can use these&lt;br/&gt;data in the fields of explosive volcanism, physical volcanology, eruption prediction, and hazard forecasting.</AbstractNarration>
