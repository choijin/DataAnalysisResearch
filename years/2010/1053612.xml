<AbstractNarration>As Americans become increasingly concerned about issues of global environmental change and freshwater resources, the national network of NSF-supported Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites has been a critical institution for measuring and modeling ecological change and advancing the understanding of aquatic ecosystems. This project will result in the production of a documentary media package to communicate research in long-term ecological change and forecasting in watersheds across the network of LTER sites. This media package will be targeted at television, academic, and community planning audiences, and will include a feature-length documentary film, a series of documentary short videos, and a comprehensive media kit for news outlets and science programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses a growing need for greater public awareness and literacy of ecological and land use change, freshwater ecosystem conservation issues, and the role of ecological forecasting in environmental and land use planning. Audiences will gain a greater awareness of the scientists and institutions that are working to understand and predict interactions among social-ecological systems under scenarios of climate, landscape, and land use change. This project will contribute to career development in science communication by involving at least one student from a science film-making program.</AbstractNarration>
