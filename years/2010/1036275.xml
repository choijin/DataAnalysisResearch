<AbstractNarration>The research will provide the necessary field support, laboratory studies, and data analyses of the NSF vertical cavity surface emitting laser hygrometer (VCSEL) onboard the NSF G-V research aircraft for HIAPER Pole-Pole Observations (HIPPO) #3. This research will provide a foundation for examining the climatologies of ice supersaturated regions in the upper troposphere. Ice supersaturated regions are important in identifying mechanisms of ice nucleation in the upper troposphere, understanding the transport of water vapor into the stratosphere, and determining the radiative properties of the tropopause region. The HIPPO Global field campaign offers a unique opportunity to examine ice supersaturation climatologies on a global scale including the poorly sampled southern latitudes and polar regions. The VCSEL dataset from HIPPO Global #3 will be submitted per science team protocols (quick look, preliminary, and final data) and intercompared with other sensors both in-flight and in the laboratory. Post-mission and pre-mission calibrations of the instrument will also be done using a number of orthogonal methods uniquely designed for the compact, VCSEL hygrometer. The VCSEL dataset for other field deployments (e.g. PREDICT) during the reporting period will also be supported in terms of pre- and post-mission calibrations and data analyses and quality control if requested. In combination, the VCSEL dataset from HIPPO and other campaigns will provide the most comprehensive examination of the scales, magnitudes, and frequencies of ice supersaturated regions in the troposphere. Analyses of the VCSEL water vapor dataset, in conjunction with other measurements during HIPPO and other campaigns, will be important to identify the influence of human activities on climate. Also, the principal investigator intends to work with undergraduate students to develop a new web-based "Atmospheric Chemistry Library" using HIPPO data and published literature. The site will summarize the properties of atmospheric trace gases (concentrations, distributions, lifetime, sources, sinks, vertical profiles, trends, and seasonal variations). The investigator envisions this will be similar to the NIST Chemistry webbook and will be useful for teachers, researchers, and the general public for accurate information on trace gas constituents in the atmosphere.</AbstractNarration>
