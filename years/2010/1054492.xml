<AbstractNarration>In a denial of service attack on a wireless sensor network, an attacker can cause the network nodes to perform useless work until they fully discharge their batteries. To defend against such attacks, each node in a wireless sensor network needs to view its action executions as moves in a game whose ultimate objective is two-fold:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the node needs to execute enough actions so that its reputation as a reliable node remains high between its neighboring nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, the node needs to refrain from executing some actions in order to ensure that the lifetime of its battery remains long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are working on constructing a utility function for this game and analyzing various ways in which the game can reach an equilibrium state, where the minimum battery discharges in the network are minimized and the node reputations remain high.</AbstractNarration>
