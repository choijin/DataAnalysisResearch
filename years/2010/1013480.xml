<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a unique packed bed (no catalyst) reactor that can internally maintain temperatures for converting H2S to hydrogen and sulfur.  This reactor helps to defeat the equilibrium limitation of the standard Claus Reaction and in addition allows one to capture hydrogen which is otherwise expended as a waste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to focus attention on the production of sulfur from petroleum refinery waste streams of H2S instead of treating the  hydrogen as a waste exhaust gas (as the Claus process does). This process allows for the use of hydrogen both as a fuel and also to drive turbines and thereby save energy.  Furthermore, hydrogen is a carbonless fuel.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Under this Phase I Small Business Innovative Research project, Innovative Energy Solution modified its superadiabatic autothermal reforming process, a partial oxidation process marketed as the SuperATR, to increase the hydrogen yield from hydrogen sulfide cracking.  In reforming hydrogen sulfide to hydrogen and sulfur, the process achieved a 38% hydrogen yield thus surpassing its main objective by one point.  In effect, Innovative Energy Solution achieved another milestone with the 38% hydrogen yield from hydrogen sulfide.  During the development of the original SuperATR process a couple of years back, the 31% yield represented a milestone then as it as the highest yield in a thermal process.  Until to that time; the highest yield (22%) was obtained by a competing process under development by Alberta Sulfur Research Limited, Canada.  The yield could have reached above 40%, with higher firing rates for higher temperatures.  But the simple bench-scale SuperATR reactor, constructed with quartz, did not permit higher firing rates due to safety limits.  With natural gas reforming, a 65% hydrogen yield was obtained with the bench-scale reactor and 64% in the pilot unit.              The new and improved reformer will be marketed in the SuperATR-max brand.  Those improvements were achieved by significant modifications made to the existing bench and pilot-plant scale reactors to include: a) addition of a new reaction zone at the reactorÃ†s mid-axial center and b) improved heat exchangers.  The additional reaction zone, resulting in a total of three reactions zones in a single chamber, effectively turn the whole reactor into a high temperature volume.  The improved heat exchangers operate with a high circulation rate of water, as the coolant, to quickly quench the product stream for preventing recombination reactions.  The company conducted a wide array of experiments reforming both hydrogen sulfide and natural gas in two types of SuperATR reactors: 1) a bench scale for hydrogen sulfide along with natural gas and 2) a pilot plant scale reactor for natural gas.  It was concluded that four factors produce the highest hydrogen yield:      i)     High Temperature: This requirement is key to overcoming the equilibrium limitation of hydrogen sulfide reforming.       ii)    Residence time: A critical parameter that must be coupled with temperature.      iii)   Fast quenching: This is needed to prevent recombination reactions between hydrogen and sulfur to revert back to hydrogen sulfide since the reverse reaction is also fast.         iv)   Ultra-substoichiometric operation: Operation in the ultra-substoichiometric, where much less oxygen is consumed, prevents formation of sulfur dioxide, a pollutant.             In addition to the technical tasks, the company continued discussions with both strategic and venture investors.  These endeavors resulted in the sale of a modified version of the SuperATR reactor to a major oil company that is also a potential strategic investor, for pollution control purposes.  Another oil&amp;gas super-major has begun technical due diligence on the process.  In addition, the company is revamping is business plan for major venture capital firms.
