<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2011 Macromolecular Materials Gordon Research Conference (GRC) (formerly Polymers West) is focused on advancing the frontiers of polymer science. The collection of leading expertise in a Gordon Research Conference setting enables a cross-disciplinary dialogue and opens opportunities for collaboration. The invited speakers are internationally known, world-class experts in their respective areas of polymer synthesis, polymer physics, polymer engineering, nanocomposites, and polymer biomaterials/therapeutics. In addition, this conference will be preceded by the Graduate Research Seminar(GRS). GRC and GRS poster sessions offer an exceptional opportunity for scientific discussion in an informal setting, where early career researchers interact with established experts from academia, industry, and government laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this GRC/GRS lies in cultivating and developing tomorrow's leaders in the polymeric materials and related interdisciplinary fields, and in advancing diversity in the scientific workforce performing such interdisciplinary research. In keeping with the past tradition of the Polymers GRC (formerly Polymers West) the Programmatic Themes of this year's conference cover a range of important and timely topics spanning the range from nanostructured polymers and composites, to polymer physics and engineering, to polymer materials for therapeutics including drug delivery and gene delivery. These themes, combined with the diverse array of speakers and attendees, will constitute a GRC of strong technical merit and broader impact.</AbstractNarration>
