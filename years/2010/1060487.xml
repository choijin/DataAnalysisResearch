<AbstractNarration>Berkeley Science Network Scholarship Project (BSNSP) at the University of California, Berkeley is increasing the number of students who earn bachelor's degrees and go on to STEM careers or graduate programs in the mathematical and physical science disciplines.  BSNSP's emphasis is on substantially increasing the number of students from groups historically underrepresented in these fields. BSNSP is working with the Office of Undergraduate Admission to recruit students who are competitive for admission and are eligible for S-STEM awards, with a focus on increasing diversity at Berkeley.  BSNSP is providing 2-year scholarships to 52 promising low-income undergraduates in the mathematical and physical sciences to aid them in their freshmen and sophomore years and SMART scholarships from UC Berkeley are supporting students during the last two years of college.  BSNSP actively supports the scholarship recipients in their decisions to select science majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to scholarship support, BSNSP is engaging the scholars in a structured network of mentoring that provides resources, encouragement, and professional development. BSNSP faculty and staff are working closely with the students to mentor them, provide new skill-building opportunities, and coordinate with other campus programs to maximize the scholarship recipients' retention to degree and preparation for graduate study or advancement into careers in the scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Overview The Berkeley Science Network Scholarship Program was designed to increase the number of students who graduate with bachelorÃ†s degrees in in the mathematical, physical and computer sciences. The Berkeley Science Network Scholarship Program also emphasized increasing the number of students from diverse groups, including groups historically underrepresented in these fields.   Intellectual Merits  The Berkeley Science Network Scholarship Program focused on retention through the lower division curriculum and advancement of students into the mathematical, physical and computer sciences majors.  The Berkeley Science Network Scholarship Program provided scholarships to students in their first two years of study, after which the participants transitioned to other sources of funding. The Berkeley Science Network Scholarship Program included four cohorts of eligible students in the mathematical, physical, and computer sciences at UC Berkeley.  The Berkeley Science Network Scholarship Program successfully identified promising students with interest in the targeted fields, recruited them to UC Berkeley, and assisted them with scholarships, professional development, mentoring, inclusion in a cross-generational community of scientists, as well as other supportive activities to assist them in meeting their educational aspirations. Broader Impacts  Eighty percent of the students who received scholarships in their freshman and sophomore years were retained in science, math and engineering curricula through their lower division years at UC Berkeley. The Berkeley Science Network scholars are a diverse group of science students.          Last Modified: 05/29/2015       Submitted by: Mark A Richards]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
