<AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of Trust-Hub project is to lead a community-wide movement toward stronger assurances in&lt;br/&gt;the digital hardware industry. The Trust-Hub is a means for information sharing between researchers and&lt;br/&gt;practitioners to accelerate the development of defenses against hardware-level attacks. This project&lt;br/&gt;proposes the development of Trust-Hub, a central web-based repository for technical papers, benchmarks,&lt;br/&gt;hardware platforms, source codes, tools, and other information that accelerates hardware security research&lt;br/&gt;and developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits:&lt;br/&gt;This project plans to develop benchmark circuits infected with hardware Trojans (called trust&lt;br/&gt;benchmarks), create hardware platforms to validate trust benchmarks, and develop a web portal to&lt;br/&gt;accelerate research and development in hardware security and trust. The project includes (i) creation of a&lt;br/&gt;large set of static trust benchmarks, (ii) benchmark complexity analysis, (iii) procedures to dynamically&lt;br/&gt;generate trust benchmarks with hard-to-detect Trojan instances, (iv) platforms for hardware emulation and&lt;br/&gt;validation of Trojan detection methods, (vii) a web-based repository called Trust-Hub, and (viii)&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive validation test suites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project would be of interest to fab-less semiconductor companies, US government&lt;br/&gt;agencies and university researchers worldwide. Benefits to the society include trustworthy electronics for&lt;br/&gt;healthcare, defense, weather forecasting, finance, transportation, and automotive applications. By&lt;br/&gt;integrating the results of this project into existing courses and by offering new courses in the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate curriculum, the PIs will impart cutting-edge engineering knowledge to&lt;br/&gt;students and improve their hardware design, security verification and test skills.</AbstractNarration>
