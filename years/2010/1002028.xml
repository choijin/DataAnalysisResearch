<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research objectives and approaches.  The objective of this research is to develop probabilistic methods for active sensing with tunable chemosensors.  The approach is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process, whereby the system takes sequential sensing actions to identify a chemical target.  The investigators will develop algorithms to adapt sensor tunings on-the-fly for two types of scenario: target discrimination and background rejection. These algorithms will be validated on two tunable sensor technologies (metal-oxide chemoresistors and infrared interferometers) combined with tunable preconcentrators. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. Active sensing has received minimal attention in chemosensors, where most work has focused on off-line optimization.  Likewise, chemometrics techniques assume that a full spectrum of the chemical is available.  In contrast, the proposed work argues that only the most informative wavelengths/features are needed, and that these should be selected dynamically.  This research will lead to agile systems that can adapt sensing parameters on-the-fly in response to their environments. The work will also provide a better understanding of active sensing across a range of scenarios (e.g. static vs. dynamic stimuli) and sensor characteristics (e.g. specific vs. cross-selective).  &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts.  For a number of applications, from quality control to environmental monitoring, there is a need to rapidly detect, identify and quantify volatile compounds.  The proposed methodology generalizes to a large class of chemical detectors, and may enable the development of power-aware networks of chemical sensors.  The project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students; since 2001, the PI has supervised 45 senior-design projects involving over 140 students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Across a wide range of applications it is important to rapidly detect, identify and quantify volatile organic compounds and other gases.  Examples include detecting contaminants in food and beverages, measuring malodor emissions in waste treatment plants, identifying narcotics and explosives in public spaces, or diagnosing illnesses from biological samples of patients.  In the past, such analyses required expensive and bulky laboratory instruments, but advances in micro/nano-technology make it now possible to build mobile/portable instruments with similar capabilities.  Examples include multi-modal (i.e. multiple sensing technologies), hyper-spectral (i.e. multiple probing wavelengths) and higher-order sensing (i.e. multiple physico-chemical dimensions).  These techniques can provide massive amounts of information, yet mobile devices have finite energy storage (i.e., batteries) and therefore limited computational and communication capabilities.    The objective of this project was to design intelligent algorithms that could balance the information content of analytical instruments with the constraints of mobile computing.   Specifically, we developed "active sensing" algorithms that could tune the instrument/sensor selectivity on-the-fly, based on information from previous measurements.  The approach is best illustrated in analogy to the traditional parlor game of "twenty questions."  This is a two-person guessing game in which player 1 thinks of an object, and player 2 must guess its identity by asking a sequence of YES/NO questions to player 1.  The best strategy for player 2 is to select the next question based on information gathered thus far (from previous questions).  In analogy, we designed algorithms that could "ask" questions by changing the sensor tuning overtime in a way that the sequence of sensor responses revealed the identity of the gas present in the environment.    The approach is illustrated in Figure 1 for an instrument with four sensors (S1-S4), 10 tunings per sensor (T1-T10), and a discrimination problem with 6 different chemicals (C1-C6).  At time t=0, no information is available, so we assume that the six chemicals are equally likely to be present: prob(Ci)=1&frasl;6.   Based on this information, the active-classification algorithm decides to take the first sensing action (a1: measure sensor S2 at temperature T4), which leads to observation o1 and an updated probability: prob(Ci?o1,a1 ).  After four sensing actions, evidence accumulated in the probability prob(Ci?o1&hellip;o4,a1&hellip;a4  ), and the cost of additional measurements are sufficient for the algorithm to assign the unknown sample to class C3.  In this toy example, the algorithm can accurate classify the chemical using only 10% of all sensor configurations.   We developed active sensing algorithms for two chemical detection platforms. The first platform was based on metal-oxide (MOX) sensors.  MOX sensors offer many advantages: they are robust, inexpensive, and highly sensitive; however, they have poor selectivity, which makes it difficult to discriminate among several chemicals, or between targets and backgrounds. To address this limitation, we exploited a property of MOX materials: the selectivity of the sensor towards different gases depends on the temperature at which the sensor is operated. Thus, if one modulates the sensorÆs temperature over time, the response at each temperature provides a different piece of information about which chemicals may be present.  In our case, we let the active-sensing algorithm select the proper operating temperature for the sensor, and how that temperature should be changed over time.  The second platform was based on infrared (IR) spectroscopy. When a gas is exposed to IR light, some of the lightÆs wavelengths (i.e., colors) are absorbed by the gas, and this absorption profile is unique to each chemical.  Therefore, one can discriminate among different gases by measuring how much of the IR light is trans...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
