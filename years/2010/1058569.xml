<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design, build, test, and validate a fully operational prototype disk drive incorporating a commutational ramp load actuator (CRLA). The CRLA is a unique and transformative actuator for disk drives that provides significant improvements over existing actuator technology by increasing performance and reducing cost. The research objectives consist of a systematic distributed parameter design for the CRLA components, quantification of intrinsic parameters and performance characteristics, design and synthesis of a robust trajectory and control algorithm to fulfill the ramp load/unload requirements, and verification of repeatability and reliability of the ramp load/unload process. The CRLA design requires travel through a magnetic transition zone which presents an input singularity at a location on the ramp within the actuator sweep angle resulting from a zero torque factor. To promote travel on the ramp and through the region near the input singularity point on the ramp, a robust closed-loop control algorithm will be developed that will provide failsafe ramp load/unload operation through the transition zone. It is anticipated that the research will lead to a technically sound and robust CRLA prototype actuator which will provide significant performance improvements and cost savings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is immediate and long-term.   The immediate commercial potential is the specific application of the technology to the current 550 million units per year disk drive market for computers, servers, data backup systems, communication technologies, and many consumer products such as digital video recorders. The CRLA technology is expected to provide cost savings of $0.17 to $0.47 on magnet, coil, and latch materials for each disk drive. Additional cost savings are realized through a reduction in product liability, warranty, and return costs. This technology will provide a direct benefit to society via manufacture of a consumer product that is of a lower cost and higher performance. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding of devices that require ?control through singular regions,? with potential application in diesel engines and various military defense and security technologies. Additional broader impacts include: (a) realistic engineering training for students; (b) improving local economy by creating manufacturing jobs; (c) involvement of undergraduate students and preparation of project modules to enhance undergraduate curriculum; (d) collaboration with practicing engineers; and (e) immediate transfer of technology to disk drive industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project investigated the development of a new actuator for computer hard disk drives called the commutational ramp load actuator (CRLA). This new actuator is capable of improving performance while reducing the cost of the actuator. The work was conducted by the startup company Bluewater Technology with collaboration from Oklahoma State University. The project resulted in further developing the CRLA technology as discussed in the US Patent No. 7,602,580. The following are the major outcomes of the project related to the intellectual merit and broader impacts of the work:  A prototype actuator for hard disk drives (HDDs) containing the CRLA technology was designed and developed. The new CRLA actuator was successfully incorporated into a commercial hard disk drive for testing and evaluation. Extensive testing and evaluation of the new HDD prototype containing the CRLA technology was conducted which resulted in meeting the originally specified performance metrics. A portable system of hardware and software was developed including the prototype drive, which can be used for onsite demonstration of the technology to HDD OEMs; an extensive amount of experimental data was also collected for various scenarios to show the feasibility of the technology for commercialization. Several opportunities for commercialization and/or licensing of the technology during the project were explored. These activities have facilitated development of the prototypes and a better understanding of the customer needs. Based on the technical findings and lessons learned with the commercialization efforts during the execution of the project, Bluewater plans to make strong efforts to sell the technology to either HDD OEMs or HDD component suppliers. A significant broader impact of the project activities is the technical and business training of several senior personnel and students at Oklahoma State University. Students from engineering as well as business school were involved in project activities at various stages of the project. The CRLA technology is an innovative technology that significantly reduces the size of the magnet and other components used in the HDD actuator. Since the magnets are made of rare earth materials, this technology provides a positive impact on reducing the use of such materials.
