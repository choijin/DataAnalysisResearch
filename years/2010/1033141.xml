<AbstractNarration>1033141&lt;br/&gt;Foster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research looks into the volumetric treatment of liquids using plasma discharge within gas bubbles dispersed in the liquid. It is a very basic experimental approach, driven by developed theory of bubble dynamics and backed by some interesting preliminary observations. The study will be of a fundamental nature, but is also strongly motivated by the application of water purification, and the development of a small system that can be used in the field. A range of interesting experiments are planned, using a high speed camera and a time-resolvable optical emission spectrometer. If successful, the research will provide new insights into this emerging area of non-equilibrium plasmas and could also contribute to the development of an application of great societal importance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research effort is novel, well thought out and has broad impacts to both the physical understanding of the phenomenon as well as to the benefit of society, specifically with regard to water purification in underdeveloped countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research enables a method for in-volume plasma injection into essentially any liquid system. This effort is expected to greatly expand our knowledge of the physics of plasma-in-bubble discharges, forming new guideposts for further research and leading to a means for implementation in practical plasma-chemical reactors. The diffusion of discharge byproducts such as ozone, radicals, electrons, atomic oxygen, and UV emission into the water can drive chemical reactions. Such discharges in liquid systems can open new frontiers in chemical processing, where the plasma supplies the driving energy. Since the discharge products are strongly antiseptic, initiation of a plasma discharge in water automatically disinfects water and opens the possibility of plasma-based, point-of use water treatment for application in underdeveloped countries where water-borne diseases account for 80% of childhood deaths. Further, as part of the proposed research several plasma demonstration and simple hands on laboratory systems will be built for use in outreach programs. The panel was impressed both by the outreach and educational activities as well as the potential applications of this fundamental research in water treatment.</AbstractNarration>
