<AbstractNarration>This award to Carmegie Mellon University facilitates cosmology research using the large new computational resource named Blue Waters recently deployed and operated by the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. It provides travel funds to support technical coordination between the principal investigators and the Blue Waters project team. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will conduct  hydrodynamic simulations of bright qasar formations which evolved from the first supermassive black holes in the universe.  The  simulations will use full mass and spatial resolution throughout the entire massive cosmological volume.  The initial simulation will evolve to redshift z= 4, while the second subsequent smaller simulation will evolve to reshift z = 0.  These are expected  to be the highest resolution SPH (Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics) simulations performed at low redshift.  These simulations represent qualitative advances both in understanding of fundamental cosmology questions and efficient algorithmic approaches at the frontiers of large scale computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team includes early career researchers.   Both the resulting data and the software used to perform these high resolution simulations will be publically available allowing related subsequent high resolution studies by other researchers.  The software is incorporated into the existing and already highly used publicly available GADGET application.  Data products in the form of visualizations and other materials will be incorporated into expansive and ongoing outreach programs at undergraduate and high school levels, advancing understanding and interest in both large scale computational research and astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The upcoming James Webb Telescope, successor to Hubble and next generation of space telescope will be discovering the first galaxies and black holes that form in the Universe.  Searches for these first objects are extremely difficult, because they are so rare, and statistics of a substantial population impossible to achieve so far. The most recent numerical simulation, BlueTides, run by Tiziana Di Matteo has made use of the largest NSF supercomputer, BlueWaters at NCSA, and has been the first computer simulation to cover both the formation of individual objects and make large scale statistical studies of them. It contains hundreds of thousands of galaxies and quasars in a volume hundreds of times larger than both the previous largest computer model and the volume observed by space telescopes so far.    One of the most exciting predictions from these computer models involves the billion solar mass black holes like those that power the earliest quasars. A longstanding mystery was whether these titanic black holes can  form naturally in our theories, and if so how? With the simulation it was found that special regions exist in the Universe with super high density but low tidal fields. These had never been seen before in models  as they are extremely rare and previous simulations were too small.  In BlueTides, a handful of these regions focused infalling streams of matter from all sides onto black holes and grew them rapidly to the masses that  are observed, and in only five percent of the present age of the Universe.   Another groundbreaking discovery from the simulation involved the nature of galaxies at these very early times.  Looking at the most massive galaxies in the model, a big surprise was that they were almost  all thin rotating disks like the present day Milky Way.  Early galaxies that have been seen so far by the Hubble Space Telescope are small, clumpy and irregular, but future space telescopes will survey much wider areas of sky, and will find the most massive, rare and luminous objects. Before BlueTides there were no theoretical predictions, for them but we now expect that beautiful spiral galaxies await upcoming observations. These will form a great test of our understanding and our theories.
