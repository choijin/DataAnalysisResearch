<AbstractNarration>This Strategies project, from the Morehouse School of Medicine, will engage 60 high school students in carrying out a multi-faceted out-of-school time (OST) intervention program focused on information communication technology (ICT), neuroscience, and entrepreneurship. In this project, Promoting Our Worth as Entrepreneurs and Researchers in Innovative Technology (POWER-IT) Georgia high school students learn advanced ICT and Neuroscience. POWER-IT is a research-based intervention model that offers Georgia high-school students high quality OST experiences to increase their skills, interest, career knowledge, and participation in neuroscience and ICT. The POWER-IT model is based on evidence that immersion experiences and access to business professionals, entrepreneurs, scientists, undergraduate mentors, and research experiences is an effective approach towards increasing students' future science and ICT success. Students will work alongside neuroscientists at the Morehouse School of Medicine Neuroscience Institute where they learn about Imagining-Microarray and Informatics Research and will be learning how researchers use information technology to do hypothesis-driven research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major content areas of POWER-IT are: ICT with an emphasis on multimedia, communication, and research and biology with am emphasis on neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>
