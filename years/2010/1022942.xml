<AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is creating, evaluating, and disseminating a collection of approximately 60 videos that illustrate children's mathematical thinking and learning.  The videos are being used in mathematics content courses for prospective elementary teachers and are specifically designed to be integrated with "Connecting Mathematics for Elementary Teachers (CMET)," a textbook authored by three of the principal investigators on this project.  The videos of children are helping prospective elementary teachers better understand children's mathematical thinking, thereby supporting better instructional choices on the part of teachers and improved learning of mathematics by children in their classes.  The videos are illustrating aspects of research on children's learning of mathematics that are described in the CMET textbook.  Results related to this project are being disseminated through conference presentations and workshops for faculty who teach mathematics for elementary teachers.  The videos are being made available on the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The videos produced in this project are significantly impacting the mathematical understanding and teaching of prospective elementary teachers by providing them with in-depth knowledge of how the subject matter they will be teaching is connected to children's mathematical thinking.  This project has the potential to fundamentally change the way mathematics educators prepare elementary pre-service teachers to teach mathematics to children.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                                                              Connecting Mathematics for Elementary Teachers II (CMET II)      DUE 1022942       Project Outcome Report for the General Public       The research and development project, Connecting Mathematics for Elementary Teachers II (CMET II), created 61 videos on how children in kindergarten through fifth grade think about and learn mathematics. These videos are free and available on our web site:  www.cmlvidoes.com.  The videos are password protected and are designed to be used for educational purposes.  Please contact the project director: Dr.David Feikes at dfeikes@pnc.edu if you would like to view or use the videos for educational purposes.       One unique feature of the videos is that they typically show 3-4 students solving the same problem in different ways (sometimes correctly, and sometimes incorrectly).  The videos dispel the assumption that all children solve problems the same way. When preparing to teach children mathematics, it is important for preservice teachers to understand that there are multiple ways to solve problems and that children think about mathematics differently.    A second unique feature of the videos is the narration embedded in each video.  Typically there is narration to introduce the videos, after each student solves the problem, and at the conclusion of each video.  The narration is designed to focus the viewersÆ attention on important aspects of how children learn mathematics.       The videos were primarily designed to be used with preservice teachers in mathematics content courses for elementary teachers but they have also been used with teachers in graduate courses, in mathematics methods courses for elementary teachers, in professional development for elementary teachers, and with parents to help them learn how to help their children understand mathematics.       Results from our analysis of these different cohorts indicated the following:   The videos were helpful in understanding how children solve math problems.      The videos were helpful providing ideas about how to teach children mathematics.       Watching the video helped viewers better relate to how children learn mathematics.       Parents were able to relate the videos to how their own children learn mathematics.       In contrast to preservice teachers, practicing teachers were more focused on using manipulatives to teach mathematics as demonstrated in several of the videos.        Teachers focused more on developing childrenÆs thinking and preservice teachers focused more on the fact that children solve problems in different ways.             Intellectual Merit  The CMET II Project disseminated knowledge on how to help preservice elementary teaches understand how children think about mathematics and subsequently improve their own understanding of mathematics. Understanding how children think about mathematics and their enhanced understanding of mathematics is intended to enhance teaching of mathematics to children.  CMET II conducted salient research on the role that knowledge of childrenÆs mathematical thinking plays in the learning of mathematics and the preparation of teachers.  This project also examined the translation and implementation of research findings for practice.  In the field of mathematics education, the CMET II project attempted to contribute toward understanding of what constitutes "knowledge necessary for teaching mathematics."  Broader Impacts       This CMET II ProjectÆs goal was to impact the mathematical understanding and teaching of prospective elementary teachers by providing them with in-depth knowledge of how the subject matter they will be teaching is connected to childrenÆs mathematical thinking.  Using knowledge of childrenÆs thinking in the teaching of subject matter for preservice teachers has broader implications for many areas including the teaching of science.
