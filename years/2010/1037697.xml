<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will combine case-based learning with problem-based learning using computer simulations in the field of construction engineering.  The combination of these two pedagogies will be used to teach complex construction engineering systems in a "multidimensional virtual environment" in which students can visualize complex phenomena.  The combination of these educational techniques may advance our knowledge of how to improve students' abilities in complex problems solving.  The ability to visualize and solve complex problems is a key skill in many modern industrial settings and for engineering practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to demonstrate means of integrating complex problem solving with more traditional engineering curricula.  The project plans call for broad dissemination of the computer-based visualization tool and associated engineering problems and case studies.  The participating institutions draw heavily from Hispanic and rural populations, both of whom are under-represented in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The U.S. construction industry, responsible for the design, engineering, construction and maintenance of buildings and infrastructure, is one of the largest industries of the U.S. economy by contributing $1.1 trillion dollars to the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 and is also a major job generator.  Additionally, buildings account for 40 percent of the primary energy use and 25 percent of the water use and 40 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, onstruction consumes 30 percent of the raw materials, and generates 30 percent of the waste placed in landfills. Therefore, the U.S. construction industry plays an important role in creating a livable and sustainable society that all of us rely on. At the core of this industry are designers, engineers and construction professionals. Enhancing the quality of future generations of such professionals in order to successfully design and manage increasingly complex construction projects has a profound impact on our society. This research project, although small in its scope, adds to this overall goal for the betterment of our society. Construction education involves concepts of many different elements such as buildings, participants, markets, and the natural environment. These elements interact with each other and form a complex system. In many cases, a complex phenomenon such as the collapse of a building cannot be simply attributed to one or two factors. The ability to understand such a complex system is critical to future generations of design, engineering and construction professionals. Based on the structure-behavior-function (SBF) theory, a hypermedia learning environment, called Case-based Active Knowledge Environment (CAKE), was developed in order to compare with a conventional learning environment.   To determine whether the CAKE learning environment instead of the conventional learning environment led to better understanding about a complex phenomenon, two experiments were designed and conducted to test studentsÆ ability to describe different systems and interactions involved in the construction processes of a case, and predict the interactions and dependencies among different systems after using the two different learning environments. One experiment was designed to compare the results of a control group and an experimental group. The other experiment was designed to collect the results of pair-wise pre- and post-tests of the control group and the experimental group respectively, and compare the before-and-after improvement in each group.   From 2011 to 2014, one hundred sixteen construction management students at Florida International University, the University of North Florida and the Milwaukee School of Engineering were participated in the experiments. Thirty of them participated in the second experiment. The first experiment was conducted with undergraduate students only. Approximately, 85% of these students were from the construction major, while students from both civil engineering and architecture major constituted around 9% of the total tested sample. At the same time, almost 80% of these students were male students. As for the second experiment, around 75% of the students were ndergraduate students; 23% were seeking a MasterÆs degree; and 2% were seeking other degrees. Similar to the first experiment, the majority of the students were majoring in construction (83%) and they were mostly male students (81%).    The research results indicate that CAKE as a learning environment shows promising benefits such as increasing the use of structure and behavior concepts and enhancing the quality of studentsÆ concept structure according to the pair-wise pre- and post-tests. However, while compared to a learning environment with nearly identical information and contents but different presentations, the advantages of using CAKE are not obvious except for better helping students form correct concepts.
