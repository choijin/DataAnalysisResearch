<AbstractNarration>1031158&lt;br/&gt;Vershon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Rutgers University proposal, Conducting Authentic Molecular Biology and Genomics Research (MBGR) in High Schools, is a three-year strategies-based ITEST project that provides avenues for science teachers and their students to become part of, and contribute to, authentic research in biotechnology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Teachers and students will use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to analyze their experimental findings and publish their results in databases used by scientists throughout the world. The primary goal of MBGR is to determine what strategies promote authentic student research and thereby foster student interest in STEM careers. In this proposed study, MBGR will examine the role of five key elements and how they are related to the strategies that the program will use to a) broaden the research content of the project and, b) study the individual program components that are used to support genuine research in high schools. These strategies will be implemented and studied at three Universities: the lead facility, Waksman Institute, Rutgers University, and two other sites, John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland and at the University of Texas at Austin. Participants will include 20 teachers and 40 students at the Rutgers Summer Institute; 10 teachers and 20 students at John Hopkins University Summer Institute and 6 teachers and 12 students at the University of Texas Summer Institute.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Conducting Authentic Molecular Biology and Genomics Research in High Schools (MBGR) (NSF 1031158) was a strategies-based ITEST project that provided avenues for high school science teachers and their students to become part of, and contribute to, authentic research in biotechnology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. In addition, participating teachers and students used Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to analyze their experimental findings and publish their results.  An intellectual merit of MBGR was to teach participants about concepts in contemporary biotechnology and engage them in molecular biology laboratory experiments by working on a genuine research project that is of interest to the scientific community. MBGR faculty and staff at three locations: MBGR @ Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (the lead facility); MBGR @ Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; and MBGR @ Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA; worked with participants from approximately 100 schools in New Jersey, Maryland, Texas, California, and Hawaii to achieve this.  As a result, over the entire MBGR period more than 6800 high school students published their findings on online databases used by scientists worldwide. Over 100 teachers of these students also benefited from their participation in MBGR. Notably, they established collegial ties with research scientists while updating their science backgrounds and ICT proficiencies.  MBGR examined the components and support structures that were required to sustain authentic research projects in high schools. Our project findings indicated the components listed below were important for the successful implementation of the program.   Projects should present a wide range of scientific concepts that deal with subject matter that is important for students to understand. Projects should teach and provide experience with the same data analyses and computational skills used by scientists.  Projects should be capable of being carried out in a variety of classroom settings by students of varying abilities and socioeconomic backgrounds. Projects should be flexible and offer different levels of participation. This includes offering projects as a club activity, as independent high school research courses, or in conjunction with established courses, such as Advanced Placement or Honors Biology. Projects should be collaborative, and capable of being worked on by groups of students. Yet each student should analyze and be responsible for his/her own set of data, and that each student has "ownership" of his/her findings that contributes to a larger project. The data that students generate should be unique, not studied previously, so that each student has the possibility of making new and exciting discoveries. Projects should extend enrollment beyond what can be achieved in a summer Institute, so that many more students can participate during the academic year. Projects should use online interactive tools, such as those that were specifically developed in context of the MBGR research project and used to review studentsÆ analyses of their findings.  Projects should provide advanced opportunities for ongoing participation in research activities beyond the fundamental core project by broadening the scope of scientific investigations.  Ultimately, as a primary indicator of success (like all authentic scientific research projects) each student should share his/her findings with the scientific community through publication of their data.   Over the grant period, these components were incorporated into MBGR. As a result, more than 100 teachers and 6800 students submitted over 6100 publications of their findings on databases used by scientists worldwide.     In summary, MBGR encouraged students to directly participate in the scientific enterprise by making genuine contributions to the scientific community, thereby fostering their interest in science and encouraging them to pursue careers in science...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
