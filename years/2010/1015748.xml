PHB granules were synthesized using the PHB operon from Ralstonia eutropha, but when any additional genes were added in an attempt to control size size distribution of the granules both the levels of protein and the amount of PHB were negatively effected, lowering both levels far below the wild type strains.

Additional constructs were made adding to the tools available for the research lab where the experiments were conducted. Even though the project did not achieve the desired results, knowledge was gained. There are many ideas of ways to control the polydispersity of small granule sizes and shapes, and I was able to eliminate a few of the methods that will not work.  In addition to the data from the experiments, my skills as a researcher were enhanced and the experience of working in a lab in a foreign country was invaluable.  On many occasions the techniques used there were much different than those I was accustomed to, which helped to open my world up to new ways of thinking and overcoming problems faced during research.  I was a much more competent scientist after the project than I was starting out, and was able to make some life long connections across the world at the same time.
