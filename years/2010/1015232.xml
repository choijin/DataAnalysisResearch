<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of my project was to determine whether existing antiviral  drugs had an effect on p7 a molecule that is found in the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). This is a very important area of research since HCV currently infects approximately 170 million people worldwide, overtaking alcohol abuse as the leading cause for liver replacement surgery in the developed world.  To this moment there is no effective vaccine against it and current treatments are expensive and not suitable for all patients.  I decided to work in Singapore because of its growing scientific community and its top tier research institutions.  I chose to work in Dr. Jaume TorresÆ lab at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Dr. TorresÆ laboratory has state of the art technology and his students and postdocs are experienced in working with HCV-p7.  While in Dr. TorresÆ lab I tried different experimental conditions and determined which the best one for studying HCV-p7 was. I analyzed the effect the antiviral drug, hexamethylene amyloride (HMA), (previously shown to be effective against influenza virus) on this molecule. My work at Dr. TorresÆ lab provided evidence that HMA may indeed be useful to treat HCV infections by directly affecting the HCV molecule p7.  My results on this project provide a small step in coming up with new treatments for this virus. In the long run this could lead to lowering the mortality and need for liver transplants in people who have been infected with HCV.
