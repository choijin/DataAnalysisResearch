<AbstractNarration>This grant provides international travel support for U.S. based graduate student participants to attend the 2010 International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2010), which will be held in Sydney, Australia, on December 13-17, 2010. ICDM has established itself as the world's premier research conference in data mining. It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative, practical development experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference seeks to continuously advance the state-of-the-art in data mining, including algorithms, software and systems, as well as related areas such as data management, machine learning and their use in a wide range of applications. With the growth of the Web, wireless communication and data intensive technologies such as sensor networks, social media, multimedia information systems, cloud computing, and application domains such as bioinformatics, climate change, or security, advances in data mining have a significant impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strong representation of U.S. researchers at the Conference is useful in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important area. The total number of ICDM participants in the past has been in excess of 300, with a majority of the participants from the U.S., then Europe and Asia. It is expected to provide scholarships to 15 U.S. based graduate student participants. This grant will partially support the travel costs for the U.S. based graduate student participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICDM proceedings are published by IEEE. The student award results will be announced at the ICDM 2010 conference website (http://datamining.it.uts.edu.au/icdm10/).</AbstractNarration>
