<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics, a two-day conference for undergraduate women in physics taking place on January 16-17, 2010 simultaneously at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), the Ohio State University (OSU), the North Carolina Research Triangle (NCRT), and Yale University. The conference has two overarching goals. One goal is to give young women the confidence, motivation, and resources to apply to graduate school and successfully complete a Ph.D. in physics or a related discipline. The other goal is to make undergraduate women in physics more aware of the wide range of career opportunities available to them. The conferences will be modeled on previous conferences at the University of Illinois, Urbana (UIUC), University of Michigan, the University of Southern California (USC), and Yale over the past four years. This conference is intended to reach as diverse a group of women in physics as possible, and the organizers are committed to providing access to the conference at minimal cost to the participants to assure that a lack of funds does not discourage participation. This award is supported by the Division of Physics, the Division of Materials Research, and the Division of Astronomical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2010 Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics was held simultaneously on January 15-17, 2010 at four locations across the United States:  the University of California, Santa Cruz, Duke University, Ohio State University and Yale University.  At the UCSC conference, there were approximately 65 participants [check number], from throughout the Western and Southwestern United States.  They were housed principally at the University Inn and Conference Center.    There were 8 talks by working scientists and one by a current graduate student.  In addition, there was a graduate student panel and student research talks.  The speakers included male and female faculty.   Among the female faculty were young scientists who could speak to issues faced by contemporary women at early stages of their careers, as well as well-established scientists, including National Academy members, Department Chairs and group leaders at leading institutions, and others.  Speakers also included one professional who studies issues involving Women in Science as part of her research.  There were also activities meant to allow students to socialize and network.  Students generally reported that they were excited by the opportunity to see distinguished female scientists, but more generally to develop an overview of the field and an understanding of possible career paths.  Here are some sample comments from students:  1.  What did you find most effective at the 2010 UCSC Women in Physics Conference?  The social events.  Having the opportunities to talk with other women students, - even meeting another student who was also a Mom!   - provided some much needed opportunities to compare/contrast experiences, get excited about how many women physics majors are out there compared to the three in my school.  I wish there had been a little more time to chat with the Speakers as well.      The fact that the event was free - lodging and travel- made it totally possible for me to go.  I would not have gone otherwise.   2.  What would you like to see improved for the next Women in Physics Conference?  I was very impressed with the overall production, accommodations, rooming, everything.  The only issue I had was being vegetarian, there sometimes weren't enough vegetarian options at lunch - many of the people who didn't specify vegetarian were eating that way anyway, so the vegan and veggie options ran low.  3.  What impact do you think the conference will have on your future career in physics?  It definitely energized me, and I encouraged all the Sophomore and Junior girls to go to this years conference.  It was neat to see the different career path that different women took.  For me, being there was exciting but once I came home to my family I realized: I don't want to do Grad school.  My choice to go back to school as a mom was one of necessity, and having the chance to meet with women and hear their experiences helped me make my decision.  Because I am now divorced, I realized I DO NOT WANT to spend the amount of effort it would take to be a graduate physics student.  I really appreciate the opportunity to actually talk with the women and make an informed decision.    However, I am going to be a high school Physics Teacher, so hopefully I'll be able to nudge some future girls in that direction - and be able to give them the support that I so appreciated!  Funds provided by the NSF were also used to support research by undergraduate students.  The program was not limited to women, though participants were required to present a poster at a subsequent Undergraduate Women in Physics conference.  The funds supported research in condensed matter physics, applied physics (advanced solar cell research) and particle physics (detector development).  All those involved are headed for graduate programs in physics and related disciplines.          Last Modified: 04/30/2013       Submitted by: Michael Dine]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
