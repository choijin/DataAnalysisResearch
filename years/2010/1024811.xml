<AbstractNarration>A class of small RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs), has recently been discovered and has been shown to regulate gene expression by binding to the untranslated regions of transcribed genes leading to degradation and/or repression of protein formation. Much remains to be discovered of exactly how these miRNAs function, and consequently very little is known about the importance of miRNA regulation to development and the generation of morphology.  MiRNAs evolve rapidly compared to coding genes and they may also acquire and lose targets more rapidly so that they could provide a source of significant variation during evolution.  This project will use a variety of molecular and computational approaches to examine the functional role of miRNAs in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, which was chosen for this study because it has an extremely well characterized gene regulatory network for early development.  It will also be determined how this regulation may have evolved, and what developmental consequences this may have, by testing whether miRNAs regulate similar genes in other echinoderms, specifically in the closely related sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus and the distantly related sea star Asterina miniata.  A great deal is known of how transcription factor based gene regulatory networks have evolved between the sea star and sea urchins and the consequences of this for their development.  It is anticipated that this project will reveal how miRNA regulation can control development and how it changes over evolutionary time in the context of a gene regulatory network. Several women graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in a variety of experimental and computational techniques.  Also the PI and graduate students in the PI's lab will run a short lab and lecture course at Ringold High School to introduce these students to the concepts of computational and developmental biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since the sequencing of many genomes over the last decade, it has become important, and possible, to understand how these immense DNA sequences control how animals generate their form. The primary means to understand genomic control is to know how genes are regulated, i.e. turned on or off; as the embryo develops.  Traditionally the focus has been on genes that make proteins, and most is known about how these are controlled and in turn control morphology. There are other types of genes encoded in the genome, among these are very short, (around 20-25 nucleotides), sequences of RNA, known as microRNAs  Much less is known of how microRNAs work, how they evolve and how they therefore can contribute to the evolution of animal morphology.  The project here use species of echinoderms, sea stars and sea urchins, to ask how microRNAs could be used in development of these embryos and how this could evolve.   The initial project was to develop an algorithm to identify microRNAs from RNA sequencing reads.  This is a difficult problem because these RNAs are small and thus not complex and so can be hard to distinguish from degraded RNAs of other types.  This work established a new algorithm, HHMMiR, that is now widely used by researchers in other systems.    Work next established the profile of microRNAs in the sea urchin and sea star during development and then compared these to other organisms. This revealed the more rapid nature by which these microRNAs could evolve and identified the set of microRNA that conversely are found throughout many animals. These datasets were provided in a publically accessible format for use by other researchers.    These above outcomes were the result of a collaboration between a computation and experimental biologist and involved the training of a woman student, who graduated with a PhD.  The next outcome was to show how microRNAs have roles in axis formation in these echinoderms.  The significant finding was that microRNAs are needed to correctly pattern axes, but the actual cell types were specified correctly.  This work was conducted by a student who received his Masters in Biology.  Finally, a collaboration between a chemist and biologist have led to the development of a new probe type that can be used to label microRNAs in the embryo so that it can be determined where microRNAs are localized during development.  These have the potential to be broadly used by researchers using many model systems.  The project also contributed to the training of several undergraduate women, who received training in molecular biology, developmental biology, bioinformatics, imaging and genomics.   Two important science outreach activities were undertaken during this project. PhD, masters and undergraduates from CMU engaged in teaching activities with 10 to 12th graders at Ringgold High, a public 8-12 high school and also, in conjunction with the Carnegie Science Center,  middle school girls from the region.  This provided instruction in molecular biology, genomics, evolutionary biology and the use of live embryos.  These provide curricular extensions that are otherwise not available to these students, and in particular introduced them to the an understanding that biology and computational sciences can have significant overlap.  Additionally this provided teaching experience to the CMU students.           Last Modified: 11/15/2016       Submitted by: Veronica F Hinman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
