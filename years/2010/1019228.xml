<AbstractNarration>This proposal outlines a research and development project that investigates how complex systems concepts supported by innovative curricular resources, technology applications and a comprehensive research and development structure can assist student learning in the domain of biology by providing a unifying theme across scales of time and space. The project seeks to address four areas of critical need in STEM education: biological sciences, complex systems, computational modeling, and equal access for all.  This proposal explores how these needs are addressed through a curricular and technological intervention that structures biology learning through the framework of complex systems and computational modeling.  The primary partners are the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania, working with eight teachers in four schools in the Boston area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project integrates graphical programming and simulation software, StarLogo TNG, into the standard high school biology curriculum to improve learning of biology concepts through the introduction and understanding of core complex systems processes.  Instead of learning biology in discrete chunks, the chosen biological topics are connected through the framework of complex systems, and successively build in complexity from the basic building blocks of life to the interdependence and sustainability of life forms. This approach is designed to help students understand how processes at one level are connected to those at another level.  The research is designed to answer the following questions:  1. Does a learning progression based on the complex systems ideas of scale and emergence enable students to make connections across biological topics, remediate known misconceptions, and apply core complex systems principles better than traditional instructional sequences?  2. What are the on-going affordances and constraints of implementation taking into consideration structural, functional and behavioral variables and what changes to project activities yield increased implementation and learning capacities?  3. Does programming of simulations increase understanding of complex systems and biology concepts compared to use of previously constructed simulations? The evaluation is designed to collect data and provide feedback on the adherence to the plan, the implementation challenged, and how research informs development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project anticipates a number of deliverables towards the end of the project and beyond.   These include the creation of a unified high school biology curricular sequence that builds in increasing spatial and temporal scales to deepen student understanding of four core biology topics; the production, implementation and testing of curricular activities that acknowledge and ameliorate known implementation challenges; and the development of curricular strategies and tools to help teachers and students improve knowledge and skills in computational modeling, computer programming and participation in the cyberinfrastructure.   In order to increase ease of integration into schools, and enhance scalability, the simulation activities are facilitated by a new web-based version of StarLogo TNG that integrates the curricular materials all of which will be distributed freely.  Additional dissemination strategies include a website, conferences, a newsletter, community activities, active dissemination, and academic presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The DRK12-BioGraph project, Graphical Programming for Constructing Complex Systems Understanding in Biology, was a four-year project with a one-year no-cost extension. Over the five years total, the team of researchers from MIT and University of Pennsylvania worked with a total of 14 teachers (4 pilot teachers, and 10 main cohort teachers) in the greater Boston area. Ten of the teachers participated for two years or more, and continue to be in intermittent contact with the research team even after a year of little direct professional development or research contact.     The goal of the grant was to change the experience of introductory high school biology for students by changing the teaching practices of the teachers with whom we worked. We sought to introduce complex systems thinking as a means by which to understand all of biology, which is often taught as a group of relatively unrelated units.     Teachers started with an introductory Saturday morning professional development workshop at the end of the year prior to their first year in the program, then participated in a one-week summer institute of intensive professional development during the intervening summer, four 4-hour school-year sessions, followed by another summer institute, and another round of school year professional development sessions. This is the most intense professional development regime most teachers will see during their careers, and quotes from BioGraph teachers indicate that it was the best professional development they had participated in.     A number of products and findings came out of the research on both teacher practice and student outcomes, as measured through pre- and post- surveys, in-class observations, and small group interviews:     The Complex Systems Curriculum &amp; Instruction Framework, which served as the overarching model against which we consider our interventions. This framework moves the field of complex systems in science education forward by offering a comprehensive program for classroom implementation that has been vetted by teachers as co-designers in the iterative design cycle. In addition to improving curriculum and instruction activities, the co-design model itself can be considered necessary to produce successful implementations and student learning outcomes.  In their year-end interviews and PD surveys, teachers articulated five categories of PD supports needed to be able to implement the project activities that involved instruction in modeling, programming, complex systems, scientific practices such as argumentation, and integration in biology content. These five categories were: time and experience, hands-on practice and training, just-in-time supports, interaction and building knowledge within the community, and supporting teacher beliefs.  In Year 1 there was significant growth in students in three of the five factors (understanding of scientific practices, perceptions of the scientific practices performed in science class, classroom experiences using computer technologies to learn science, interests in science, and perception of how students learn in science class), with the largest growth in studentsÆ classroom experiences using computer technologies. There was no significant growth in studentsÆ understanding of scientific practices or their interests in science. In Year 2 there was significant growth in all five factors and an increase in effect sizes from Year 1 to Year 2.  Results from the video data and focus group analysis indicate that students demonstrated understanding and skills in nearly every Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) category.   Various data sources showed notable evidence of students learning the science and engineering practice and the cross cutting concepts from the NGSS. Students grappled with data, and used and manipulated models to understand systems. Our findings provide insight into curriculum development for the NGSS, in that we have shown how science and engineering practice...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
