<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Reuben Simoyi of Portland State University for investigation of mechanisms and metabolite chemistry of novel organsulfur compounds as related to drug development.  The goal of this work is to synthesize several series of drug-related thiourea derivatives, along with other organosulfur compounds, and evaluate both their metabolic activations and the reactivity of the resulting metabolites.  Many new drugs contain organosulfur moieties and this work will help establish a deeper mechanistic understanding and quantify systematic protocols to assess their physiological response. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this research include its true interdisciplinary nature, blending synthesis with analytical methods to study an important class of biologically active molecules.  Professor Simoyi has an outstanding track record with undergraduate researchers and in the training of scientists from underrepresented groups in his laboratory.  This work will have a translational impact on the pharmaceutical industry by facilitating successful predictions of active compounds as potential drugs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal benefitted from a no-cost extension which was necessary to complete the project.  Funding for this project from the NSF was very beneficial in educating four graduate and 27 undergraduate students.  The majority of these students were from under-represented minorities.  11 undergraduate students managed to perform research work that was good enough to be published in peer-reviewed journals.  All in all, 25 manuscripts were published in top-tier journals as a result of this funding opportunity.  The project was aimed at examining, mechanistically, how certain thiol-containing drugs are bioactivated in the physiological environment.  From these mechanisms, we can predict the action of yet-unknown chemical entities and avoid the use of animal models in predicting toxicity.  The European Union countries rolled out new regulations in 2014 banning the use of animals in predicting toxicities of chemical entities except in very rare cases.  Their new ACUC animal protocols are extremely stringent.  Our work, published in the journal Toxicology (volume 315, pp 102 &ndash; 109 and volume 339 pp 34 &ndash; 39) and Chemical Research in Toxicology (volume 26, pp 112 &ndash; 123) managed to accomplish this aim and they were all highly regarded and cited. Several cosmetics companies in Europe are using our method for skin sensitization studies of their new compounds without sacrificing animals.   By far the biggest success of the project was designing an electrochemical cell that can be used to mimic bioactivation of drugs.  Building this cell took longer than we anticipated as we had to wait on a company: Couluchem, to deliver to us a crucial part of the cell.  This had to be custom made for our needs.  The cell has now been constructed and is now part of the general equipment that can be used by any researcher in the department.  Figure 1 shows the schematic sketch of this electrochemical cell.  A lot of work was put into constructing and optimizing this cell. This is only one a few that are available to the academic community.  Many pharmaceutical companies utilize this electrochemical oxidation method to predict bioactivation and possible toxicities of their new drugs, but such results are rarely ever published in the public domain. Our first certified results, subjected to peer-review, were published in 2016 in the Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, 761, pp 131 &ndash; 140.   Our project also worked on synthesis of a new antimetastatic inhibitor called NAMI-A.  Its stability in the face of thiol-type ligands was also studied.  The studies were profiled in the prestigious Dalton Transactions journal (volume 43, pp 12943 &ndash; 12951) and in the Journal of Physical Chemistry A (volume 118, pp 2196 &ndash; 2208).  Further studies on this topic will hopefully be pursued in later studies.   Work done in this project managed to answer all the relevant questions posed at the beginning of the proposal.  Its lasting legacy is the possible elimination of sacrificing of animals especially for cosmetics research and the construction of the electrochemical cell that can mimic what happens to a drug when ingested.  This removes guesswork when introducing new chemical drugs; it can actually allow us to prognosticate possible bioactivation pathways and allow us to design safer drugs.  The education and training aspect of this project was also enormous.  Undergraduates trained off this grant have moved on to graduate programs (medicine, pharmacy and doctoral PhD programs), and one of the most important factors was the fact that they had published top-ranked research manuscripts, something most undergraduates cannot achieve.  Of the four graduate students trained off this grant; two are engineers at Intel Corporation, one is a research scientist at the Scripps Institute in La Jolla and the other is a postdoctoral fellow at Oregon Health and Sciences University.
