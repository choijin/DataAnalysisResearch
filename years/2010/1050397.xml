<AbstractNarration>This project is developing mathematics teacher leaders to serve as school and district-based intellectual leaders and master teachers in a set of small rural school districts in Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho. Teachers in these underserved areas are geographically isolated and intellectually removed from colleagues in the same discipline. To counter these circumstances the team of investigators is combining in-depth mathematical content knowledge focused on reasoning, justification, and generalization of mathematical ideas, with ongoing, purposeful, supported professional development activities during the academic year. Supporting these activities is a partnership among teachers, school administrators, and higher education faculty intended to create a mechanism for sustained school change, resulting in continued improvement in teaching and student achievement. Cohorts of teacher leaders attend 3 three-week summer institutes, joined by administrators during the last 3 days of each institute. This intense work is accompanied by academic year support that gradually phases out as teacher leaders transfer their new knowledge to their own classrooms and then to their colleagues through the establishment of purposeful local professional development communities. The strength of this project lies not only in the blend of its innovative activities and focus on making mathematical reasoning explicit, but also on its potential to advance understanding of how to achieve the sustainable transformation of school cultures. Towards these ends, a strong leadership team of mathematicians, mathematics educators, and school leaders is actively guiding these efforts. The influence of this project is felt through its work with three cohorts totaling 72 teachers and 30 administrators from 30 rural schools with high minority (Hispanic, Native American, migrant, low SES) populations. All told, the project expects to directly impact an estimated 8,000 students during the award period. In addition, the project holds promise to serve as a model for sustainable professional development that emphasizes school-based change and is applicable to other schools nationwide, particularly in other rural isolated regions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>MMRE (Making Mathematical Reasoning Explicit) was a Professional Development research project designed to study effective ways to increase the mathematical reasoning of participating 4-12 grade teachers and their students, and to prepare teachers for leadership roles in their schools and districts. Additionally, principals and other professionals (e.g., math coaches, superintendents) were included in a smaller part of the project designed to familiarize them with the goals, objectives and approaches of our work. Over the course of the work, 72 teachers from rural schools in Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho participated directly in the sustained mathematics and leadership professional development activities: Summer institutes; regional meetings; winter institutes; classroom observations and debriefing feedback. In total, over 450 teachers were impacted by the extended work of the teacher leaders, who developed and implemented summer workshops/mini institutes for teachers in their schools; provided additional support, professional development and feedback to peer teachers in their schools and districts; and through the work of the TOSAs (Teachers on Special Assignment) who were funded during the final two years of the project. Gains in teacher content knowledge and knowledge for teaching were made (as documented in the final report), as were gains in student mathematical knowledge, as established through observational data, performance on reasoning tasks, and more broadly, on standardized tests. Students reported a much more positive attitude towards mathematics, and were more inclined to take more, higher level mathematics classes.</p> <p>The research associated with this model documented the advance of knowledge of mathematics teachers and their students, as well as contributed to the broader community&rsquo;s knowledge about effective professional development for mathematics teachers. It added to the corpus of knowledge regarding sustained professional development (MMRE teacher leaders participated in the program for a minimum of three years). Research and evaluation of the program established that teachers improved the quality of their instruction, became more confident in their teaching, and gained substantial knowledge of ways i to actively engage students in mathematical reasoning, through use of math routines that required generalizing and justifying. Students showed gains in their mathematical reasoning, as demonstrated on reasoning tasks.</p> <p>The chart below documents the progress towards the goals of the project. Most of the stated goals were met; a few were partially met. The impact on students beyond those in direct contact with participating teachers, was not readily documentable during the life of the project, although it was clear that more students were enrolling in advanced math classes. This result was directly attributable to the work of the project.</p> <p>The TOSAs funded during the two extension years of the project made a significant contribution to the mathematical knowledge and teaching skills of teachers in their districts with whom they worked over the two extension years.
