<AbstractNarration>This dissertation project examines how children learning English as their first language acquire the grammar of English questions. The ultimate goal of this study is to contribute to an understanding of why some types of errors, but not others, occur in language acquisition, and how these errors relate to input frequency and the properties of individual words. The research will include both cases of under-generalization of subject-auxiliary inversion (failure to invert the subject and the auxiliary in direct questions, e.g., "Why you are laughing?") and also cases of over-generalization (over-application of subject-auxiliary inversion in indirect questions, e.g., "I don't know what time is it.") Since such forms are entirely absent from the speech of adult native speakers, these are linguistic patterns created by the language learning mechanism. The outcomes of the proposed studies will shed light on the acquisition of interrogative structures and on the nature of generalization mechanisms in language acquisition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This dissertation examined why young children learning English as their first language make mistakes when asking direct and indirect questions. For example, children say "Why you are laughing?" instead of "Why are you laughing?" Children also say "I donÆt know where is it" instead of "I don't know where it is." Adult native speakers never produce such questions. Thus, children never hear the incorrect form, but they produce it.  Word order errors are extremely rare in children's speech, so the occurrence of errors in questions is particularly interesting. The ultimate goal of this study was to understand why some types of errors, but not others, occur in language acquisition. To achieve that goal, the research investigated how children's errors are related to a) how frequently specific combinations of words occur in speech directed to children by parents and b) the linguistic properties of individual words, i.e., words that complete the meaning of a verb (who, what) versus words that add optional information about events (when, why).  We created two tests to elicit direct and indirect questions from children. An example of our experimental protocol can be found online at http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~lpozzan/Publications/Questions%20Protocol.%20wmv.   The results of the two tests confirmed the impression gained from childrenÆs spontaneous speech: children produce word order errors in both direct and indirect questions.
