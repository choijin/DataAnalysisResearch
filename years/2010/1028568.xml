<AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this research is to develop nanoantenna-based frequency up-converter arrays for efficient nonlinear optical response at wavelengths for which silicon has high quantum efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project will facilitate the development of plasmonic nanoantenna arrays that are optimized for ?photon-management? applications, e.g., optical frequency conversion solar cell technology. To-date, little work has been done on optimizing these structures for their nonlinear optical response, which, in general will depend on multiple parameters including material and geometric. In addition, this project offers an opportunity to investigate several, not well-understood, fundamental scientific studies, such as:  1)  identifying the origin of the nonlinear optical response;  2) determining  the  limiting  factors  that  influence  the  near-field  resonance of nanoantennas; and 3) understanding how nanoscale plasmonic enhancement can be precisely coupled to the local nonlinear optical response in solid state materials.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact:&lt;br/&gt;This work has the potential to be transformative by helping to revolutionize and fast-track the development of efficient solar cell technology, whereby according to recent estimates, the industry is growing at a rate of ~ 30% per year, with a predicted growth of ~$7.5B by 2015. In addition, the work is expected to broadly impact interdisciplinary science/engineering education by developing a high-school module on plasmonic-enhanced solar cells and photo detectors, incorporating research materials into an undergraduate course on nanotechnology, and providing unique graduate research experience for students from various backgrounds. The work will be broadly disseminated through various academic/industrial channels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      In recent years, there has been increased interest in exploiting  the "intensity enhancing" capabilities that metal (plasmonic)  nanostructures provide for a variety of interesting applications. As a  promising candidate, gold bowtie-shaped nanoantenna arrays (BNAs) have  been shown to concentrate an applied optical field in small  sub-wavelength regions. This has resulted in enhancements of ~1000. The  work in this grant focused on how to engineer the properties of BNAs and  other types of nanostrucutres to enhance light-harvesting applications  such as solar energy, as well as enhance optical forces for manipulation  of particles (metal and insulating) from nanometer to micron-sized.  Some highlights of the findings include:  Investigated  photoconversion efficiency of BNAs integrated on Si photodiodes and  found that the max power output from the photodiode increased by ~37.3%  with incorporation of the BNAs, when the illumination was spectrally  selected for 690 nm. Investigated the potential of using the  BNAs to manipulate dielectric microparticles in aqueous solution. We  found that the high optical gradient force associated with high local  field enhancement leads to extremely efficient particle tweezing that  critically depends on the geometry of the BNAs as well as the optical  parameter space. Demonstrated multiple-core-shell plasmonic  nanoparticle tuning for broadband light harvesting  in panchromatic  dye-sensitized solar cells Demonstrated virus-templated  plasmon-enhanced photoanode for improved electron collection and light  harvesting in dye-sensitized solar cells   The work has resulted in 11 journal publications and 4 conference publications. In addition, more than a half dozen students received either Masters or PhDs from this overall project.         Last Modified: 12/15/2013       Submitted by: Kimani C Toussaint]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
