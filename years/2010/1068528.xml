<AbstractNarration>The objective this research project is to understand the link among the electronic- atomic- and micro-scale properties of Calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) and hardened cement.  CSH is the dominant building block component of the hardened portland cement and the key microstructure that controls the overall mechanical behavior of portland cement concrete.  To significantly enhance concrete performance and durability, technologies to modify CSH structure and properties are being envisaged.  This research will use a combination of rigorous theoretical and innovative experimental methods to investigate the fundamental science issues governing CSH structure and properties.  These investigations will identify the gap between what is theoretically possible and what is experimentally achievable, and consequently, suggest plausible strategies for future cementitious material development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concrete is the most utilized construction material across the world.  Life cycle performance enhancement of concrete can have far reaching impact on sustainability and energy use of the concrete and cement industries.  In addition, this interdisciplinary multi-institutional research will contribute to the development of highly skilled graduate workforce.  The Ph.D. students will be mentored by PIs with diverse background and experience in collaborative research on complex problems that occur at the boundaries of traditional disciplines.  The research results and techniques will be highlighted at the campus outreach events designed to attract high school students into STEM disciplines and recruit undergraduate students into graduate programs.  The methods developed in this research will have applications in the analysis of a wide class of materials possessing complex multi-component microstructures, such as shales and nanophased ceramics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Portland cement concrete is the most utilized construction material across the world.  The emerging interest in structure-property relationships of portland cement building blocks is due to the increasingly significant environmental, social and economic impact of its usage and production, which is expected to continually grow as a result of demands placed upon the infrastructural needs.  The focus of this project was to develop fundamental scientific knowledge of the structure-property relationships at different scales.  To incorporate the structural information into models for predicting material behavior many approaches applicable at different scales can be contemplated (Fig. 1).  At the smallest scale, calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) is the dominant building block component of the hardened portland cement and the key microstructural unit that governs the overall mechanical behavior of portland cement concrete.  From this bottom-up viewpoint, the atomic and electronic structure of crystalline phases of calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) crystals was studied and their bonding characteristics calculated from first principles.  The CSH crystals provide the baseline for revealing the fundamental nature of the more complex and mostly non-crystalline phase (termed as C&ndash;S&ndash;H) found in hardened cement paste.  New atomic bonding information was calculated, which show (1) the diverse degree of contributions of the various bond types to the overall cohesion, (2) the variety of Hydrogen bonds (HBs), (3) the significant contribution of HBs and their role in affecting the bond order (BO) of each bond type, (4) the BO dispersion within each bond types, (5) the significant dispersion in BO of the strong Si-O bonds with small bond length (BL) variation, and (6) the variation in the BO of relatively weaker Ca-O bond.  A single quantum mechanical metric, the total bond order density (TBOD) has been shown to be the more relevant parameter for classifying CSH material than the traditional C/S ratio (Fig. 2).  The mechanical behavior of CSH crystals was found to be controlled by the electronic structure and a delicate balance of different types of interatomic bonds.  In certain CSH crystals, such as suolunite, the HB network is organized in such a unique way that enhances its mechanical properties.  The correlations between the mechanical properties and the partial bond order density (PBOD) for each bond species in CSH crystals, showed that the property variations are determined more precisely by the Ca-O bonds and HBs as opposed to the more prevalent Si-O bond (Fig. 3).  The silicate tetrahedra (in chains) are tightly bound units that provide overall rigidity but contribute little to mechanical property variations or strength.  Results show that for multi-component crystals, such as CSH, that include ionic, covalent and hydrogen bonds, the nonlinearity of mechanical response and the failure is controlled by the weaker ionic or hydrogen bonds.  In summary, the electronic structure and inter-atomic bonding characteristics are essential for the development of realistic structural models of disordered cement hydrates and for suggesting optimum composition or hydration pathways that will result in superior cement. At the micro-scale and larger spatial dimensions, it is found that the cementitious materials offer significant challenges for atomistic modeling due to their complex composition, complex and mostly ill-defined atomic structures, atomic defects and multi-scalar porosities, prohibitive computational expense and so on.  Moreover, coarse-grained models and multi-scale models have to rely on information at various scales that are not readily available or easily conceived, and therefore, these approaches are not feasible for materials that are suffused with complex structures and interfaces.  Continuum model based upon granular micromechanics approach was found to be rigorous and an effective practical method at these scales.  This approac...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
