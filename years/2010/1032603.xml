<AbstractNarration>1032603&lt;br/&gt;Basu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: In the field of proteomics, analytic separation techniques like LC/MS can separate, quantify, and identify thousands of proteins; however, they cannot perform functional assays for determining the catalytic or binding activity of the protein. Preparative techniques, on the other hand, can isolate proteins into fractions while preserving their biological structure so that they can be used in functional screening assays. However, preparative techniques can only isolate relatively small number of fractions due to limitations in fraction collection technology. Existing fraction collectors, which require robotic arms and dedicated containers for each fraction, cannot accommodate the thousands of proteins in a typical proteome. The vision of "whole-proteome" functional assays cannot be realized until a scalable fractionation technology is developed. This represents a barrier to many fields (including pharmaceutical research, systems biology, and industrial biotechnology) where the function and reactivity of a protein is more important than its structure or sequence. The objective of this proposal is to develop a highly scalable fractionation technology needed for whole-proteome functional screening. Our approach is micro-fractionation in droplets (ìFD), a "containerless" fractionation technique which can elegantly collect and isolate thousands of separated fractions into microscale droplets. ìFD is a high throughput technology which can generate thousands of fractions per second with volumes as small as 50 pL. Another important benefit is the ability to couple the droplet fractions directly to a downstream screening assay. In addition to our supportive preliminary data, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team, including 1) A. Basu (PI), who has published the ìFD technique and has 8 years experience in droplet-based microfluidics; 2) B. Shay, with &gt;15 years industrial and academic experience in separation science; and 3) R. Kilkuskie, director of the Michigan High Throughput Screening Center. This proposal will develop a proof of concept showing that ìFD can fractionate proteins into droplets and couple them to a functional protein assay. The 3 specific aims include 1) Build a system for integrating the microfractionation system with size exclusion chromatography (SEC- ìFD); 2) Form a protein library using SEC-ìFD; and 3) Utilize the protein library in a model enzyme screening assay in droplet format. This interdisciplinary project creatively couples microfluidic technology with separation science in a way that can address a limiting problem in proteomics. The ultimate vision for this research is a system which can perform functional assays on all the proteins in a proteome, thereby realizing the vision described above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Discovering the function of proteins has had and will continue to have substantial impact on many areas of national priority, including biological research, pharmaceuticals, industrial/agricultural biotechnology, and alternative energy. This research will also have transformative impact in high throughput screening by providing a low cost, high performance alternative to microplates. As part of the BRIGE program, the PI has developed a multi-faceted educational outreach plan which promotes STEM to multiple demographics, including K-12 students, underrepresented minorities, undergraduates, women, and 20-30 year old "GenXers". Programs include the "Nanodays" program at the Detroit Science Center for elementary and middle school students, research experiences for minorities and undergraduates via Wayne State's SURA and REU programs, women in engineering programs at the Detroit Science Center, and informal Science Cafes targeted towards 20-30 year old students and young professionals in the metro Detroit area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chemical fractionation is a key step in the analysis of biological and environmental samples.  When analyzing a complex mixture of chemicals, it is first separated into its individual components using processes like liquid chromatography or electrophoresis.  Then, each fraction is analyzed immediately (inline detection) or placed in an isolated container for subsequent analysis (fractionation).  Conventional fraction collectors require a physical container for each fraction, which limits its scalability.   This grant explored a containerless fractionation technique called microfractionation in droplets (&mu;FD).   We showed that droplets suspended in oil, ie a droplet emulsion, can serve as containers for fraction collection.   Whereas conventional fractionation technology is limited to 100Æs of fractions, with &mu;FD it is possible to accommodate more than 10,000 fractions.   Furthermore, the volume of the fractions can be as little as 10 pL, many orders of magnitude smaller than conventional technology.  Both features are important in high throughput screening, an analytical approach where a large number of tests are conducted on a single sample.  These techniques are used in proteomics and drug discovery.  Our outcomes demonstrated the ability to integrate &mu;FD with popular separation processes.  By coupling a microfluidic droplet generator to a liquid chromatography column, we collected &gt;3500 fractions in &lt;10 minutes.   We also integrated &mu;FD with on-chip capillary electrophoresis (CE), demonstrating for the first time preparative CE in nL volumes.  For analyzing the droplet fractions, we developed a novel droplet tracking software called Droplet Morphometry and Velocimetry (DMV).   DMV is the first open software which can track droplets over multiple video frames and report on &gt;20 parameters related to size, shape, velocity and trajectory.  It is currently being used by &gt;50 labs in 15 countries worldwide.   Funding from this grant has resulted in 6 conference presentations, two MS theses and a pending journal paper, with two more planned in 2014/2015.  It has resulted in the discovery of new phenomena to be explored in the PIÆs further work, and an open software used by the microfluidics research community worldwide.  It has supported 2 Ph.D. students (one female), 2 MS students (one female), 1 undergraduate, and 1 high school student (recruited from the Detroit Science and Engineering fair).  It has also helped the PI conduct outreach efforts at the Michigan Science Center and Detroit Public Schools.            Last Modified: 11/19/2014       Submitted by: Amar Basu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
