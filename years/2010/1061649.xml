<AbstractNarration>Graduate student Maisa Taha (University of Arizona), supervised by Dr. Norma Mendoza-Denton, will do research in southeast Spain, where an intensive greenhouse agriculture boom has attracted immigrants from Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and above all, Muslim North Africa. This research will address the processes of incorporation and inclusion of immigrant populations resulting from globalization and transnational processes presently occurring.  Specifically it will focus on the interactions of Spanish and first-generation immigrant youth in high school classes designed to promote democratic values and ethical living (part of the EU's so-called "Citizenship" curricula). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will use participant observation, semi-structured interviews, focus groups and audio/video recordings to document how immigrant and Spanish students examine their own multicultural existences with each other and with teachers. The research will take place at high schools in three towns with distinct demographic profiles, with the objectives of (a) assessing the prevalence of East-versus-West arguments around ideals of freedom, equality, autonomy, and secularism taught in the Citizenship classes; (b) documenting political and cultural debates inside and outside of classrooms; and (c) historically contextualizing current debates about immigrant inclusion, education, and citizenship at the local, national, and pan-European levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are numerous broader impacts from this research. The project is significant because it will deepen understanding of how publicly-schooled youth in highly diverse settings engage with civic and ethical education intended to promote "unity-in-diversity" across the entire EU. Given the racial, linguistic, religious, and cultural differences that have segregated communities in southeast Spain, the findings from this study will also contribute to education policy and curriculum development while offering a first-hand view of an upcoming, newly multicultural generation of citizens learning to handle social inclusion and democratic action. Such results will prove relevant to policy makers, educators, community organizers and scholars around the world who seek ways of understanding how democracy and pluralism can grow in tandem, particularly when it comes to marginalized and often stigmatized, non-Western groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This ethnographic study of high school classrooms in southeast Spain focused on understanding the daily interactions of Spanish and immigrant youth and their teachers in democratic citizenship education classes. Much has been written about the ideals behind "values" or "character" education and about the philosophies of community and civic vibrancy that drive democratic education.

Southeast Spain was an ideal area for this study given its recent economic development and dramatic rise in foreign labor, resulting in cross-cultural frictions. In other words, it is an area that is learning to be diverse amidst unprecedented flows of people and goods; and schools are to guide youth in adopting attitudes and behaviors conducive to peace and cross-cultural understanding.  A key element in current citizenship curricula, including those in use in Spain, is an emphasis on dialogue and debate as interactional channels for acquiring democratic dispositions such as tolerance, respect, self-knowledge, and a belief in the equality of all people. Citizenship education classrooms are in this way designed to provide both lessons on and experience with democratic interaction.

Findings from this project illuminate the everyday challenges of promoting democracy and diversity. First, classroom discussions unintentionally framed democratic citizenship as normative and exclusionary, rather than flexible and inclusive. For example, because gender equality holds a prominent place within Spanish political ideologies and acts as a symbol of Spaniards' social advancement since Francisco Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975), the fact that Moroccan Muslim students came from families with traditional gender roles set them apart during discussions of balancing household chores and women's equality in the workplace.   Second, immigrant students of different backgrounds had different experiences and frameworks for participation in citizenship education classes. Rumanian and Eastern European students enjoyed model minority status, Latin American and Sub-Saharan African students were very few in number and well integrated into Spanish peer groups, but Moroccan students were objects of fear. Conversational frameworks of cultural sharing were meant to make Moroccan youth into "known" entities but instead placed them on unequal footing with their classmates as objects of public scrutiny. Moroccan students' strategies for resisting this positioning&mdash;through silence, side conversations, and refusals to participate&mdash;reinforced teacher and peer perceptions that they were ghettoized. Such experiences strengthened Moroccan students' own perceptions of the ideological contradictions of their host community.
