<AbstractNarration>Face-to-face conversation is often considered the most basic form of language use, as it likely played a key role as languages evolved and it continues to play important roles in  language acquisition and communication. With support from the NSF, the investigator will conduct a 3-year study of the way language is used and understood in interactive conversation. Engaging in conversation fundamentally depends on the insights we form about the knowledge and beliefs of our conversational partner. Sometimes these insights are correct, sometimes they fail dramatically, and other times the insights are not formed at all. This project will develop and test a theoretical framework for understanding how these insights are formed and used and, crucially, when they fail. The experiments combine eye-tracking technology with interactive conversation to study these processes in real time. This project will provide key insights into how a poorly understood but core component of language, that is, forming insights about the perspective of another person, guides every-day language use.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will provide opportunities for extensive, hands-on research for graduate and undergraduate students. Undergraduate participants from groups that are underrepresented in science will have the opportunity to participate through the University of Illinois Summer Research Opportunity Program.</AbstractNarration>

Project Outcomes:              If you want to ask someone a question, this involves the use of incredibly sophisticated representations of who knows what: We generally ask questions to seek new information, rather than to ask about what we already know about. We ask the question of someone who we think knows the answer, rather than someone we believe to be unknowledgeable. Doing so requires us to distinguish what we know from what other people know, and is a basic component of the uniquely human facility called theory of mind.              This project was aimed at examining how we learn and use theory of mind information in face-to-face conversation. Several key findings came about as a result of this research.     First, we discovered that people are better at reasoning about what other people know if you are talking with another person in a live, interactive conversation. The more each person interacted, by saying things like "yeah, got it", the better this information was used.

For example, when shopping for fish at a grocery store, we might provide a detailed description of which fish we would like to purchase, such as the large tail-piece of salmon. We keep track of these descriptions and continue to use them even in situations where it is no longer necessary to have such detail, such as when pulling the fish out of the fridge at home. This research shows that the way we store this information in memory may explain why people may persist in talking about the large tail-piece, even when only a single cut of fish is in the refrigerator.     Third, we found that people differ in how well they keep track of who knows what. Some people excel at using this information; other people are less skilled at doing so. The research funded by this grant examined some of the factors that predict w...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
