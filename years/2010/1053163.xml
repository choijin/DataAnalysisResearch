<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a five-day International Conference on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) Modeling Fluids and Complex Fluids to be held at the Centre for Nonlinear Studies, Northwest University, Xi'an, P.R. China, June 13-17, 2011. The award will provide partial support for US participants, with a special emphasis on graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and researchers from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some important progress has been recently made in analysis and understanding  of  Partial Differential Equation  that describe many important fluid phenomena related to oceanic and atmospheric dynamics, motion of liquid crystals and other applications.  In addition, significant progress has been made in the analytical and numerical study of non-Newtonian complex fluids and polymeric flows, and in the study of transport and mixing in fluid turbulence. This international conference is aimed at presenting and developing the recent successful approaches and at fostering collaborations between researchers from different disciplines including PDEs, harmonic analysis and numerical computations.  It is expected that this conference will yield new strategies for the resolution of many remaining open problems. Plenary talks by leading experts in the field will be combined with shorter talks, discussions and poster presentations.  All junior participants will be encouraged and given an opportunity to present their results. The National Natural Science Foundation (NNSF) of the P.R. China and the Centre for Nonlinear Studies at Northwest University will provide funds to cover the local expenses in China. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://www.math.okstate.edu/~jiahong/PDE_Conference/Xian_Conference</AbstractNarration>

Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental tools in understanding many fluid phenomena ranging from small scale blood flows to large-scale geophysical flows and have played pivotal roles in many practical applications involving fluid flows. In the last fewyears, these PDEs have gained renewed interests and significant progress has been made. One goal of this conference has been to broadly disseminate these recent advances in a timely fashion.  This conference assembled a distinguished group of experts on the focused PDEs from several countries, including Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, South Korea, Spain,the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition, eight junior mathematiciansfrom the United States and more than seventy beginning researchers from China also attended this conference.  During this week-long international conference, researchers from the United States, China and other countries were able to communicate directly with each other on the most recent developments. Their combined efforts have generated new ideas and strategies that may lead to the resolution of some outstanding open problems. Extensive international collaborations have been initiated. This conference helped charter some future directions for the field.  This conference also provided an excellent opportunity for training and mentoring students and recent Ph.D.'s. Eight junior mathematicians from the United States (some from under-represented groups) and more than seventy from China attended this conference with many of them given the opportunities to present their researches. They communicated extensively with the leading experts of their fields and built social and collaborative networks with other participants.
