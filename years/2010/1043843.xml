<AbstractNarration>The scientific enterprise in America requires enterprise class security to assure competitive advantage and efficiently advance discovery and invention.  Across NSF funded activities there is pervasive and increasing concern with the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of scientific workflows, resources, data, and personal information.  Threats include data loss and corruption due to archive failures or malicious attacks, release of private data maliciously or accidentally, or loss of computational or network capacity due to system software failure or compromise. The good news is that there are a number of common security solutions that support NSF researchers today however support for these is limited and often left to the individual development or project teams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF-sponsored workshop will explore the potential for a cross-disciplinary Scientific Software Security Innovation Institute (S3I2) to address the protection, integrity, and reliability of research software, systems, and information. The goal of this workshop is to identify the needs for, and models of, an S3I2 to address secure scientific cyberinfrastructure in the United States. To accomplish this goal, the workshop will bring together representatives from NSF funded projects, researchers, developers, and resource providers.  The workshop will cover the topics of: research security needs; existing tools, systems, processes and organizations that secure research activities and data; outstanding issues to be addressed in research assurance; and organization and operational models for a future security institute targeting the identified security needs.  The workshop will result in an analysis of these needs and solutions and discuss the advantages of potential models for a S3I2 to address America?s research assurance needs.</AbstractNarration>

The topic of the workshop was the potential benefits of a security-focused software institute to serve the entire NSF research and development community.

Towards those goals, the participants of the 2011 workshop included greater representation from MREFC and large NSF projects, and, for the most part, did not overlap with the participants from the 2010 workshop.     A highlight of the second workshop was a presentation by Scott Koranda of the LIGO project on the history of LIGOÆs identity management activities and how those could have benefited from a security institute. A key analysis he presented is that, by his estimation, LIGO could have saved 2 senior FTE-years of effort by following suitable expert guidance had it existed.     The overarching finding from the workshops is that security is a critical crosscutting issue for the NSF software infrastructure and recommended a security-focused activity to address this issue broadly, for example a security software institute (S2I2) under the SI2 program. Additionally, the 2010 workshop participants agreed to 15 key additional findings, which the 2011 workshop confirmed, with some refinement as discussed in this report. The major refinements from the 2011 workshop were:  The NSF CI ecosystem increasing includes a number of "cloud" and other services provided by external parties. Any effort to increase the trustworthiness of that CI ecosystem must take those services into account in addition to software produced under NSF funding. The S2I2 must carefully balance providing a service unbiased towards any particular solution with keeping its staff suitably up-to-date through their involvement in projects, including the research and development of solutions. Adoption of orphaned software is a measure of last resort and the S2I2 should ideally avoid it if at all possible through planning and coordination.  Assessment of software and services is valuable, but the S2I2 must be careful not to turn it into a purely bureaucratic function. A key goal of the S2I2 in providing leadership is the continuous building and distribution (through education, training and workforce development) of a body of knowledge on the topic of trustworthy CI. This includes successes and lessons learned from projects so that other projects can benefit from those. A key goal of the S2I2 in providing leadership is aggregating community needs and speaking on behalf of the community to external entities (e.g. InCommon, REN-ISAC).           These refinements resulted in the following set of refined key findings:  A security-focused S2I2 should provide NSF and the NSF research community with security leadership and guidance. A security-focused S2I2 should provide documentation, training, recommendations, and consulting to NSF cyberinfrastructure projects both on software security and security software. A security-focused S2I2 should provide short-term support for orphaned security software deemed critical to NSF cyberinfrastructure projects. A security-focused S2I2 should perform independent software and services security assessments. A security-focused S2I2 should support security design reviews of MREFC projects or smaller CI development and integration efforts. The institute should independently highlight/rank security software that NSF CI relies upon. The institute should provide a security auditin...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
