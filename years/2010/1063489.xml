<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The fundamental goal of this proposal is to address, for the first time, the static and dynamic magnetic behavior of metallic, nanoengineered heterostructures in the single-domain limit and in the size-range of 30-300 nm, that include shape-controlled single layers, tri-layers of synthetic anti-ferromagnets, and heterostructures with exchange-bias and exchange-spring behavior. It will emphasize size-dependent scaling laws, with studies of true nanoscale magnetic exchange phenomena by eliminating longer length-scale effects, collective behavior of large ensemble arrays and free-floating elements with complete degrees of freedom, including rotation. The central focus will be on the fundamental understanding of magnetic reversal behavior, interlayer coupling, exchange interactions, aging and memory effects and relaxation dynamics, all in the single domain limit and in the context of recent theoretical models. This new science will be enabled by high-throughput recently established nanoimprinting routines and by a series of careful and specialized magnetic measurements. Nanoimprinting allows the fabricate of identical, custom-shaped thin-film elements in the lateral size range between 30 and 300 nm over areas as large as several square centimeters---sufficient for macroscopic ensemble measurements. Unlike electron-beam lithography, with patterning times of many hours, nanoimprint lithography can pattern a whole substrate in just a few minutes. Moreover, the proposed synthesis method overcomes two principal limitations of wet-chemistry approaches, i.e. preparing monodisperse particles in this mesoscopic size range and creating heterostructured elements. Finally, the physical/magnetic microstructure at the nanometer length scale of the NLPs will be correlated at all stages with the magnetic properties measured using particle ensembles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The properties of materials depend critically on size, especially on the nanometer length scale. Magnetic properties express this behavior most prominently. At the macroscopic scale a magnetic material breaks down into domains to minimize its magnetostatic energy. As the size of the materials is made smaller it is no longer able to sustain multiple domains and becomes a single domain material. At this length scale, it becomes possible to explore fundamental and intrinsic magnetic behavior without the interference of extrinsic characteristics arising from domain walls. It is proposed to use a novel method to synthesize large numbers of such "designer particles" that are homogeneous in size, shape, morphology and magnetic characteristics by a newly developed technique of nanoimprint lithography---a method similar to rubber-stamping but with nanoscale features. This will enable the study of the magnetic response, as well as its time dependence, of sufficiently large number of "particles" to provide statistically significant data and understanding of magnetic behavior on this length scale. This fundamental work also has potential impact on the technologies of information storage, spin electronics, magnetic logic, hard magnets for energy applications and biological sensing. The simultaneous advancement of discovery with teaching, training and learning will be integrated. These activities include developing new lecture modules for an undergraduate course in Nanotechnology and a graduate class on Magnetic Materials. A new interactive exhibit for the annual UW, College of Engineering open house will be developed; is attended by more than 4000 students from local schools. The PI plans to make the extra effort to recruit minority/women students to UW and will specifically work with Spelman College, a historical African-American liberal arts college in Atlanta, which has a joint science/engineering program in place with UW. International collaborations on electron holography with a leading group in Japan are also planned.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Magnetic properties of materials critically depend on size. As you make them smaller, at some critical size, typically about 75-100nm, they become single domain; if you make them smaller further, typically 10-30nm, their magnetic structure becomes unstable and their magnetization fluctuates and points in random directions.  In other words, at this size, called superparamagnetism, a collection of such particles will show no magnetization in the absence of a field.  These sizes, ~50-100nm, where the magnetization is stable and single domain, is of fundamental and technological interest.  First, in order to understand such behavior we have to make large numbers of uniform magnets, on this size scale, and arrange them in well-ordered arrays.  To accomplish this, we developed a technique call nanoimprint lithography &ndash;&ndash; a method similar to rubber-stamping &ndash;&ndash; to develop high quality arrays of magnetic dots (Figure 1).  We then studied the behavior of such arrays made of a material with high coercivity (a larger negative field is required to reverse its magnetization).  Such magnetic arrays, called bit-patterned media, are of technological interest in developing the next generation magnetic hard disks with much higher density of storage.   Lithographic methods can also be developed to build small magnetic elements with complicated shape and three-dimensional magnetization structure.  Using nanoimprint lithography we made sub-micron elements in the shape of a sombrero.  We then studied them carefully and determined their three-dimensional magnetization structure by a combination of imaging and modeling.  Whilst these studies are fundamental in nature, they give us insight into making complex elements that may have practical utility. We envision that if we can make such 3D elements, comprised of alternating layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials, and release them into solution, their response to an alternating magnetic field could potentially be useful for biomedical applications such as cancer therapy.   Another complex structure that we studied were arrays of rings, where each ring is made of multiple layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials.  These rings are also of fundamental interest.  If you make a small magnetic disk it has a magnetic structure &ndash;&ndash; a singularity &ndash;&ndash; with a high-energy component right in the middle (an analogy would be a galaxy with a high energy black hole in its center); however, if you make a ring, you eliminate this high energy singularity at its center.  In this case we used photolithography and our goal was to study the magnetization structure of such rings.  We also studied the response of such rings to the passage of current in a tunneling geometry.  We also studied lithographic approaches to make logic gates for information processing using only magnetic elements without the use of a current (imagine a lap-top computer that does not heat up). This emerging field is called magnetic quantum cellular automata (MQCA) and our contribution was to find novel ways to enhance magnetic signal propagation, build simple logic gates (AND, NOR etc.) and design a full adder.   Finally, we made investigations of magnetic coupling between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials (exchange bias) on the small length scale using lithography.  We gained fundamental insights into characteristic length scales, the role of interfaces and the effect of shape anisotropy on this phenomenon.     The broader impact of this work includes (a) training of highly skilled personnel ( doctoral students) for both academia and industry; (b) developing NIL techniques at our cleanroom to benefit local industry; (c) motivating undergraduate students to pursue a career in STEM disciplines; (d) encouraging youth ( K-12) to consider the excitement of science through the College of Engineering open house; (e) enabling the next generation information storage devices by developing bit-p...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
