<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  2010 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Solid State Chemistry, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program will be held in Colby-Sawyer College, New London, NH, USA (Aug 1-6, 2010). The principle topic of the 2010 Solid State Chemistry Gordon Research Conference is "Functional Materials By Design". This conference will continue the precedent of bringing together researchers from diverse backgrounds, studying a variety of materials types, to discuss the latest advances and challenges in solid state chemistry. In the spirit of the GRC concept, the intent of this meeting is to promote the exchange of ideas and the building of strong relationships among academic, industrial, and government researchers working on the frontiers of the field of solid state chemistry. Speakers, as well as poster presenters, will be encouraged to emphasize advances, unpublished work, new ideas, and speculations for the future on a variety of current topics. The field of solid state chemistry includes a broad cross-section of materials disciplines, and the intellectual exchange at the annual Gordon conference truly shapes the future directions of the field. Discovery of new materials, however, bears the potential to generate new properties and exotic phenomena, and can initiate dramatic advances in technological innovations as well as in basic science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The speakers at the 2010 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Solid State Chemistry represent academic, industrial, and government laboratories with a strong international contribution. Leading scientists working in various areas of solid state chemistry have been invited, resulting in a program which is expected to draw the interest of many researchers in the field. As a result, the content of some sessions cuts across different materials types and uses, and should therefore draw the interest of those working on diverse classes of compounds. Many younger scientists are included in the program along with more senior and distinguished scientists, promising to make the presentations and discussions representative of new directions in the field. Speakers have been explicitly encouraged to present forward-looking discussions of frontier issues.  Funds will be used to enable 30 students, post-docs and faculty from undergraduate institutions to attend the conference.  Special attention will be given to broadening participation from underrepresented groups during the selection process.</AbstractNarration>

In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.  Thank you for your support of this Conference.
