<AbstractNarration>Many college math and science students have difficulty developing and evaluating mathematical arguments and proofs. As a result, a number of colleges and universities have instituted introduction to proof transition courses to help prepare these students for more theoretical upper level math courses, but with limited success. Building on prior work, this project continues to develop a library of high quality videos of students constructing proofs that are appropriate for such a transition course, and develops methods for using these videos to help students strengthen their abilities at solving problems and constructing proofs. These videos are used for both professional development and to support student learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using guided discussions with faculty, the videos help mathematics teachers develop insights into some of the mysteries of students' mathematical thinking, enabling them to hone their pedagogical approaches. For example, the videos have helped some faculty develop insight into three critical moments that play an important role in students' proof production: (1) finding a key idea that gives insight into why the claim is true and that helps guide proof development, (2) finding a technical handle that allows the student to communicate the key idea in a way that is precise and that insures the proof is correct, and (3) integrating all the necessary ideas and steps of the argument and writing a coherent, formal proof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For student learning, the videos help students develop their reasoning abilities. Particular ways the videos help are:&lt;br/&gt;1) Students learn the value of taking the time to unpack the statement to be proved, of using definitions, of stepping back and considering alternative approaches, of considering why their approach was not working in a particular situation, and of letting that understanding guide the use of other approaches.&lt;br/&gt;2) Students learn to not only begin with examples, but to use examples in ways that generate insight, a key idea, or a technical handle as they learn to ask whether their examples are helping them, and if not, why not.&lt;br/&gt;3) Students practice becoming more reflective on their own thinking. The students in the videos are only slightly more advanced than the students watching, so their thinking is more visible than that of the professor to the viewing students. Viewers are able to compare their ideas with those of the students in the videos, see the thinking of the students in the video unfold, see them make errors, and learn how these errors can be resolved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ability to write clear, correct arguments in support of complicated technical statements is an important skill needed by professionals in STEM disciplines.  In the field of mathematics, this skill can be observed when mathematics students develop and evaluate arguments in support of mathematical statements, a task often referred to as proof writing. To support the development of this skill, many colleges and universities have designed introduction-to-proof courses that help prepare students for more theoretical upper level math courses.  However, even with the establishment of such courses, students still struggle with a number of issues related to proof construction.  The goal of this project was to develop an educational resource that helps identify and navigate many of the common obstacles that proof-writing courses have thus far insufficiently addressed.       To that end, this project involved creating an online video library of over 40 carefully edited videos, most under 10 minutes in length, showing college mathematics students working in pairs to prove mathematical statements that they had not previously seen. These authentic videos are designed to help reveal student thought processes, including where and why the students struggle and how they get themselves back on track.  The videos can be used in a variety of courses in which students develop their own critical thinking skills, though they were created with an introduction-to-proof class in mind.  In such an environment, the videos can help students and faculty better understand specific issues that arise in the construction of proofs. By watching and discussing the videos, students can focus on the work of the students in the video to observe the effectiveness of the processes they are utilizing as they try to prove or disprove a mathematical statement.  In the process of developing the videos, we field-tested a variety of effective ways to use the videos in introductory proof courses, both in the classroom and for out-of-class assignments.

These materials include a summary of each video, the issues that arise in the video, and suggestions for where to pause the video along with questions to pose when using the video with students in a classroom setting.   The key benefit of these videos is that, when used in the classroom together with a well-guided discussion, they allow students to watch other students at their skill level explain their reasoning and address obstacles as they move toward proving or disproving a statement.  This interactive experience encourages the viewer to evaluate how the students in the video are approaching a problem and challenges them to consider and explain why a particular approach may or may not be working.  Our experience using these videos suggests that by observing the process and pitfalls as they occur, students recognize the pitfalls more readily and can develop strategies to overcome them.   By referring to the supplementary materials on the website, teachers can easily choose a video in which a particular issue is revealed and can be discussed.     Faculty can also use the videos for their own professional development, to gain insight and better understand studentsÆ mathematical thinking. In fact, these videos have been used in a number of settings in which faculty from a variety of institutions discussed them to gain collective insight into studentsÆ difficulties with proofs. This can help faculty become more effective teachers. We have offered a number of workshops and minicourses for faculty and have introduced our videos to well over 200 mathematics faculty.
