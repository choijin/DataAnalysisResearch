<AbstractNarration>This project is a collaboration between anthropologists Dr. Deborah A. Poole (Johns Hopkins University) and Dr. Penelope Harvey (The London School of Economics and Political Science), which is being co-funded by the National Science Foundation and the United Kingdom's Arts and Humanities Research Council through a Memorandum of Understanding between the two agencies.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poole and Harvey will undertake research on the contemporary nation state as a multiscalar entity, to investigate how it acquires political and affective force at the interface between local, regional and transnational levels of organization and practice. Their research will be conducted in Cusco, Peru, where they will collect data on new forms of regulatory and technical systems developed in the wake of a governmental administration re-organization that has given new power to regional governments. The research will consider two domains of state authority in particular: (1) law, in the form of the international treaties and conventions that regulate how nation states govern indigenous populations and the environment; and (2)  infrastructural engineering, more specifically the metrics, techniques, and standards of engineering works that frame the ways in which modern states transform public space and infrastructural systems. Their ten-month ethnographic will focus on controversies surrounding technical practices, legal interpretation, and expert knowledge in a World Bank-funded public works project that is both administered by the Regional Government of Cusco and subject to international indigenous, environmental, and regulatory laws. The research team will trace these controversies as they unfold in relationship to two specific activities within the project: the construction of a by-pass around an important archaeological site, and a territorial mapping program designed to reorganize and rationalize urban and rural land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through its novel combination of perspectives drawn from the social science of law, and of science and technology, this research will make significant contributions to social science methodology and theory. Findings from this project will contribute to better understanding of the structure and fucntioning of contempoary state systems. The project also will advance international research and policy-development collaborations between the United States, Britain, and Peru.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       This collaborative field-research project explores the role of experimentation, ambiguity and affect in public development projects and local participatory government in Cusco, Peru.     Its goal is to deepen understandings of local responses to both fiscal and administrative decentralization on the national level, and the global rescaling of regulatory networks and norms. Scholars disagree if the privatization and globalization of such traditional state functions as development, economic regulation, and security have produced weaker versions of the nation state; or if global governance has instead reinforced state power by expanding the state's regulatory and surveillance capacities.   Our research suggests that any attempt to evaluate outcomes in terms of measurable degrees of state power, must first confront the challenge which highly mobile and dispersed regulatory regimes and governmental practices present for the scientific study of state form at the level of local and regional government.      Field research was carried out in diverse sites of local (municipal) and regional government in Cusco Peru over a twelve month period in 2011-2012.    The two PIs (Prof. Penelope Harvey and Prof. Deborah Poole) led a team of four anthropologists, all with strong previous experience working in or studying local governmental dynamics in the Andean region.   Fieldwork focused on tracking (a) the idioms and practices of participatory politics including budgeting and public consultations, and (b) the planning and implementation of basic development in the areas of risk mitigation, road construction, territorial ordering, sanitation and waste management.    Methodologically, each member of the research team was charged with closely observing interactions among government functionaries, experts, local citizens, and non-governmental organizations, as they unfolded across various governmental sites and in relationship to specific legal and technical instruments.   Through such a collaborative, multisited methodology we were able to track how modes of expert knowledge such as engineering and law were differently mobilized in specific municipal, regional and local contexts, and in relationship to specific fiscal and development policies.   As such, our collaborative methodology has yielded new insights into the complex scaling of political and technical knowledge in decentralized state structures.     Our research makes original methodological and theoretical contributions to the scientific study of the modern state.  Methodologically, our project demonstrates the value of collaborative ethnographic research for comparative, interdisciplinary study of the neoliberal state.   Specifically, by tracking actors, norms,  and instruments across the multiple social and government sites that participate in fiscal planning and development, we forward a "multi-sited" and "non-sited" model for ethnographic collaboration that is responsive to the dispersed territories and regulatory regimes that define the neoliberal state.  Theoretically, our research on local development and governance in Cusco deepens comparative understandings of the ways in which local histories and cultures shape repertoires of political experimentation.    Our research also engages with public debates regarding corruption, local political authority, and the neoliberal state in Latin America and elsewhere.   Specifically, our research provides new empirical evidence on local responses to the normative and regulatory ambiguities, as well as the entrenched forms of central power, that have plagued decentralization in Peru.
