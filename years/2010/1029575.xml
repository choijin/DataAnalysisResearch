<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to connect the cellular microstructure of solid foams to their superb high stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight ratios as well as excellent energy absorption characteristics under quasi-static and dynamic loadings. This project uses X-ray tomography to characterize the random cellular microstructure of metallic foams and trabecular bone. The geometry extracted and the mechanical properties of the base material are introduced into micromechanically accurate analytical and finite element models that are used to calculate the mechanical response under quasi-static and dynamic compression; this starts from the initial small deformation linearly elastic regime to the large deformation crushed regime. The uniqueness of the work lies in the analysis of actual random microstructures that may include graded cell sizes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite significant gains in our understanding of the connection between the cellular microstructure and the mechanical properties of foams, the subject remains empirical. The models and closed-form expressions of properties developed in this project can be used to design foams to fit the application or to evaluate the degree of degradation of patient bones, thus bringing science to the hitherto empirical subject. The project will train researchers to become future leaders in multidisciplinary research in academia and industry. The results will be disseminated through journal publications, conferences, university lectures, and through contact with international and industrial researchers in the field. Interaction with industrial researchers also serves to disseminate results directly to users and helps keep the project pointed towards a practical direction.</AbstractNarration>

The system analyzed was an aluminum alloy open-cell foam of relative density of approximately 8%.  The crushing of the foam was first investigated quasi-statically where it was found to exhibit the characteristic initial linear elastic response that terminates into a local maximum.  This is followed by an extended stress plateau during which crushing localizes and gradually spreads until the whole specimen is crushed. The completion of crushing occurs at about 55% average strain following which the densified material exhibits saturation type hardening.

Micro-mechanically accurate finite element models where used to reproduce all aspects of this behavior to a great degree of accuracy for the first time. The models were used to study parametrically the elastic moduli, the "yielding" stress and strain, and the energy absorption capacity.  A second aspect of the study involved impact experiments on 2-inch diameter specimens. The induced stress was measured using a pressure bar, and the deformation was captured using high-speed photography. It was found that impact above a critical speed resulted in the development of shocks commonly seen at very high impact speeds of most solids.
