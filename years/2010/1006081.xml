<AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of California-San Diego is to investigate magnetic remote spatio-temporal control of biomaterials and their payloads. Magnetic nanocapsules containing therapeutics could provide a viable means to remotely control the release of therapeutics to cell aggregates, through the blood vessels and blood-brain barrier. The magnetic nanocapsules respond to remotely applied magnetic fields to release drugs on-demand. To experimentally demonstrate the concept of spatio-temporal control of biomaterial response, the investigators will design and construct nanocapsules with innovative on-off switchable drug delivery approaches.  The nature and dimension of these capsulated magnetic materials with therapeutics will be varied to understand the effects of these parameters on biomaterial characteristics and their drug release behavior. The anticipated impacts are expected to be significant in the drug delivery area that will benefit clinically challenging central nervous system disorders as well as cancer treatments. Graduate students will be trained with the multidisciplinary facets of this research project, and involves highly interdisciplinary fields such as materials science, biology, bioengineering, chemistry and chemical engineering. The educational outreach plan of this project will involve Annual San Diego Science Festival (Science Week San Diego) and Teacher Training and Professional Development programs that are organized by the BioBridge Science Outreach Initiative, a community based partnership among University of California, San Diego, San Diego School districts and industry.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This research project aims to investigate smart drug release systems based on magnetic nanocapsules containing therapeutic drug payloads. Such a controllable drug delivery techniques could provide viable means to treat Alzheimer's disease and other central nervous system disorders, and various types of cancers using on-demand release of drugs. To experimentally demonstrate the concept of remote spatio-temporal control of biomaterial response, the investigators will design and construct nanocapsules, and the nature and dimension of the capsule materials and magnetic materials will be varied to understand the effects of these parameters on biomaterial characteristics and efficiency of drug release behavior. The new technique can also be applied broadly to many other therapeutic areas to benefit large patient populations, and also provide opportunities for broader economic stimulus. The new approach will also stimulate many scientists and engineers in the materials science and bioengineering field for further innovations and understanding of biomaterials design, behavior and applications. This highly multidisciplinary research project will also emphasize the educational aspects for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, including under-privileged high school students.</AbstractNarration>
