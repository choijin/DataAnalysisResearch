<AbstractNarration>PIs plan two workshops to develop the archival conventions for the use of amino acid racemization (AAR) in studies of earth surface and sedimentary crustal processes. Data generation has been ongoing over the last 40-50 years in laboratories both in the US and internationally, but no convention or database has been agreed to for archiving such information that would be accessible to all. PIs have laid out plans for the first workshop to be held in conjunction with the 2010 annual national meeting of the Geological Society of America in Denver this fall followed up by the International Meeting of INQUA to be held in Bern, Switzerland in July, 2011.</AbstractNarration>
