<AbstractNarration>The goals of the Beyond Weather and Water Cycle project are to increase elementary teachers' understanding of climate and climate change, increase the amount and quality of science taught in elementary classrooms, and build a virtual professional learning community of practice. These goals will be accomplished by contextualizing and adapting existing developmentally-appropriate digital resources including differentiated, engaging informational texts; developing an online climate literacy course for elementary teachers; and utilizing Web 2.0 tools to provide interactive experiences and to facilitate virtual, collaborative professional development. Structured around the seven essential principles of climate literacy, instructional and professional resources will take elementary teachers and their students past the superficial understanding and teaching of weather and the water cycle to a solid understanding of climate. The project leverages the investment that NSF has made with the Beyond Penguins and Polar Bears project and continues to make in the educational, social, and technical infrastructures of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) by using NSDL-funded projects (especially CLEAN - the NSDL Climate Literacy Pathway project), tools, systems, and partnerships as a means to multiply project impact. This project is creative in its integration of science and literacy and innovative, transformative, and Earth-friendly in its use of Web 2.0 tools to provide e-education opportunities and facilitate virtual, collaborative professional development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Beyond Weather and the Water Cycle  is an online professional development magazine which focuses on preparing elementary teachers to teach climate science concepts while also integrating inquiry-based science and literacy instruction. The project draws on research showing that an integrated approach can improve student achievement in science, as well as in reading comprehension and oral and written discourse abilities. Beyond Weather and the Water Cycle is modeled on an award-winning NSF-funded project Beyond Penguins and Polar Bears: Integrating Literacy and Science in K-5 Classrooms. Structured around the seven essential principles of climate literacy (U.S. Climate Change Science Program, 2009), instructional and professional resources take elementary teachers and their students past the superficial understanding and teaching of weather and the water cycle to a solid understanding of climate. An interdisciplinary approach fosters an understanding of Earth (and its climate) as a system of interconnected parts.

More importantly, this empathy seemed to influence future teaching styles of the teacher participants.  &gt;&gt;Grade 3-5 student content knowledge of concepts foundational to understanding of climate science was improved.    &gt;&gt;The greatest improvements in teacher content knowledge were related to teachers developing studentsÆ conceptual understanding, engaging students in reflection about their learning, and presenting intellectually rigorous lessons.
