<AbstractNarration>Logic solvers are software programs that can solve complex logical&lt;br/&gt;formulas fully automatically.  Problems in many areas of Computer&lt;br/&gt;Science, such as artificial intelligence, program analysis, security,&lt;br/&gt;hardware verification, and cyber-physical systems can be&lt;br/&gt;translated into logical formulas.  Those formulas can then be solved&lt;br/&gt;fully automatically by logic solvers. Over the past two decades, at&lt;br/&gt;least ten different logic-solving communities have emerged, based on&lt;br/&gt;different logical languages and solving techniques.  These communities&lt;br/&gt;have independently been building computing infrastructure to aid&lt;br/&gt;development and evaluation of their solvers: libraries of benchmark&lt;br/&gt;formulas, cluster-backed web services, annual competitions, and more.&lt;br/&gt;Such infrastructure also provides an important access point for&lt;br/&gt;users, who can find all the solvers at one site, or even run solvers&lt;br/&gt;on the infrastructure cluster to test their relative capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to build a single piece of shared&lt;br/&gt;computing infrastructure called StarExec, which will be used by &lt;br/&gt;different logic solving communities.  StarExec will provide improved&lt;br/&gt;services for established logic-solving communities, and lower the&lt;br/&gt;entry barrier for new and emerging communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The StarExec infrastructure will consist of a custom web service&lt;br/&gt;interfacing to a medium-sized compute cluster.  This open-source&lt;br/&gt;service will allow multiple logic-solving communities to host&lt;br/&gt;benchmark libraries, run jobs comparing different solvers, and host&lt;br/&gt;competitions.  StarExec will leverage economies of scale to provide&lt;br/&gt;more sophisticated services than is feasible for most individual&lt;br/&gt;logic-solving communities.  A very important goal of StarExec is not&lt;br/&gt;just to collocate different logic-solving communities, but to unite&lt;br/&gt;them.  To this end, the StarExec team will develop formal&lt;br/&gt;specifications of both the syntax and proof-theoretic semantics of&lt;br/&gt;different communities' logical languages.  This will be done using a&lt;br/&gt;meta-language called LFSC ("Logical Framework with Side Conditions"),&lt;br/&gt;developed in previous NSF-funded research.  Translation of formulas&lt;br/&gt;between compatible fragments of different logics will be implemented,&lt;br/&gt;which will will enable a greater degree of integration between solver&lt;br/&gt;communities than was previously possible.  For example, it will be&lt;br/&gt;possible for solvers in one community to be run on benchmarks from&lt;br/&gt;another.  This integration will also aid users of logic solvers, who&lt;br/&gt;will have a greater variety of options, all in a common framework, for&lt;br/&gt;solving their problems.  The broader impact of the StarExec project&lt;br/&gt;will be to accelerate the development, adoption, and convergence of&lt;br/&gt;different logic-solving technologies.  This will enable faster&lt;br/&gt;progress in nationally important application areas such as artificial&lt;br/&gt;intelligence, verification, security, and cyber-physical systems,&lt;br/&gt;which increasingly depend on high-performance logic solvers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project created the StarExec (www.starexec.org) web service, for evaluating logic solvers.  Logic solving is one of the oldest areas of Computer Science, and has seen a resurgence of interest as solvers for different kinds of logics have been improved to the point where they can serve as powerful generic backend tools for solving problems in different application areas.  StarExec provides a medium-sized (around 200 nodes) compute cluster for researchers to run their own or others' solvers on benchmark formulas, to measure performance.  Such measurement is a critical part of improving solvers.  StarExec has been used the past four years to run many competitions and evaluations that different logic-solving subcommunities organize, to spur improvements in solvers and adoption of standard input formats for benchmarks.  For 2017, for example, StarExec was used to run eight such competitions, including the SAT Competition for SAT solvers, one of the biggest.  By developing a single piece of powerful infrastructure that can be used by different subcommunities -- StarExec hosts 12 such -- the project has had a strong positive impact both on the field of logic solving, where now larger evaluations than ever before are routining conducted thanks to the notable compute power of StarExec; and also on the many application areas that are making increasing use of logic solvers as backend tools (since the generality of logic enables many different kinds of problems to be expressed as logic problems).  Examples of such areas include formal verification, software analysis, software synthesis, artificial intelligence and planning, computational mathematics, and more.  Thus the project has had a strong indirect broader impact.  Within the field of logic solving, StarExec has become the gold standard for large-scale evaluation, and is used not just for the many community-organized competitions and evaluations already mentioned, but also by individual researchers, who ran, on average, 1.1 million solver invocations per week in the last year of the project (and with similar numbers earlier in the project).  StarExec has received a subsequent grant from NSF, with the goal of increasing the impact of the system through development of  a distribution of the StarExec software, which others can freely install on their own clusters.  In continuing cooperation with Prof. Geoff Sutcliffe at Miami University, we will be developing this distribution to be installed first on a new cluster hosted there.  This will help extend the value of StarExec past the expected lifetime of the current hardware, by ensuring that the substantial amount of software running the service (over 100kloc) can be adopted also by others for their own clusters.
