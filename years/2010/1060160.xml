<AbstractNarration>The Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Scholarship Program is to provide scholarships for 32 academically-talented, financially-challenged students in Industrial and Systems Engineering or Mechanical Engineering at Oakland University. Student scholars receive special training in PLM techniques, enabling them to assume leadership roles in an emerging field necessary to future engineering practice. Skills learned by the students are precisely those that are essential to revitalize, to diversify and to broaden Michigan's foundering economy. The goal of the program is to enable students to graduate in four years with a B.S. degree ready to enter the high technology workforce or continue on at the graduate level. Faculty, along with members of the student chapter of the Society of Women Engineers, work closely with the Oakland School district, SWE Detroit Section, Gear-Up Program, Detroit Area Pre College Engineering Program and Oakland University Public Schools Academy to recruit students into the program. Students are organized in cohorts and assigned faculty and industrial mentors. Industrial mentors assist the students in obtaining summer internships. Oakland's Academic Skills Center trains tutors dedicated to the program for individual tutoring during the first two years. The cohort is encouraged to participate in specially organized senior design projects.&lt;br/&gt;Studying the effects of faculty and industrial mentoring is driving changes in the fundamental structure of how Oakland University recruits, supports, and retains engineering students, especially under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A National Science Foundation Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) grant to Oakland University helped students to pursue and obtain their educational and career goals in the fields of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering.   Oakland University received the S-STEM grant (#1060160) to fund its Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Scholarship Program, and the outcome is a group of 31 engineering graduates beginning their engineering careers at a variety of companies or attending graduate school.  In addition, 3 more engineering students who were supported with PLM Scholarships are scheduled to graduate in December 2018 with another scheduled to graduate in April 2019.  "The PLM scholarship program is more than just financial help," said Russell Bauer, an Industrial and Systems Engineering graduate working at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA).  "It allows students to network and communicate with established professors within their fields. These professors can then assist students with projects, contacts, and most importantly, finding job experience."  "Over my four years at OU, I have received $4,800 a year from the scholarship, but the most valuable asset is still the connections I have made, which have led to job offers."  The PLM scholarship program provided scholarships to academically-talented, financially-challenged students in the Industrial and Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering programs at Oakland University.   "Being just shy of the Presidential scholarship requirements at OU, the PLM scholarship has been instrumental in me balancing funding for my education and relieving some of the financial stress, allowing me to focus on excelling with my schoolwork," Bauer said.  As part of the program, students were organized in cohorts and assigned faculty mentors, who assisted the students in obtaining summer or year-round engineering internships at a wide variety of companies.  The project's Principal Investigator Dr. Robert Van Til , Pawley Professor of Lean Studies and Chair of the ISE Department, notes "We are extremely grateful to the National Science Foundation for awarding us this grant.  We enjoyed working with our PLM scholarship students to help them through our engineering programs."  "Several of the students have told me that the scholarship has been very important in allowing them to enroll in, and remain at, Oakland University. It is exciting to see the PLM scholarship students graduating and starting their careers in engineering. They have been highly sought after by several companies."  For Bauer, the PLM scholarship program provided him with the connections needed to find his dream job.  "I am currently working at FCA on advancing technologies such as motion capture and virtual reality, to speed up the new vehicle launch process," he said. "The ergonomics side of ISE has introduced me to the motion capture side of work, while the PLM side of ISE has given me a lean manufacturing knowledge set which is sought after in the industry."
