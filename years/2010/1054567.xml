<AbstractNarration>Modern distributed systems are extremely complex, due in large part to&lt;br/&gt;individual node complexity, node unreliability and asynchrony, and&lt;br/&gt;unpredictable network message delays and orderings.  Further complicating&lt;br/&gt;development of these systems is both the presence of multiple potentially&lt;br/&gt;incompatible versions of the systems, and the need to build correct systems&lt;br/&gt;also exhibiting high performance.  Prior testing and simulation frameworks are&lt;br/&gt;characterized either by extensive manual effort, or automated search for&lt;br/&gt;violations of a binary decision problem---the presence or absence of a bug.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are developing automated and interactive techniques for helping developers&lt;br/&gt;understand the behavior of distributed systems implementations.  By leveraging&lt;br/&gt;the evolved frameworks, and instrumenting implementations in structured,&lt;br/&gt;straightforward ways, we are building development tools focused on&lt;br/&gt;understanding system behavior rather than merely identifying correctness&lt;br/&gt;errors.  This change in focus will enable more general tools that improve&lt;br/&gt;development productivity in addition to testing productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is proceeding on three fronts: 1) developing automated tools &lt;br/&gt;using data mining with repeated executions to extract execution behaviors and&lt;br/&gt;performance, 2) developing flexible execution descriptions suitable for both&lt;br/&gt;use-case descriptions and automated processing, allowing more intuitive&lt;br/&gt;interaction between users and their tools, and 3) incorporating testing tools&lt;br/&gt;with revision control systems, enabling multi-version analysis and long-term&lt;br/&gt;progress tracking.  When completed, this research will reduce developer effort&lt;br/&gt;necessary to design, update, and debug distributed systems, and may inspire&lt;br/&gt;creation of a new class of systems debuggers analysing not just correctness,&lt;br/&gt;but also performance and complexity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the project was to utilize statistical data mining techniques to further the art of large system debugging and development. In its first year, it focused primarily on approaches to detect the performance problems of systems when comparing a volume of performant logs to a volume of non-performant logs, by looking at the time, value and occurrence of state and event logs. In the second year, it focused primarily on using these data mining techniques to automate the process of analyzing the result code changes over time, to detect when code changes have had a significant impact on the behavior of the system. While most of the changes in a system are to improve it, it is not uncommon for changes to make the system worse along some dimension, in ways that are not immediately obvious to the developer. Additionally, we focused on the use of these techniques in the design of operating system primitives for process isolation, by first analyzing the behavior of existing software components. Thus, the project focused on the use of data mining techniques in all stages of the software development process: design, development, and debugging.    The outcomes of the project include a publicly available distributed system log analysis tool, Distalyzer, including several related datasets; two peer reviewed papers; the graduation of one PhD student supported by this grant; and the identification of several bugs in commonly used open source software (Transmission and HBase) which have been communicated to the broader community for correction. Our developed techniques and tools (as embodied in our Distalyzer tool) are unique within the discipline because they allow users to find the root causes of performance problems across a broad range of ways to compare systems. In our results, we demonstrate how our approach allows users to compare (1) different implementations of the same protocol, (2) different transactions in a transaction processing system, and (3) different wholistic system executions performed at different times or with different versions of the code.
