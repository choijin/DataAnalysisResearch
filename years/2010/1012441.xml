<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project will establish the feasibility of stabilizing nano-pigment dispersions in inks to facilitate manufacturing scale-up of electrochromic inks.  The small business has previously developed patented inks based on electrochromic nano-pigments and a compatible ion-conductive adhesive, which are designed to be coated with conventional manufacturing equipment to produce flexible electrochromic devices, such as window films that change reversibly from dark to clear upon the application of 1.5V potential.  While functional electrochromic films have been produced in the laboratory, attempts to scale to commercial manufacturing have been frustrated by agglomeration of nano-pigments in the inks over time.  Various additives will be evaluated in these inks, to result in an electrochromic ink formulation suitable for manufacturing trials. This project will also explore ionic interactions with the surface of nano-particles buried within a polymer composite.  The technical insights from this project may also have applicability in other technologies driven by ionic absorption / desorption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project springs from the invention of a new material that enables the production of light-weight, flexible electrochromic devices. Potential applications include architectural electrochromic window film and automotive electrochromic window film.  Broad market acceptance of these films would contribute significantly to energy savings.</AbstractNarration>
