<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrons are a fundamental constituent of all atoms, and it is the tremendous variety of forms their interactions can take that is largely responsible for the wide range of material properties we see in the world around us.  This experimental project is aimed at understanding more about the ways in which interactions between electrons manifest themselves.  The motion and states of the electrons are governed by quantum mechanics, but under special circumstances classical Newtonian physics provides a good approximation to their behavior.  In one set of experiments a small number of electrons will gradually be forced closer and closer together to increase the importance of quantum mechanical effects, and to understand how that affects their interactions.  In addition to having a negative electric charge, every electron also acts like an extremely weak bar magnet.  Another set of experiments will study how these "magnetic moments" interact as the electrons are brought together.  An important aim of this part of the project is to develop a way to measure the orientation of the magnetic moment of a single electron.  Demonstrating this capability represents an important step towards constructing a quantum computer that uses the magnetic moments of individual electrons as its bits.  This project will support the education of a Ph.D. student, together with the participation of undergraduate researchers, working at the boundary between fundamental physics and its applications to new technological opportunities.  These students will learn how to use the most advanced tools of modern nanoscience research, which has proven to be excellent training for careers in both academia and high technology industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports a project that will use electrons floating on the surface of superfluid helium to study the onset of quantum effects in electron-electron interactions and spin relaxation and decoherence in quantum dot structures.  Submicron structures (dots) will be developed to tightly confine electrons on the helium in small clusters, and the energy to successively add electrons will be measured.  These experiments will take advantage of recent developments in reliably moving individual electrons across the helium surface to measure electrons outside the dot, rather than within the dot where the sensing structures distort the potentials.  The total energy in similar dot structures with two trapped electrons will depend upon their relative spins, with singlet states lying lower than triplets.  Measurements of the achievable singlet-triplet splitting will be made, and structures optimized for large splitting.  By careful study of the time scales over which particular spin states persist it is expected to be able to determine the electron spin relaxation and decoherence times.  The ability to measure single electron spins and their decoherence are key steps on the road to implementing an electron spin quantum computer.  This research will be performed by a Ph.D. student and part-time undergraduate students.  The students will learn nanofabrication, low-temperature techniques, and high-sensitivity measurements on the experimental end, and about the theory of many-body quantum systems and quantum information.  These skills, requiring resourcefulness and attention to detail have proven themselves to be excellent training for scientific careers in academia and high technology industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Electrons are negatively charged elementary particles which are one of the constituents of atoms.  It has been known for several decades that electrons will float on the surface of liquid helium in much the same way that some insects skim the surface of water.  If the helium is sufficiently cold (within about 2 Kelvin of absolute zero) it forms a superfluid and the surface becomes extremely smooth.  Electrons can move across this smooth surface with very little to deflect them or slow them down.  Until recently these experiments have been used to study the physics of electrons as they interact, but it has been assumed that there would be no practical applications.  However, quantum information processing needs many well-controlled small quantum systems, and these electrons may be able to play that role &ndash; each electron becomes a quantum bit, or "qubit."  Intellectual merit: In the course of this project we have developed devices for controlling the motion of electrons on helium so that electrons can be selected and kept isolated from one another.  We have designed special silicon chips which are made using standard computer chip fabrication techniques, but we further process them to make micro-scale channels in the surface (seen in the pictures).  The liquid helium fills these channels by capillary action, the same way water is drawn up from the roots to the leaves of a tree.  The electrons stay above the helium in the channels. Since the electrons have a negative charge, their motion can be controlled by making parts of the chip (called "gates") positive or negative to attract or repel electrons.  The images show one of these chips at various levels of magnification (the entire chip is about 2mm x 2mm).  The wires connected to the chip supply the voltages for the various gates.  In the most highly magnified image one can see that there is a narrow section of the channels which forces the electrons to pass through single file (they repel one another).  One important outcome of this project is showing that this "turnstile" device can allow a fixed number of electrons (pairs in the first experiments) through every time it is activated.  The same voltages are used simultaneously for 78 parallel channels, which provides evidence that this technology may be scalable to large numbers of identical devices.  In another set of experiments electrons were moved on and off a thin layer of helium covering a very smooth metal surface.  Small devices for manipulating the quantum states of the qubits will need to use thin helium layers (no more than 10 - 30 nm thick). We have demonstrated structures which allowed the electrons to be moved from a thick helium layer to a thin one and back again.  Broader Impacts: The capabilities we have developed, including the turnstiles and structures allowing us to use thin helium films, as well as low-noise ultra-low power amplifiers built into the silicon chips for detecting electrons can be used for studying the interactions between electrons on helium.  However, they can also be applied to a much broader range of possibilities, such as learning how to use these electrons as qubits for quantum information processing.  The turnstiles may also have another application as a new precision current standard.  If a large number of parallel channels can each release precisely one electron every time they are activated, it will be possible to make a current standard operating at much higher current levels than existing superconducting tunnel junction turnstiles.   Teaching and training students about scientific research is an important component of a university research project.  A total of five undergraduates have worked on this project, or very closely related research, as well as three high school students and 3 graduate students.  One of the graduate students has led the project, and she has recently finished her PhD.          Last Modified: 12/01/2014       Submitted by: Stephen A Lyon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
