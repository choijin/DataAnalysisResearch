<AbstractNarration>The last decade has seen a series of major achievements in the study of conformally invariant systems, in particular following the introduction of Schramm-Loewner Evolutions. This new approach has proved extremely effective in describing the scaling limit of interfaces of critical models of two-dimensional Statistical Physics, such as percolation and the Ising model, in accordance with the earlier predictions of Conformal Field Theory (CFT). The research program proposed here focuses on systems on paths and loops, in particular in relation with the CFT formalism; on free field invariance principles and the analysis of Cauchy-Riemann operators; and on the connections between geometric and functional representations of continuous scaling limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to analyze mathematical models of the physical phenomenon of phase transition. A phase transition describes a sharp qualitative change in a physical system under variation of an external parameter, such as freezing of water (transition from liquid to solid phase as temperature decreases). At the phase transition, a random macroscopic geometry may emerge, akin to the wiggly interfaces separating non mixing fluids like oil and water, or positively and negatively charged regions in a magnetic material. The study of those fluctuating interfaces is grounded in both Probability Theory and Theoretical Physics. Special emphasis will be put on the interplay between these two approaches, and their relation to other areas of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research projects supported by this award relate to scaling limits of two-dimensional discrete models at criticality. Many of these models, such as the Ising model of ferromagnetism, originate in Statistical Mechanics.  Scaling limits provide insight on structures that emerge in macroscopic systems composed of a large number of small, interacting random elements. The study of scaling limits of discrete models at criticality sheds light on the crucial phase transition phenomenon, such as the transition from a solid phase (e.g. ice) to a liquid phase (e.g. water).  The last decade has seen a series of major achievements in the study of such conformally invariant random systems, in particular following the introduction of Schramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLE). This new class of stochastic continuous planar curves has proved extremely effective in describing the scaling limit of interfaces of critical models of Statistical Physics, such as percolation and the Ising model.  The type of mathematical objects under consideration have been proposed as models for a variety of physical phenomena. For instance, critical percolation can be used to understand hydraulic conductivity in rocks; observations of tungsten oxide surfaces have been linked to Schramm-Loewner paths, and adsorption of rod-like organic molecules on a graphite substrate has been modeled by dimer configurations.  The PI efforts have been directed along two main axes. The first axis pertains to combinatorial models, such as the dimer model, where the individual constituents of the system may only adopt finitely many possible positions. The main tool to analyze these models is exact solvability, which combined with analytic notions such as families of differential operators, allows for a detailed description of the behavior of large-scale systems. This led in particular to the solution of the longstanding Fisher-Stephenson conjecture.  The second main axis consisted in establishing robust connections between, on the one hand, the algebraic methods developed in Theoretical Physics (Conformal Field Theory) starting from the 1980s and, on the other hand, the probabilistic and analytical methods underpinning the recent progess on the mathematical side, leading to a synergy between seemingly disparate techniques.   The PI has been actively involved in the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows through the teaching of advanced classes and minicourses, and the organization of seminars and conferences, and engaged in mathematical and interdisciplinary training activities, in particular in relation with his research projects at the interface of Physics and Mathematics.
