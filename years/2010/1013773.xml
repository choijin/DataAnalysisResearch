<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will design and construct ceramic blades for use in gas turbine engines to allow the gas turbines to operate at higher temperatures thereby increasing their efficiencies.  The project will measure distributed power generation, peak shaving, renewable back-up, CHP, and propulsion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact and the novelty of the approach of the project will be that the unusual geometry of the turbine, which would allow the blades to be held in compression and all cooling of the assembly accomplished with a low-pressure fan rather than the compressor, thereby further increasing system efficiency.  In addition, the ceramic turbine blades have the potential to increase gas turbine efficiency thus conserving fuel usage and providing a reduction in exhaust emissions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A novel gas turbine blade mounting configuration was studied during this Phase I SBIR program.  As proposed and developed further during this program, the technology would provide a means to utilize ceramic materials in gas turbine stationary and rotating blades.   Application of ceramic blades in gas turbines would enable operation at high firing temperatures (up to 1500&deg;C) without blade cooling.  As well as providing a means for high temperature operation, ceramic blades would eliminate the requirement for diversion of high pressure compressor flow for blade cooling (up to 5% of the compressor output) and hence improve system efficiency.  The blade mounting configuration developed during this program is a way to maintain rotating blades of a gas turbine under compressive loading, thus side-stepping a key impediment to the use of ceramics as gas turbine blades: their weakness under tensile loading.  In the configuration developed during this project, the rotary blades are inserted inside a rotary casing and exposed to compressive rather than tensile stresses during operation.  There is a minor bending stress due to gas expansion though the blades, but this stress has been shown to be insignificant.   In this project, two configurations of a 3-stage turbine configuration were studied, a 500 kW and a 1000 kW machine, with analytical results indicating the potential to near or exceed 50% system efficiency with exhaust gas recuperation.  In addition, Phase I efforts included demonstration in 3D CAD of the assembly process as well as investigations into materials and fabrication methods, with the objective of a near-net shape casting process for all blades.  A candidate material was identified as capable to withstand the high temperatures, oxidation environment and high compressive loading with regard to creep, as well as methods to fabricate and manufacture complex parts from these materials.   Due to limited funds, a proof of concept prototype gas turbine was not proposed as part of Phase I.  Instead, a motor-driven turbine "mock-up" with blade mounting similar to that of the studied gas turbine, operating in excess of 10,000 rpm, demonstrated the mounting scheme and the compressive loading of the blades that results.
