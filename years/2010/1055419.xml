<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award provides a schema of integrated research and educational activities for delineating the physical underpinnings of vibratory energy harvesters' transduction under random and non-stationary excitations. Theories in probabilities and nonlinear vibrations are combined with computational techniques and specially designed experimental modules to i) understand the response of energy harvesters to time-varying frequency excitations, ii) characterize their transduction under random broad-band and narrow-band excitations, and iii) elucidate the influence of nonlinearities and bi-stabilities on their performance under realistic excitations. Research tasks are closely tied to myriad of educational activities that include i) a creative inquiry undergraduate project that involves the creation of an "energy harvesting carpet", ii) an outreach initiative called "Journey into Vibration Energy Harvesting" introducing energy harvesting principles to high school students and their teachers iii) extensive emphasis on diversity and recruitment of minority students, and iv) development of new graduate course offerings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this CAREER award's objectives will lay the foundation and provide the necessary tools to develop efficient and transformative vibratory energy harvesters for excitation sources long considered impractical due to their random or non-stationary nature. Such harvesters will enable the widespread deployment of self-powered health-monitoring sensors, thusly avoiding catastrophic structural and machine failures (e.g. the 2007 St. Anthony's bridge collapse near Minneapolis, Minn.), and will reduce our dependence on batteries whose regular replacement and recharging pose significant challenges and risks especially for remotely installed devices, and for patients living with implantable medical appliances.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Vibration-based energy harvesting is a process by which ambient vibrations are captured and transformed into a useful form that enables autonomous operations of many vital low-power consumption electronics. While most environmental excitations from which energy can be harnessed are generally random or non-stationary in nature, proposed solutions for enhanced energy harvesting are currently based on steady-state analyses that assume a harmonic excitation with a fixed frequency.  Published work resulting from this CAREER award served to delineate the behavior of energy harvesters under random and non-stationary excitations. It also highlighted the role that nonlinearities play in the transduction of energy harvesters under different types of excitations and investigated the conditions, in terms of excitation nature and design parameters, under which nonlinearities can be used to improve the performance of energy harvesters. In specific, the outcomes of this award are:  1. An in-depth understanding of the influence of stiffness nonlinearities on the performance of energy harvesters under harmonic, random, and non-stationary excitations.  2. Recommendations on how to design the nonlinear stiffness of the harvester such that the harvester's performance is improved for given characteristics of the environmental excitation.  3. Establishment of new metrics to assess performance of nonlinear energy harvesters under different types of excitation.  4. Development of energy harvesters with novel design concepts that exploit nonlinearities, internal resonances, and modal interactions to improve efficacy under broadband excitations.  Results culminating from this award will therefore permit designing transformative energy harvesters for excitation sources that have traditionally been considered impractical due to their random or non-stationary nature. These harvesters will be used to power many vital electronic systems such as health-monitoring sensors and implantable medical devices. Such electronics can help us avoid catastrophic failures of structures similar to the 500 bridge failures reported in the US over the last two decades, and will lower dependence on batteries whose continuous replacement poses a significant risk of infection in biomedical applications.  Through several undergraduate creative inquiry projects and reachout activities, this award also introduced the concept of vibratory energy harvesting to undergraduate and minority students. Such activities included the design of a bicycle suspension with energy harvesting capability, energy harvesting trekking poles, and an energy harvesting computer mouse.
