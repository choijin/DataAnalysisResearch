<AbstractNarration>1021278&lt;br/&gt;Kandlikar &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2010 International Conference on Nanochannels, Microchannels and Minichannels, organized under ASME sponsorship, will be held June 22 - 24, 2010, at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal Canada. Since 2002, this conference series has become a premiere international forum, attracting many leading and emerging researchers from diverse disciplines working in different countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The conference provides a platform for researchers to exchange information and identify research needs in an emerging area that encompasses many engineering disciplines. The main objective is to provide a multi-disciplinary forum to promote and expedite progress in understanding fundamental phenomena in applications involving channels of small dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The international nature of the meeting promotes global interaction. This conference will support a number of students as well as emerging research leaders to attend the conference. Emphasis will be made to solicit participation from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
