<AbstractNarration>This project will attract students to engineering and increase the persistence of these by combining scholarships, multiple-mentors, professional development activities and internship opportunities to help them succeed as students as they plan for future careers or graduate study. The proposed project uses the "fund and guide" model to help talented, but financially needy students complete their degrees in a timely fashion and move into the workforce or graduate studies. Undergraduates in Electrical, Mechanical, and Industrial &amp; System Engineering will participate as a cohort group from their freshman to senior years. Scholarships of $5,000 per semester (up to $45,000) will be provided to participants enrolled in a 9-semester dual BS/BA degree program in engineering. Key program elements include scholarships, a comprehensive mentorship program, research internships, and a professional development seminar series designed to help students to bridge the gap between the classroom environment and the expectations and realities of the workplace. Project success, defined in terms of five performance objectives will be systematically evaluated, reported, and disseminated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project attracted students to engineering and increased the persistence of them ay combining scholarships, multiple-mentors, professional development activities and internship opportunities to help them succeed as students as they plan for future careers or graduate study.  We used the "fund and guide" model to help talented, but financially needy students completer their degrees in timely fashion and move into the workforce or graduate studies.  Key program elements included scholarships, a comprehensive mentorship program, research internships, and a professional development seminar series designed to help students to bridge the gap between the classroom environment and the expectation and realities of the workplace.    The project featured a unique emphasis on comprehensive professional and academic mentoring that allowed students to succeed in their academic studies, while developing longer professional career plans.  By integrating mentorship relationship along with cohort-based professional development activities, and research/internship experiences, diverse groups of students were able to experience an inclusive education leading to improved retention and successful graduates now all working in various industries.   Five objectives relating to diversity of recruits, retention rates, graduation rates, internship/research participation, and employment goals were all met or exceeded.  The project successfully supported and mentored 13 engineering graduates who are all employed in industry and government.  The successful outcomes proved that the fund-and-guide model with strong mentoring program augmented with professional development activities worked effectively.  This proven student development model can be replicated in many ways, in whole or in part, to help address the national workforce needs for greater number of better prepared, broadly capable engineers.
