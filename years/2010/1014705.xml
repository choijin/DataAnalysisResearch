<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many materials, nature as well as manufactured, are comprised of a number of different components, and each component affects the overall properties of the material.  One example is soil which has liquid, solid, and void phases.  Oftentimes, materials may appear to be homogeneous by the naked eye but when placed under a microscope, the comprising constituents can be identified.  The microstructure configuration of these materials plays a significant role in the properties observed by the naked eye.  Researchers are interested in studying the microstructure of such materials in order to link the effects of characteristics of the microstructure to global characteristics.  If this can be accomplished, then advanced materials can be manufactured to possess specific desired properties.   I went to University of Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan to collaborate on this research project with a Professor named Tsuyoshi Takada.  I chose to work with him because he is an expert in probabilistic modeling in engineering applications.  The microstructures mentioned above typically consist of random configurations and must be approached within a probabilistic framework.  During the project, we wrote computer codes to generate virtual microstructures of a material that are similar to the microstructures of this material if seen under a microscope.  This research project is a contribution to the scientific community because it provides an alternative way to generate virtual microstructures which may be better than previous methods for certain applications.  Now that the microstructures are generated, it is important to study the characteristics of the microstructure and its behavior under a set of forces.  If it can be determined what microstructure configurations produce the most desirable behavior under a set of forces, then this can have important implications in the development of new materials.
