<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;This project is a new Science Masters Program (SMP) in biomedical engineering at Grand Valley State University.  In this program students are learning how to apply mathematics, science, and engineering to medicine and health in order to advance fundamental understanding and create knowledge in areas ranging from molecules to organ systems.  In addition, students are learning to develop innovative approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, for patient rehabilitation, and for improving health.  This Science Master's Program is educating students to meet these objectives by connecting product development activities and opportunities with research in order to support the development of innovative medical products for commercial use.  The curriculum includes: (1) foundation courses in human physiology to help students effectively communicate with health care professionals and apply advanced technological solutions to clinical problems; (2) engineering courses that apply engineering principles to problems in medicine and health; (3) medical device design and development courses to evaluate, design, and construct medical products; and (4) research opportunities employing the methods for effectively translating ideas from concept to bedside.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The State of Michigan is actively pursuing expansion of its biomedical sector as part of its economic recovery plan.  The SMP is West Michigan's only program in graduate biomedical engineering education.  It is located in close proximity to medical research and biomedical firms.  The graduates of this program are key resources in nurturing the growth of this sector.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of our project was to design and implement a Master's program in Biomedical Engineering at Grand Valley State University to leverage the State of Michigan's investment in healthcare in West Michigan.  Technical Significance:  Biomedical engineering applies mathematics, science and engineering to medicine and health to advance fundamental understanding and create knowledge in areas ranging from molecules to organ systems as well as to develop innovative approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, for patient rehabilitation, and for improving health.  The Science MasterÆs Program in Biomedical Engineering at Grand Valley State University (GVSU) in Michigan educates students to meet these objectives focusing on matching development opportunities with research to bring innovative medical products to market.  The curriculum includes:  (1) foundation courses in human physiology to help students effectively communicate with health care professionals and apply advanced technological solutions to clinical problems; (2) engineering courses that apply engineering principles to problems in medicine and health; (3) medical device design and development courses to evaluate, design, and construct medical products; and (4) research opportunities employing the methods for effectively translating ideas from concept to bedside.  Broader Significance:  The State of Michigan is currently on an economic recovery path that includes expansion of the biomedical sector.  This program is West MichiganÆs only opportunity for graduate biomedical engineering education.  It is located in close proximity to medical research and biomedical industry.  The implementation of this program is a vital step to ensure the continued development and growth of MichiganÆs workforce, through providing students with a wide variety of regional opportunities including in medical device/biotechnology industry, medical school, and healthcare management, as well as research and development.  Project Outcomes: In the last 3 years the school of engineering at GVSU currently has a vibrant viable Master's program in Biomedical Engineering. We have enrolled 24 students and graduated 10.
