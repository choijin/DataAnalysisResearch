<AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Kenneth S. Suslick of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and his research group will explore the origin, mechanisms and time dependence of sonoluminescence processes.  Sonoluminescence does not come from a direct interaction of molecules with sound; instead, it arises from acoustic cavitation: the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of bubbles in a liquid.  This research project will employ spectroscopic probes the the cavitation event, utilize streak camera and probe-pulse techniques to elucidate the time dependence of sonoluminescence, and develop diagnostics for shockwave control via mechanoluminescence from particles added to the liquid phase. A key focus of this work will be ionic liquid media, which have recently been found to produce greatly enhanced sonoluminescence intensities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High intensity ultrasound is used in industrial and microelectronics processes, for welding, emulsification, dispersion and cleaning. It is also increasingly used to effect unique chemical transformations induced by the high temperatures and pressures present in bubbles as they collapse when liquids are irradiated with high intensity ultrasound. Students trained by this project will have unique and valuable experience in this important new chemical process.</AbstractNarration>
