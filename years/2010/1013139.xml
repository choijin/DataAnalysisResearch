<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  As part of the EAPSI Singapore program, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a research team that was also working on discovering virus protein's roles in virus replication and pathogenesis. The Iridovirus family affects many cold blooded vertebrates and cause severe disease and death in these animals. These diseases have a growing impact on aquaculture. In 2004, countries in Asia and Pacific accounted for 91.5% of the production quantity and 80.5% of the value in the worldÃ†s aquaculture production. During my time in Singapore, I analyzed several conserved viral proteins in this family to compare and contrast differences between the prototype of this family, Frog Virus 3 (FV3), and Singapore Grouper Iridovirus (SGIV). SGIV is unique in this family in that it is the only vertebrate virus to not have its DNA methylated.  My studies in Singapore will further our understanding of virus proteins in virus pathogenesis and host immunity.  In addition, the EAPSI experience is the first time I have worked collaboratively in a cross-cultural laboratory. I was able to work in a lab environment that is different from my own lab in structure, resource use, and style. During my time in Singapore, I learned the importance of leadership in a cohesive cross-cultural lab.  My experience in the EAPSI Singapore program has helped me to broaden my network in my field as well as across several disciplines. This opportunity allowed me to meet other researchers in my field not only in Singapore but also from China, Vietnam, and Iran. In addition, I was able to meet graduate students from all over United States in diverse fields.  This opportunity gave us a forum to discuss our work as well as many other topics but more importantly gave us memories that bind us together.
