<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the REU/RET site in Physics at Baylor University.   Selected NSF fellows choose from research opportunities in astrophysics, complex (dusty) plasmas, early universe cosmology, elementary particle physics, nuclear physics,space physics, superstring physics or surface physics.  In all of these areas, fellows are involved in advanced scientific research with many of their activities being interdisciplinary in nature. Over the course of the program, fellows are encouraged to become self sufficient in their research agenda. Twice-weekly seminars, an end of the summer Undergraduate Research Symposium and specially designed classes in various physics research areas of interest enhance the overall intellectual impact of the program.   Collaborative research opportunities after the REU fellow returns to his or her home institution are available as is partial stipend support for returning to Baylor during the academic year. The program also provides three to five RET (Research Experience for Teachers) fellowships. RET fellows are selected from a national applicant pool and reside on-site for approximately eight weeks. All REU and RET fellows give a research (PowerPoint) presentation and produce both a paper and a poster at the end of their ten-week stay. When possible, fellows are also invited to publish their results with their mentors in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since 1993, CASPER has hosted the National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experience for Teachers (RET) programs as part of CASPER Summers.  During the summer of 2012, eleven undergraduate students and four high school teachers participated in the program working with CASPER Faculty as well as faculty in the Department of Physics and the School of Engineering. Theoretical and experimental research projects were conducted under the direction of nine Baylor faculty members with assistance from nine graduate students. Two high school students also participated in summer research through the High School Summer Science Research Program (HSSSRP) sponsored by the College of Arts and Sciences. Thus students and teachers were integrated into groups consisting of members with a wide range of skills and expertise.  During the summer of 2013, ten undergraduate students and three high school teachers participated in the program working with CASPER CASPER Faculty as well as faculty in the Department of Physics and the School of Engineering. Three high school students also participated in summer research through the High School Summer Science Research Program (HSSSRP) sponsored by the School of Arts and Sciences and the CASPER High School Scholars program, and two other undergraduate students participated with funding from other CASPER sources.   In both years, students, teachers, faculty, and graduate students participating in summer research attended weekly Wednesday Lunch Bunch Seminars, where faculty members presented short talks on various topics such as using sound to represent data, new physics at the Large Hadron Collider, using your physics degree in software development and the Physics of Star Trek. The students were also given tips on literature searches, writing papers, preparing posters and presentations, and applying to graduate school. During Friday Updates, the participants gave weekly progress reports on their research, and shared current interests and examples of how physics is presented in the media and in movies. At the end of the summer, each of the participants prepared a poster, gave a twelve-minute presentation, and wrote a paper detailing their research and results. Students also took field trips to the Meyer Observatory and SpaceX Rocket Test Facility.       2012 REU students made four presentations at state and national meetings during the fall 2012 semester, with three additional presentations planned at national and international meetings during the spring 2013 semester.  One student is a co-author on a publication in progress. Three students are continuing their research with eventual publication in mind.  Technical skills developed:  Laser safety Vacuum technology Programming Assembling and testing vacuum chambers Electron microscopy  Image analysis and data extraction Astronomical observing techniques  Setting up and maintaining ultra-high vacuum systems Ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy. Sample preparation for surface science measurements Understanding surface reaction dynamics and kinetics   Research in areas including:    experimental complex plasmas surface physics astronomy  early planet formation string theory   Education and Outreach:  RET Fellows developed high school curriculum based on the CASPER Physics Circus, creating a web-based learning tool and immediate impact into their high school physics classroom.  Broader Impacts:   All of the above directly impacts the growing shortage of qualified scientists, technicians, mathematicians and engineers as well as STEM teachers.
