<AbstractNarration>The international conference titled "Single-Molecule Approaches to Biology" is part of the Gordon Research Conference series and will be held at Il Ciocco, Lucca (Barga), Italy, June 27 to July 2, 2010. The specific goals of the meeting are to convene 40 senior and emerging speakers who represent new thrusts of single-molecule research with a total of ~170 participants for a five day conference in a relatively isolated setting. The program will cover cutting-edge developments in single-molecule sequencing, DNA/RNA/protein interactions, folding machines, cellular biophysics, synthetic biology and bioengineering, force spectroscopy, new method developments, super-resolution imaging in cells, and novel probes for single-molecule imaging. In addition, four poster sessions will give participants various opportunities to actively participate in the scientific discourse. This conference will bring together top experts in molecular and cell biology with innovators in the measurement and manipulation of single molecules. By addressing these scientific issues with a combination of world-class speakers, contributed oral talks, and poster sessions the conference will advance teaching, learning, and training in single-molecule approaches to biology. The conference will give preference to women and minority scientists, junior faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and researchers from institutions serving predominantly minority populations, the extension of scientific knowledge to underrepresented groups will be furthered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is jointly sponsored by the Physics Division and the Molecular Cell Biology Division at NSF.</AbstractNarration>
