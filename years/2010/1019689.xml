<AbstractNarration>1019689&lt;br/&gt;Shanmugalingam &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports activities associated with the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) 2010 taking place in Hyderabad, India, August 2010.  USPI Nageswari Shanmugalingam and Indian collaborator Saminathan Ponnusamy, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IITM) will convene a training workshop to introduce young mathematicians to the field of p-Harmonic and Quasiconformal Mappings, as well as an ICM satellite conference to bring leading US and Indian mathematicians together for the cross-fertilization of ideas on advanced topics in Geometric Analysis.  The US delegation of twelve mathematicians includes established scientists, early career, and graduate student participants.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expectation is to foster new international collaborations and seed joint proposals for NSF and foreign counterpart agency consideration.  This is one of many activities being planned around the first gathering in India of an estimated 5,000 mathematicians for the ICM and awarding of the prestigious Fields Medal.  It is also a unique opportunity to promote interaction between mathematicians in the U.S. and India and address the current minimal level of collaboration with Indian mathematicians especially in Geometric Analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop and satellite conference is jointly funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
