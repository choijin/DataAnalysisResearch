<AbstractNarration>Given multiple multivariate data sources, each represented by an unknown multivariate distribution, the investigator proposes an approach to regression analysis based on relationships between semiparametric estimates of these multivariate distributions. Resulting from this are regression estimates expressed as estimates of the conditional expectation of a response given its covariates, for each source. The investigator plans to study the statistical properties of the regression estimates, associated diagnostic tools, the applicability and computability of the method using real data, and compare the method to multiple and kernel regression methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A basic statistical problem, referred to as regression, is to estimate a relationship between a dependent variable, called the response, and corresponding independent variables, called the predictors or covariates. Most often this is done using a single data source. In many cases, however,  multiple data sources are available such as different groups of patients and a control group, data sets from many surveillance sensors, multiple surveillance sources from land, sea, and space, or multiple time records. The existence of multiple data sources motivates a generalization. The investigator will study a novel approach to regression based on multiple data sources, by combining or fusing the data from all sources as to increase the precision of all estimates, and by studying the joint statistical behavior of all sources. Potentially the approach may impact regression analysis in general, as well as forecasting of such time series as unemployment, commodity prices, and the course of a moving object given covariate information, whenever multiple data sources are available. The investigator plans to compare the approach with existing regression methods both theoretically and by  data analysis using real data.</AbstractNarration>

The reason for the increased precision is that the distributions from the two sources are estimated using the fused or combined samples.  The method has been applied to samples of triplets (height,weight,age) from case and control  germ  cell testicular cancer samples. With our new semi-parametric  regression method we detected an important increased risk of germ  cell testicular cancer with greater body weight after adjusting for  age and height that was not found with these same data using standard  logistic regression modeling.  This is an important finding because body weight is likely a later life exposure involving dietary caloric intake and/or energy expenditure from physical activity.  This is in contrast to height that is influenced by early life factors such as genetics, early life nutrition, or endogenous or exogenous hormones.  The possibility of intervening to reduce body weight among young men  could help to stem the rise in incidence of testicular cancer.       But suppose now there is only one source. How can then the method be applied? After all the method requires additional data sources. A way out is to use computer generated data.
