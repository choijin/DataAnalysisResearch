<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of Professor Maurice S. Brookhart of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill focused on the design and mechanistic studies of metal-catalyzed diene and olefin polymerizations. The copolymerization of ethylene and polar vinyl monomers is under investigation. These reactions provide high molecular weight materials at high rates by employing bulky monodentate ligands that circumvent catalyst deactivation. The second effort examines the development of late metal catalysts for the polymerization of norbornene and functionalized norbornenes. The molecular weights can be controlled and living polymerizations allow co- and block polymers to be made. The third aim centers on the development of a new family of well-defined diene and olefin polymerization catalysts based on cobalt, a late transition metal that has seen little development with respect to olefin polymerization reactions.  As a final part of the project, the activation of alkanes will be investigated.  Electrophilic activation of alkanes is thought to proceed through alkane complexes as intermediates.  As part of this work, Professor Brookhart focuses on synthesizing stable complexes of methane and higher alkanes and exploring their structures, dynamics, and reactivities with the aim of providing fundamental information useful in developing alkane functionalization reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyolefins, polydienes and related copolymers such as those produced here are central to the polymer industry and are produced on a staggering scale of over 180 billion pounds per year due to the attractive physical properties of the polymers and elastomers and the ready availability of their starting materials. The reactions in this study investigate new (cheaper) metal catalysts that provide faster rates and fewer unwanted by-products.  Alkane functionalization (the final aim of the project) is a critical reaction for alternative energy production.  These reactions allow methane, a gas, to be converted to methanol, a liquid fuel that is easier to store, transport, and handle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Brookhart has made a serious commitment to mentoring minority students working with Project SEED and UNC-sponsored programs such as the Saturday Academy. The group contributes to the development of science programs at the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center, specifically "Today's Chemistry, Tomorrow's Fuels." Several patents have been issued based on this work and the technology has been licensed by DuPont.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plastics, which are produced from chemical feedstocks known as olefins, are the most abundantly used plastics and are produced on a scale of tens of billions of pounds each year worldwide.  Typical examples of these polyolefins well known to consumers include polyethylene(the largest volume plastic), polypropylene, polystyrene and the polydienes, polybutadiene and polyisoprene(rubbers).  The majority of these materials are made through a process in which single molecules (known as "monomers" such as ethylene and propylene) are stitched together to form long chains (polymers = plastics) using a transition metal as a catalyst, typically a transition metal in the class known as early metals (most often titanium).   The precise properties of the plastics such as rigidity, elasticity, impact resistance, temperature stability, clarity and dyeability can be controlled by varying the structure of the simple organic molecules (ligands) bound to the transition metal catalyst. Our group discovered several years ago that a second class of metals known as "late" transition metals (for example nickel and palladium) could, with the proper ligand design, be used also to polymerize monomers such as ethylene and propylene.  The results were fascinating in that the polymers produced had quite different structures and thus different properties relative to polymers produced with typical early metal catalysts. This initial discovery captured worldwide attention of both industrial and academic groups and a massive effort ensued in exploring late metal polymerization catalysts. Following our initial discovery, developing new catalysts based on late metal complexes and understanding the precise mechanisms of action has been the chief focus of our NSF-funded research efforts. In this grant period we have designed and launched new ligands for use with palladium and nickel catalysts that provide polyethylene materials with lightly to highly branched structures which greatly modify the physical properties of these plastics.  The more branches incorporated, the more "soft" these materials become, so the lightly branched materials can be used to make flexible, clear films while the very highly branched materials have applications in as viscosity modifiers and lubricants.  A nickel catalyst was designed to yield ultrahigh molecular weight and lightly branched polyethylene, a unique material with potential applications in high strength fibers. A palladium catalyst was also developed in which a polar monomer (methyl acrylate) could be incorporated into the polyethylene to again potentially result in a modified polyethylene with useful properties. These studies provide a basis for further advances in designing new ligands with potential applications for manufacturing new plastics.  Hydrocarbons are our most abundant feedstocks which are derived from petroleum and natural gas. Almost all chemicals are derived from these feedstocks which include alkanes such as methane, ethane and propane.  A major thrust of many research groups is to find new methods using transition metal complexes to "activate" normally unreactive carbon-hydrogen bonds of these alkane complexes and convert them to more useful chemicals such as olefins and alcohols.  A key step in the reaction of a transition metal complex with an alkane is thought to be coordination of the alkane to the metal, however; such complexes must be very weak due to the poor coordinating ability of the C-H bond.  Observing such complexes and their chemistry would be a major advance in designing new metal catalysts for converting alkanes to useful products.  As a second part of this project we aimed to generate stable alkane complexes and study their behavior.  We were successful in observing the first transition metal complex of methane and in this grant period have reported the first metal complex of ethane and defined its structure and elucidated the dynamics of the system by use of Nuclear Magnetic Spectroscopy.
