<AbstractNarration>This international planning grant will enable researchers from the USA to collaborate with Italian oceanographers in planning and developing a long term time series program at the Italian Base in Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica. The long term goal involves observing the effects of climate change on the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients in the western Ross Sea, an important region of Antarctic Bottom Water formation. The goals of the planning grant include: (1) determining the current state of US-Italian knowledge in the Ross Sea; (2) prioritizing the most important scientific issues to be addressed in future collaborations; (3) developing a plan for both short term and long term funding of collaborative activities; and (4) planning logistical operations by both nations. The proposed western Ross Sea time series program will serve as both an environmental sentinel and a natural laboratory to understand the impacts of climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning visit, and future international collaborations, will facilitate the development of the next generation of scientists in Antarctica. Italian post-doctoral and graduate students, as well as junior US researchers, will participate in the planning meeting. A long term study of the western Ross Sea will enable new investigators to be involved in all aspects of planning and testing hypotheses regarding the impacts of climate change on a coastal Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A planning meeting was convened to discuss the possible formation of a long term time series station and program in the western Ross Sea at Terra Nova Bay (TNB), Antarctica that would leverage the logistical resources and scientific expertise of the Italian and US Antarctic research programs. The scientific justification for such a program was recently elucidated in the Southern Ocean Scoping workshop entitled "A US Southern Ocean Carbon, Ecosystems and Biogeochemistry Science Plan" that was held at Princeton University in June 2009 (http://www.whoi.edu/cms/files/SOWorkshop_Report_Final_61243.pdf). In brief, the scientific consensus reached at that meeting emphasized the relative importance of understanding the physics, biogeochemistry and ecosystem functioning of the Southern Ocean with respect to the EarthÃ†s climate system. Due to the high biological productivity in Antarctic coastal waters these regions of Antarctic bottom water formation represent important sites for carbon sequestration. Our ability to discern future ecosystem changes in the Southern Ocean as a function of both anthropogenic and natural climate variability is dependent upon establishing a long-term time series program in the western Ross Sea, similar to the LTER site on the western Antarctic Peninsula. The goal of this planning meeting was to initiate scientific, programmatic, and logistical discussions to formulate the foundation for developing such a program.     Twenty scientists (including 4 from the US) and a program officer from the Italian Research Funding Agency (PNRA) convened to discuss the possible collaboration. In brief, it was decided that an international collaboration between the two countries would be mutually beneficial.
