<AbstractNarration>This research investigates shared representations, flexible learning techniques, and efficient multi-category inference methods that are suitable for large-scale visual recognition.  The goal is to produce visual systems that can accurately describe a wide range of objects with varying precision, rather than being limited to identifying objects within a few pre-defined categories.  The main approach is to design object representations that enable new objects to be understood in terms of existing ones, which enables learning with fewer examples and faster and more robust recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has three main components: (1) Designing appearance and spatial models for objects that are shared across basic categories; (2) Investigating algorithms to learn from a mixture of detailed and loose annotations and from human feedback; and (3) Designing efficient search algorithms that take advantage of shared representations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research provides more detailed, flexible, and accurate recognition algorithms that are suitable for high-impact applications, such as vehicle safety, security, assistance to the blind, household robotics, and multimedia search and organization. For example, if a vehicle encounters a cow in the road, the vision system would localize the cow and its head and legs and report ``four-legged animal, walking left'', even if it has not seen cows during training.  The research also provides a unique opportunity to involve undergraduates in research, promote interdisciplinary learning and collaboration, and engage in outreach.  Research ideas and results are disseminated through scientific publications, released code and datasets, public talks, and demonstrations for high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposal for this CAREER grant identified ambitious goals: (1) Create a broader view of recognition (beyond assigning object labels to bounding boxes); (2) Enable closer collaboration with cognitive scientists and other areas of AI; (3) Better understand object representation, annotation, and cross-category generalization; (4) Create object representations that manage the complexity of large-scale recognition; (5) Create robust recognition systems that are suitable for impactful applications; (6) Provide research opportunities to undergraduates.  The proposal recognized that the PI could not achieve all of these aims single-handedly but could play a role in guiding the research community towards these objectives.  Indeed, the PI and his research group have published several papers in top conferences and the proposed CORE dataset, contributing towards the progress of the field in the very directions outlined above. Today, we have computer vision systems with flexible object representations that have been shown to recognize attributes and generalize to novel categories.  Smart vision systems are everywhere in cars, homes, and personal devices. The CAREER grant has supported research projects co-published with undergraduates, with three students publishing papers while undergrads and going on to PhD programs at top schools.    Now, to summarize a few of the specific research contributions supported by this grant. To better understand the failure modes of object detection, the PI proposed new ways of systematically measuring performance and mistakes.  This tool has been used in dozens of object detection papers since, which specifically explain how using the tool led to improvements in their systems.  The PI's group also developed part-based models of objects, in which the appearance and configuration of the parts is learned from annotations.  The work showed that modeling parts that are shared across object categories enables detection of novel categories and improved performance across familiar objects. This work was superseded by deep network methods, which provided a less supervised way to learn object parts, but the key ideas of shared learning of compositional models of objects is the basis of today's best object detectors.  The PI's group also published one of the first papers on visual question answering, with a focus on learning which regions are relevant to a posed question.  For example, if someone asks "What color is the traffic light?", the vision system should localize the traffic light to answer the question.  The main challenge is in learning to perform visual tasks from natural language and identifying relevant regions through implicit supervision.  Ultimately, a visual system will need to learn many concepts and visual tasks over time, and the training data for all tasks may not be available at once.  To address this problem, the PI's group contributed a method for learning to perform new tasks by building on existing representations while minimizing degradation of performance on tasks for which training data is no longer available.  In summary, this grant has supported the PI's efforts to promote a broader view of object recognition that is suitable for open-ended, real world problems. The PI has made several direct contributions towards this goal, perhaps playing some role in influencing the community as a whole which now takes many of the objectives laid out in the proposal for granted. Additionally, three PhD students and several undergraduates supported by the grant have graduated and will continue to benefit the community through their achievements.
