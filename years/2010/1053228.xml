<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award to the Mote Marine Laboratory funds the acquisition of a lab analysis system capable of simultaneous assay of up to 500 analytes, using very small sample volumes. The instrument is used to assess sublethal, but possibly significant, effects of prolonged or acute exposure to oil on critical biological functions in marine mammals and sea turtles: Although these are among the most vulnerable species to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the sublethal effects of oil exposure on these populations are poorly understood. As a result, this investment, through the NSF-RAPID mechanism, is timely and critical in light of the recent Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  The instrument/system will be an integral  part of a  comprehensive research laboratory that will  establish body burdens of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in oil-exposed individual animals undergoing rehabilitation; confirm oil-related impacts on general health by using traditional clinical measures of kidney and liver function, and use biomarkers to assess whether exposure to oil during the Deepwater Horizon spill causes genotoxic effects or significant impacts on reproductive potential or immune system function.  The results will enhance understanding of the immunological and reproductive consequences of oil exposure on marine mammals and sea turtles. Results from the studies will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journal publications and though participation at regional and national scientific meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, great concerns surfaced with regard to the possible sublethal effects of exposure to oil on charismatic, protected species (e.g., marine mammals and/or other long lived, vulnerable species such as sea turtles) in the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico.   Traditionally, significant sublethal effects of exposure have been assessed via studies of changes in animal distribution, foraging ecology, or nutritional status; whereas those approaches have merit, technology now provides means by which factors such as immune function and fertility potential can be assessed directly using well validated biomarkers. Our NSF project permitted us to purchase a Bio-Plex 3D system, which is admirably suited to multiplexed analyses of serum to detect immune function changes, acute phase responses, and other sublethal responses to stressors, including but not limited to those caused by exposure to oil.   To date, we have used the new instrument and associated instrumentation to accomplish the following:  a) assess levels of oil and gas-related contaminants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs), immune function (using a 27-cytokine assay) in 9 species of sharks (plus some deepwater teleosts) using individuals captured and sampled in the area of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; b) assessed baseline values of PAHs, immune function and fertility potential in known aged bottlenose dolphins from a range of areas, including relatively unpolluted locations and highly polluted ones;  and c) attempted to the extent permitted by NRDA restrictions, to acquire samples of oil-exposed dolphins and sea turtles collected or sampled during or after the Deepwater Horizon spill.   Our ongoing efforts have also started to assess contaminant levels, immune function, acute responses, and fertility potential in beluga whales sampled in locations in Alaska where oil and gas exploration and development are ongoing or likely; for the beluga whales, we are developing baselines using captive, known-aged animals.   In addition, we have received funding to: (a) serve as formal collaborators for a new Gulf Research Initiative Research Center (based at University of South Florida) for which we will be using the Bio-Plex 3D system to examine sublethal effects of oil exposure associated with the Gulf oil spill on teleosts showing gross and histological pathology one year later; and (b) conduct research sponsored by the Office of Naval Research to assess possible sublethal effects of sonar-like sounds on dolphin immune function, acute phase responses, fertility potential, and other responses.  Our continuing efforts will allow conservationists, modelers, managers and legislators to better understand population level effects of oil exposure and other stressors on protected species and sentinel species in marine environments; such knowledge will facilitate the development of informed and effective management decisions.
