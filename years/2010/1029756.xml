<AbstractNarration>Studio STEM employs active, inquiry-based learning through engineering design activities to promote conceptual change and problem solving techniques using information and communications technology (ICT).  The project aims to engage and encourage rural Appalachian middle grade students to pursue STEM using fundamental concepts in energy conservation and sustainability through an informal design-based studio. This setting allows students to creatively explore and share problems and solutions by documenting their experiences using personal blogs. The project builds on a previously piloted interdisciplinary curriculum, Save the Animals, developed in partnership with the Virginia Middle School Engineering Education initiative and focuses on solving energy-related problems that explore relevant environmental issues affecting animals and humans.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this project, four curriculum modules are presented and grouped in themes by year. Students explore and design around energy transfer in Save the Penguins (energy efficient dwellings), alternative energy generation in Save the Fish (hydroelectric dams) and Save the Bats (wind turbines), and alternative transportation in Save the Seagulls (solar cars). All modules incorporate the 5-E learning cycle (engage, explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student participants interact with selected undergraduate volunteers from the College of Engineering at Virginia Tech, and industry/community partners. At completion, Studio STEM will have served over 300 students in grades 6-8 and trained over 200 middle school teachers and undergraduate volunteers to implement the design-based curriculum through a series of professional development workshops.  External evaluation consists of both formative (using a mixed methods approach) and summative assessment, utilizing online surveys, observations, and focus groups designed specifically for the project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Studio STEM was a three-year NSF ITEST project that offered middle school youth from an impoverished, rural area, the opportunity to engage in meaningful engineering design activities that helped them understand and learn to mitigate the impact that certain technologies have on the environment. Sessions occurred throughout the school year and over the summer. The youth were mentored by local university student facilitators and local high school students, and they engaged in digital dialogue with each other, their facilitators, and their teachers through the Social Networking Forum, Edmodo, which promoted collaboration and design thinking. They designed solutions to environmental problems affecting animals, and learned significant science content. They were visited by local industrial partners, and engaged in field trips to local industries and science museums. Youth who participated in this project made significant gains in several key areas. Some youth became more motivated to pursue STEM careers. In addition, some youth became more skilled at problem solving and developed more confidence to solve problems.
