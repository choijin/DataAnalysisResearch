<AbstractNarration>Animal movements result from a balance of many different forces, and are the product of neural outputs&lt;br/&gt;acting on muscles driving a mechanically complex body in an unpredictable environment. Locomotion&lt;br/&gt;emerges from interactions within and among these neural, sensory and motor systems and the external&lt;br/&gt;environment. In order to achieve an integrated understanding of locomotion, even in very simple model&lt;br/&gt;organisms, interdisciplinary approaches that combine experiments, mathematical and computational models,&lt;br/&gt;and robotic models are necessary. This Research Coordination Network on the Neuromechanics and&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics of Locomotion will catalyze interactions and communication between researchers from diverse&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds whose combined expertise will lead to significant progress in uncovering the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;processes of this complex system. We will use our successes in understanding the swimming behavior of&lt;br/&gt;lamprey through coordinated neural and mechanical studies (experimental, robotic and computational) as&lt;br/&gt;a model for the RCN?s approach to interdisciplinary collaborations. The RCN will provide a framework&lt;br/&gt;that facilitates these collaborations through planned activities that include exchange visits of graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and postdoctoral fellows among RCN laboratories, an annual Winter Workshop on Locomotion,&lt;br/&gt;visits among members of the RCN network, organization of minisyposia at national meetings, and&lt;br/&gt;maintenance of a locomotion website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One ideal in neuroscience is to understand how the nervous system creates a complete behavior. Locomotion&lt;br/&gt;is a prime example of such a complex behavior. Relationships among neuronal and motoneuronal&lt;br/&gt;activities, and the resulting dynamic muscle forces would need to be deduced. One would then describe&lt;br/&gt;how muscle forces combine with the mechanics of the organism in its environment. Finally, the integration&lt;br/&gt;of sensory feedback into movement control must be described. The neuromechanics and dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of locomotion present a rich array of challenges to biologists, mathematicians, engineers and computational&lt;br/&gt;scientists. This RCN will support graduate students and postdocs to visit a laboratory outside their&lt;br/&gt;own discipline, where they can develop a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between theory,&lt;br/&gt;computation, and experiment. Members of the steering committee have demonstrated commitment to this&lt;br/&gt;model of training, and have excellent track-records in the mentoring of students, ranging from directing&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research, directing MS and Ph.D. theses, and serving as advisors to postdoctoral students.&lt;br/&gt;This RCN will serve as a means to increase the number of US women and minorities in scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
