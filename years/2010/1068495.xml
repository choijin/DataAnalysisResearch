<AbstractNarration>Cosmic ray collisions in the upper atmosphere produce extensive air showers of particles which are detectable at Earth. The IceCube Observatory, a versatile particle detector at the South Pole, is a powerful tool for studying these mysterious high-energy cosmic particles. Measuring the size or energy of cosmic ray events is an important overall goal of the IceCube Observatory. Such measurements are crucial for studying any aspect of these particles, especially their energy spectrum and mass composition. The surface detectors of IceCube (known as IceTop) are covered by snow, and this attenuates the signals in the detectors. This award will enable the group to develop a reconstruction algorithm which corrects for the attenuating effect of snow coverage. In addition, this group will study the composition of cosmic rays and how the IceCube Observatory can distinguish between heavy and light cosmic ray primaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UAA draws students from all over the state of Alaska. This project presents a unique learning opportunity for UAA undergraduates, an opportunity not only to participate in active research and discovery, but also to be a part of a large international effort.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Space is not really empty at all; very high-energy ions called "cosmic rays" fly through space in all directions at close to the speed of light.  When cosmic rays hit the top of Earth's atmosphere, they disintegrate into showers of particle debris which are detectable here at the surface of the Earth using large detectors.  One such detector is IceTop, the surface component of the IceCube Observatory located at the South Pole.  In addition to thousands of digital "eyeballs" buried deep in the Antarctic ice, the IceTop detector is an array of hottub-sized tanks of frozen water spread out over an area of about 1 square kilometer.  Light sensors scan the volume of the tanks for flashes of light from cosmic rays.   Every time a cosmic-ray-induced shower of particles passes through IceTop, the light sensors record data about the amount of light that they saw and the time that it arrived.  We then use computer algorithms to try to reconstruct what direction it came from and how energetic it was.  The first step of this project was a complete overhaul of the software which does this reconstruction.  Next, we studied one of the most troublesome things about the IceTop detector: that snow builds up over the tanks, especially near buildings and structures.  The particles coming from the sky get attenuated in the snow; the thicker the layer of snow, the fewer particles make it through to the detectors beneath.  So if you're trying to estimate the energy of a cosmic ray by measuring how many particles reach a detector, it's important to know how many particles were "lost" along the way.  We studied the effects of snow in a number of different ways, including: looking at the average amount of light seen by real detectors as a function of how far they are from the center of the shower and how much snow covers them, and generating simulations ("fake" events) which include real physics of how particles attenuate in snow.   We learned a lot about snow during this process, including ways to take the snow into account when reconstructing cosmic ray data.  The standard way is to assume a simple mathematical function for how much reduction in particles to expect; the same function is applied to all the tanks in a "one-size-fits-all" way.  But our studies have shown that this can be improved: really, the function should be a much more complicated one that depends on each tank's radius from the center of the shower and on how far along in the shower's development it's being measured. We worked out such a function that fits simulations well; the hope is that it will eventually replace the "one-size-fits-all" method, but for now it is in testing and being refined.   So what is the point of measuring all these cosmic rays and their energies?  Even though cosmic rays were discovered over 100 years ago, it is still debated where they come from and even what mass of charged ions they are.  So the most impactful goal of this project is to use IceTop data, reconstructed with computer algorithms, to estimate the energy of the original cosmic rays and make a "spectrum", or a map of how many particles there are out in space at all different energies.  Additionally, some of the cosmic rays are traveling in such a direction as to hit both the IceTop detector at the surface and the deeply-buried detectors in IceCube.  These are called "coincidence" events, and all of the extra information from the deep detectors can allow us to see the subtle distinctions between "heavy" and "light" cosmic rays, to estimate their mass.  Undergraduate researchers participated in different stages of the project, from looking at IceTop data to looking at real cosmic ray muons in a small muon telescope made from scintillators and housed at UAA.  The effort to measure energy and mass started with looking at one month of data from 2008, then we looked at one year of data from 2010-2011, and by the end of this project were looking at three years of data from 2010-2013, and have publish...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
