<AbstractNarration>The project is a collaborative effort within an education among consortium that consists of eight Minnesota two-year community and technical colleges and Bemidji State University (BSU).  The goal of the project is to address the manufacturing workforce needs in Minnesota through an innovative redesign of higher education delivery and its seamless career pathway. The project has four objectives: 1) increase the number of technicians in Minnesota who meet standardized industry credentials, 2) evaluate four pilot certificates and adapt and repackage the pilot certificates into diplomas and AAS degrees, 3) adapt curriculum to create four additional technician-level diplomas and AAS programs across the state that can articulate to BSU's Bachelor of Applied Science Applied Engineering degree, and 4) assure access through online and blended availability. Internal and External Advisory Boards are providing input on direction and the application of resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In August 2010, 360&deg; Manufacturing and Applied Engineering Center of Excellence became the recipient of The eTECH Project (NSF ATE Award 1002893).  The goal of The eTECH Project was to augment the 360&ordm; Seamless Career Pathway by integrating industry approved credentials within manufacturing and applied engineering curriculum and offering this enhanced curriculum online to reach the maximum number of learners and workers.  Intellectual Merit  eTECH partners and collaborators identified five (5) diplomas and five (5) AAS degrees with one (1) having three (3) emphases for a total of seven (7) available tracks.   These diplomas and AAS degrees build from the four (4) pilot certificates in Production Technologies, Machine Technologist, Automation Technology, and Welding Technology.  The programs developed include:  Applied Engineering Technology Diploma and AAS degree        Three (3) emphases        Applied Engineering Machining and Automation Machining and Welding     Automation Technology Diploma and AAS degree Maintenance Technology Diploma and AAS degree Mechatronics Diploma and AAS degree Mechanical Design Technology Diploma and AAS degree.   Industry-recognized credentials have been incorporated including Manufacturing Skills Standards Council (MSSC), American Welding Society (AWS), and Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Institute (PMMI).  The programs are designed to fit the 360&ordm; Seamless Career Pathway starting from certificate-level to diploma to AAS degree to BAS degree.  The curriculum is designed into 15 &ndash; 21 credit blocks of curriculum in the fields of study.  Twenty-seven (27) new courses have been developed by faculty from partner colleges through this project.   The consortium has learned many lessons through this project and has established a few best practices.  The best practices identified include: offering the courses in 8 week blocks, establishing course schedules that fit both full-time and part-time students, providing services to the students to help with the admissions, registrations, and financial aid that cross the multiple colleges, utilizing a consortium agreement to establish the terms of the consortium, providing faculty with a standard course outline format, promoting Quality Matters best practices for improved instruction, and providing colleges with an intellectual property agreement for faculty developing curriculum for eTECH so that curriculum is jointly owned and shareable.  The lessons learned include: the difficulty in promoting consortium programs and gaining ownership at the colleges, confusion around the role of the admissions office, targeting a new and different audience, establishing a plan for the on-site lab courses and getting faculty to embrace the idea of intensive weekend labs.  Thirty (30) faculty from college partners participated in eleven (11) professional development activities and events including workshops, conferences, and advisory council meetings.  More than two-thirds (69%) of the faculty participants reported that they were "very satisfied" with the session being rated.   MnSCU system provides additional state funding to the 360&deg; to support K-12 outreach, marketing of eTECH programs, student support services, and capital purchases to improve equipment and laboratory curriculum.  The funding support provided from July 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012 has been $2,578,000.   The 360&ordm; collaborative online/blended eTECH programs are part of a $13.1M Department of Labor Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) grant award to Central Lakes College in collaboration with Pine Technical College and St. Cloud Technical and Community College.   Broader Impacts  Through The eTECH Project, 176 students participated in the eTECH program and gained knowledge, skills, and abilities related to manufacturing.  These individuals received upgraded/new skills and are now qualified or better qualified to meet the needs of toda...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
