<AbstractNarration>The Moravian College Scholars in Mathematics and Computer Science Program provides scholarships to community college students who transfer to Moravian College to complete a bachelor's degree in mathematics or computer science. Students are awarded scholarships for two years and, if necessary, for a fifth semester at Moravian.  The objectives of this program are: 1) to provide opportunities for area community college students who otherwise would not be able to afford a private liberal arts college education to attend Moravian College, 2) to enhance existing and build new bonds between Moravian College and community colleges in the area, 3) to broaden participation of community college transfer students in mathematics and computer science at Moravian College and 4) to increase the number of community college transfer students who graduate from Moravian College with a degree in mathematics and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project eases the difficulties of transfer students by providing orientation, a summer bridge program, and opportunities to engage in research projects culminating in a conference for K-12 students. This project will have a sustained impact on Moravian College as well as the Lehigh Valley via the service-learning aspects of the summer program which exposes area K-12 students to interesting aspects of mathematics and computer science, raising awareness of STEM field opportunities. Relationships between community colleges and Moravian College will be strengthened and opportunities for future STEM student placement are enhanced.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Moravian College Scholars in Mathematics and Computer Science Program (MCS2) provided financial support, academic support, and career guidance for transfer students interested in mathematics and computer science.  The objectives of the program were:     1.  To provide opportunities for area community college students and transfer students, who otherwise would not be able to afford a private liberal arts college education, to attend Moravian College. 2.  To enhance existing and build new bonds between Moravian College and community colleges in the area.3.  To broaden participation of community college transfer students in mathematics and computer science at Moravian College.4.  To increase the number of transfer students who graduate from Moravian College with a degree in a STEM field and a major or minor in mathematics and computer science.    The program ran for 6 consecutive years and admitted 27 transfer students into the program.      Students in the MCS2 program entered in a cohort and had the opportunity to participate in a 10 week summer research project and a cohort based course in mathematics.  The results of the summer research included talks at local conference, workshops for high school students to promote STEM, and two research papers and several conference presentations.  Of the 27 students admitted into the program, 22 of them were able to engage in some type of STEM research project with a faculty member.      Some highlights of the program include:   27 transfer students were admitted.     Only 2 students left the college prior to completing their bachelor?s degree in a STEM field.   All of the student received additional financial support from Moravian College in order to decrease the financial burden of finishing their 4 year degree.    4 students continue to post-graduate education   5 students completed secondary education certification in a STEM related field   75% of the students who came to Moravian from a two year school, said they would not have come to Moravian if it were not for the MCS2 program.     Over 80% of the students who have completed the program are either still enrolled in school or are working in a STEM related field.        In addition to providing opportunities for the students, the program has also provided an opportunity for Moravian College to strengthen articulation agreements with regional two-year schools.  Over the span of the program, the number of admitted transfer students has almost doubled.   The college now has articulation agreements with at least 6 other regional two year colleges and is developing a dual enrollment program with the local community college.  Overall the program was a success for these 27 students and the faculty involved.  It has accomplished the objectives and produced some very well rounded individuals.  In addition to creating students in the STEM workforce, it has also provided an opportunity for the same individuals to get a second major or minor in biology, political science, spanish, education, religion, and economics.
