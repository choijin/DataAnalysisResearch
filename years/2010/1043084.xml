<AbstractNarration>This project supports the planning of a unique and important collaboration between researchers at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) and colleagues in France to improve C++, one of the most widely used programming languages. Safety-critical sectors of the world economy, such as air-traffic controls, rely on systems software written in C++. Despite the existence of international standards, and a very large users' community and corresponding weight on the global economy, there is no reliable and scalable way to correctly and mechanically translate C++ programs into executable machine codes. This award will fund Dr. Gabriel Dos Reis from TAMU and three of his students to spend time working with Dr. Xavier Leroy at INRIA Rocquencourt in France to develop a strong research partnership to improve the reliability of C++ compilers. This collaboration is unique because it builds on the respective strengths of the researchers:   while the U.S. team has expertise with the C++ programming language standards and C++ compilers, the French team provides expertise in formal methods for realistic compilers for embedded systems. The formal methods developed by the French team for a realistic subset of the C programming language will be used by the U.S. team in its pursuit of mechanization of the C++ object model, especially for new language features.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary aim of this project was to support the planning of a unique and important collaboration between researchers at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) and colleagues at INRIA (France) to improve C++, one of the most widely used programming languages.  Safety-critical sectors of the world economy, such as air-traffic controls, rely on systems software written in C++.  Despite the existence of international standards, and a very large users' community and corresponding weight on the global economy, there is no reliable and scalable way to correctly and mechanically translate C++ programs into executable machine codes. This project brought together two experts to develop a strong research partnership to improve the reliability of C++ compilers. This collaboration built on the respective strengths of the researchers: while the U.S. team has expertise with the C++ programming language standards and C++ compilers, the French team provides expertise in formal methods for realistic compilers for embedded systems.  Outcome: The project is indeed a success in that it initiated a strong collaboration between two experts; it produced critical academic outputs, engaged undergraduate students in international STEM activities.  Two research papers published at the 2011 and 2012 symposia on Principles of Programming Languages, the premiere venue for research in programming languages, were developed thanks this collaboration:       1.  "Formal Verification of Object Layout for C++ Multiple Inheritance" by     Tahina Ramananandro, Gabriel Dos Reis, Xavier Leroy.  POPL 2011,     Austin, Texas, USA.     This paper is the first published formal and mechanized account of  a family of in-memory object layout algorithms used by the vast  majority of C++ compilers.  It lays down the foundation for future work on formal semantics for C++-style system programming languages.    2. "A Mechanized Semantics for C++ Object Construction and      Destruction with Applications to Resource Management"  by Tahina Ramananandro, Gabriel Dos Reis, Xavier Leroy.  POPL 2012,  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.        This is the first published mechanized semantics of C++  construction and destruction, with eyes towards justifying a fundamental programming idiom for reliable and systematic  resource management.  Beyond the academic significance, this work also uncovered several omissions and inconsistencies in the ISO C++ standards.  They were reported, some of them were fixed in time for the C++11 standards.  The collaboration initiated by this project is on-going, and we haveplans for future significant research projects.     Broader Impacts:  Beyond the academic output, this project succeeded in catalyzing a fruitful and vigorous collaboration between US and French research teams.The project involved several students (the vast majority undergraduate students) in international STEM activities.
