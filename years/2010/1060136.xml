<AbstractNarration>Participation in the development of innovative technologies requires diverse perspectives in order to quickly adapt to emerging technologies. This scholarship project at the Rochester Institute of Technology is designed to increase the diversity in Engineering Technology by addressing factors that contribute to the underrepresentation of women and minorities in these majors.  The scholars in this program complete a course designed to enhance study skills, encourage graduate studies, emphasize workforce readiness, and build a community of scholars.  Scholars are linked with mentors from both academia and industry. Scholarships are offered to academically talented and economically disadvantaged freshman and third year transfer students.  One of the goals of this project is to demonstrate that the presence of a critical mass of underrepresented groups can aid in recruitment and retention of students in STEM disciplines. The project includes outreach activities led by the scholars that encourage K-12 students to consider STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of the Critical Mass of Engineering Technology Scholars (CoMETS) program was to build a critical mass of female scholars in Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology by recruiting, retaining, and graduating 44 <em>additional</em> female students to these programs.&nbsp; The project demonstrated that the presence of a critical mass of underrepresented groups could aid in recruitment and retention of students in STEM disciplines. The objectives of the COMETS program were to:</p> <ul> <li>Engage scholars in the Women in Technology community through participation in professional development workshops, socials, mentoring, and outreach events. </li> <li>Effectively prepare the scholars for the workforce or graduate school. </li> <li>Reinforce the students&rsquo; decision to major in Engineering Technology.</li> <li>Perform regular and thorough assessment of the CoMETS program.&nbsp; </li> <li>Identify scholars struggling academically and provide proactive academic support.&nbsp; </li> </ul> <p>The COMETS project strategies to achieve the objectives include academic, social support and professional skills development provided by the Women in Technology program in the college.

Additionally, assistance was available to the scholars by the existing RIT support network: a well-established, substantial network of support services encompassing areas ranging from academic support centers to the Women&rsquo;s Center to health and wellness programming.</p> <p>The first CoMETS scholarships were awarded in 2012. &nbsp;Scholarships were offered to academically talented and economically disadvantaged freshman and third year transfer students. Each scholar received scholarship support of $6,000-10,000 per academic year. Fifty-one scholars participated in this S-STEM program. Although, retention of scholars in the CoMETS program was 72%, many of the scholars who left (7 out of 14) continued to stay in STEM programs. All but four remained at RIT.
