<AbstractNarration>This Materials World Network project aims at investigating magnetic nanostructures with perpendicular anisotropy, which have fascinating magnetization reversal mechanisms and important technological applications in magnetic recording and spintronics. The network will coordinate research groups at the University of California-Davis (UCD) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US, and the National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in Taiwan, with complementary expertise and backgrounds. Systematic studies will be carried out on nanostructures with uniform and/or graded perpendicular anisotropy to probe their depth-dependent magnetic configurations and anisotropy gradient, to study the basic magnetization reversal mechanisms and dynamics, and to examine the effect of decreasing inter-grain exchange coupling. Samples will be synthesized in coordinated efforts by the UCD and NTHU researchers, including continuous thin films, grain-segregated granular films, nanodots and nanowires. For uniform anisotropy nanostructures, the size-dependent magnetization reversal mechanisms and microscopic magnetic memory effects will be studied; simultaneous enhancements of magnetic anisotropy and grain segregation in prototype perpendicular media will be explored by using an intermediate layer. For graded anisotropy nanostructures, polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) study will be performed at NIST to directly and quantitatively measure the depth-dependent magnetization profile and anisotropy gradient. Scanning electron microscopy with spin polarization analysis (SEMPA) will be used at NIST to image vector magnetization as a function of milling depth; it will probe domain wall assisted reversal in these materials that has been predicted to facilitate both writability and thermal stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding and controlling the magnetization reversal mechanisms in magnetic nanostructures with perpendicular anisotropy will have profound technological impacts.  The nanostructures under investigation have important applications in perpendicular magnetic recording, graded magnetic media, magnetic random access memory, and other types of spintronic devices. The project brings together a network of researchers from physics and materials science with expertise in synthesis of nanostructures, probe microscopy, magnetic and magneto-optical characterization, and neutron and x-ray scattering. This configuration is ideally suited to promote the project in all its scientific aspects. International collaboration is at the heart of this project. A critical component is the international exchange visits, which will facilitate executions of key experiments, enhance discussions of results and planning of future work. UCD and NTHU students involved will visit each other?s lab, integrate the research efforts, participate in experiments, acquire knowledge and training at NIST and Advanced Light Source, learn the comprehensive set of techniques covering all aspects of the research, and gain valuable cultural experiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) are a technologically important class of materials whose magnetic moments prefer to orient normal to the films, in contrast to usual cases where the moments lie in the film plane. The technological importance of PMA materials is best manifested in the rapid advancements in magnetic recording, where the areal density has increased by 9 orders of magnitude over the last 60 years.    Intellectual Merit  A variety of nanostructures with uniform and graded perpendicular anisotropy have been realized, where the magnetic switching can be influenced by both the anisotropy gradient along the depth of the film and the lateral feature size. Major results include the following:  1. We have achieved a breakthrough in realizing the technologically important (001) oriented FeCuPt in the tetragonal L10 phase, and illustrated the L10 ordering mechanism. Our synthesis approach allows lowering of the ordering temperature by over 250&deg;C compared to conventional approaches, which has been a key bottleneck impeding their employment in the emerging heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) media.  2. In studies of graded magnetic anisotropy media, where the magnetic anisotropy varies along the film depth, we have demonstrated a number of novel approaches to realize the anisotropy gradient, by varying synthesis conditions, changing deposition order of magnetically hard/soft layers, introducing composition gradients, or utilizing post-deposition ion irradiation.   3. In magnetic nanodots that exhibit the vortex state, where the moments form a hurricane-like winding configuration, we have demonstrated two distinctly different mechanisms to control the winding direction, also known as the chirality. When the magnetic vortices are placed next to an antiferromagnet, we show that interfacial exchange interactions play a critical role in determining the magnetic configurations and reversal mechanisms.   4. In studies of magnetic skyrmions, which so far have been largely limited to low temperatures and finite magnetic fields, we have realized ground state artificial skyrmion lattices at room temperature.  These structures are constructed by growing asymmetric vortex-state magnetic nanodot arrays on top of PMA thin films. The vortex structure is imprinted from the dots into the interfacial region of the underlayer by a critical ion irradiation step. These artificial skyrmions offer a convenient and powerful platform to explore skyrmion physics and topological phenomena.  This project has so far led to 34 publications in top journals in the field, such as Nature Communications and Advanced Materials, and a provisional patent application.

Broader Impacts  A Materials World Network has been established with colleagues at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in Taiwan, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and additional partners in Spain, Germany, Sweden, Japan and China. 17 journal publications are joint studies with international partners.    Results from this project have important and broad technological impacts. Our results on FeCuPt and graded media demonstrate effective and convenient ways to achieve these technologically important materials, which are highly relevant to magnetic recording, as evidenced by the keen interest in our work from the community and partnerships formed with Seagate and HGST. Our 2013 paper on the FeCuPt study was featured by Applied Physics Letters (APL) in its Research Highlight and Top Stories. It was one of the top 15 "Most Accessed" papers out of ~5,500 APL papers in 2013.    Our demonstration of the room temperature artificial skyrmi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
