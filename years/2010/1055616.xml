<AbstractNarration>Professor Sheryl L. Wiskur of the University South Carolina is supported by the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop a research project with a focus on the asymmetric silylation of alcohols. Asymmetric derivatization with silyl groups will be employed to bring about the enrichment of one alcohol enantiomer over another via selective kinetic resolutions. These will lead to an increase in the enantiomeric excess of single enantiomers and ultimately highly enriched compounds in higher yields. Detailed studies are also proposed using NMR and circular dichroism to elucidate the mechanistic pathway of silylation-based kinetic resolutions and the origin of chiral induction. The proposed research is of fundamental and practical importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiral alcohols are common starting materials for a variety of chiral products. A facile synthetic procedure to obtain higher yields of single enantiomers will have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Students will be trained in organic and analytical chemistry skills to prepare them for academic, pharmaceutical and industrial chemical careers. Women and minority students will be coached to sharpen their scientific, leadership and management skills.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since optically active intermediates are increasing in importance in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, developing new efficient approaches to obtaining these compounds is an important goal.  The research funded by this award led to the development of new methodology to obtain a variety of enantiopure alcohols, but more importantly fundamental studies on how the reactions progressed were undertaken.  By understanding the basics of a reaction, further expansion and development of the reaction is more likely.  Studies undertaken include many physical organic experiments to understand the complicated nature of silicon and how chirality transfer is possible.  This work most importantly provided valuable training for graduate and undergraduate students     The intellectual merit of this award is the mechanistic understanding and development of tunable triarylsilyl compounds for the silylation-based kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols.  The formation of these compounds enantiomerically pure provides a facile method for the pharmaceutical or agricultural industry to obtain enantiomerically pure alcohols for their incorporation in the synthesis of biologically relevant molecules.  The project has been useful towards the understanding of the chiral environment around the silicon and using that knowledge to expand the substrate scope and has been a worthy endeavor.  This project has advanced the field of asymmetric chemistry and shown the usefulness of triarylsilyl groups in asymmetric catalysis.      The broader impact of this work has been the development of new methodology that provided the synthetic community with new knowledge and an appreciation of employing triarylsilyl groups in methodology.  Chemists will be able to use these tools to obtain new compounds in a more efficient and inexpensive manner as compared to existing routes.  Even though the focus of this proposal was on studies toward understanding the mechanism of the reactions proposed, the larger picture deals with the knowledge that was gained from these experiments.  Ultimately, the work aided in expanding the scope of these reactions.  The PI and students were exposed to a wide range of organic chemistry problems and techniques that prepared the students for careers in the pharmaceutical and chemical industry, as well as careers in academics.  Students received multidisciplinary training in organic, analytical, and supramolecular chemistry.  Students have shared their knowledge through attending conferences and publishing peer reviewed papers.  The PI is strongly committed to mentoring students, and developed a womenÆs mentoring group towards retaining women in science.
