<AbstractNarration>Puberty is a significant stage of development marked by many transitions in both physiological and neural function.  Though most people appreciate the large hormonal changes that occur during this period of development, the types of life experiences that an adolescent individual encounters also change dramatically.  These experiences can result in increased exposure to stressors in the environment.  A growing body of research indicates that how an individual responds to stress, both physiologically and neurobiologically, changes substantially during this stage of life.  Despite these pubertal-related shifts in stress reactivity, relatively little is known about the biological mechanisms that underlie these shifts.  It is important to address these gaps in this understanding as stress can disrupt many of the body and brain systems that are developing into their adult-like patterns during this time.  Using an experimental animal model that combines studies at the whole organism and biochemical levels, these experiments will begin to reveal the neural and endocrinological mechanisms that mediate the pubertal changes in stress responsiveness.  The results produced by these studies will contribute to, and greatly extend, the current understanding of how pubertal maturation and stress interact to affect both the brain and body.  Importantly, these studies will be undertaken at Barnard College, an all-women liberal arts college.  Thus, in addition to these experiments leading to significant advances in the fundamental understanding of development, support of this proposal will also provide many female undergraduates with ample educational opportunities to take part in all aspects of the research experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report:  Interest in adolescence as a major period of physiological and neurobehavioral development is growing.  Also growing is the concern of how stress may perturb this development, yet we know relatively little about the maturation of hormonal systems that mediate stress reactivity during this crucial stage of life.  It is imperative to address these gaps in our understanding, as puberty and adolescence represent major developmental transitions known to be critically important in the maturation of other physiological and neurobehavioral systems.  Thus, studying the development of stress reactivity will not only contribute to our basic understanding of how adolescence affects the functioning of a key hormonal system, but could also shed light on the developmental vulnerabilities associated with puberty.  With the supported by this NSF Award we were able to make significant progress on understating the pubertal maturation of hormonal stress reactivity.  From characterizing the hormonal changes associated with pubertal and adolescent development, to the neural and endocrine mechanisms which mediate these changes, we have set a solid foundation for further enquiry into how and why these changes occur.  This Award has led to the publication of 12 articles in peer-reviewed scholarly journals.  From a broader perspective, the research supported by this NSF award was conducted at Barnard College, an all womenÃ†s liberal arts college associated with Columbia University.  Thus, this Award provided many female undergraduates with valuable opportunities to take part in all aspects of the research experience.  In close collaboration with the principle investigator of this Award, students were involved in each stage of these experiments, from producing, recording and analyzing data to participating in the dissemination of these results at national conferences and ultimately co-authoring peer-reviewed publications. Given the far-reaching influences of stress reactivity on the physiological, neurobiological and behavioral functions of an individual, the undertaking of these research projects contributed to and greatly extended our current understanding of adolescence generally and the pubertal organization of neural and endocrine systems specifically.
