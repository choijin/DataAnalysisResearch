<AbstractNarration>The computing landscape is changing - parallel computing will be the "default" approach to programming in the future.  A central challenge in the transition to parallelism is shortage of workforce with expertise in parallel programming. In this REU, we will train students in the basics of parallel programming, provide them with research experience that demonstrates the importance of parallel computing in their own fields, and help them develop the confidence that they need to be successful in graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To enable undergraduates to participate in the revolutionary new capabilities afforded by parallel computing, the REU-POP program (Research Experience for Undergraduates-Passionate on Parallel) at the University of Illinois will recruit ten (10) junior- and senior-level undergraduates majoring in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to participate in a summer research experience in parallel computing and programming relevant to their own fields of study. Recognizing that women are critically underrepresented in academic and professional computer science, qualified students will be especially sought at women's and minority-serving colleges with limited research or graduate-school options. Eligible students will have completed specified computer science courses, but will not be required to have experience in parallel programming, which is rarely available at the undergraduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU students will work in pairs (current literature suggests this is a successful learning strategy for women in programming) in small teams that will include a faculty member in their own discipline and a specially trained graduate mentor. Through preparatory online sessions before the POP summer, a four-day immersion session at the start of the POP summer, hands-on learning in their university laboratory, weekly technical sessions, and special seminars on topics such as parallel computing in current technology; research ethics; technology commercialization; and the benefits of graduate school, students will develop essential skills in parallel programming and explore the research options in their own STEM disciplines. Students will also interact with prominent professional and academic researchers to form a network of diverse role models and mentors to provide advice on careers and graduate school options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe undergraduates can be encouraged to persist in engineering programs, particularly computer science, by engaging them in research, by employing multiple mentoring options, and by providing opportunities for them to work in "programming pairs." The REU-POP program at Illinois will explore these methods within the REU context, and we will report on their success in the open literature to assist others in this effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award enabled us to run 4 summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs from 2010 to 2013.  These programs included participation from a total of 43 students; 34 of those students were completely supported by this grant.  These students participated in a 10-week mentored research experience in which they worked in pairs with a faculty advisor and graduate student mentor.  Projects focused on applying parallel programming to application areas including: Molecular Dynamics, Protien Classification, Brownian Dynamics, Heat Conduction, Quantum Mechanics, Optimization, and Particle Simulation.  In addition, students took part in a 1-week parallel programming boot camp that introduced students to a broad collection of parallel programming paradigms including shared memory (pthreads, OpenMP), message passing (MPI), and GPU programming (CUDA).  Further enrichment included a series of seminars on presentation, ethics, writing, applying to graduate school, team work and guest speakers.    Demographically, 30% of our participants were women, 20% were African American, 8% were Hispanic, and 3% were Native American.  In addition, 50% of the students came from institutions with limited research opportunities.  Of the students that participated in our REU program, 30% continued on to graduate school, 33% are working, and 37% are still completing their undergraduate degrees.  The graduate schools attended by our former students include Illinois, Berkeley, Stanford, Georgia Tech, Washington, Wisconsin, and UC Boulder.
