<AbstractNarration>The West Virginia University ADVANCE project has an overall goal of providing policies and support to retain and promote women to higher professorial ranks.  This is in response to a direct need to address an increasing trend of faculty attrition among women in the STEM disciplines.  Specifically, the project aims to focus on three primary objectives.  They include: making direct connections between faculty needs and policies and practices at the institution; recruiting, retaining and promoting more women faculty in the STEM disciplines; and engaging faculty in a dialogical change process as a mechanism toward achieving institutional transformation.  As a result of these measures, the institution expects to be able to achieve very impressive outcomes, including, but not limited to: development of a methodology for institutional transformation that can be applicable to all institution types, improvement of climate issues as identified in climate surveys and exit interviews, significant increases in the representation of women faculty in the STEM disciplines, particularly at higher professorial ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  There are several novel approaches presented in the proposal including: implementation of an endowed fund to support women in STEM; a week long boot camp for new faculty; search committee certification in objective evaluation, which offers a feasible plan for accountability; mini sabbaticals in year 3 of the tenure track to minimize an excessive teaching load burden experienced by most faculty at the institution; attrition planning training for chairs to ensure that progress continues in each department in the event the current chair is no longer in place.  A major strength of the WVU ADVANCE IT project is its focus on dialogue exchange among faculty toward exchanging climate.  This model is well documented in the social science component of the proposal, and has not been largely examined within the ADVANCE community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.  The West Virginia ADVANCE IT project proposes to utilize mechanisms of achieving institutional transformation that are potentially adaptable to all institution types, including two-year institutions.  To that end, this project has the potential to impact both typical and atypical ADVANCE institutions.  Project accomplishments are expected to be broadly disseminated through traditional means that would include peer reviewed journal articles, national presentations and targeted outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ West Virginia University's ADVANCE Center is an interdisciplinary innovatiave research and practice unit for faculty equity funded by the Office of the Provost.  Accomplishments to date include:  -The creation of an institutional culture of systematic data collection and sharing (e.g. exit surveys for faculty and staff, COACHE faculty satisfaction surveys, culture surveys and salary assessments) as well as tracking institutional trends to inform organizational decision-making.    -Institutionalized policies and/or resources that better support work-life integration.  Examples include a modified duties policy without salary modification to accommodate significant personal circumstances (e.g. caring for a child/children, caring for a parent, serious illness) with an automatic extension of the tenure clock; family travel funds to cover caregiving expenses for faculty and postdoctoral scholars with dependent care responsibilities; and an expansion of dual career benefits to cover academic job placement for partners of current (not just potential or new) employees.  -Transparent and inclusive recruitment and evaluation practices such as innovative training on implicit bias awareness and intervention and changes in the promotion and tenure guidelines that expand the path to professor for tenured Associate Professors to account for extraordinary and extended administrative service or outstanding contributions in any one mission area.  -Mentoring and sponsorship of faculty, postdoc scholars, and graduate students through an ongoing membership with the NCFDD and an institutionalized external sponsorship program for faculty members.  Sponsorship participants report that the program helped them publish their work (on average two peer reviewed publications per person), train their students, obtain funding for their research (on average $380,426 per person) and advance in their careers (79.3 percent indicated promotion and/or tenure).  Furthermore participants noted that their mentors helped them build national and international reputations, further contributing to WVU's reputation and ability to achieve its mission and move West Virginia forward.  -Leadership programs that promote and sustain diversity, including a standardized protocol document for Chair appointment, assignment and review, including regular 360 reviews; and the Women's Leadership Initiative, created to empower female faculty and staff in leadership roles by providing them development opportunities and professional networks.   -Significant improvements in the hiring of female faculty in targeted STEM and SBS units, including an increase in the number of women in targeted STEM departments from 33 to 49 (a 48.5 percent increase) and from 23 to 31 in SBS departments (a 34.8 percent increase).  -Significant increases in the number and percentage of female faculty members in STEM disciplines reaching the rank of Professor (e.g. from 0.8 percent to 7.69 percent), including some attainment of this rank by female faculty for the first time in their department's history, and increase in the representation of women at the Associate Professor level from 19.2 percent to 28.8 percent.
