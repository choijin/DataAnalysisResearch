<AbstractNarration>This project is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. The Integrated Biological Sciences Summer Research Program (IBS-SRP) is hosted by the Institute for Biology Education at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and provides intensive 10 week research training experiences for undergraduate students interested in exploring graduate school and careers in research. The IBS-SRP is a large REU program that includes eight smaller disciplinary learning communities: Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics; Bioenergy; Cellular &amp; Molecular Biology; Computational Biology &amp; Biostatistics; Ecology, Plants &amp; Environmental Systems; Molecular &amp; Environmental Toxicology; Neurobiology; and Virology. Each student belongs to one of these disciplinary learning communities and conducts an independent research project with a faculty mentor in that area. In addition, a faculty member, who provides complementary mentoring and expert advice to students, leads each disciplinary community. Students are expected to do full-time research as well as participate in all program activities. Program seminars and workshops focus on five core biological sciences concepts: evolution; pathways and transformation of energy and matter; information flow, exchange and storage; structure and function; systems. In addition, professional development workshops on scientific writing and presentation skills, preparation for graduate school, biological sciences research career opportunities and ethics and the responsible conduct of research are offered. Each student creates a research proposal poster at the beginning of the program, writes a final paper at the end, and gives an oral presentation at a final symposium. The impact of the program is assessed using various means, including an online REU common assessment tool. Students are selected for participation based on their academic record and their potential for success and interest in graduate school and a career in research. Students who are from ethnic groups underrepresented in biological sciences research, from low-income homes, first-generation college students, or those who attend small liberal arts colleges with limited research opportunities are especially encouraged to apply.
