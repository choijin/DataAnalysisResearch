<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Concurrent Rapid Identification and Quantification of Bulking and Foaming Bacteria      Pitiporn Asvapathanagul   Environmental Engineering  University of California at Irvine  and   Biomedical Laboratory Science Department  Yonsei University-Wonju  NSF-Korea EAPSI 2010     1.      What &ndash; This research study focuses on using a well known and highly accurate molecular methodology that has been using in medical field  (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Reverse Line Blot Hybridization; PCR-RLB) to identify bulking and foaming bacteria  which cause solids separation problems in the biological wastewater treatment processes such as activated sludge, membrane reactor and anaerobic digester.            The goals of this research are  1) to discover a broad spectrum primer set for foaming bacteria and another primer set for sulfur uptake bulking bacteria for amplifying target DNA extracts  2)  to discover specific DNA sequences of target foaming and bulking bacteria in the amplicon regions, which serve as probe for signal development and  3)  to optimize and modify these primers and probe to the PCR-RLB platform.     2.      Why &ndash; importance of the research  Causes of bulking and foaming are still unclear. Most of sewage treatment plants use chlorine as disinfectant to kill the bulking and foaming bacteria, which also kill the majority of Heterotrophic bacteria converting BOD to water and carbon dioxide. Chlorination increases the plant operational cost. Microscopy is originally used for bulking and foaming bacteria identification, which is not accurate. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), a molecular method, is currently used for bulking and foaming bacteria identification. FISH cannot differentiate among gram positive branching filamentous bacteria as well as maximum numbers of bacteria species or genera are limited by fluorescence and filters of fluorescence microscopes. PCR-RLB is useful for foaming and bulking study because     PCR-RLB can simultaneously identify multi genera of bulking and foaming study in one assay (Upto 40 probes can be used), which is excellent for sewage treatment plant monitoring because the specific cause of each bulking and foaming overgrowth is still doubtful.  PCR-RLB is high accurate that can differentiate one single nucleic acid (DNA) basepair different, which is suitable for foaming identification because their 16S rRNA genes are highly similarity. Not complicate and easy training.        3.      Where &ndash; host researcher and location; rationale behind choice           The medical field has established many molecular techniques. It is beneficial for environmental engineering to learn and apply these techniques to study bacteria in the sewage treatment processes. Pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium spp. and Nocardia spp. (host advisor Ã¦s interest) are close related to gram positive branching foaming bacteria in the wastewater treatment plants. Dr. Hyeyoung Lee (host advisor) presented the application of PCR-RLB to my major advisor (Dr. Betty H Olson) three years ago. Hence Dr. Olson had an idea that this technique will help wastewater treatment plant personnel know the coming of these problematic bacteria.      4.      Outcome description of what you did/found  A series of DNA sequences belonging to foaming bacteria, including Nocardia spp., Millisia and Skermania spp., Gordonia spp., Tsukamurella spp., Microthrix spp. and Mycobacterium spp. were designed as broad spectrum primers for foaming bacteria group and highly specific probes for each genus. A series of DNA sequences belonging to bulking bacteria, including Thiothrix spp. were designed as broad spectrum primers for sulfur uptake bulking bacteria group and highly specific probes for Thiothrix genus. Optimized the PCR and RLB protocol such as chemical concentration, annealing temperature and washing temperature      5.
