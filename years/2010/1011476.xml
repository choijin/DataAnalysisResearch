<AbstractNarration>Understanding the neural mechanisms that cause species to behave differently has been an elusive goal in biology.  This project, which is part of a doctoral dissertation, uses the nervous systems of sea slugs (opithobranch molluscs) to address this issue by comparing neural circuits underlying swimming behavior.  Sea slugs have large neurons and simple nervous systems, allowing researchers to map out neural circuitry underlying equally simple behaviors.  Some sea slug species swim by flexing their bodies up and down. Other species either do not swim or swim by other means. The neural circuitry underlying up and down swimming has been determined in two species: Tritonia diomedea and Pleurobranchaea californica.  The neural circuits and interactions underlying swimming in these two species are remarkably similar even though these animals are not closely related.  There is evidence to suggest the ability to swim evolved independently using the same (or homologous) neurons.  This leads to the prediction that other species that swim in this manner would also use the same neurons and neural interactions to produce the behavior.  To test this intriguing prediction, a third species of sea slug that swims with up and down movements will be be studied.  The only readily available species are found in Australia.  Electrophysiological, pharmacological, and histological approaches will be employed by the student to study the Australian species to determine if it also uses the same neurons and neural mechanisms.  The results of this project will contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms that allowed behavior to evolve.  A positive result would show that behavior could predict neural circuitry in animals that independently evolved the behavior.  A negative result would still be interesting because it would show that similar behaviors can be produced by different mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several broader impacts of this project.  The first is that it will be a training opportunity for the student that will greatly enhance his dissertation project.  The work will also establish a new partnership with colleagues internationally.  The results of this project will be disseminated broadly both in the form of research papers, but also as contributions to NeuronBank.org, a project that tracks identified neurons and synaptic connections.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background: Similar behaviors have evolved independently in a number of different lineages.  Some examples include vocal learning in birds, pair bonding in rodents, and eusociality in insects.  This project examined another example, swimming in sea slugs, where the cellular basis for the behavior could be determined.  Individual nerve cells (neurons) can be identified and the connections between the neurons (synapses) can be studied using microelectrodes. Not only can neurons be identified from individual to individual within a species, but homologues can be recognized across species.  Two sea slugs, Tritonia diomedea and Pleurobranchaea californica independently evolved the ability to swim by flexing their bodies up and down.  It was previously shown that the neural circuits controlling this behavior in both species contain homologous neurons called DSI and C2.  DSI uses the neurotransmitter serotonin.  In Tritonia, it was previously shown that serotonin not only served as a neurotransmitter, but also played a neuromodulatory role; it increased the strength of synapses made by C2.  Furthermore, serotonergic neuromodulation was necessary for Tritonia to swim.  It was not known if this was also true for Pleurobranchaea.    Results: The results from this project showed that the DSI homologue modulated C2 synapses and that serotonergic neuromodulation was necessary for Pleurobranchaea to swim.  This project further showed that individual Pleurobranchaea differed in their amounts of neuromodulation and that this correlated with the durations of their swim episodes.  Homologues of C2 were identified in species that did not swim like Tritonia or Pleurobranchaea.  In one of those species, Hermissenda crassicornis, it was found that neither the DSI nor serotonin increased C2 synaptic strength.  Therefore, Tritonia and Pleurobranchaea appear to have independently evolved this neuromodulatory mechanism. Attempts to procure a third swimming species from Australia were unsuccessful.  This would have further tested the hypothesis that the same mechanism is repeated used for the independently evolved behaviors.  Broader Impact: Descriptions of identified neurons were added to the online database: http://neuronbank.org/wiki/.       Last Modified: 08/27/2012       Submitted by: Paul S Katz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
