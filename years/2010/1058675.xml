<AbstractNarration>This research project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, will develop methods for activating C-H bonds and for forming C-C bonds based on facile interconversions of platinum(II) and platinum(IV) organometallic complexes. Professor Joseph L. Templeton of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will develop methods for forming C-C bonds from abundant and recalcitrant C-H bonds in alkane and arene reagents. Activation of C-H bonds and formation of C-C bonds will be promoted by controlling access to reactive five-coordinate platinum intermediates.  Experiments to elucidate the mechanism of organometallic platinum reaction cycles will be undertaken.  Although significant progress has been made in both C-H activation and C-C bond formation reactions, most of the focus has been on the details of the organic bonds as they reshuffle partners.  This project will look at the critical role of ancillary ligands on the metal that remain intact throughout the reaction cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work could lead to more efficient methods of carbon-carbon bond formation through both insertion reactions and coupling mechanisms.  Chemical transformations promoted with transition metals are environmentally beneficial since the reactions are economical with respect to atomic identity of reagents and products.  This methodology will have an impact on areas that rely on the efficient preparation of chemicals within the pharmaceutical, chemical, and agricultural industries. Broader impacts include expanding the education of both undergraduate and graduate students through independent experimental research projects.  In addition, Professor Templeton will participate in advisory activities that promote science not only on the Chapel Hill campus but across the state of North Carolina. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

We were able to find and characterize platinum, iridium and tungsten complexes containing metal ligand multiple bonds. In addition to well-defined monomeric complexes that contain carbon or nitrogen or oxygen bound to late metals through both sigma and pi bonds, we uncovered instances of dinuclear complexes containing two equivalent metal centers.  The properties of these dinuclear complexes were informative and led to new mechanistic insights. The NMR behavior of the dinuclear species was particularly informative as the second order effects could be modeled successfully.  We moved to nitrene analogs of oxygen atom transfer products in order to track insertion chemistry with Cp* iridium complexes.  Insertion into the phenylpyridine Ir-C bond was observed along a reaction coordinate on the way to other products. Working with pi rich tungsten monomers containing both alkyne ligands and azavinylidene ligands produced a reversal of addition to the alpha and beta sites on the azavinylidene ligand.  As a result the electron pair on the nitrogen was available to simple electrophiles while oxidation to form a radical intermediate with could couple at the beta site of the azavinylidene produced beta addition overall.  Further exploration of the reactivity patterns of the radical complex formed by one-electron oxidation produced beta site coupled products.  With stereocenters at both metals and at both bridging carbons the number of potential stereoisomers is 10 (the number of isomers would be 16 if all four centers were unique, but here the two ends are the same and the two CHMe centers are the same, too, hence only 10 different isomers) but we see only a single species by NMR.  The NMR spectrum reflects formation of a pair of enantiomers that have identical NMR properties.  We have isolated a crystal and have the solid state structure to reinforce our interpretation based on NMR data alone.
