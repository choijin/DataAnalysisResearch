<AbstractNarration>The University of Massachusetts, American Society of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO), New York Hall of Science, and Boston Public Schools propose a thematic COSEE Center, that will greatly broaden the impacts of the COSEE Network. COSEE-OCEAN will use existing social and professional relationships to strategically engage ocean scientists in education and outreach activities by offering them professional development workshops at annual ASLO meetings and connecting them to COSEE Network outreach activities. COSEE-OCEAN will efficiently leverage these existing networks to expand and enhance a two-way exchange of innovation, experience, educational products, professional development models and best practices between COSEE and mainstream STEM formal and informal education communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our vision is that within five years, all ocean scientists will be aware of and have access to education and outreach opportunities within the COSEE Network; the COSEE Network will be able to exchange knowledge and resources with STEM programs nationwide; informal education institutions will have increased their capacity to address public ocean literacy; and a model for implementing a high quality ocean curriculum in diverse, non-coastal urban school districts will be widely disseminated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our goals are:1)To engage more Ocean Scientists in high quality education and outreach opportunities provided by the COSEE Network, 2) To deliver high quality Ocean Science instructional materials to a diverse audience in large urban school districts, especially in non-coastal states, and 3) To promote Ocean Literacy through a network of Informal Science Education institutions and individuals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits of COSEE-OCEAN are to strategically strengthen the interactions between existing networks in order to catalytically utilize COSEE resources in a broader context and to gain capacity from the networks' output, COSEE-OCEAN aims to reach ALL ocean scientists, to target under-represented minority students in urban school districts, to effectively engage students in non-coastal states, and to form connections between existing educational networks.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this proposal include expanding the COSEE Network to include existing networks of ocean scientists (ASLO), informal educators (ASTC, CAISE), and urban educators (Lawrence Hall of Science and Boston Public Schools), which will strengthen the capacity of that overall network to deliver high quality ocean education to K-12 and public audiences. By using distance learning and working with urban school districts in non-coastal states, we will vastly broaden the reach of COSEE to include a diverse population of students who do not have opportunities to directly experience the ocean. In addition, we will link effectively with COSEE-China to extend the reach of COSEE beyond US borders.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Default">Intellectual Merit</p> <p class="Default">In 2011, the New York Hall of Science, in collaboration with University of Massachusetts, Boston assembled an inquiry group of experts in the field of learning and ocean science to identify the state of ocean science literacy resources and assess their ability to deepening the publics engagement in, and understanding of ocean science. The study concluded that, while there were many superb ocean science educational resources (e.g., programs, courses, interactive games and museum exhibits), there was limited efficacy in deepening understanding and engagement in ocean science among a broad spectrum of learners. The group noted that the complexity and transdisciplinary nature of ocean science renders it a daunting subject for even those living in close proximity and familiarity to the sea. Characteristics of ocean science that seemed to be implicated in this barrier to understanding is the abstract, statistical, and dynamical systems nature of most ocean science data. This conclusion indicates that the discipline needs to do a better job of acquainting the public with the complexity of ocean science. The publication of the &ldquo;COSEE OCEAN Inquiry Group Report: (accessible as a free download: <a href="http://scholarworks.umb.edu/environment_pubs/1/">http://scholarworks.umb.edu/environment_pubs/1/</a>) provides a point of departure for future directions in improving ocean science literacy.</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">Broader Impacts</p> <p class="Default">As a result of these findings COSEE OCEAN began a couple of initiatives to provide new resources and promote ocean science literacy among a very broad urban audience. Initially, we began promoting the report and its findings through a large-scale event hosted by the New York Hall of Science called World Maker Faire. Participation in this event during the life of the grant exposed over 10,000 New Yorkers to activities ranging from plankton and nekton exhibits, reef protection, underwater robotics, and other activities. As a coastal city, New York lacked major festival celebrating ocean science, so in collaboration with the Hudson River Park Trust, we successfully launched SUBMERGE, an annual marine science festival on Pier 26 in TriBeCa, New York City. It provides a venue for many and varied educational programs about ocean science. A description of the event can be found here: <a href="https://www.hudsonriverpark.org/special-events/view/events-Submerge">https://www.hudsonriverpark.org/special-events/view/events-Submerge</a></p> <p class="Default">This event is free and for the 2 years it has been held so far has exposed an additional 12,000 New Yorkers to activities, demonstrations and talks about the marine environment and engineering. This led to collaboration with Clarkson University and Hudson River Park Trust to develop a new museum of estuary science at Pier 26, a project that is currently underway and expected to provide a venue for hundreds of thousands of visitors yearly to learn about the complexity of estuary systems and how they couple with human, and other earth systems. Significant to this project is that it will be responsive to the outcomes of, and to specifically address the needs outlined in the Inquiry Group Report. This new estuary science center is expected to open to the public in 2019.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/23/2016<br>      Modified by: Stephen&nbsp;M&nbsp;Uzzo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1038853/1038853_10050641_1482519557753_100_2131--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1038853/1038853_10050641_1482519557753_100_2131--rgov-800width.jpg" title="COSEE OCEAN Inquiry Group"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1038853/1038853_10050641_1482519557753_100_2131--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="COSEE OCEAN Inquiry Group"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">COSEE OCEAN Inquiry Group Meeting at the New York Hall of Science in New York City October 22-24, 2012</div> <div class="imageCredit">Catherine Cramer</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stephen&nbsp;M&nbsp;Uzzo</div> <div class="imageTitle">COSEE OCEAN Inquiry Group</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1038853/1038853_10050641_1482517787123_OSMpic(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1038853/1038853_10050641_1482517787123_OSMpic(1)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Submerge Poster at AGU Ocean Science Meeting"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1038853/1038853_10050641_1482517787123_OSMpic(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Submerge Poster at AGU Ocean Science Meeting"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Graduate Student Sarah Rosengard presents her poster at the American Geophysical Union Annual Conference in New Orleans, Louisiana, 2016</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sarah Rosengard</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stephen&nbsp;M&nbsp;Uzzo</div> <div class="imageTitle">Submerge Poster at AGU Ocean Science Meeting</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1038853/1038853_10050641_1482520010174_30136308790_5c7977a1a2_z--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1038853/1038853_10050641_1482520010174_30136308790_5c7977a1a2_z--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Opening Time at SUBMERGE"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1038853/1038853_10050641_1482520010174_30136308790_5c7977a1a2_z--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Opening Time at SUBMERGE"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The SUBMERGE marine science festival opens for the day on Pier 26, Manhattan, New York City</div> <div class="imageCredit">Todd Narasuwan, NYSCI</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stephen&nbsp;M&nbsp;Uzzo</div> <div class="imageTitle">Opening Time at SUBMERGE</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
