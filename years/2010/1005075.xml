<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Santa Fe Institute (SFI) hosts an  REU Site focusing on the computational properties of complex adaptive systems with particular (but not exclusive) emphasis on the social sciences. The program provides a unique and transformative educational and research experience for undergraduates. SFI is a private, independent research institute dedicated to collaborative and transdisciplinary research across the biological, computational, physical, and social sciences. The REU Site focuses on fundamental scientific problems that cross scales and can be addressed by quantitative thinking, mathematical modeling and empirical data analyses. SFI, the home of complexity science, has played a seminal role in the recognition that many of the most challenging, exciting, and profound questions facing science and society (a) lie at the interfaces between traditional disciplines; and (b) raise questions of collective behavior, emergence, and multi-scale organization, all which are characteristic of complex systems. Among such questions are the physical-chemical origins of life; innovation, growth, evolution and robustness of complex adaptive systems, including organisms, ecosystems, and societies; structure and dynamics of networks in nature and society; biologically-inspired and other novel paradigms of computation; relationships between information processing, energy, and dynamics in biology and society; and growth, sustainability, and the fate of human existence. The REU students are fully immersed and engaged participants in this diverse and, for many, unique intellectual environment composed of overlapping, collaborative, interdisciplinary, and multi-generational scientific teams; in this context they team up with one or more mentors at SFI to work on meaningful complexity science research problems to which they can make a significant contribution. Activities include: participation in the Complex Systems Summer School; development of individual research projects; participation in on-going SFI workshops, working groups, symposia and colloquia; participation in the Summer Internship/Mentorship Program, acquiring teaching and mentoring skills; and presentation of research results in peer-reviewed settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alumni of this SFI REU program are expected to proceed to graduate school,  and into academic research and teaching professions. The program provides undergraduates with a unique opportunity to conduct scientific research in a collaborative transdisciplinary environment and to communicate that experience back to their home institutions and to carry it into their future careers. The institute and this REU Site administrators use specific and targeted plans to recruit students from traditionally under-served communities. Other dimensions of broader impacts arise as a result of the participation of previous SFI REU Site alumni (supported by institutional funds), as well as the REU students' partial participation in SFI's annual Graduate Workshop on Computational Social Sciences. All REU students are expected to co-author (with their mentors) scholarly publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report reflects the culmination of a three-year Santa Fe Institute REU site "Transdisciplinary Research through Computational Modeling in the Social, Biological, and Physical Sciences" project, a program that received a no-cost extension for a 4th year.  The project provided opportunities for rich interaction between mentors and students, interactions that are the foundation of the accomplishments achieved by the projectÆs activities.  The program facilitated 36 discrete ten-week summer residencies by participants, each of whom completed a research project on some aspect of complex systems, generally within the domain of the social sciences. Students were immersed in a collaborative, transdisciplinary and multigenerational scientific environment.  Activities included participation in the Complex Systems Summer School; development of individual research projects; participation in on-going SFI workshops, working groups, symposia and colloquia; participation in tutorials focusing on teaching and mentoring skills; and presentation of research results in peer-review settings.  To date, four student-authored papers have appeared in peer-reviewed literature as a result of project research.  The program facilitated a wide range of research activities.  Among the projects was research on adaptation and information in the Afghanistan insurgency focusing on the application of methods from information theory to examine the emergence of a coordinated insurgency in the region, 2004-2009. This work resulted in a publication in Entropy.   Another project explored the links between pattern and process in cultural evolution, laying the theoretical and methodological foundations for investigating how individual level interactions aggregate to produce population level patterns of cultural diversity.  Other work studied the longevity of the economic firm looking at the effects of market size and concentration on firm lifecycles by investigating lifespan and frequency across economic and industrial sectors.  In facilitating this program extensive outreach was conducted, targeting students including those underrepresented in science.  We also communicated research results to the broader public through institute videos, articles in the SFI Bulletin, SFI Update, and the Santa Fe Institute Annual Report, and other Institute publications  Alumni of the SFI REU program proceed to graduate school, to industry, and into academic research and teaching professions in large numbers. This program provides undergraduates with the opportunity to conduct scientific research in a collaborative environment, communicate that experience back to their home institutions and carry it into their future careers as 21st century scientists.  SFI's educational programs&mdash;including the NSF REU site program&mdash;feature residential fellowships, schools and informal education for students ranging from middle school through the postdoctoral level. Intrinsic to this program spectrum is related research into the appropriate content, pedagogy, and evaluation methods for complexity science and computational thinking education.
