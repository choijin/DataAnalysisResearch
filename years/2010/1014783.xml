<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the &lt;br/&gt;R/V Cape Hatteras, a 136-ft long research vessel owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by the Duke/UNC Oceanographic Consortium as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. Four items were submitted for review. In order of priority they were:&lt;br/&gt;1) HiSeasNet Installation&lt;br/&gt;2)   ROV&lt;br/&gt;3)   Ultra-cold Freezer&lt;br/&gt;4)   Mega Corer &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded the purchase of a Mega-core and ultra-cold freeze for the R/V CAPE HATTERAS in 2010.   The Mega-core adds  to R/V CAPE HATTERAS sediment sampling abilities.  With 12 core tubes, it allows for a larger replicate sampling scheme than any corer presently available.  More core tubes also allow for samples to be available for different disciplines and thus more information from one cast.  With Cape Hatteras becoming more active in the Gulf of Mexico, these sediment sampling instruments will likely see increased use.   The Mega Core takes 12 samples which are configured in a rectangle.  This multiple coring system takes samples with minimum disturbance to the sediment-water interface.   With the acquisition of the Mega-core, there is one additional multiple coring instrument available to the fleet.   The Mega-core will be used in a 2011 cruise in the Gulf of Mexico to study the effects of the 2011 floods of the Mississippi River.  These cores will allow scientists to study seabed erosion.  Sample preservation for biological uses (identification, analysis, comparison) has always been a concern on oceanographic cruises. A variety of methods are used, but the most common are chemical (formaldehyde, alcohol) or physical &ndash; freezing.  As added emphasis is being put on using DNA for identification (e.g. Barcode of Life), or isolating proteins for laboratory analyses, freezing samples below temperatures in commercial freezers (20oC) is becoming more important.  The freezer purchased is a 6.8 cubic foot, -85&deg;C unit which fits in the ships laboratory space.  The -85&deg;C freezer has been used for a cruise in 2011.  In particular to freeze specimen/tissue samples retrieved from the benthic layer of the Continental slope and shelf.
