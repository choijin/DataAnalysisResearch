<AbstractNarration>SES-1024271&lt;br/&gt;PI: Rebecca J. Erickson&lt;br/&gt;Institution: The University of Akron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: James M. Diefendorff&lt;br/&gt;Institution: The University of Akron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates identity and emotion management control theories to examine how the occupational context combines with self processes to affect individual and organizational outcomes. The researchers use a mixed methods design with a sample of registered nurses in seven acute care hospitals in the Midwestern United States. Data are collected through questionnaires, organizational records, audio recordings, and face-to-face interviews. By cross-validating the findings from the different data sources, the researchers will be able to empirically specify how social contexts, interactional events, and the emotions which emerge from them, are experienced and managed in ways that impact key dimensions of individual health. It will also provide insights into work unit-level effectiveness of nursing care provided within hospital settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;As demands for nursing care continue to increase, understanding determinants of nurse well-being, and how this relates to patient well-being, has become a growing concern for health care organizations. This project has the potential to translate theoretically-informed results into organizational policies and practices that promote the well-being of both patients and the nurses who care for them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nurses play a critical role in ensuring quality patient care. Yet, as an occupational group, they tend to have high levels of burnout that can have a negative impact on the quality of care they are able to provide for their patients. Thus, having a more complete understanding of the determinants of nurse well-being is important for health care organizations and the patients they serve.  Previous research on identity and emotion management has helped us to better understand stressors and strains experienced by nurses. In this study we employed a unique integration of identity and emotion management theories to further our understanding of how both processes relate to nurses' health perceptions and well-being. To this end, we conducted a large scale research project aimed at advancing theoretical and empirical knowledge of how structural and cultural aspects of a nurseÃ†s social context relate to identity verification, the experience and management of emotion, nurse behavior, and ultimately, the quality of patient care outcomes. We used a mixed methods design with a sample of full-time registered nurses (N = 762) working in nine acute care hospitals in the Midwestern United States.  Data were collected through written questionnaires, organizational records, audio diary recordings, and face-to-face interviews.  We briefly describe three key findings from the project. First, we found that identity discrepancies (i.e., difference between how one sees oneself and how one thinks others see oneself) with interactional partners who possess different levels of power are influenced by different resources (i.e., structural, interpersonal, intrapersonal) and that such discrepancies are negatively related to nurses' perceptions of their patient care quality.  Thus, nurse identity discrepancies from interactions with physicians, patients, other nurses, and support staff may stem, in part, from a specific pattern of available resources and these discrepancies, in turn, lead nurses to perceive that they are less effective on the job.   Second, we observed some gender differences in emotion management among nurses. Our findings indicate that male nurses not only manage their emotions less frequently than female nurses, but that they may also benefit from their emotion management in ways that women do not. More specifically, our results showed that gender moderates the relationship between emotional labor and occupational outcomes, such that male nurses have better outcomes when they engage in emotional labor whereas female nurses have worse outcomes when they engage in emotional labor.  These results suggest a potential status "bonus" for men such that they can actually benefit from having to perform emotion management on the job, something that has long been considered to be harmful to nurse well-being.   Third, initial results using these data suggest that at the level of the nursing unit, nurse emotion management and well-being were associated with independently collected patient satisfaction ratings (see doctoral dissertation by C. Moran).  For instance, patients were more satisfied on units in which nurses reported stronger unit-level rules for displaying enthusiasm and hiding negative emotions. Patients also reported greater satisfaction on units in which nurses were experiencing less burnout.  Thus, these results suggest that the unit-level emotional experiences of nurses relate to bottom-line patient satisfaction outcomes that are of substantive interest to nursing administrators, health care organizations, and the general public.   In sum, initial findings from this project advance our understanding of the role of identity and emotion management processes among nurses as well as how these key social psychological processes are linked to a range of antecedent conditions and substantive outcomes.  The results suggest that the interconnections between identity and emotion may have important applied implications for health care leaders and...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
