<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to create a "sounding board" to involve a broad spectrum of stakeholders drawn from across the university to oversee curriculum development and change efforts.  The hypothesis of this project is, in brief, that engaging a large number of peers who are invested in the curriculum will promote wider faculty adoption of effective teaching methods.  The PI will validate the idea of a sounding board by creating a test-bed for the course redesign process which integrates a variety of performance improvement processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will arise from the PI's investigations of the barriers to wider adoption of effective engineering pedagogies.  If successful, this project can increase buy-in to course redesign efforts and identify potential concerns of stakeholders to comprehensive curriculum reform.  The data obtained can inform the STEM community of potential barriers to broad adoption.  If the sounding board model is successful the idea is potentially transferable to other programs.</AbstractNarration>

The business plan became an NSF poster at the 2014 American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) conference.  FROM FOCUS GROUPS TO VENUES FOR COLLABORATION  The E2R2P team obtained a 1-year, no cost extension to continue exploring outreach opportunities that would build sustainable venues for academics, industry, and government partnerships.  Treasure Valley Manufacturing Innovation Roundtable  Representatives from Boise State's department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, the Division of Research and Economic Development, the TECenter, and the Venture College (business  incubators) met with regional manufacturers. After exploring strengths and weaknesses of regional manufacturing efforts, they explored potential  responses in the following areas:   Integrate with other state universities to provide improved access to resources for start-ups and entrepreneurs, improve collaboration between State universities and manufacturing associations, provide resources for QA/QC testing, and create shared maker space and a virtual manufacturing capability. Foster more realistic senior design projects that align with industry expectations for freshout engineers.  Build more internship, apprenticeship, and co-op opportunities for every major.   Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering (MBE) Internships  Responding to an action item arising from the Manufacturing Innovation Roundtable, Boise State's MBE department has been forming strategic partnerships with local industry to stand up internships. These efforts have established internship agreements with Micron, Hewlett Packard, Plexus, DC Engineering, Boeing, Rekluse, PKG User Interface Solutions, The Core...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
