<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to use gravitational microlensing in lensed quasars to measure the sizes of innermost quasar emission regions. The main goals will be to (1) accurately measure the scaling of accretion disk size with black hole mass; (2) determine the scaling of disk size with wavelength from the near-IR through the space UV; (3) determine the size of the non-thermal X-ray emitting regions and their scaling with black hole mass; (4) routinely measure disk inclinations and orientations; and (5) measure the changes in disk structure with changes in luminosity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and a postdoc, public lectures, and middle school teacher training by the PI.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The structure of quasars, supermassive black holes a million to a billion times the mass of our Sun, growing by accreting gas through a surrounding disk, remains enigmatic.  While they are so luminous that the can be seen anywhere in the Universe, they are too small to be resolved into a ``picture'' with a telescope -- this makes it very challenging to understand their inner workings.  The structure and evolution of quasars also strongly affect the development and growth of their host galaxies, so their properties are also important to understanding the entire development of structure in our Universe.  Figure 1 (from Urry &amp; Padovani 1995 via Z. Ivezic)  shows a cartoon of a quasar, its surrounding accretion disk, a jet of ejected material seen in some systems, and nearby clouds that are responsible for producing the broad and narrow emission lines from atoms excited by the ultraviolet radiation from the accretion disk.  The intellectual merits of the investigation were (1) to further develop and apply the method of gravitational microlensing to measure the size and structure of quasar emission regions, and (2) to advance methods for analyzing and interpreting the variability of quasars.  In particular, we clearly see that the hotter parts of accretion disks are more compact, with a temperature structure that is broadly compatible with simple models.  The absolute sizes of the disks are larger than predicted, and this remains a mystery even though we later confirmed the microlensing results using the methods we developed to better understand quasar variability.  The X-ray emission of quasars appears to closely track the inner edge of the accretion disk, very close to the black hole, which rules out some theories for its origin. We developed quantitative statistical models for quasar variability and applied them to understanding quasar structure, both that of the accretion disk and the so-called broad line clouds. We have started using these methods to classify variable stars and to better understand the stars the Kepler satellite is searching for new planets.  The broader impacts covered a range of areas. First, it contributed significantly to more closely unifying two sub-fields of astronomy while working with and training a large number of graduate students (12) and post-doctoral researchers (10) at twelve institutions both in the United States and in Europe.  Second, this project and other projects of the PI contributed to educating and developing the public's interest in science through public talks and press releases. Third, the statistical methods developed for analyzing time series data may have significant application outside the field of astronomy.
