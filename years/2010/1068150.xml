<AbstractNarration>In this project, the University of Mary Washington (UMW) is completing a series of initiatives to recruit and retain STEM majors, particularly students who are members of groups that are traditionally under-represented in the STEM disciplines.  The suite of activities in this Type 1A project provides pathways to success in the STEM disciplines by  (1) enhancing an existing summer bridge program with a revised pre-calculus course and a new interdisciplinary science research course to better prepare students for STEM disciplines,  (2) adding new undergraduate research experiences, particularly for first and second year students, including peer mentoring by upper-level STEM majors and early-engagement training for faculty through workshops,  (3) creating a new STEM outreach program for high school students that provides opportunities to engage in research and other activities with faculty and undergraduate student research teams,  (4) creating a STEM learning community by implementing a supplemental instruction program,  (5) establishing a STEM diversity scholarship program to attract qualified, culturally diverse students to UMW, and  (6) creating a new STEM colloquium for faculty and students to share their research with a larger STEM community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A goal of the STEREPS project is that the University of Mary Washington will graduate an additional 20 STEM majors per year by years 3-5 of the project, with approximately 5 of these STEM majors from under-represented groups each year.  The project provides an environment for improved collaboration and dissemination across the STEM disciplines at UMW, an increase in the number and diversity of STEM graduates entering the region's STEM workforce, and the dissemination of scientific and pedagogical results at regional and national conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The STEM Talent Expansion through Research, Engagement, Preparation and Scholarships (STEREPS) project proposed distinct activities to promote diversity and STEM education at the University of Mary Washington. The principal goals of the project were two-fold: to increase the total number of STEM graduates at UMW by an average of 12% per year or 60 total STEM graduates during years 3-5, and to increase the number of culturally diverse STEM majors by 20% per year beginning in year 3 of the award.&nbsp; Toward these goals, the STEREPS projects&rsquo; interrelated activities were designed to recruit, engage, support, and retain STEM majors, particularly among underrepresented groups. Underrepresented students entering UMW were supported through a summer bridge course designed to expose students to basic laboratory and scientific practices to promote success in STEM courses; 42% of students who completed this course graduated or on track to graduate with a STEM degree. Scholarships ($1000-2000, annually) were awarded to 18 students to recruit and encourage retention in a STEM major; 12 recipients have graduated, or are on track to graduate with a STEM degree. The Peer-Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) Supplemental Instruction initiative has established a culture of participation and engagement in the chemistry department and students in the introductory chemistry courses who participated at least 4 times in the PASS program increased their final grade in the course by at least 5% (figure 1). This initiative has also increased networking on campus; the PASS program is a collaboration between STEM faculty and the College of Education faculty. In addition, students serving as PASS leaders often became motivated to explore careers in STEM education, which they had not previously considered. The Summer Science Outreach Institute increased awareness of UMW among local high school students; many participants had not realized the STEM opportunities at the university prior to their summer research experience.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The combination of these initiatives contributed to an increase in the overall number of STEM graduates at UMW and an increase in the number of underrepresented STEM graduates. &nbsp;Over the course of the grant period, the total number of STEM graduates increased by an average of 22 per year with the largest increases observed in the disciplines of Computer Science and Earth and Environmental Sciences (table 1).&nbsp; Diversity has also increased among our STEM graduates and current majors; over the final three years of the grant, the number of STEM graduates from underrepresented groups increased by an average of 37% per year (figure 2), and the number currently completing a STEM major has similarly increased (figure 3); these increases exceeded our goals. &nbsp;The results of the STEREPS initiatives have been presented at several professional conferences; such dissemination will allow other institutions of higher education to enhance their STEM programs and enrichment opportunities for STEM students.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Kelli&nbsp;M&nbsp;Slunt</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1068150/1068150_10114916_1506696881960_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1068150/1068150_10114916_1506696881960_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2: The number of UMW STEM graduates from traditionally underrepresented groups from 2011-2016."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1068150/1068150_10114916_1506696881960_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2: The number of UMW STEM graduates from traditionally underrepresented groups from 2011-2016."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The number of UMW STEM graduates from traditionally underrepresented groups from 2011-2016.
