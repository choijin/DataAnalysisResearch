<AbstractNarration>This project will continue work on the development of methods for the asymmetric synthesis of amine-containing compounds.  Many of the proposed methods rely on tert-butanesulfinamide, which serves as a chiral amine reagent for some transformations and as a key chiral element embedded in organocatalysts for other transformations. Rhodium-based asymmetric catalysts will also be utilized to develop practical methods for the enantioselective catalytic synthesis of alpha-branched amines.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Jonathan A. Ellman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley.  Professor Ellman's research efforts are centered on the development of practical and efficient methods for the asymmetric synthesis of amines because a very high percentage of drugs, biopharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals incorporate chiral amines.  Based upon the very real impact of prior efforts from his laboratory, the successful development of the proposed methodology will contribute to the discovery and production of new products with societal benefits by the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and agrochemical industries.</AbstractNarration>
