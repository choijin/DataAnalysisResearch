<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the development of manufacturing methods of mixed ionic-electronic conducting thin film cathodes for intermediate temperature (IT) solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) based on novel additive deposition and patterning techniques.  The major advantage of the proposed method is that variable and precisely-controllable cathode material composition and morphology can be rapidly produced and studied.  In particular, the researchers will attempt to produce La1-xSrxFe1-yCoyO3 (LSCF) cathodes with various composition (stoichiometry) and morphologies by magnetron sputtering with multiple targets.   This enables systematic study of electrochemical activities of LSCF based cathode surfaces and interfaces by a variety of in situ and ex situ methods such as Raman spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).  Hence it allows the selection of an optimal LSCF thin film cathode for IT SOFC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to a low-cost and rapid manufacturing method for high performance IT SOFCs, which can generate electricity from a variety of fuels, such as hydrogen, methane, or carbon monoxide in an efficient and environmental friendly fashion.  The proposed research can potentially transform the current manufacturing practice of SOFCs and accelerate its commercialization process.  The multi-faceted research program involves tasks in advanced manufacturing, materials characterization, electrochemical and mechanical testing and modeling.  It provides an ideal setting for both materials science and mechanical engineering students to actively participate in project-based and hands-on research and learning. A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Central Florida and the University of South Carolina will have the opportunity to participate in various integrated team research and educational activities afforded by this program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In collaboration with University of Central Florida (UCF), the University of South Carolina (USC) part of the project focused on the characterization of ruggedized mltilayered 10mol%Sc2O3-1mol%CeO2-doped ZrO2 (ScSZ) electrolytes.  ScSZ is a solid state oxygen ion conducting material shows much higher ionic conducitivity than tradtional Yttria stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) at intermediate temperature.  It has great potential for application is solid oxide fuel cell, a clean energy generation technology.  Unfortunately, ScSZ is not as strong and stable as YSZ when in contact with electrode of solid oxide fuel cells.  This limited its application in solid oxide fuel cells.  To address the problem, the research team developed a multilayer electrolyte which included YSZ skin layers on the ScSZ core. UCF led the manufactuirng and mechanical testing efforts, USC led the electrochemical characterization studies. The laminate showed high mechanical robustness, which is attritubed to the beneficial compressive stress in the YSZ skins.  USC work indicated an interesting stress-enhanced ionic conductivity phenomena in the layered electrolyte.  Interestingly, this synergiestic effect was also found to be related to the compressive stress induced in the YSZ skin layers. When the compressive skin layer stress was altered, the conductivity enhancement effect dissappeared. The findings from project can lead to high performance electrolytes for intermediate temperature SOFC with both high conductivity and high strength.
