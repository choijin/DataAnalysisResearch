<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to develop an integrated instrument for the fabrication and characterization of plasmonic nanostructures and nanodevices. The approach combines a scanning electron microscope with imaging, localized etching and deposition, and lithography capabilities, with optical spectroscopies, cathodoluminescence, and electrical characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed platform integrates structural, optical, and electrical characterization to a level substantially above any current commercial or custom-built system. This system will allow the development of active plasmon-based structures and devices, with direct fabrication and characterization. The developmental challenge in this project is the integration of the variety of techniques into one platform and the leveraging of this combined capability to achieve new strategies for developing active plasmonic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of this platform will greatly enhance current experimental capabilities in plasmonics, nanoscale photonics and optoelectronics, advancing our understanding of the physical principles upon which their behavior is based. This will enable new applications of plasmonic systems currently limited by joint challenges in the fabrication and characterization of active plasmonic nanostructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rice currently supports an IGERT program in Nanophotonics, a professional master?s program in Nanoscale Physics and an undergraduate REU program ?Conjunto? aimed at underrepresented minority students. The availability of the proposed instrument would provide an unmatched opportunity for all students to participate in research in nanophotonics. The cathodoluminescence capability is not available even as a standalone instrument in the Houston area. This experimental system will be welcomed by the growing nanophotonics research community in southeast Texas.</AbstractNarration>
