<AbstractNarration>Water distribution systems are complex engineered systems in which biological and chemical reactions occur within a physical network of pipes, pumps, and tanks.  Because safe drinking water is critical to maintaining public health and national security, engineering students need to understand the dynamics of water distribution systems. This project is developing and testing modules and kits for a Water Distribution System Analysis Lab. These kits and modules are being developed to increase students' understanding by providing systematic information and interdisciplinary concepts associated with the biological, chemical, and hydraulic dynamics in water distribution systems. This lab introduces students to real world problems by adapting and implementing problem-based learning modules with real-life context and by applying computational techniques to hydraulics and water quality simulations. These kits and modules are being designed for use from pre-college through graduate programs, as well as by organizations such as Engineers without Borders.</AbstractNarration>

However, in spite of the increased complexities and public health risks due to aged water distribution systems (e.g. the water crisis of Flint, Michigan), the fluid mechanics and hydraulics courses that are being taught to engineering students (civil, chemical, and environmental engineering students) only focus on the physical properties and dynamics of fluids. Furthermore, there is also a lack of commercially-available educational materials that address both the theory and application of integrated water distribution system dynamics. Currently, there are significant needs for engineering students to understand physical, chemical, and biological dynamics in water distribution systems, so that the current demand for generating a trained work force and maintaining our aged water infrastructure can be met.</p> <p>This project team aimed to address the current needs in educating undergraduate students in water distribution systems, providing five function adaptable water distribution system analysis lab (WDSAL) modules and kits, where developed WDSAL modules and kits from this project employ an integrated approach to address biological, chemical, and hydraulic dynamics in water distribution systems.</p> <p>The outcomes of this project provide hands-on laboratory and modeling experiences related to hydraulics, water chemistry (disinfectant reactions), and microbiology (bacteria disinfection) to undergraduate students, providing interdisciplinary lab experiences related to real-life engineering projects. Also, students have opportunities to generate and interpret multiple information sources from lab exercises with the kits and to utilize them in model building and calibration of real water distribution systems.</p> <p>During the entire project period, over 460 students at four different institutions (University of Toledo, University of Dayton, University of Cincinnati, and Mount Union) had opportunities to use the lab modules and kits, and learn dynamics in water distribution systems. &nbsp;</p> <p>Overall, the participating students from the four institutions showed improved learning with positive responses to the developed lab modules and kits (e.g. increased understanding on subjects and relevant real world problems &amp;
