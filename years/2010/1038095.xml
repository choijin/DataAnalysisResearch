<AbstractNarration>The international workshop, "Cellular Decision Making", co-sponsored by NSF/USA, EPSRC/UK, and CIFAR/Canada to be held in Arlington, VA on April 19-21, 2010 will discuss state-of-the-art techniques for both the measurement and modeling of cellular decision processes and the challenges that lie ahead. Progress in these areas will provide a predictive foundation for how complex living systems operate. It will bring together the leading experts from the biological and physical sciences to present and discuss research in the following four key areas that address the following fundamental areas. 1. Cellular decision processes studied at the single cell level in real time. 2. Reducing biological decision-making machinery to simpler modules.3. Quantitatively modeling biological decision processes. 4. Role of stochasticity within biological processes. The meeting is sponsored by the Physics and the Molecular Cell Biology Divisions at NSF.</AbstractNarration>
