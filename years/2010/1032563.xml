<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research award will explore language differences on the engineering concept inventory for engineering statics.  The Concept Assessment Tool for Statics (CATS) is an instrument developed to identify students? conceptual understanding of statics concepts. In pilot tests at University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez, results demonstrated very low performance (28%) of students on CATS as compared with national standards which ranged between 30% - 70%. Because this test is in English, which is not the first language of most University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez students, the researcher proposes to test the efficacy of CATS with bilingual students. To accomplish this goal the study will be guided by the following research question: Do mechanical and civil senior engineering students? from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez exhibit language difficulties with CATS? A mixed methods design is proposed in which data will be collected using quantitative (questionnaires and/or closed-ended questions) and qualitative (open-ended questions using focus groups) instruments. Similarly, data will be analyzed following quantitative analyses, but also applying open coding techniques for qualitative purposes. The expected results of this study will be the development of a beta version of CATS, in Spanish, to be tested further for validity and reliability. This project advances knowledge and explores creativity because it will be the first time that: (1) 100% of the sample of an engineering concept research study will consist of bilingual students; (2) an engineering concept inventory is developed in Spanish; (3) such a study measures language differences on engineering concept inventories. The results of the work are expected to enhance student learning of difficult concepts in statics, and particularly to improve the success of Hispanic students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  CATS is one of the most robust concept inventories developed in engineering.  Since its development, it has been validated using multiple statistical analyses.  This project allowed us for the first time to test a concept inventory for validity in a targeted population.  Students at UPRM are very unique since they are bilingual students, and Spanish is their primary language.  The protocol established includes an incorporation of qualitative research methods such as think-aloud and linguistic analysis.  This methodology could be applied to other concept inventories or instruments that are used to measure conceptual understanding, such as pre and post-tests, course examinations, etc.  Our findings indicate that conceptual errors committed by our students are very similar to those identified by the developers of CATS, but the graphical representation generated by students were different. Therefore, the distractors (wrong answers in the multiple choice questions) might not be effective with our student population.  Due to sample size limitations, we did not found statistical difference in item performance between participants who responded the CATS (English version) and the CATS-S (Spanish version). We have the CATS-S available for faculty to use at UPRM and expect to continue performing statistical analyses from CTT, IRT and cognitive assessment.  Since the quantitative approach was not successful, a linguistic analysis was conducted and revealed that common errors students made were not due to language limitations (remember these are Hispanic students) but to conceptual errors (misconceptions).  Several publications have resulted directly or indirectly from this project throughout the awarded period.  They include:  Mazak, C.M., Font, C.B., Santiago-Rom&aacute;n, A.I., "Effects of Language on CATS Performance", proceedings ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition. Indianapolis, IN, 2014.
