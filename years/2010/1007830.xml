<AbstractNarration>Healey&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1007830&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The principal investigator and his colleagues study several&lt;br/&gt;second-gradient problems of nonlinear elasticity, with&lt;br/&gt;applications to multi-phase structures and solids -- especially&lt;br/&gt;lipid bilayer vesicles, shape-memory alloys and thin structures. &lt;br/&gt;A common thread running through these problems is the following&lt;br/&gt;mathematical structure: a non-convex potential energy in the&lt;br/&gt;first-gradient term and an additive second-gradient&lt;br/&gt;regularization, often characterized by a small positive&lt;br/&gt;parameter.  The main goals of this work are: (1) to provide&lt;br/&gt;classes of rational models -- particularly in the case of&lt;br/&gt;two-phase lipid bilayer vesicles -- for understanding the often&lt;br/&gt;exotic behavior of such structures under loadings; (2) to&lt;br/&gt;systematically find their equilibria corresponding to local&lt;br/&gt;minima of the total potential energy (meta-stable solutions); (3)&lt;br/&gt;to obtain the existence of global energy minima as weak&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium solutions of those models and study their structure&lt;br/&gt;in the asymptotic limit as the small parameter approaches zero. &lt;br/&gt;Goals (2) and (3) are inextricably linked to (1).  We employ&lt;br/&gt;rational continuum models, characterized by general constitutive&lt;br/&gt;functions, and study thresholds of bifurcation and the structure&lt;br/&gt;of global energy minimizers to compare with experiment.  The&lt;br/&gt;proposed work is highly interdisciplinary, requiring tools and&lt;br/&gt;perspectives from several fields, e.g., nonlinear analysis and&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations, bifurcation theory, calculus of&lt;br/&gt;variations, nonlinear continuum mechanics, computational methods,&lt;br/&gt;symmetry ideas, biophysics, and materials science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project focuses on fundamental modeling and predictive&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis for the quantitative characterization of&lt;br/&gt;shape and deformation patterns of certain micron-scale structures&lt;br/&gt;under applied loading, namely, lipid-bilayer membrane vesicles,&lt;br/&gt;shape-memory alloys, and thin films.  Each of these has direct&lt;br/&gt;and important connections to basic science and technology -- in&lt;br/&gt;particular, to problems associated with bio-molecular structures&lt;br/&gt;and advanced materials.  For example, lipid-bilayer membranes are&lt;br/&gt;ubiquitous in bio-molecular systems; understanding and predicting&lt;br/&gt;their mechanical behavior is crucial for understanding cell&lt;br/&gt;function.  The project focuses on understanding the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;pure, man-made membranes or liposomes under changes in osmotic&lt;br/&gt;pressure, temperature, or composition.  The future promise of&lt;br/&gt;liposome vesicles (closed membranes) as vehicles for drug&lt;br/&gt;delivery demands a fundamental understanding of their multi-phase&lt;br/&gt;mechanical behavior under loading.  Likewise for phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions in shape-memory alloys and wrinkling of thin films --&lt;br/&gt;a fundamental understanding and mathematical prediction of their&lt;br/&gt;behavior are important for characterizing the mechanical&lt;br/&gt;properties of novel materials and for potential sensing and&lt;br/&gt;actuation at the micron scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Mechanical experiments on real structures and materials typically begin with a nominally homogeneous or perfect specimen that progressively exhibits complex patterns or microstructure under steady, quasi-static changes in loading.  In particular, the identification and measurement of such thresholds of instability - going from the perfect homogeneous state to the more exotic state -  is a key component of most experiments.  In this project we build and analyze rational mathematical models for extremely thin structures to predict their mechanical response (deformation, force, stress, energy, etc.) under loadings.  In particular, this project is focused on the study of finely thin elastic sheets, thin rods, two-phase biomembranes and shape-memory solids. The main goals are: (i) to provide classes of rational mechanical models for understanding the often exotic behavior of such structures. (ii) to systematically determine - via analysis and computation - stable configurations as loading and other parameters (temperature, thickness, etc.) vary. (iii) to identify/predict new phenomena.     We now describe a sampling of the important results:  1. Wrinkling of highly stretched films [1] (see below for publications):  We consider the wrinkling of a stretched, finely thin rectangular sheet. A schematic diagram of the problem is depicted in Figure 1 in publication [1]. The left side of the thin film is totally clamped while a pure horizontal displacement in the amount of "&epsilon;L" is imposed on the right side. We refer to &epsilon; as the macroscopic strain. This problem has previously attracted the attention of several investigators in recent years, nearly all of whom employ classical model - the F&ouml;ppl-von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n theory (F-K).  We propose and analyze a new model.  A typical sampling of our results are depicted in Figures 3-16 in [1].  We conclude:  (a) For a given fine thickness, only a certain range of aspect ratios admit stable wrinkling; for a given initial length (in the highly stretched direction), wrinkling does not occur if the width is too large or too small.  In contrast, the F-K model erroneously predicts wrinkling in those very same regimes for sufficiently large applied macroscopic strain.  (b) When stable wrinkling occurs, the wrinkling amplitude first grows, reaches a maximum and then disappears again as the applied macroscopic strain is increased; the wrinkling pattern is unchanged during its evolution &ndash; only the amplitude changes.  In contrast, the F-K model predicts an ever increasing wrinkling amplitude as the macroscopic strain is increased.   2. Behavior or hemitropic (chiral) rods [2]: We consider the response of long, straight, thin objects with intrisic helicity or handedness, e.g., DNA molecules, subected to end thrust as depicted in Figures 2 and 3 of [2]. If the thrust is large enough, the fiber "buckles" out of straightness. We propose a new model, and our results reveal new phenomena: If the loaded hemitropic rod is fixed to rotation on one end while unconstrained on the other (fixed-free, cf. Figure 2 in [2]), then the post-critical configuration is characterized by a planar centerline accompanied by twist.  On the other hand when both ends are restrained against rotation (fixed-fixed, cf. Figure 3 in [2]), the post-buckling configuration is helical (non-planar), as illustrated in Figure 5 in [2].    3. Phase-tip splitting in twinned states of simple two-phase solids [3]:   We consider a simple model for twinning of shape memory alloys in  anti-plane shear.  Here a long solid of rectangular cross-section is  subjected to hard anti-plane shear loading on the boundary, always  admitting the trivial homogenous state.  A sampling of our results are depicted in Figures 3-12 in [3].  In all cases, we find stable "striped" twinned phases; for small (or zero) loading, we see splitting of phase stripes at the tips near the frustrated boundaries.  4.
