<AbstractNarration>Technical: Carbon-based nanomaterials, including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and graphene, have attracted significant interest in the scientific research community due to their superlative electronic, thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties. While impressive performance has been achieved on selected samples, large-scale technological development has been hindered by the structural inhomogeneity of as-synthesized carbon-based nanomaterials. In an effort to overcome this polydispersity problem, a technique called density gradient ultracentrifugation is employed to sort carbon-based nanomaterials by their physical and electronic structure. This project seeks to resolve the outstanding issues surrounding the preparation, characterization, and application of monodisperse carbon-based nanomaterials. Specific research objectives include: (1) Tuning co-surfactant ratio and loading to achieve monodisperse small diameter (&lt; 1 nm) SWNTs due to their spectral advantages for near-infrared optoelectronic applications. (2) Demonstrating diameter and electronic type sorting of DWNTs in an effort to elucidate exciton energy transfer between concentric carbon nanotube shells. (3) Quantifying structure-density relationship for surfactant dispersed graphene as a function of surfactant type, co-surfactant ratio, density gradient, and pH. (4) Employing monodisperse carbon-based nanomaterials in electronic device and materials applications such as transistors, optoelectronics, transparent conductors, and sensors.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. It is anticipated that this research will lead to substantial intellectual property and commercialization opportunities. Furthermore, an important component of the project is an education and outreach plan that is well integrated with the aforementioned research objectives including: (1) Undergraduate curriculum development through a revision and updating of an interdisciplinary course entitled Nanomaterials. (2)  Hands-on, inquiry and design-based curriculum development for pre-college students in collaboration with the Materials World Modules program. (3) Engaging students and the general public about science and science policy via the Northwestern University Science Policy Action Network.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: This grant has explored several issues surrounding the preparation, characterization, and application of monodisperse carbon-based nanomaterials (e.g., single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs), and graphene).  In addition, the knowledge gained from carbon-based nanomaterials was applied to the study of monodisperse post-graphene two-dimensional nanomaterials (e.g., transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus).  Specific research accomplishments include:  (1)   Orthogonal iterative density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU) has enabled nearly single-chirality and enatiomerically pure SWCNTs to be isolated.  (2)   DWCNTs have been sorted by outer shell electronic type using DGU. Photoluminescence spectroscopy has been used to show that photoluminescence quenching occurs for the inner shell in DWCNTs independent of the electronic type of the outer shell.  (3)   High-concentration aqueous dispersions of graphene have been achieved using nonionic, biocompatible block copolymers (e.g., Pluronics and Tetronics).  The nonionic character of these dispersants eliminates issues affiliated with ionic small molecule surfactants in electronic and electrochemical devices (e.g., transistors and batteries).  (4)   Pluronic encapsulated SWCNTs have been sorted by electronic type using pH-shifted DGU.  The enhanced buoyant density difference between metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs leads to substantial improvements in the purity and scalability of DGU.  (5)   DGU-sorted semiconducting SWCNTs have enabled significant enhancements of the performance of thin-film transistors including world record setting operating frequencies, mobilities, transconductances, and on/off ratios.  (6)   DGU-sorted DWCNTs have enabled improved performance for field-effect chemical sensors.  In particular, the outer shell can serve as a sacrificial layer for covalent chemical modification while the inner shell remains intact for charge transport.  (7)   By tuning threshold voltage in p-type and n-type semiconducting SWCNT thin-film transistors, subnanowatt complementary logic has been realized with full rail-to-rail voltage swing, thus enabling logic gate cascading and higher levels of integration.  (8)   DGU-sorted SWCNTs have been incorporated into optoelectronic devices including broadband photodetectors and optically triggered photoactuators and motors.  By tailoring SWCNT diameter, the spectral response of these devices can be controlled.  (9)   DGU sorting has been extended to metallic nanoparticles and TMDs. In particular, the use of block copolymer dispersants increases the hydration layer thickness, thus reducing the buoyant density of these materials into the range of aqueous density gradients.  (10)     Through several academic, national laboratory, industrial, and international collaborations, DGU-sorted nanomaterials have been employed in a variety of fundamental studies and devices including exciton dynamics, ballistic charge injection, high pressure spectroscopy, composites, and light-emitting diodes.     Broader Impacts: The research accomplishments of this grant have been disseminated widely and significantly impacted a variety of education and outreach activities including:   (1)   Graduate student training: This grant provided partial to full support of 6 PhD students in Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University.  (2)   Undergraduate student training: 10 undergraduate researchers, including 4 under-represented minority and 5 female students, have been affiliated with this grant via Research Experience for Undergraduates Programs.  (3)   Industrial outreach: Technology transfer has occurred to NanoIntegris, Raymor Industries, Optomec, and IBM T. J. Watson Research Center including five joint publications.  NanoIntegris was co-founded by PI Mark Hersam and has licensed multiple DGU patents on sorting carbon nanomaterials.  NanoIntegris was acquired by Raym...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
