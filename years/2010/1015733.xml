My research focused on the interaction between economic development, desertification, and environmental migration in Northwestern China.

In addition, I interviewed local officials and village level cadres to understand the role played the Chinese state in facilitating migration and economic development in the region. During these two months, I analyzed quantitative data on migration pattern in Northwestern China gathered in 2009. I also gathered 891 copies of government policy from the provincial and prefecture records office. The years of these records spanned from 1951 to 2009 with the majority centered on the last decade.

Even though I had visited NW China many times in the past, I never had the opportunity to actually blend in as the rhythm of daily life in northern Shaanxi and Xi&rsquo;an.

The Chinese state intervention to alleviate severe regional disparity is to direct most of its investment spending to the region and encourage FDI by providing tax breaks. Northern Shaanxi clearly follows this pattern.
