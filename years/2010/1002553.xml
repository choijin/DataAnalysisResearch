<AbstractNarration>This award supports airfare travel expenses for U.S. participants in the "Fourth International Conference on Recent Advances in Applied Dynamical Systems," held at the Zhejiang Normal University in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, China, on 16-20 June 2010.  The conference centers on recent research in applied dynamical systems and bifurcation theory, with emphasis on complex systems and stochastic models.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting features invited lectures by leading researchers.  Abstracts of the conference talks, as well as presentation slides, will be posted on the conference web site.  The meeting includes a round table discussion on open problems and directions for future research, a report from which will be published in the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Dynamical Systems Magazine (DSWeb;  http://www.dynamicalsystems.org/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference brings together experts and junior researchers in applied and random dynamical systems and bifurcation theory, and it serves as a venue for developing communication and establishing collaborative research among research groups from the U.S., China, Japan, and other countries.  Priority for travel funds is given to graduate students, postdocs, junior mathematicians, women and minorities, and researchers without other sources of support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://jxshix.people.wm.edu/2010jinhua/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Title: Conference on Bifurcation Theory and Applications of Dynamical Systems  Principal Investigator: Todd Young, Mathematics Department, Ohio University   This grant gave support to U.S. participants for travel to: The Fourth International Conference on Recent Advances in Applied Dynamical Systems,  June 16-20, 2010, at Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, China.  The grant provided travel support only, reimbursing airfare for flights on U.S. carriers.  Local financial support for all US participants was provided by: The Center for Dynamical Systems and Nonlinear Studies  and the School of Mathematics and Physics, Zhejiang Normal University.   Significance of the conference: For many years dynamical systems and bifurcation theory have been at the forefront of scientific progress in a number of applied fields that are traditionally closely allied with mathematics such as nonlinear phenomenon in physics, population biology and electronic and telecommunication systems. In recent years the importance of applications of dynamical systems theory has become apparent in an increasing number of new areas, such as environmental fluid dynamics, geophysical flows, climate dynamics,  and genetic, neural and other biological networks. On the other hand, these areas of science and engineering are sources of interesting mathematical problems.  The research in these areas is essentially collaborative,  crossing the borders of countries and disciplines. In fact, rapid progress requires an organized collaborative effort like this workshop. It will serve as a venue for developing communication and establishing collaborative research among research groups from U.S., China, and other countries. The fields of dynamical systems, bifurcation theory, and their applications have been closely allied. The associated research, ranging from pure to applied, is extremely rich with many active groups in the U.S., China,  and other countries. Continuation of the broadening of applications considered by these groups and incorporation of dynamical systems tools into these fields is important to their continued contribution to scientific progress. This workshop will further advance these developments throughout the region, while training U. S. junior mathematicians and students for international collaborative research.  The Workshop showed interesting new developments in dynamical systems and their application in engineering and science to the public. Several presentations were about modeling and simulating dynamical systems in engineering and science. They have demonstrate how new development in mathematics may bring solutions or insights to scientific and engineering problems.    Summary of accomplishments of the grant:  - A total of 20 US participants attended the Workshop, including 3 junior faculty members, and 5 PhD students.  - All but one of the US participants either spoke in the Workshop or presented their research as posters and they discussed their work with colleagues from China, Asia and Europe.   - The U.S. participants attended five days of talks in which they learned about new developments in dynamical systems theory and applications from leading researchers from around the world.  - The U.S. participants made new contacts for their research and are continuing these contacts via email and other means.
