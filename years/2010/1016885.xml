<AbstractNarration>Algorithmic game theory is a field that uses and extends tools from economics and game theory to reason about fundamental computer science problems and applications.  The PI will pursue a broad research agenda across three central subfields of algorithmic game theory. The first set of goals is to develop general analysis frameworks that can identify robust guarantees on the worst-case inefficiency of equilibria, and to consider measures of inefficiency other than the quality of a worst-case Nash equilibrium. The second set of goals concern developing novel worst-case analysis frameworks to inform the design of incentive-compatible auctions for revenue-maximization problems. The final goal is to apply computational complexity theory to explain rigorously certain barriers in economics and game theory, in particular in optimal mechanism design and in equilibrium computation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The goal of this research project was to develop new results in theoretical computer science that are useful for reasoning about fundamental economic problems.   For example, consider the problem of selling items in an auction --- such as collectables on eBay, wireless spectrum to telecommunication companies in a government auction, or sponsored links to advertisers through a search engine auction.  How can a seller determine the best outcome (either for the seller or for society) even when there is little data about bidders' preferences?  What about when the theoretically optimal auction is too complex for direct use?  Are there simple auctions that are guaranteed to be approximately optimal?   For another example, consider a network (traffic, communication, etc.) in which end users choose their own routes.  How does the performance of such "selfish routing" compare to the theoretical optimum?  What kind of behavioral assumptions are necessary to prove that selfish users attain outcomes that are close to optimal?   This research project developed theory to help answer all of these questions.   The research project also involved the mentoring of PhD students, innovation in graduate teaching, the dissemination of lecture videos and notes for graduate courses, the teaching of algorithmic fundamentals through massive online open courses, and the organization of both traditional and new meetings for the presentation and discussion of cutting-edge research.
