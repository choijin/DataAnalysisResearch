<AbstractNarration>According to a recent report from the National Academies, the underrepresentation of women is largely due to institutional barriers and unintentional but wide-spread biases. At Northern Illinois University (NIU), faculty demographics in STEM disciplines show many of the same characteristics as the national statistics: relatively low recruitment rates for women and high attrition rates. To that end, this IT Catalyst project will explore mechanisms for creating high-level mentorship opportunities and peer support programs, addressing two key concerns of STEM faculty: (1) achieving a balance among teaching, research, service, and personal responsibilities in midcareer, and (2) developing a sense of agency within the workplace&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research literature on barriers which restrict women?s entry into and advancement in STEM discipline forms the theoretical basis for this project. The goal of this proposal is to collect the data that will identify issues and barriers. Those data will then be used, in the longer term, to discern which interventions and programs will be effective in retaining female faculty in STEM fields within the institutional context. For the past several decades, research has been directed toward enhancing women?s and other minority groups? participation in STEM discipline academic careers at all levels. While the ?pipeline problem? has been cited as a major issue, a recent report from the National Academies argues that the pipeline is not among the contributing factors to women?s slower advancement in STEM disciplines. Instead, it is the culture, not the numbers of available women, which drives inequities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of this project are multi-fold.  They include impacts at the institutional level and beyond.  It is expected that the data, interventions, models, and tools can make a substantial contribution to the wider literature and serve as models for others to follow.  Additionally, it is expected that project outcomes will benefit all university faculty, including members of other groups underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.  Project findings will be communicated through the project web site, publications, and presentations at conferences, thus impacting the ADVANCE community, at large.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Northern Illinois University (NIU) is a Carnegie research-high activity university, located in DeKalb, Illinois, a community of 35,000, 65 miles west of Chicago. The university?s location provides many opportunities for dual career faculty couples and for collaboration with nearby industries and government laboratories. Two national laboratories, Argonne National Laboratory and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, are both within an hour?s drive from campus. Several STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) faculty members hold joint appointments from NIU and from a government laboratory.   Prior to 2008, NIU faculty demographics in STEM disciplines displayed many of the same characteristics as the national statistics: relatively low recruitment rates for women and high attrition rates. Following a preliminary review, the grant team explored the possibilities and mechanisms for creating mentorship opportunities and peer support programs, addressing two key concerns of our STEM faculty: (1) that of achieving a balance in midcareer among teaching, research, service, and personal responsibilities, and (2) that of developing a sense of agency or power within the workplace, and enabling faculty to advance through tenure and promotion processes that are not always fully transparent.  The award of the Advance IT Catalyst Grant allowed the researchers to gather data broken down by sex/gender, discipline (STEM/non-STEM), and other employment variables, such as time at rank.  A work?life survey was administered in 2010-11 to STEM and non-STEM faculty in two colleges.  121 faculty responding to the survey; key results follow.  Satisfaction: Respondents were generally satisfied with their current position, with a large proportion indicating departmental atmosphere was the factor that most contributed to satisfaction, and work?life balance was the factor that most detracted from satisfaction.  Hiring Process: A majority of the respondents reported being satisfied with the hiring process at NIU, and noted successful negotiations.  Key variables in the hiring process were the interaction with the search committee and the perception that faculty made an effort to meet with interviewees.  Teaching and Service Workload: There was a general perception among faculty that they were able to teach the courses they wanted and that teaching was assigned equitably.  However, self?reporting of workloads suggest that female faculty, especially in STEM, have an overall higher undergraduate teaching load. With regards to service, most participants serve on departmental level committees.   Research: The top five productivity indicators identified by respondents were: number of articles published in refereed academic/professional journals, prestige of publication outlets, number of monographs, number of presentations at national/international conferences, and number of book chapters. While most respondents believed their colleagues valued their research, a proportion of STEM faculty believed their colleagues did not value their research.  Networks and Mentoring: Less than a quarter of all respondents took part in a formal mentoring program, with STEM females reporting the least participation and the greatest sense of isolation within their departments.  Perceptions of Respect and Inclusivity: A majority of respondents believed they could voice their opinions openly within their department, but STEM females indicated that they tended not to be included in departmental informal networks. A majority of participants agreed with the statement that that their department chair treated them with respect.  The Tenure Process: A higher proportion of STEM faculty disagreed with that research, teaching, and service are given appropriate weight in promotion, tenure, and merit decisions. 100% of STEM female respondents were satisfied with the tenure and promotion process overall.  Work?Life Balance: A majority of respondents agreed that most faculty in their department were supportive of colleagues who want to balance their personal and career lives, but a higher proportion of female respondents suggested that personal responsibilities had slowed down their career progress.  Common themes across all focus groups included:  Requirements for full professor are vague Agency is dependent upon the department chair There is lack of clarity among how faculty are appointed to department committees Faculty do not experience mentoring within the department or college Informal processes play key roles in determining when faculty come up for promotion to full professor   Dominant themes from the individual interviews included informal mentoring, stop the tenure clock and FMLA leave policies, challenges in maintaining work-life balance, and the quality of research facilities.  Presentations to stakeholders and upper level administration reviewed the following recommendation and action steps.  Clearer guidelines for FMLA leave, extension of probationary period, and faculty work plans should exist.  Guidelines for promotion to full professor should be made clearer.  Departments should develop equitable and transparent practices for determining when an application for promotion to full professor can occur.  Increased formal/informal networking should be promoted for faculty career progress and increased mentorship. The institution should explore ways to promote work-life balance, seeking advice especially from department chairs. Committees within the institution should revise bylaws to require such practices.        Last Modified: 11/17/2013       Submitted by: Lesley S Rigg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
