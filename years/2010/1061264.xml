<AbstractNarration>The mid-ocean ridge in the Atlantic that separates North American and South America from Europe and Africa is one of the major tectonic plate boundaries on the planet.  Only recently has it become obvious that this ridge consists of segments of alternating symmetric and asymmetric spreading, both of which are characterized by different styles of seismicity.  A first order question in marine geology is: what causes these differences and do they primarily relate to differences in the mechanical or chemical properties of the crust and underlying mantle.  This research sheds new light on this question.  It involves an intensive field campaign to sample six adjacent mid-ocean ridge segments that alternate between symmetric and asymmetric spreading.  During the campaign, deep submergence tools to identify the presence of previously undiscovered hydrothermal vents will be deployed. Samples of rock and glass dredged from the seafloor will be examined petrographically for mineral associations and to select samples for geochemical analysis.  Selected samples will be analyzed for major and trace elements, volatiles, and Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopes.  Melt inclusions will also be examined.  These data will be used to determine whether magmatic differences that can be related to deeper mantle composition or behavior are the cause of the different types of spreading.  Broader impacts of the work include strong integration of research and education.  It will result in the development of a course on mid-ocean ridge science for undergraduates that includes analytical laboratory and seagoing field components, with course materials being posted on the web for dissemination.  It will also directly train over 10 undergraduates, two graduate students, and two early career researchers.  Samples and data collected will be made immediately available to the public and resulting geochemical analyses will be posted on a publicly accessible website.  The project also involves a strong component of collaboration with French scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) runs like a spine down the center of the Atlantic Ocean and is the site where the entire Atlantic ocean crust has been formed over the last 200 million years. The classic model of plate tectonics explains the creation of the ocean floor at  ridges like the MAR as a continuous conveyor belt where ocean crust spreads evenly from the individual segments along the ridge axis towards the east and west as the crust gradually increases with age.  As our mapping of the ocean ridge has become increasingly high in resolution, however, it has been realized that both of these ideas do not apply to large portions of the MAR. Instead of being a symmetrical conveyor belt, the ridge can spread by having a large fault form near the ridge axis, as one of the plates slides up and slips to the side creating a huge asymmetric mountain on one side of the ridge axis.  Why do these complexities exist, and what controls whether the ridge operates in an organized and symmetric fashion, or a sinuous and asymmetric fashion?  To address these questions we carried out an intensive sampling cruise to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the Kane and Atlantis fracture zones, a distance of about 700km.  In this region we were able to sample both symmetric and asymmetric segments, with the aim of seeing whether the chemical compositions of the erupted basalts were different in the two types of segments, and if they were, what insights they could provide on what controlled the diverse behavior of the ridge. There was a bonus question that could also be addressed in this region.  A controversy has existed in our understanding of what controls the overall depth of ocean ridges. At Iceland, the ridge is above sea level. In other regions, it is 5000m below sea level.  One school of thought is that these variations are a response to the temperature of the mantle below the crust. The other is that the variations reflect differences in mantle composition. The MAR in our study area varies in depth by more than a thousand meters, so provides a small scale experiment that can be used to test these two hypotheses.   The cruise was very successful and recovered samples from 170 locations.  We combined these samples with samples from other cruises to have 330 total sample locations, an unprecedented density for this length of a slow-spreading ridge.  We carried out complete major and trace element analyses of all samples we could obtain for which there was not published data, and selected a subset of samples for analysis of Sr, Nd, Pb, Hf and noble gas isotopes.  This data set is unique and unprecedented in its completeness and extent.   We found that symmetric and asymmetric segments can be clearly distinguished in terms of their chemical compositions, and that these differences throw light on what causes segments to be symmetric or asymmetric. By identifying these differences, we were then able to explore published data from other segments from the ocean ridge system and found that the same chemical distinctions in our area apply globally.  Asymmetric segments are formed by smaller extents of melting, and also have magma chambers that crystallize at higher pressures.  The smaller budget of magma and its presence deeper in the crust facilitate the faulting that characterizes these segments.  This behavior is enhanced when the segment is oblique to the spreading direction.  The small amount of magma then does not lead to efficient diking, which can make the segments sinuous and disorganized.   The data also can be used to test the hypotheses for what controls the overall depth of the ridge. We found that the chemical differences between symmetric and asymmetric segments had been obscuring some of the chemical tests of these hypotheses.  With the new understanding of the differential behavior of these two types of segments, we were able to obtain a much cleaner geochemical signal. The ridge depth varies smoothly in this region, increasing from north to south. While there are subtle and interesting variations in mantle composition along the ridge, they are not uni-directional like the change in depth. Instead, they influence only a few elements and isotopes that are most mobile in the mantle, and the overall crustal composition is entirely consistent with the mantle temperature hypotheses.   This project therefore funded a successful cruise to produce the best studied section of normal ocean ridge. Through these studies, we were able to discover chemical differences between symmetric and asymmetric segments that cast light on their origin and appear to apply globally. The comprehensive data set also provides a new test of hypotheses for ridge depth, and shows that mantle temperature is the predominant control. These results have far-reaching ramifications for our understanding of the ocean ridge system.       Last Modified: 06/30/2018       Submitted by: Charles H Langmuir]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
