<AbstractNarration>The mid-ocean ridge in the Atlantic that separates North American and South America from Europe and Africa is one of the major tectonic plate boundaries on the planet.  Only recently has it become obvious that this ridge consists of segments of alternating symmetric and asymmetric spreading, both of which are characterized by different styles of seismicity.  A first order question in marine geology is: what causes these differences and do they primarily relate to differences in the mechanical or chemical properties of the crust and underlying mantle.  This research sheds new light on this question.  It involves an intensive field campaign to sample six adjacent mid-ocean ridge segments that alternate between symmetric and asymmetric spreading.  During the campaign, deep submergence tools to identify the presence of previously undiscovered hydrothermal vents will be deployed. Samples of rock and glass dredged from the seafloor will be examined petrographically for mineral associations and to select samples for geochemical analysis.  Selected samples will be analyzed for major and trace elements, volatiles, and Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopes.  Melt inclusions will also be examined.  These data will be used to determine whether magmatic differences that can be related to deeper mantle composition or behavior are the cause of the different types of spreading.  Broader impacts of the work include strong integration of research and education.  It will result in the development of a course on mid-ocean ridge science for undergraduates that includes analytical laboratory and seagoing field components, with course materials being posted on the web for dissemination.  It will also directly train over 10 undergraduates, two graduate students, and two early career researchers.  Samples and data collected will be made immediately available to the public and resulting geochemical analyses will be posted on a publicly accessible website.  The project also involves a strong component of collaboration with French scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ More than two thirds of the Earth?s surface are covered by oceans that are underlain by oceanic crust formed along the global mid-ocean ridge sytem, along which tectonic plates separate.  The rate at which these plates separate, ranging from close to zero to up to ~ 1 m per year at ultra-fast spreading ridges, is a first order control on the the amount of melt produced under the ridge axis ; slow-spreading ridges, separating at &lt;~0.6 m per year are generally less magmatic than faster ones. Plate separation requires a mass transfer to the deep-earth towards the shallower lithosphere. While at fast-spreading ridges this deficit is mostly taken up by magma supplied to the axis, at slow-spreading ridges there is a deficit in melt supply. This deficit is taken up by tectonic processes, that bring up material from the mantle mechanically, and incorporate in the oceanic lithosphere.  Seafloor morphology along the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge below shows striking differences that reflect variations in this melt supply deficit and importance of tectonic activity forming the seafloor. We observe to end-member morphologies, with linear segments with ridge-parallel faults (important melt supply) and segments with that are asymmetric, with irregular, complex, and long-lived faulting such as oceanic detachments (low melt supply). The asymmetric segments also display higher seismicity rates than linear segments, and ubiquitously show hydrothermal activity associated with these oceanic detachments.  As the two modes of accretion are found adjacent to each other and co-exist at identical spreading rates, the differences in melt supply and importance of tectonic activity must be linked instead to the generation of melt at depth, that is observed in the geochemistry of basalts sampled along these two types of segment from preliminary geochemical results.     To investigate these differences and their cause, the KAPOW cruise (2012) sampled extensively ~750 km of the  Mid-Atlantic Ridge axis, between the Kane and Atlantis Fracture Zones, recovering more than 200 basalt samples ; this is one of the densest, and most extensive sampling or a ridge section ever conducted. The geochemical analyses of these rocks, conducted between Harvard University and the University of Bergen (Norway) includes, major elements, trace elements, and isotopes, that inform about both the composition of the mantle from which the melts are sourced, and of the processes that this melt undergoes during their ascent till they erupt (differentiation, fractionation, assimilation, contamination). This project allowed a PhD candidate to conduct part of her research work, with international visits to Paris and Norway for data gathering and interpretation.  The results, while still being interpreted, show the following main observations:  -       MgO shows systematic variations indicating lower temperatures of erupted magmas near trasnforms, and higher at symmetrical segments, associated with originally shallower melt lenses.  -       Na8.0 shows that symmetric segments have shallower pressures of crustallization than adjacent oblique segments.  -       More enriched magmas, as determined from trace elements, occur near discontinuities and transforms, but there is substantial variability locally.
