<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This project supports a small travel grant to offset the expenses of 15 graduate students and 1 undergraduate student in science and engineering programs at the University of Alaska Fairbanks to attend the Association of Canadian Universities for Northern Studies (ACUNS) "International Student Conference on Northern Studies and Polar Regions: Communities of Change Building an IPY Legacy." The purpose of the conference is "This conference will bring together young researchers from around the globe who are interested in advances of methods, technologies, networks, policy and science planning in the Polar Regions." The structure of the conference is around Four Major Themes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The impact of sustainable development, economic activity and polar law on communities, governance and natural habitats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The use of natural, physical and social sciences to help understand the causes and effects of the changing polar climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Changes to polar marine and terrestrial communities over the short and long term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Changes in research communities and how research is undertaken in the Polar Regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participating students give oral and poster presentations that illuminate one or more of the four themes of the conference. In addition to the student presentations there are scheduled pre-conference workshops, key note speakers, and informal gatherings for networking between students and established scholars. The students from the University of Alaska will benefit greatly from these professional interactions and will contribute substantially to the content of the conference as developing northern scholars from a key institution that supports northern research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project allowed 13 students to attend the  international conference Community of Change - Building an IPY Legacy sponsored by the Association of Canadian Universities of Northern Studies and the University of the Arctic.  Students attended the conference to generate and exchange ideas, research strategies related to the impacts of climate change on both northern ecosystems and the people who depend on them.  Students came away from the meeting with a broader understanding of the vulnerabilites and disparities caused by climate change.  Student networking increased and some research collaborations were developed.    Also, interactions with northern indigenous people improved the students' ability to communicate and translate their research to the non-science community.  The issues of sustainability, climate change, energy and healthy communities are of great importance to northern studies and it was recommended that graduate students participate in the 2010 UARCTIC's l Rectors' Meeting in Fairbanks, Alaska.  This meeting furthered the activities of the International Polar Year by highlighting the role ofvarious international committees and professional societies in the planning of the future research and education activities.  Some of the suggestions were an annual graduate student research conference in Alaska, an international research journal focused on the results of the international polar year's research and more student networking opportunities at international meetings sponsored by the UARCTIC.
