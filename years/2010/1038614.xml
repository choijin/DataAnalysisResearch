<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: WSC-Category 3: Crops, climate, canals, and the cryosphere in Asia : changing water resources around the Earth's third pole&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT: This project is generating an integrated assessment of the impacts of climate-, and human-driven changes in hydrology on agricultural production and land use in Central, South, East, and Southeast Asia, and the implications for regional food security and economic welfare in the coming decades. It combines future climate projections, remote sensing and hydrological data together with hydrological, geophysical, agroecosystem and economic modeling to characterize the relative importance of local precipitation, runoff, groundwater mining, interbasin water transfers, and agricultural and non-agricultural water use for the region's water supply-demand balance.  The project goal is to estimate how effects of climate change on high-elevation snow, ice, and permafrost hydrology will affect downstream water resources and food production, and through scenario analyses with regard to e.g. dam construction and other large-scale water engineering efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is assessing current and projected water resources in the watersheds of the major rivers draining from the Asian High Mountains (principally the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Salween, Mekong, Yangtze, Yellow, Amu Darya, Syr Darya, and Irtysh Rivers), with a particular focus on the climatic change and variability impacts on runoff from the highlands. Irrigated agriculture is widespread in the study region, and water resources are tightly linked to food supplies.  Agricultural economies support the majority of the regional population, so water and food resources are a key factor in the regional economy.  This project is linking water supply and potential food production to an economic model, enabling assessment of water use, cropping intensity and yields in each of the various crop production sectors of the economy. The project is characterizing the response of downstream water demand and agricultural production to increased population, economic activity expansion and constrained water supplies, and assessing the implications of improvements in irrigation and crop water use efficiency, proposed major interbasin water transfer projects and dam construction, and deep groundwater depletion for food security and trade in the region's economies.  Simulation uncertainties are assessed by sensitivity analyses driven by uncertainties in both model parameters and agricultural and hydrological databases. The project has collaborative ties with researchers in several countries in the study region, and they are contributing to efforts to obtain relevant data on regional land and water use.&lt;br/&gt;Water and food security in Asia in the face of climate change and rising populations is an issue of global importance. Much of the study region is already experiencing physical or economic water scarcity, and major water engineering works are planned in both India and China. This broadly interdisciplinary project (geosciences, agricultural sciences, social sciences) is quantifying contemporary water resources, water use for agriculture, and food production, and the economic consequences of future climate change on water and food prices in the study region.  Knowledge gained in this study will improve the capacity of integrated assessment modeling to account for the physical constraints of water resources on future economic and social activity, and mitigation and adaptation strategies. This project includes graduate student education &amp; training and undergraduate research opportunities. In addition, the project is developing learning modules on global change in Asia, with a focus on water and food resources and sustainability, for an NSF-sponsored K-12 global change education outreach program.  The project is contributing to stronger and deeper international collaborations with researchers in Asia.  Finally, the project is contributing to the global change research community's capacity to integrate physical and social sciences, which is essential to address the broadly interdisciplinary issue of water, climate, and sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Water and food security in Asia, in the face of rising populations and climate change, is an issue of global importance. Much of South, Southeast, and East Asia already experience physical or economic water scarcity, and major water engineering works are planned in both India and China.  Water scarcity is one of the greatest challenges to sustained and increased agricultural production. Agricultural economies support the majority of the regional population, so water and food resources are a key factor in the regional economy.  Irrigated agriculture is a major component of dry season food production, and irrigation dominates regional water use.  Our interdisciplinary project combined computer models of glacier melting, surface hydrology (including river flow and groundwater recharge), crop productivity and irrigation water demand, and resource economics (farmer decisions) to quantify available water resources and water use for irrigated agriculture and food production.   One component of our research focused on China.  In response to increasing demand for food, Chinese agriculture has both expanded and intensified over the past several decades.  Irrigation has played a key role in increasing crop production, and, as in India, groundwater is now an important source of ChinaÆs irrigation water.  Groundwater withdrawal in excess of recharge (sometimes called groundwater mining) has resulted in declining groundwater levels in the North China Plain, and could eventually restrict groundwater availability, adversely affecting crop productivity.  We used a hydrological model in conjunction with a process-based crop growth model to evaluate the dependence of Chinese crop production upon mined groundwater.  We found that to meet gross irrigation water demand would require that one-quarter of irrigation water would have to be mined groundwater.  Based on simulated irrigated and non-irrigated crop yields across China, we estimated that mined groundwater accounted for 15% to 27% of national total crop production, depending on weather.  Another component of our research focused on India.  India is currently experiencing a groundwater crisis; global remote sensing analyses shows northwestern India has one of the most severely over-extracted aquifers in the world. To study the future of this system, we are using our system of models to examine the impacts of climate change, farming changes, and water infrastructure construction.  We simulate changes in irrigated crop area with an empirical economic model of farmer decisions about how much of their cropland to irrigate, based on analysis of 35-years of district-level census data (equivalent to county-level in the U.S.) that had been collected from across the major agricultural regions of India.  By integrating the economic model projections of irrigated areas into the hydrology model, we can assess which regions of India where climate models predict precipitation will increase in the coming decades, will nonetheless experience an increase in the demand for irrigation water greater than this increase in water supply. This result in particular can highlight the value of considering both the human (economic) and natural (hydrology) systems together &ndash; specifically, how will increased demand for irrigation water due to the human response to precipitation increases compare to increased surface water supplies provided by the additional precipitation?

Results from this analysis are now out for peer-review, at which time they will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.  We al...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
