<AbstractNarration>Scaled chrysophytes are microscopic organisms common to all freshwater environments.  Most species grow under very specific conditions, making them excellent indicators of environmental change and of the health of the environments in which they live.  These organisms are so named because they form highly ornate structures out of glass, called scales, which are unique in design for each species.  These scales accumulate in sediments where they can be recovered later and used to piece together the history of the water body.  Study of scaled chrysophytes, including use as bioindicators, has been hampered by the lack of taxonomic resources available to new researchers.  The primary objective of this project is to synthesize three decades of research on scaled chrysophytes from thousands of collections made along the east coast of North America, and archive corresponding materials from all samples in international museums. A synthesis of the data is expected to yield insights for new research initiatives on global climate change and for addressing biodiversity and evolutionary questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worldwide taxonomic expertise in scaled chrysophytes has significantly declined over the last decade, a fact that has undermined the importance and use of these organisms for advancing our knowledge of key environmental issues such as global climate change.  In addition, unlike most groups of organisms, there are no museum collections available to aid new researchers.  These facts provided the primary stimuli for this project, namely to develop a comprehensive guide to the organisms and simultaneously archive materials and specimens that directly correspond to the guide in internationally recognized museums.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scaled chrysophytes and diatoms are siliceous algae that are common components of aquatic environments.  Many species grow under specific conditions and as such are excellent indicators of environmental change.  Because remains of these organisms can be found tens to millions of years later in lake sediments, they can be used to reconstruct past environments.  Over the last 30 years collections have been made and analyzed for siliceous algae from 350 waterbodies spread over the east coast of North America from Florida to Newfoundland.  Species have been documented from each collection and used to describe the flora, determine habitat requirements, and examine biogeographic patterns over the entire study region.  These studies have resulted in numerous published articles, several books, and descriptions of many new organisms, all of which form a well defined baseline from which to evaluate future changes.  Intellectual Merit: As part of this award, images of numerous siliceous organisms, physical and chemical data, and location information for all of the sites examined over the last 30 years was assembled and used to evaluate biogeographic distributions, impacts of environmental variables on specific species, and the overall importance of the organisms in different types of habitats.  This information formed the basis of several publications.  More importantly, samples from each of the waterbodies were assembled into three equal sets, documented, and deposited at three international museums, the Natural History Museum in London, the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, and the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.  These museums were selected because of their existing collections of siliceous algae, in particular of diatoms.  A minimum of four samples was added to the collection from each site, including an aliquot of the original material, a prepared sample known as a slurry that can be used to study the siliceous organisms using either a light or electron microscope, and duplicate permanent prepared slides for direct observation with a light microscope. In total, each museum received approximately 1,425 samples consisting of over 700 slides, 350 raw sediment samples and 350 cleaned slurries (see Figure).  All three museums received identical sets of samples for a total of approximately 4,275 items.  The collections also contain isotype material for approximately 70 new species and genera.  A booklet (both electronic and hard copy versions) that describes all 1,425 specimens was included with each collection.  The document will aid users in locating specific samples by specimen number, site name, geographic location or publication.  In addition, the user can access excel files on a DVD and sort the specimens based on any criterion. The booklet also contains details on locations of sites, key references, and associated physical and chemical data.  Users can, for example, sort the sites according to pH and select samples that meet specific requirements.  Data from the study were used to examine questions regarding the biogeography, distribution, and scale structure over geologic time scales for scaled chrysophytes. The first question addressed was Do Scaled Chrysophytes Have a Biogeography?  Our findings firmly support the fact that the distribution of scaled chrysophytes along the east coast of North America is not homogenous, despite apparent dispersal mechanisms (migratory birds and wind events) that theoretically should act to reduce differences between regions.  Instead, significant differences were found between closely-spaced geographic regions each containing sites with statistically similar chemical and physical attributes.  Environmental variables clearly play a significant role in determining if species will inhabit a given site.  However, species are not always found in waterbodies judged able to support growth indicating inadequate dispersal, poor transportability, or both. Results were also used to test the...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
