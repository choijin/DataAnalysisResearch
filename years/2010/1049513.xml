<AbstractNarration>This project concerns the application of algebraic and combinatorial tools&lt;br/&gt;in two settings:&lt;br/&gt;(1) cluster algebras and totally positive varieties: in particular, the&lt;br/&gt;study of the Fomin-Zelevinsky positivity conjecture and construction of&lt;br/&gt;canonical positive bases for cluster algebras; and the study of the&lt;br/&gt;topology of the totally non-negative part of a flag variety.&lt;br/&gt;(2) physical combinatorics: in particular the exploration of connections&lt;br/&gt;between the asymmetric exclusion process, orthogonal polynomials, soliton&lt;br/&gt;solutions of the KP equation, and total positivity on the Grassmannian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a broader perspective, this research project will reinforce&lt;br/&gt;interactions between combinatorics, representation theory, statistical&lt;br/&gt;physics, and integrable systems, with hopefully a significant impact on&lt;br/&gt;all fields. In the longer term, it may also have applications to the&lt;br/&gt;mathematics of traffic flow, translation in protein synthesis, or shallow&lt;br/&gt;water waves. Integrating education and research, the PI will organize&lt;br/&gt;student seminars and a two-week summer school on cluster algebras, a field&lt;br/&gt;containing many accessible open problems. This project also seeks to&lt;br/&gt;achieve two other educational goals: increasing the visibility of women&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, via a series of Colloquium lectures at Berkeley given by&lt;br/&gt;distinguished women; and bridging the student-faculty divide at Berkeley,&lt;br/&gt;by organizing activities that will bring together undergraduates, graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and faculty.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aims of the project, broadly speaking, were to explore connections between cluster algebras, total positivity, and physical combiantorics. Some of the main outcomes of the project are summarized below.  In physical combinatorics, the PI and Kodama wrote three papers that illustrated the connections between the positive Grassmannian and soliton solutions of the KP equation, which in turn model the behavior of shallow water waves.  The authors used these connections to solve several important problems, including the inverse problem and the regularity problem. Their first paper  ``KP solitons and total positivity on the Grassmannian" appeared in Inventiones, and their second paper ``A Deodhar decomposition of the Grassmannian and the regularity of KP solitons"  appeared in Advances in Mathematics. Their third paper,  ``Combinatorics of KP solitons from the real Grassmannian," gave an exposition of their results, and appeared in the  Proceedings of the Abel Symposium.  The PI and Kodama also studied the Toda lattice, giving  complete flag variety analogues of some of the results above.  Their paper ``The full Kostant-Toda hierarchy on the positive flag variety" appeared in Communications in Mathematical Physics.  One consequence of their work was the introduction of a new family of polytopes called Bruhat interval polytopes, which are a generalization of the permutohedron. These polytopes were further explored in the PI's paper ``Bruhat interval polytopes" (joint with her student Emmanuel Tsukerman), which studied the combinatorics of Bruhat interval polytopes, and in particular showed that the face of any Bruhat interval polytope is a Bruhat interval polytope.  This paper appeared in Advances in Mathematics.  The PI wrote a paper ``Network parameterizations of the Grassmannian" with her NSF postdoc, Kelli Talaska.  This paper gave explicit parameterizations of Deodhar strata in the Grassmannian, and it generalized work of Postnikov giving parameterizations of positroid cells in the totally non-negative Grassmannian. This paper appeared in  Algebra and Number Theory.  In cluster algebras, the PI wrote an expository paper called ``Cluster algebras: an introduction," which appeared in the  Bulletin of the AMS. Additionally, the PI's paper ``Bases for cluster algebras from surfaces" (joint with Musiker and Schiffler) was accepted for publication in  Compositio Mathematica.  Finally, the PI began work on a book on cluster algebras, which is joint with Sergey Fomin and Andrei Zelevinsky.  In total positivity, the PI completed a paper ``Positroids and non-crossing partitions" with Ardila and Rincon.  This paper gave a link between positroids and non-crossing partitions, which in turn gives a link between the enumeration of positroids and free probability.  This paper appeared in the Transactions of the AMS.  The PI completed a second paper ``Positively oriented matroids are realizable" with Ardila and Rincon, which proved da Silva's 1987 conjecture that every positively oriented matroid is realizable.  It follows from this result and an older result of the PI's that the positive matroid Grassmannian is homeomorphic to a ball.  This paper appeared in  the Journal of the European Mathematical Society.  The PI completed a paper with Pech and Rietsch, on mirror symmetry for quadrics, entitled ``On Landau-Ginzburg models for quadrics and flat sections of Dubrovin connections."  This appeared in Advances in Mathematics (the special issue in honor of Andrei Zelevinsky). The project proves a version of mirror symmetry expressing the Dubrovin connection for quadrics in terms of a mirror-dual Landau-Ginzburg model on the complement of an anticanonical divisor in a dual quadric.  The paper also computes the constant term of Givental's J-function by several methods.  The PI also completed a paper with Sylvie Corteel entitled ``Macdonald-Koornwinder moments and the two-species exclusion process." In previous work, we explained the relationships between three different objects: the asymmetric exclusion process (a model from statistical physics), Askey-Wilson polynomials (some famous orthogonal polynomials in one variable), and some combinatorial objects that we called staircase tableaux.  After our previous work, various people pointed out to us that Askey-Wilson polynomials are the one-variable case of Koornwinder polynomials, which are also known as type BC-Macdonald polynomials.  And they asked us if we could generalize our previous work, finding the appropriate generalizations of the asymmetric exclusion process and staircase tableaux.  The new paper shows that the appropriate analogue of the asymmetric exclusion process (ASEP) is a generalized ASEP which has two different types of particles.  The PI also completed a paper ``Macdonald-Koornwinder moments and the two-species exclusion process" with Sylvie Corteel and Olya Mandelshtam, which introduces rhombic staircase tableaux, and uses them to give a combinatorial formula for the stationary distribution of the two-species ASEP. This also leads to a combinatorial formula for Macdonald-Koornwinder moments.  This paper is submitted to a journal.  Over the course of the project, the PI advised the following students: Adam Kalman, Olya Mandelshtam, Steven Karp, Anastasia Chavez, Emmanuel Tsukerman, and Felix Gotti. She also mentored the following postdocs: Kelli Talaska, Florian Block, Yan Zhang, and Khrystyna Serhiyenko.          Last Modified: 08/14/2017       Submitted by: Lauren Williams]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
