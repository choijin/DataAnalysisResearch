<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal supports travel awards for graduate students to attend the 9th National Graduate Research Polymer Conference to be held at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (June 6 - 9, 2010, Chapel Hill, NC).  A number of prominent polymer scientists have accepted the invitation to speak at the conference.  The organizers anticipate 200 students (and professors, researchers and industry representatives) from across the country, as well as 50 participants from the Triangle area will come to UNC Chapel Hill campus for four days to share research results and exchange ideas.  Symposium topics include biorelated materials, energy-related materials, photonics and electronics, polymer surfaces, nanostructured materials, and characterization/kinetics/theory/modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major goal for the 9th NGRPC meeting will be to foster the interaction/networking with professors, industrial scientists/representatives, as well as among graduate students.  Efforts toward broadening participation will be included. Ten half-day oral sessions and two late afternoon poster sessions are planned. This conference will provide an excellent opportunity for the attendees to stay current with the state-of-the-art researches and to promote fruitful discussions among researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merits  The 8th National Graduate Research Polymer Conference (2010 NGRPC) was held at UNC Chapel Hill on June 6-9, 2010. Graduate students within the polymer track are not only the future polymer scientists/engineers. Also their breath prepares them for the interdisciplinary challenges associated with contemporary science problems. Hence they need proper channels to connect to both academia (outside of their own schools) and industry, as well as to communicate within themselves. The 2010 NGRPC successfully served as the 'missing link' to nurture interdisciplinary interactions and networking. We reached the main goal of fostering the  interaction/networking with professors, industrial scientists/representatives, as well as among graduate students.  Broader Impact  In three and half days, 2010 NGRPC gathered 160 students from 30 different institutions and 30 other professionals (faculty,government reps and company reps). This conference provided an excellent opportunity for the attendees (especially graduate students) to stay current with the state-of-the-art researches and to promote fruitful discussions among researchers.  Funding from the NSF allowed us to provide 20 travel awards at $250 each to support graduate students to attend the conference.  Priority was given to graduate students who presented their research in the oral sessions, and to female and minority students.   In summary, 2010 NGRPC had: 3 plenary lectures (Professors Joe DeSimone, Marc Hillmyer, and Jan  Genzer); 48 oral presentations by students; 80 posters in 2 poster sessions by students; career fair and career panel discussion.
