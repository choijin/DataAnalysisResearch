<AbstractNarration>This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering (BRIGE) grant provides funding for comprehensive investigations to study the fundamental mechanisms that affect the consolidation of metallic nanoparticles and to determine the relevant length scale parameters that capture the microstructural responses of the nanoparticle material system. Characterization experiments will be used to determine the effects of processing parameters (i.e. pressure, temperature, heating rate) and nanoparticle attributes (i.e. size, compressibility, agglomeration) on the densification and microstructural evolution of the nanoparticle systems during consolidation.  Atomistic simulations will be performed to examine the influence of these parameters on nanoparticle diffusion during consolidation and to quantify the fundamental transport mechanisms by which the nanoparticles consolidate.  From the length scale parameters determined from the atomistic simulations and experimental observations, the microstructural characteristics observed at the nanoscale will be implemented into physically-based constitutive relations for larger scale finite element models which can be used to evaluate new applications for nanostructured microdevices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of this research will broaden the scientific and technical understanding of nanoparticles and nanostructured materials.  The goal of this work is to use multiscale modeling to implement higher fidelity physics which include the deformation behavior of nanoparticles determined from atomistic simulations and experimental investigations into larger scale models that predict the behavior of nanostructured materials. Quantifying the effect of particle and processing parameters on dimensional changes and microstructure will lead to significant scientific advances in nanotechnology by providing a fundamental understanding of nanoscale material behavior under different processing conditions.  Further development of modeling methods and expansion of simulation-based design will directly impact the powder metallurgy and nanotechnology industries by providing predictive models for the consolidation of nanostructured materials which will lead to significant performance increases and cost savings in evaluating new applications for nanopowders, as well as will reduce time for implementation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanostructured materials are attractive due to their favorable properties as compared to their coarser grained counterparts.  One limiting factor in their wide spread use is difficulty maintaining their favorable microstructure during fabrication of useful components.  In this project, the effect of material parameters, microstructural parameters, and processing conditions on the consolidation of a nanopowder material system using a press-and-sinter process was investigated and characterized using a multiscale modeling approach.  Specifically, the following tasks have been completed under this project: a) Performed classical MD simulations to study compaction and sintering effects on nanoparticle and nanocrystalline atomistic models for comparison to experimental results. b) Studied the interactions and deformation behavior between nanoparticles. c)  Characterized nanocrystalline powder and obtained relevant compaction and sintering parameters to describe densification and grain growth in the nanocrystalline model,  Intellectual Merits: This project has developed MD simulations of the compaction and sintering of metal nanoparticles. (1) Critical interrelationships between macro-physical properties during consolidation and nanoscale structural characteristics were determined, reducing the burden of complex experimental characterization. (2) A multiscale model, linking lower length scales, surface contact properties, and sintering kinetics, allowed a physics-based investigation of mechanisms driving nanopowder consolidation. (3) Furthermore, the work under this project has established a preliminary modeling framework for a fundamental understanding of additional metallic nanopowder material systems for use in powder metallurgy applications.  Broader Impacts: This project (1) enhanced the current graduate research program through the creation of a new molecular modeling  course being offered in the Mechanical Engineering curriculum, (2) attracted the involvement of many underrepresented undergraduate students in research opportunities; (3)  supported students to attend conferences and pursue PhD studies; and (4) promoted k-12 education of underrepresented students in engineering research through the formulation of an afterschool enrichment program and two-day summer program at the local Boys and Girls Club.
