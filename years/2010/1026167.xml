<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, three collaborative teams led by Dr. Gregory A. Waselkov (University of South Alabama), Dr. Elizabeth J. Reitz (University of Georgia), and Dr. C. Frederick T. Andrus (University of Alabama) will investigate the seasonal nature of fishing and shellfishing during the Middle Woodland and Late Woodland periods (AD 325-1040) along estuaries of the Alabama portion of the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In this two-year project, team members will compare methods of analysis used by archaeologists to assess seasonality of habitat exploitation and residential mobility at coastal sites around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Georgia's component will focus on zooarchaeological analysis of vertebrate and invertebrate remains with the goal of integrating the two kinds of animal remains into a dynamic model of subsistence exploitation. The team from the University of Alabama will take the lead on a large-scale application of oxygen isotope temperature proxy analysis to multiple species of fish and shellfish to produce refined seasonality interpretations. University of South Alabama project members will develop a Bayesian statistical analysis to correlate temperature proxy curves from different species and achieve more precise seasonality interpretations of archaeological deposits. That team will investigate elemental and isotopic analyses of selected fish and terrestrial vertebrates to provide information on ontogenetic (individual lifetime) habitat changes, with seasonality-of-capture implications. The UGA and USA teams will also prepare specimens for isotopic analysis and record data on growth patterns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One outcome will be a reliable and precise understanding of the seasonal dimensions of Woodland subsistence adaptations along the Alabama coast, an area little studied by archaeologists. A second broader outcome will be a higher standard of analysis based on adequate samples of multiple prey species that yield confident assessments of seasonal habitat exploitation and site occupation, providing a firm basis for models of coastal sedentism and mobility around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together specialists in archaeology, zooarchaeology, geochemistry, materials science, and marine biology to create a synergy with benefits that transcend normal disciplinary boundaries. The intellectual merit of the project derives from a rigorous protocol for analysis that targets specific seasonal events with multiple lines of evidence, increased precision of seasonal interpretations, and calibration of seasonal exploitations of different habitats, an approach new to archaeology. These analytical methods work in concert, making this a very powerful interpretive approach that can transform archaeological inquiries on coastal sedentism and mobility. At a more basic level, isotope analysis of the archaeological remains will give insight into the fundamental processes that govern all skeletal growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are broader impacts to this study. All three project labs will meaningfully involve undergraduates in this research, learning the basics of isotope chemistry and zooarchaeological analysis. Analytical procedures and results of this project will be particularly highlighted in active public outreach programs, including supervised volunteer opportunities in the labs, staff and student visits to K-12 classrooms, hosting visits by school groups to the labs, and in an exhibit currently in development for the University of South Alabama's Archaeology Museum.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this interdisciplinary project was to examine seasonal aspects of Woodland settlement patterns and resource use on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico using materials from two Woodland-period archaeological sites. The sites are located on the Alabama coast near Mobile Bay. Very little research has been conducted in this area for the Woodland period even though information about life during the Woodland period offers an important perspective on coastal life during the Mississippian period which followed it. Mississippian settlement patterns and subsistence strategies were presumably very different from those in the Woodland period in terms of mobility, social organization, and the role of domesticated plants. The project specifically looked at animal remains from Middle and Late Woodland deposits at two Gulf coast sites: Plash Island (A.D. 325-642) and Bayou St. John (A.D. 650-1041). The multi-proxy study combined zooarchaeology of invertebrates and vertebrates with stable isotope geochemistry [&delta;<sup>18</sup>O, &delta;<sup>13</sup>C, &delta;<sup>15</sup>N, <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr], laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and bulk ICP-MS analyses of oysters, rangias, coquinas, quahogs, hardhead catfishes, and gafftopsail catfishes. Molluscs dominate the Plash Island assemblage in terms of individuals though vertebrates contribute half of the biomass; molluscs dominate the Bayou St. John assemblage in terms of both individuals and biomass. Neither assemblage is highly diverse, though the Plash Island assemblage is more diverse than the Bayou St. John assemblage both in terms of sources of individuals and sources of biomass. People at Plash Island used shellfish and fish from a wider range of trophic levels and from higher trophic levels than did people at Bayou St. John. The more diverse strategy practiced at Plash Island extended to using more venison, which was a minor resource at Bayou St. John. Although people at both locations used over 70 invertebrate and vertebrate taxa, the people at Plash Island used those animals more evenly. Compared to the strategy practiced by people at Plash Island, people at Bayou St. John were more focused on estuarine resources, particularly molluscs, a focus reflected in the lower mean trophic level and the high percentages of individuals and biomass from trophic level 2.1 in the Bayou St. John assemblage. Most of the fish individuals in both assemblages are from fishes with the potential of maturing into large-bodied fishes. Inherently small-bodied fishes contribute very little of the biomass to either assemblage. Nonetheless, at least half of the sea catfishes, mullets, and drums in both assemblages had a Standard Length below 250 mm, indicating that they were small, young fish, though some individuals were considerably larger. The preferred fishing technology at both sites was based on mass-capture methods, such as weirs and small-gauged nets, but this was more pronounced at Bayou St. John than at Plash Island. Other technologies, such as large-gauged nets, likely were used to capture the large fish individuals in both assemblages. The Plash Island assemblage contains but one animal that has a markedly seasonal migratory habit such that its presence in the assemblage indicates a season when people too were present. In this case, the cownose ray only indicates a spring through fall, which is not sufficiently specific to reconstruct human residential patterns. The Bayou St. John assemblage contains somewhat more animals with more specific seasonal migratory habits; some of these animals are present near the site during warm weather and others are present during cool weather, indicating that Bayou St. John was occupied on a multi-seasonal basis.
