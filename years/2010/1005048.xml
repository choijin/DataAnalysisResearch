<AbstractNarration>This three-year REU Site program is focused in the area of particle-based functional materials.  The overarching objective of this project is to develop a research experience for undergraduates program that not only builds a basis for research fluency, but also increases the students' ability to integrate knowledge. The specific goals of the REU program include: 1) Train students to perform increasingly independent research, specifically aimed at the multitude of technological applications that are impacted by functional materials; 2) Develop an integrated internship to cross-train REU students so that they can get not only a breadth of experience, but also an increased appreciation of the interconnectedness of the focus area; 3) Improve the students' ability to function in teams by pairing students for their internships; and 4) Increase the students' ability to integrate knowledge within and across the focus area via the research internship pairing and workshop series.  In addition to the research projects, social activities will be largely coordinated by the Office of Experimental Learning that will aid in organizing these events to foster the cohort experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will target students from primarily undergraduate institutions and students from underrepresented groups.  Research results will be disseminated at national societal conferences (AIChE, APS, MRS, and ASEE) as well as on the departmental web page (http://www.che.pitt.edu).  Additionally, results will be published in both disciplinary and educational journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research experience for undergraduates program focused on what we call Particle-based Functional Materials (PFM-REU). The focus area is comprised of computational and experimental studies of particulate materials that fulfill a specific function, either because of their discrete nature or due to the influence of particles on structure. Such systems include: material self-healing, controlled delivery of therapeutics, "smart" catalysis, and particle separations, to name a few. Our REU was based on the premise that the successful engineer of the future will need to be able to seamlessly traverse the boundary between these seemingly disparate technology areas. In order to equip our students to become the "nimble thinkers" necessary in the changing economy, the PFM-REU program explicitly focused on enhancing studentsÆ knowledge integration skills, while building their base of knowledge in a specific area. This was accomplished by combining the traditional research of an REU site with a tailored workshop series and an innovating "cross-training" internship.        The chief intellectual merit of the PFM-REU program is evidenced through advancing knowledge and understanding across fields of engineering and physics as the students worked in their disciplinary reserach projects. The primary broader impacts lie in integrating teaching and research, and training of undergraduate students.        Over the span of three summers, we have "graduated" a group of at 29 talented, diverse students that are able to engage in "broad thinking" within the realm of exciting research fields impacted by particle-based functional materials.

To date, the supported disciplinary and educational research has resulted in 4 peer-reviewed papers, one of which appeared in ACS Nano.   Aside from the demographic, scientific outcomes and career assessments discussed above, the evaluation of our other assessment results has been both encouraging of continued program success (Figure 1) and indicative of a significant contribution from our novel "internship" practice (Figure 2).
