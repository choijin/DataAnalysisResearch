<AbstractNarration>Purdue University, in collaboration with the King's Centre for Visualization in Science (KCVS) at the King's University College, the American Chemical Society (ACS), and the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), is developing, testing, and disseminating a series of interactive web-based digital learning objects to help first-year undergraduate chemistry students visualize and understand the chemistry underlying global climate change. Developed in response to documented misconceptions, the interactive digital learning objects are helping to fill, through chemistry education, a systemic hole identified by urgent calls for climate science literacy. Recognizing that interdisciplinary understanding of complex systems is fundamental to understanding modern science, these digital learning objects also are providing "best-practice" resources to support chemistry instructors in adopting active-learning pedagogies that situate cognition in authentic science practice and globally important contexts.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  Global climate change is one of the most pressing environmental challenges facing humanity.  Developing new energy sources, mitigating the effects of climate change, and altering our energy consumption habits are challenges that will increasingly be met by the current generation of students.  Colleges and universities across America and around the world play an important role in educating our youth about global climate change: its root causes, regional and global consequences, and how we can both adapt to and combat climate change. While the task of educating about climate change is critical, few credible, interactive, multimedia resources are currently available to help learners and educators negotiate the complex issues involved in understanding the scientific evidence for climate change. Many of the key underlying concepts require mental models built on a fundamental understanding of chemistry, yet connections to climate science and global climate change are largely missing in American first-year undergraduate chemistry courses for science majors.  Can an online, interactive set of resources that helps learners visualize the chemistry underlying climate change: (a) exemplify science education for sustainability, (b) improve the understanding of climate change by both undergraduate students and faculty members, and (c) provide resources to support pedagogical reform? This project explores these questions by developing a series of online digital learning objects and examining the efficacy of these tools by measuring changes in understanding by undergraduate students about both climate change and core chemistry concepts taught through climate change science.  The project also is producing a tested inventory of climate change concepts for use in further research.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.  These digital learning objects are being implemented and evaluated at several universities and are being disseminated to American colleges and university chemistry departments for further evaluation and implementation through existing ACS networks. The three co-PIs for this proposal lead a partnership under the umbrella of IUPAC, involving UNESCO, RSC, ACS, and members of the African and Asian Federations of Chemistry Societies, to disseminate tested climate change science materials as a contribution to the UN International Year of Chemistry (2011) and UNESCO's Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, 2005-2014. These digital learning objects are being made available to several portals for climate change science education, including the new UNESCO global clearing house on climate change education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Global science and K-16 education is paying more attention to sustainability challenges as evidenced by the volumes of published research and the recent K-12 Framework for Science Education (1).  The outcomes of this project are a series of interactive web-based digital learning objects aimed at filling the gap in sustainability literature in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  These learning objects help undergraduate chemistry students to visualize and understand the chemistry underlying global climate change.  The resources aim to (a) exemplify science education for sustainability, (b) improve the understanding of climate change by both undergraduate students and faculty members, and (c) provide "best-practice" resources to support chemistry instructors in adopting active-learning pedagogies that situate cognition in authentic science practice and globally important contexts.          The chemistry content and focus of the resources followed by a short description are:  Isotopes:  An introduction to isotopes, isotope ratios, atomic weights, and mass spectrometry.  Climate contexts include determination of historical temperatures and sourcing of atmospheric carbon. Gases: An exploration of the chemistry of gases, including a discussion of kinetic molecular theory, the ideal gas laws and the interaction of gases with electromagnetic radiation.  Climate contexts include the temperature profile of the atmosphere, the characteristics of greenhouse gases and the role of greenhouse gases in climate. Acids and Bases: A discussion of acids and bases grounded in an understanding of reaction equilibria.  Includes topics relating to the characteristics of acids and bases, chemical equilibria, reaction quotients, the pH scale, the difference between strong and weak acids and bases and the effect of pH on the quantitative distribution of chemical species important to marine life.  Climate contexts include ocean acidification and its effects on marine life. Thermochemistry: An introduction to thermochemistry, including discussion of the forms of energy, system and surroundings, internal energy, heat, work, temperature, the role of energy in physical processes and chemical reactions, enthalpy and enthalpy changes which relate to the heat absorbed or released at constant pressure.  Climate contexts emphasize alteration of the EarthÆs energy balance and humanityÆs dependence on energy, especially through the combustion of fossil fuels.      These resources are freely available to all educators worldwide and can be found here http://www.kcvs.ca/vc3/Lessons/.      In addition to this website which houses the digital learning objects we created we have widely disseminated our results in over 40 presentations across the US, Canada, Europe, Africa, and Australia for both scientific audiences and the public.  We have also hosted workshops on using these tools in classrooms at scientific conferences in Turkey, the US, Canada, and Italy.  Finally, we have highlighted these tools in three peer-reviewed publications.         References  1.
