<AbstractNarration>This project is building on two prior CCLI grants, 0536511 at the University of Wisconsin-Stout and 0087906 at St. Olaf College, which supported the creation of undergraduate laboratory-based coursework based on psycho-physiological research in cognitive neuroscience.  The laboratory-based courses developed at the University of Wisconsin-Stout, known as C-NERVE 2.0, subsequently formed the basis of a cognitive neuroscience learning community there.  C-NERVE 2.0 is an immersive undergraduate research program.  Students who participate are provided with hands-on experiences designed to facilitate careers in basic or applied sciences related to cognitive neuroscience. The UW-Stout C-NERVE learning community consists of faculty from more than five different departments and over 30 undergraduates. C-NERVE students complete a series of five core courses that have been designed to include intensive hands-on digital psycho-physiological research experiences. These courses include Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience and Applied Psycho-physiological Methods. Students serve as research assistants in several investigative labs, on a rotating basis, for up to three years. They are trained in several psycho-physiological research methods in the context of performing original research. They also take part in activities designed to involve them in the larger learning community, such as outreach activities designed to promote science education to underrepresented populations. For their capstone experience, students design and complete an original project in the role of principal investigator. Their final task is to present this final project at a conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expanding the research activities of C-NERVE, bolstering undergraduate training in the ethical conduct of research, and involving students in C-NERVE outreach efforts. It is creating an additional C-NERVE learning community at the University of South Carolina - Aiken and creating a multi-campus extended C-NERVE learning community. It will also act as a clearing house for other campuses interested in developing similar programs and functions as a surrogate for the larger scientific community while introducing students to participation in the scientific research culture.</AbstractNarration>
