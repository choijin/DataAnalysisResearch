<AbstractNarration>Professor Shelley D. Minteer of University of Utah and Professor Joseph Wang of the University of California-San Diego are supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop three-dimensional structures of nano building blocks to be used as supports and current collectors for enzymatic biofuel cells. Hierarchical catalyst supports in which macroscopic and microscopic pore structures are combined and independently controlled will be constructed using either porous carbon materials or templated microchannels. The proposed structures will be used as electrodes in conventional biofuel cells and in biofuel cells within microfluidic channels. The biofuel cell anodes will utilize a pair of NAD-dependent dehydrogenases (lactate and pyruvate dehydrogenase) with lactate as fuel, and with an NADH-recycling electrocatalyst polymer layer on the interior surface of the nanoporous metal layer to facilitate NADH redox chemistry within the nanoporous layer. The work will focus on electrode structure and activity and will seek insights into how these catalyst support structures can correlate with improved bioelectrode performance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Current enzymatic biofuel cells are hampered by poor enzyme utilization, and the proposed nanostructured electrode design promises to alleviate this deficiency and improve the current/power density for the conversion of chemical energy of a fuel into electrical energy. The project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate and engage students from underrepresented minorities through the involvement of the PIs in a variety of outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

Such unique ability to fine tune both the micro/submicrometer-sized building blocks and the nanometer-sized assemblies of the new  electrode architectures offers great versatility towards diverse energy applications. Our effort has also led to new and novel wearable biofuel-cell and battery concepts, as skin-worn energy harvesting devices which offer considerable promise for powering wearable systems. Overall, our activity and resulting knowledge represent a major step towards the creation of advanced bioelectrocatalytic surfaces with greatly enhanced mass transport and electrocatalytic activity for efficient biofuel operation and energy conversion.  This successful activity has been very productive and has already resulted in over dozen research papers published in leading international journals, several of which jointly with our collaborator.   Our effort has also involved the training and development of 4 undergraduate students, 1 graduate student, and 2 post doc fellows (including three females and two from underrepresented background), providing them a unique experience in the exciting and interdisciplinary research environment, developing their scientific excitement, and exposing them early in their career to an advanced stimulating research environment in the field of electrochemistry and energy conversion.
