<AbstractNarration>This research and development project leverages curricular module development to design, develop, and test new cyberlearning modules that integrate multiple (circulation, respiration, and digestion) systems of the human body.  The project aims to deepen science content knowledge, science inquiry skills, and model-based reasoning skills for high school biology students. The project will use simulations showing how individual systems function, how they work together, and how the integration of all three creates a dynamic and reactive biological system. It is expected that the presentation of this dynamic system will result in a deeper understanding of the materials and enhanced performance on student achievement measures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Develop an integrated simulation of the human digestive, circulatory and respiratory systems that allows students to develop productive inquiry strategies.&lt;br/&gt;2. Embed the simulation in online instructional modules that provide immediate, individualized coaching as students are challenged with a series of investigative tasks.&lt;br/&gt;3. Provide reports of students' performances during the activities to students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;4. Develop follow-up online collaborative investigations that provide differentiated instruction to strengthen students' understanding and support transfer and opportunities to engage in scientific discourse.&lt;br/&gt;5. Develop one benchmark assessment that measures outcomes across all three body systems and reports to students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;6. Develop and deploy professional development to support teachers as they use these materials.&lt;br/&gt;7. Provide evidence of the technical quality, feasibility, and usability of the new materials.&lt;br/&gt;8. Study the influence of these materials on complex science and inquiry learning of the integration of the three human body systems modeled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small scale randomized, controlled trial will be performed at the end of the project. The project is grounded in model-based learning, cognitive learning research, and an evidence-centered design. Universal Design for Learning is factored into all simulation designs. Questions asked during the evaluation include: Is the project progressing as planned? Are the modules useable? Are the users satisfied? Are the modules used as intended in a typical high school setting? Does this improve teaching and learning of key content? The primary investigator is WestEd; the American Association for the Advancement of Science is a partner and three teachers from nearby schools serve as co-developers. The project has an external evaluator as well as a strong advisory board. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will create multi-leveled instructional cyber-modules. These modules will contain embedded assessments that provide students and teachers immediate and individualized coaching. Professional development will also provide teachers tools and guidance to increase their learning of human body systems. Dissemination strategies include featuring the modules on WestEd's award-winning website as well as submission of academic papers to journals and national conferences targeted at science educators and education researchers. Because these modules supplement classroom curricula and use online technology, they could potentially be used to teach millions of high school biology students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Human Body Systems (HBS) project created three supplemental instructional modules and a final benchmark assessment geared to provide high school students with an integrated understanding of the digestive, respiratory, and circulatory systems. The HBS suite builds on prior work establishing the benefits of using simulation-based science assessments that support the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). These modules provide students an opportunity to access information about these systems using multiple forms of representation that have been shown to allow students to better demonstrate their understanding about scientific phenomena. Tasks within the modules allow students to build models, use them to test predictions, and draw conclusions from those investigations.</p> <p>The instructional modules are embedded in the biology curriculum and allow exploration of nested systems at different scales ranging from molecules to cells to organs to the whole body. These modules are intended as formative assessments and provide feedback and coaching tailored to students&rsquo; errors. HBS instructional modules provide progress reports for students and teachers. The benchmark assessment provides a summative report consistent with the NGSS targets. Online professional development for teachers covers complex systems, model-based learning, and using the progress reports to adjust instruction.</p> <p>The suite was developed through iterative cycles of analysis, design, data collection, and revision. The tasks were validated by triangulation of information from multiple sources that included internal and external reviews, classroom feasibility testing, classroom pilots, and data analyses.</p> <p>The suite of modules is accessible through the online SimScientists portal that allows teachers to assign the modules to their classes, monitor student progress in real time, use a rubric to score student constructed responses in the benchmark assessment, and view reports for Individual students or aggregated by class.</p> <p>A randomized controlled trial involving 40 teachers and ~2000 students was conducted to look at the impact of the intervention on student understanding and integration of complex systems. The study involved predominately high school biology students from across the country. Although the modules were intended to help students integrate the curriculum from units taught throughout the year, the content of the suite did not align easily with traditional high school biology curricula. Different curricula cover the content at different times of the year and at diverse time intervals, making the traditional curriculum fragmented. It is therefore not surprising that many of the teachers in the study found it difficult to integrate the content of the modules into their instruction. Teachers also reported that the HBS suite presented science content at a level that students in traditional biology classes found somewhat difficult. Consequently it took them longer than teachers expected to complete the modules. Coupled with the extended time was the competition for computer resources, especially as state testing often hits in the spring. While HBS modules were tested in introductory high school biology classrooms, they could perhaps be used more effectively for advanced courses as an introduction to or review of human body systems&nbsp; and the nature of complex systems.</p> <p>Based on interviews, teachers found the HBS platform easy to set up and navigate, and students found it easy to use. The professional development prepared teachers to use the technology in their classrooms. Most students related well to the technology. Teachers reported using HBS in ways that they believed strengthened their instruction. They indicated that the instructional reports helped them assess student understanding and allowed them to organize the introduction and review of content strategically.</p> <p>One teacher wrote, &ldquo;I think that the modules are an excellent way of bringing contextual cohesion to some of the concepts that I teach in my biology class. For instance, your coupling membrane transport with the process of respiration within a context (hiking and bicycle riding) that students can relate to, is beyond what I currently do when I teach the details of each process independently of one another. I must say that I believe that your modeling techniques definitely have a place in the curriculum because I have witnessed engagement and immersion as my students interacted with the program.&rdquo;</p> <p>An important finding from this study came from an in-depth analysis of a constructed response item in the benchmark assessment. This item required students to look at various data and integrate their knowledge and understanding to explain a complex phenomenon. This analysis found that the use of the complete HBS modules by treatment students in the study demonstrated clear gains in their ability to write complex integrated responses to the question compared to students who used only the benchmark assessment.</p> <p>Intellectual Merit: The SimScientists Human Body Systems Project illustrates the promise and the challenges of simulation-based instructional modules and assessments that foster integrated understanding of the complex systems of science.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/05/2016<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;G&nbsp;Brenner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1020264/1020264_10021217_1480541908825_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1020264/1020264_10021217_1480541908825_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Task from Instructional Module on Getting Molecules to Cells"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1020264/1020264_10021217_1480541908825_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Task from Instructional Module on Getting Molecules to Cells"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Task integrating the digestive and circulatory systems representing the absorption of molecules by the body.</div> <div class="imageCredit">WestEd</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;G&nbsp;Brenner</div> <div class="imageTitle">Task from Instructional Module on Getting Molecules to Cells</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1020264/1020264_10021217_1480542014272_Image2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1020264/1020264_10021217_1480542014272_Image2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Task from Instructional Module on Homeostasis"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1020264/1020264_10021217_1480542014272_Image2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Task from Instructional Module on Homeostasis"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Complex task that targets the connection between glycogen, glucose, and homeostasis.</div> <div class="imageCredit">WestEd</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;G&nbsp;Brenner</div> <div class="imageTitle">Task from Instructional Module on Homeostasis</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1020264/1020264_10021217_1480970443637_Image3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1020264/1020264_10021217_1480970443637_Image3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Teacher Home Page in Learning Management System"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1020264/1020264_10021217_1480970443637_Image3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Teacher Home Page in Learning Management System"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Teacher?s view of the SimScientists learning management system where teachers can try out the HBS modules, assign them to classes, and view reports.</div> <div class="imageCredit">WestEd</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;G&nbsp;Brenner</div> <div class="imageTitle">Teacher Home Page in Learning Management System</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1020264/1020264_10021217_1480971196965_Image4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1020264/1020264_10021217_1480971196965_Image4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Learning Management System Report for Teachers"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1020264/1020264_10021217_1480971196965_Image4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Learning Management System Report for Teachers"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Teachers can review an aggregate classroom report in the learning management system following the completion of a module.
