<AbstractNarration>The pharmaceutical supply chain is critical to the quality of our healthcare system and its performance depends on the correct application of order-fulfillment technology.  Industrial Engineering Ph.D. candidate Ms. Jennifer A. Pazour, in conjunction with her advisor Dr. Russell D. Meller, is conducting research that develops analytical models to analyze alternative piece-level order-fulfillment technologies that are prevalent in pharmaceutical distribution.  This doctoral dissertation enhancement project is focused on developing improved planning tools for the selection of order-fulfillment technology.  The research will be conducted in collaboration with the Technical University of Graz's Institute of Logistics Engineering and SSI Schaefer, a leading order-fulfillment technology provider.   Both organizations are located in Graz, Austria.  An optimization modeling approach will be developed and incorporated into a decision support tool that integrates Ms. Pazour's current dissertation research with her collaborators' mechanical understanding of the technologies.  Not only will the research improve on the selection of current order-fulfillment technology, it also has the potential to identify gaps in the market where new order-fulfillment technology could be developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through the Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Project, Ms. Pazour spent the Fall 2010 semester conducting order-fulfillment research at the heart of the order-fulfillment community in Graz, Austria.  Her academic host was the Graz University of Technology (TU Graz) and her industry host was SSI Schaefer-Peem, an order-fulfillment technology provider.  The intellectual merit generated through this grant includes the development of a mathematical-programming model that jointly determines the best combination of piece-level order-fulfillment technologies and the assignment of SKUs to these technologies.  Our model relaxes the sequential-modeling approach of previous research.   We validated our methodology with industry data and showed that our model provides technology recommendations and SKU assignments that are consistent with successful implementations.  Through an experimental design, we identified key factors in implementing manual versus automated order-fulfillment technologies and provided managerial insights into the application of different order-fulfillment technology strategies.  Our developed tool has significant potential benefits for practitioners, which include reducing the time to develop initial design concepts,  providing a formalized basis for evaluating alternative design concepts, reducing the educational time and training expenses for new employees, improving the solutions that new employees recommend, and gaining insights into order-fulfillment technologies and their applications.  The DDEP had broader impacts by enhancing Ms. Pazour's future research and career endeavors as an assistant professor.  The exposure to research at TU Graz, business at SSI Schaefer-Peem, and life in Graz, Austria broadened her understanding of another culture and perspective. Additionally, the industry-academic collaboration created through this project has led to continued collaborations with the University of Arkansas, TU Graz, and SSI Schaefer-Peem.
