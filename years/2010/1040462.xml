<AbstractNarration>1040462&lt;br/&gt;Popescu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for instrument development of a spatial light interference microscopy facility that will measure samples in both transmission and reflection modes. This quantitative phase imaging instrument will benefit diverse research efforts in the materials and life sciences. In particular, it will enable: (1) non-destructive inspection of nanostructures, semiconductor devices, and new materials such as graphene and carbon/semiconductor nanotubes, (2) observation of the dynamics of live cells and transport in neurons, and (3) exploration of new cancer detection techniques. Current topographic imaging technology severely constrains the size and sheer number of samples that can be measured at high resolution. Thus, the information gathered and new understanding obtained is thereby limited. Numerous new lines of research and opportunities for discovery in fields ranging from medicine and life sciences to semiconductors and material sciences will be enabled once this new form of fast microscopy is made accessible. Further, development of this transformative scientific instrument will provide rich opportunities to broadly integrate research and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have developed two novel microscopy systems, one for materials and one for life sciences. The two instruments will be open to the users on our campus and outside, in the Beckman InstituteÆs Microscopy Suite. The technology is based of Quantitative Phase Imaging, which yields label free quantitative investigation with nanoscale sensitivity.  Our state-of-the-art capability in light microscopy enables scientific breakthroughs in materials and life sciences, provides research training to personnel from undergraduate to post-doctoral levels, and integrates both formal and informal educational activities.

Development of educational materials to enable the next generation of scientists to better design and evaluate 1) instruments, 2) experiments in various fields involving nanostructures and, 3) educational approaches combining theory, experiments and simulations.  As a result of this project, we published 46 peer-reviewed journal publications, gave 80+ invited and keynote lectures, presented 100+ conference papers and posters, filed 14 patents of invention, graduated 8 PhD students, 10 master students, worked with 25 research undergraduates, Popescu wrote the first book on QPI [1], and edited another book on NanoBiophotonics [2]. The attached figures are adapted from the following publications: Fig.1 [3], Fig. 2 [4], Fig. 3 [5], Fig. 4 [6], Fig. 5 [7], Fig. 6 [8].  Phi Optics licensed IP from the university and commercializes SLIM instruments (www.phioptics.com).  Popescu continued to work with undergraduate students to generate biomedical optics lecture material for the two optics courses that he teaches: ECE 460 Optical Imaging and ECE 564 Modern light microscopy. These materials are posted for open access online (http://light.ece.illinois.edu/ECE460/ and http://light.ece.illinois.edu/ECE564/ ). Popescu is working on a new book, "Principles of Biomedical Optics", which will have two parts: Optics and Methods.     The GirlsÆ Learning Electrical Engineering camp was offered for the fifth time in July 2014. The Illinois Summer Academy (a partnership with UI extension and the 4-H club) for high school students was offered for a third time in June 2014. Prof. Goddard led the development of GLEE. It has been offered as an annual summer camp since 2010. A total of 93 girls ranging from entering 9th through entering 12th grade participated in the camp over five years: 19 (including 5 African-American and 4 Hispanic) in 2010, 20 (2 African-American) in 2011, 20 (2 African-American, 1 Hispanic) in 2012, 14 (2 African-American, 1 Hispanic) in 2013, and 22 (2 Hispanic) in 2014. Details of the GLEE curriculum have been included in past NSF MRI annual reports. In 2014, we added two new activities: a card game that teaches different sorting algorithms and a hands on project to build an optical imaging system, specifically, a color projector using an LED light source, a lens, a printed transparency, and cardstock paper to form an optical V-groove (to allow the students to vary the object distance from the lens). Both activites were well received. The projector activity was surprisingly inexpensive, only $4 per projector ($2 for the LED flashlight, under $2 for the lens, and negligible costs for the paper and transparency material). Given the activityÆs popularity, simplicity, and opportunity to teach key concepts in imaging, we intend to have this 1hr project as a display at Engineering Open House and at other campus outreach events.
