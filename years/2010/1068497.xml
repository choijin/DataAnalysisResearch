<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to support a workshop on 21st Century Kinematics, which will bring together experts and novices together to demonstrate the use of numerical algebraic geometry to solve current research problems in areas that are fundamental to advancing Kinematics.  These areas are united by the challenge of solving even larger systems of polynomials, specifically the analysis and synthesis of mechanisms and robots, compliant mechanisms, and tensegrity and cable-driven systems. In each case, the challenge of formulating and solving these polynomial systems is a significant obstacle. The workshop will explore new results in numerical algebraic geometry and improved computation that have the potential to provide tools for rapid derivation, analysis and solution of complex polynomial systems. This is critical to the advancement of mechanisms and robotics research into the 21st century. The intellectual merit of this workshop award centers on advancing the capabilities for research into the design of complex and innovative mechanical systems by introducing advanced techniques of numerical algebraic geometry to the mechanisms and robotics research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this workshop will provide an opportunity to build on past successes in the development of robotic systems, compliant and micro-electromechanical systems by using new mathematical formulations. In the 21st century, advances in information-driven systems and mechatronics demand even more innovation in mechanisms and robotics, in order to transform 'bits of information' into the 'bits of physical activity' needed to manipulate, transport and deliver goods and services. The presentations will be assembled into course notes to form the foundation of graduate courses in universities around the country that will balance theory with practice, and fundamental science with design innovation. This workshop has the potential to rapidly disseminate the computational tools of numerical algebraic geometry to a large number of researchers, and reset the expectations of what is possible in the design of increasingly complex mechanical systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Workshop on 21st Century Kinematics focused on algebraic problems in the analysis and synthesis of mechanisms and robots, compliant mechanisms and tensegrity and cable-driven systems.  Discussions at the 2010 and 2011 ASME Mechanisms and Robotics Conference resulted in a proposal for an NSF workshop to advance the analysis and design of machine systems.  This workshop echoes the NSF supported 1963 Yale Mechanisms Teachers Conference that taught a generation of university educators the fundamental principles of kinematic theory.  The workshop included over 70 participants and consisted of presentations by nine distinguished researchers.  The presentation slides of each speaker are accessible on-line through http://mechanicaldesign101.com (google search:  Workshop Presentations: 21st Century Kinematics).  A book of background papers by the presenters published by Springer was made available on-site for $25.00, and is not available in eBook form for $159.  The focus of this workshop was on the kinematic theory that underlies the design and analysis of innovative mechanical devices.  The presenters demonstrated how increasingly complex mechanical devices are characterized by in increasingly complex systems of polynomials.  In fact, It is routine for researchers to obtain polynomial systems that dwarf landmark kinematics problems of the recent past.  The primary outcome of this workshop was a broad understanding of the technological challenges of 21st Century Kinematics.  It also became clear that increasingly sophisticated computational tools, such as those based on numerical algebraic geometry, are needed to assist derivation and solution of these polynomial systems in areas such a robotics, protein kinematics, human rehabilitation, compliant mechanism design, and tensegrity systems.  Discussions for a follow-on workshop are scheduled during the 2013 ASME Mechanisms and Robotics Conference.             Last Modified: 06/02/2013       Submitted by: J.
