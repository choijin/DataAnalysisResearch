<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Don L. Warner at Boise State University for the summers of 2010-2012.  The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program.  The research projects focus on research in areas that span areas of chemistry and biology.  Sample projects include:  (1)  a study of the ways in which the coordinating metal alters the functionality of the peptide deformylase enzyme; (2)  the study of the DNA-binding properties of synthetic aziridinomitosenes; (3) the study of the substrate and inhibitor recognition by human carbonyl reductase; (4)  the study of quorum sensing in mutants of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus; (5)  the colorimetric detection of DNA with oligonucleotide-functionalized colloidal gold nanoparticles; (6)  the calculation of the structure and binding of conotoxin ligands with the acetylcholine-binding protein of A. californica; and (7) the study of the binding of actinides with dithiophosphonic acid ligands.    Besides being exposed to compelling research, the students participating in this program will participate in site visits, social activities, and professional development activities -- including sessions on peer mentoring (for returning students) and ethics in scientific research.  The site will recruit from first year students from regional 2-year and 4-year colleges with little research infrastructure.  Many of the targeted students are first-generation college students and members of other groups underrepresented in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide practical, hands-on research training to a significant number of students who might not have this opportunity at their home institution.  The interdisciplinary projects that the students will work on while at Boise State University, are excellent examples of the kinds of cross-disciplinary work that is becoming more and more typical of the most fruitful avenues for modern laboratory research.  Students participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

The students recruited were in their first or second year of college, since college students are most at risk for departure from the sciences (or even departure from college) during these critical first two years. Participation in undergraduate research programs has been shown to be effective at helping retain students.     Objective 2: Provide research opportunities to students who are at risk for early attrition in the STEM disciplines and are members of populations with low retention rates for continuation of their college education. We targeted recruiting efforts at two- and four-year partner schools with high enrollment of students who are underrepresented minorities, first generation college students, or are from rural communities. College students in any of these groups are more likely to leave college early compared to their peers.     Objective 3: Help prepare participants for success in college, graduate school, and the STEM workforce. We developed significant discipline-specific and interdisciplinary professional development and learning opportunities through a robust "Summer Research Community" that helped participants develop skills and expertise necessary for success in the STEM professions.     Objective 4: Determine the impact of early undergraduate research and interdisciplinary professional development on participants' attitudes, educational choices, and career decisions. While undergraduate research has been shown to be effective at retaining students in college, most undergraduate research activities are designed for students in their junior or senior years of college&mdash;i.e., for students who are least at risk for early attrition.

Students displayed gains in areas associated with critical thinking and problem solving, and developed independence as a result of the REU. With respect to the research being conducted by students, our external evaluator commented on "the deep level of sophistication of the research" and that "the level of sophistication with which REU students can discuss and describe their research is surprising, particularly for the new students who have, for the most part, taken only a single college chemistry course".     At this time, to the best of our knowledge, 6 participants received a STEM BS or BA deg...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
