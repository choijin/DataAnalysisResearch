<AbstractNarration>The ultimate science objective of this project is clarification of the distribution of water and other volatiles in the deep interior of the Earth. Uniquely among the planets, Earth has oceans at its surface that are key to the origin and support of life. It has been postulated that mantle rocks at depths between 410 and 660 km store about 10 times as much water as is in the world oceans, and that the global water cycle extends from the atmosphere down to the mid-mantle.  For example, Earth's mantle may serve as a reservoir for water, buffering the oceans from variations that might be induced by surface geological processes. In this project we are using novel electromagnetic geophysical methods to image electrical conductivity variations in the mantle deep beneath Earth's surface.  Because the conductivity of mantle rocks is highly sensitive to even small amounts of water, these images will allow us to constrain the distribution of water in the deep Earth, and improve our understanding of deep Earth water cycles.  Results of this research have the potential to impact our understanding of the evolution of the oceans, and perhaps ultimately life itself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To improve resolution of upper mantle and transition zone electrical conductivity we will exploit large scale electric currents induced by the flow of periodic ocean tidal currents through the Earth's main magnetic field. We are using an extensive base of seafloor data collected over the past 30 years to estimate the tidal electromagnetic field in the semidiurnal and diurnal bands, and then combining these (along with terrestrial geomagnetic data) with a 3D tidal simulation to invert for mantle electrical structure. The seafloor database consists of both cable and point electric and magnetic field measurements that are heavily concentrated in the Pacific basin, which is thus the focus of our study. Key to the success of the effort is the recent great improvement in our knowledge of open-ocean tidal currents that has resulted from modern satellite altimetry, and sophisticated data assimilation schemes. Combination of models of the tidal forcing function with 3D electrical conductivity models, and then constraining them with measurements, is the technical approach that will lead to the science objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Geophysics and Marine Geology &amp; Geophysics Programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past several decades it has become increasingly clear that significant quantities of water, perhaps several times the volume of the surface ocean, may be stored in Earth's deep interior, effectively dissolved in the minerals that make up the bulk of the mantle.  The actual volume and distribution remain highly uncertain, but the presence of water would modify the mechanical properties and melting behavior of the deep Earth, with profound implications for the geological history and evolution of the planet.  Laboratory experiments show that electrical conductivity of mantle minerals is very sensitive to even small amounts of water, increasing by a factor of ten or more, with the addition of even a fraction of a percent of water. Thus, electromagnetic (EM) geophysical methods, which can provide images of subsurface conductivity from surface data, represents an ideal probe of mantle water content.  However, at  upper mantle/transition zone depths of 200-400 km very low frequency electromagnetic data (with frequencies of a few to one cycle per day) are required, and traditional electromagnetic induction approaches break down: obtaining reliable electric field data is very difficult, and external source fields in the ionosphere are spatially complex and poorly constrained.  This project has pursued development of an alternative approach to EM imaging of the upper mantle, using the electric currents induced by oceanic tidal flow through EarthÃ†s main field. The tidal flow is now well-constrained through dynamical models that assimilate modern satellite altimeter data.  This project funded development of modeling and inversion methods for tidal EM harmonic constants on the seafloor, and made initial steps towards applying this to a large compilation of such data in the Pacific ocean.  This work continues as of this writing, with an advanced graduate student working on completing initial inversions of the tidal EM data.
