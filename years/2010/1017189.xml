<AbstractNarration>AF: Small: Algorithmic Foundations of Phylogenetic Tree Reconciliation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A phylogenetic tree represents the genealogy of a set of species. One of the grand challenges in computational biology is to build the Tree of Life, the phylogenetic tree describing the evolutionary history of all extant species.  A major obstacle to assembling this or indeed any large tree reliably is the sparseness of the coverage provided by the available genomic data. That is, the same genetic information may not be at our disposal for all species.  For example, a gene may not have been sequenced for a species of interest or the gene may simply be absent from that species. One approach to address this problem is to find a collection of overlapping subsets of the species, each of which has the property that similar genetic data is available for every species in the subset. A phylogenetic tree is built for each subset and then the trees are combined into a single supertree for the entire set of species. Building supertrees is nontrivial, as it involves reconciling conflicts among the various input trees with regard to the placement of certain species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will address the fundamental algorithmic problems that arise in reconciling multiple conflicting phylogenetic trees into a single supertree that represents them all. The reconciliation problem will be treated as one of finding a supertree whose total dissimilarity with the input trees is minimum. The research will study the mathematical and computational properties of tree reconciliation under a variety of measures.  Some of these will be based purely on tree structure; for example, on what groupings a tree implies on its species set.  The PIs will also study what are sometimes referred to as gene tree parsimony problems.  Here, the dissimilarity measures attempt to identify the possible occurrence of complex evolutionary events such as gene duplication and subsequent loss, and horizontal gene transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research aims to advance the theory of tree reconciliation and to use the results as the foundation for novel algorithmic methods. The work will build on significant recent theoretical developments in the field. Techniques will include graph theory, fast local search, axiomatic characterizations of tree reconciliation methods, impossibility proofs, compact integer linear programming formulations, and fixed parameter tractability. Specific questions to be addressed include developing methods to handle non-binary trees, extending distance measures to account for missing data, understanding which properties can or cannot be satisfied by a particular method or by any method, and resolving a number of open problems in gene tree parsimony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be informed by the needs of the evolutionary biology community, with which both PIs have an extensive and longstanding collaboration. The results will be widely disseminated within that community. It is anticipated that several of the algorithmic techniques developed in this project will be of direct utility in phylogenetic tree databases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Phylogenetics addresses one of the fundamental problems in science: understanding how the organisms around us evolved to their present state. This evolutionary history is depicted by a phylogenetic tree.  Phylogenetics offers biologists the basic tools to elucidate the function of genes in particular organisms by comparing them to similar genes in closely related species.  At the same time, phylogenetics poses deep and elegant challenges to computer science.  These challenges have been the focus of the PIs' work.  The PIs have developed algorithms, software, and mathematical techniques to construct phylogenetic trees effectively.  To this end, they have tackled two major obstacles: (1) lack of data and (2) conflict among the data. The PIs have addressed issue (1) by investigating methods that combine trees for relatively small subsets of species into larger, more comprehensive phylogenies, called supertrees. Issue (2), conflict, arises because of errors in phylogeny construction or because of certain events that have a major role in evolution, such as gene duplication, loss, and horizontal transfer.  The PIs have addressed conflict from various perspectives, accounting for both error and the possible occurrence of meaningful evolutionary events.   The PIs have strived to bring theory into practice, producing software that is based on solid theoretical principles, is tested thoroughly on real and simulated data, and is fast, robust, and easy to use.  Their work has benefitted from their longstanding collaborations with biologists.  Indeed, the PIs' research has contributed to major projects in evolutionary biology, such as the development of a database with over a hundred million phylogenetic trees, and the development of algorithms for the Open Tree of Life, which aims to build a comprehensive phylogeny for all known species.  Their collaborations have given the PIs access to datasets on which to assess the quality of their algorithms and software.  All of the software produced by their work and all of their datasets are publicly and freely available for download.    Broader Impacts  Phylogenetic trees are of broad utility to society.  Ecologists use phylogenetic trees to estimate the degree of biodiversity in a geographical region, allowing them to analyze rates of species extinction.  In medicine, phylogenetic trees model disease progression.  Techniques from phylogenetics are used beyond the confines of biology, to understand the development of human languages and political systems.  The PIs are applying phylogenetics to the study of legumes.  The importance of legumes as a food crop is undisputed; legumes are also unique in their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, a process that is essential for agriculture.  Legume phylogenies, and, in particular, reconstructions of their history of gene duplication, enable researchers to leverage information across legume crops. For example, agronomic characteristics identified in soybean can be valuable in common bean and peanut and chickpea, and vice versa.     The project has supported the training of several PhD students, including a female.  These former students now work in academia, medical research, and different areas of industry.  The research has also led to a number of senior capstone projects for undergraduate students.       Last Modified: 10/23/2015       Submitted by: David F Fernandez-Baca]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
