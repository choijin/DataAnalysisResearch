<AbstractNarration>Anumba 1032164&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for PI Anumba Chimay from Pennsylvania State University to organize a 4-day international workshop on the use of computing and information technology (IT) as driver of new innovations in the area of sustainable buildings. The workshop will be held in Abuja, Nigeria from Nov. 29 - Dec. 2, 2010. The goal of the workshop is to create a cooperative framework which will allow US and Nigerian researchers to partner on new projects dealing with sustainable buildings using the Nigerian environment as a natural laboratory for studies and experiments. The workshop is also intended to result in improved understanding of the technical challenges involved in engendering a culture of innovation and sustainability in a developing country. Dr. Valentine Ekechukwu, professor at the University of Nigeria and Director for Innovation and Research at the Nigerian Universities Commission will work closely with Dr. Chimay in the organization of this workshop. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Global Center of Excellence in Computing is also providing some support and will post the workshop outcomes on its website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The primary goal of the workshop is to advance fundamental research in the interrelated areas of innovation and sustainability through their integration based on the use of computing and Information Technology (IT). The first step in this process is the creation of a cooperative framework, which will allow US researchers to work with their Nigerian partners on sustainability using the Nigerian environment as a perfect natural laboratory for studies and experiments, particularly those related to solar power. The next step will involve developing research partnerships (during the workshop and immediately after it), resulting in the submission of a joint NSF PIRE proposal.  The PIs expect that the outcome of the workshop will be a number of joint research projects addressing fundamental research questions, both theoretical and experimental, in the area of sustainability, questions which could not be answered without access to the Nigerian research talents and environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Pennsylvania State University has a well-developed Global Engagement Nodes (GENs) program that has provision for a service learning component, a model that will be used formulate the US-Nigeria collaboration discussions at the workshop.  Graduate students and junior scientists will receive support to participate in the workshop.  As the first NSF workshop in Nigeria being organized in cooperation with the National Universities Commission, its impact on the Nigerian researchers will be significant and will lead to a renewed interest in cooperation with the American scholars and institutions.  The workshop materials will be distributed by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and specifically by the ASCE Global Center of Excellence in Computing, which is helping with the organization of the workshop. The materials will be made available on the Center's website (www.asceglobalcenter.org) and will be promoted by the Center.  Since the Center has members on all continents, the PI expects a global impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering's Africa, Near East and South Asia Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of the NSF workshop was to provide a forum for US scientists and researchers to interact with their Nigerian counterparts with a view to:  -          Understanding the key issues in the development of innovative design approaches to sustainable buildings;  -          Comparing and contrasting the approaches to engendering innovation in the design of sustainable buildings in a developing country (Nigeria) and a developed country (USA);  -          Exploring the extent to which local materials and design practices can be deployed in the development of sustainable buildings;  -          Developing an agenda for future joint research initiatives that will facilitate knowledge exchange between the US and Nigeria.     In addition to the above, the workshop will also explore the potential for a multi-faceted approach to engaging the industry in both countries.     Summary of Project Outcomes      The workshop provided an excellent platform for interaction between the US researchers and their Nigerian counterparts. Some of the outomes of the workshop include the following:     1. There is considerable opportunity for research and educational activities in Nigeria relating to the innovative design of sustainable buildings.     2. A good number of Nigerian academics have a strong interest in collaborating with US and other international researchers in the development of the sustainable buildings agenda in Nigeria.     3. The development of sustainable buildings in Nigeria is closely linked with a broad range of other issues that may need to be addressed in concert with sustainable building initiatives. These include: energy generation and distribution, transportation infrastructure, water supply and wastewater systems, information and communication technology systems, etc. In response to this, the team has developed a White paper for an integrated research effort that will address these issues. Funding for this is being jointly explored by the US-based scientists and their Nigerian colleagues.     4. The US Embassy in Nigeria is very interested in working with the workshop participants to advance the subject of Sustainable Buildings in Nigeria and has pledged to help facilitate a follow-on workshop that also engages industry practitioners.     5. There was limited industry participation in the workshop despite invitations to a number of professional bodies. There is scope for a follow-on workshop that focuses more on industry rather than academics, as this will help to explore the practical implementation difficulties (e.g. funding, codes of practice, traditional design norms, etc.) that have an impact on the design of sustainable buildings.     6. The design and construction of a set of exemplar sustainable buildings would be essential in communicating/demonstrating the benefits of sustainable buildings to a wider audience. The National Universities Commission (in NIgeria) is exploring local funding for this.          Last Modified: 12/15/2011       Submitted by: Chimay Anumba]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
