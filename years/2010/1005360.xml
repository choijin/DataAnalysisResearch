<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-1005360&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Carolyn S. Gordon, Alexander Barnett, Peter A. Perry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A week-long International Conference on Spectral Geometry will be held at Dartmouth College July 19--23, 2010.  The primary themes of the conference will be Quantum Unique Ergodicity, which addresses the behavior of the highly excited states in the quantization of ergodic Hamiltonian systems, and Inverse Spectral Geometry, which asks the extent to which spectral data associated with the Laplacian or other natural operators encode the geometry of a Riemannian manifold.  In addition to spectral problems on Riemannian manifolds, there will be a secondary focus on the related topic of quantum graphs, in which the one-dimensional Laplacian acts along edges, and waves scatter at vertices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both quantum unique ergodicity and inverse spectral geometry are areas of intense research activity in mathematics, bridging geometry, analysis and number theory, and both have strong ties to physics.  By bringing together experts and young researchers with various perspectives and expertise, the conference will promote new collaborations and interactions and contribute to the advancement of research in these areas.  The conference will be preceded by a two-day intensive workshop, aimed at graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s, to prepare for the conference themes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An International Conference on Spectral Geometry was held at Dartmouth College July 19--23, 2010.  The funds provided by the National Science Foundation were used primarily for travel support for doctoral students and recent Ph.D.'s to attend.   The conference was preceded by a two-day workshop consisting of three minicourses to prepare the participants, especially the students, for the conference lectures.   The goal of the conference was to bring together researchers in spectral geometry, including students as well as worldwide experts, to stimulate new ideas and directions, establish new research collaborations, enhance existing collaborations, and advance the knowledge and understanding of the participants, especially the students and recent Ph.D.'s.   The conference was highly successful in all these aspects.    One of the unifying themes of the conference was a flurry of recent exciting developments in quantum ergodicity.  Physicists have long known that classical Newtonian mechanics is superbly effective at modeling the dynamical behavior of macroscopic bodies at low velocities, but that the description of dynamics on a microscopic scale requires the theory of quantum mechanics, whose underlying mathematical framework is quite different.  However, the emergence of classical Newtonian mechanics at macroscopic scales from quantum mechanics is still poorly understood.  It is been conjectured that the quantum counterpart of a ``chaotic'' classical system (roughly speaking, one in which a small perturbation in the initial conditions results in a drastic change in particle trajectories) should, at high energies, approach a ``uniform distribution,'' one in which a particle is equally likely to be anywhere.  While this conjecture is out of reach in general, some recent advances in the arithmetic setting (when powerful methods of analytic number theory can be brought to bear) have confirmed the conjecture in a variety of cases.  A second major theme was inverse spectral geometry, which asks the extent to which the geometry of an object, such as a vibrating membrane, is encoded in spectral data such as vibrational frequencies.   Spectral geometry brings together analysis, geometry, and number theory and plays an important role in quantum physics.   In addition to spectral geometry on manifolds, the conference addressed the spectral theory of quantum graphs.  The theory ofquantum graphs is another arena in which the relationship between spectra andgeometry fruitfully come together, and there is much cross fertilization betweenthe inverse spectral theory of quantum graphs and that of Riemannian manifolds.     The conference program included approximately twenty lectures on recent advances and newly developed techniques, a poster session in which doctoral students had the opportunity to present their research projects, an open problem session, and a break-out session.    Numerous participants, both senior experts and students, have reported new directions in their research as a result of the conference.   Many others found new approaches to their research problems.   The conference and workshop contributed to the research development of the doctoral students and young researchers, both through the formal program and through the high level of informal discussions between students and senior experts.
