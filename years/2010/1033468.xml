<AbstractNarration>1033468&lt;br/&gt;Young&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green chemistry and green engineering approaches are the product and process design philosophies necessary to unite continuing economic prosperity with environmental and public health protection. The sharing of the precepts and advances in these areas within the expert community and with potential new students has been the mission of the American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute, utilizing the annual Green Chemistry &amp; Engineering Conference as chief vehicle. Dr. Jennifer Young serves as the PI for ACS Green Chemistry Institute. The theme of the 14th Annual Conference is Innovation and Application which is aligned with current imperatives for science studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is expected to draw some 400+ experts from industry, academe and government to discuss the concepts and recent advances in the areas. The student participants will be exposed to this exciting environment including the principles of green chemistry and engineering, the newest research in the area and the approaches and methodologies for dealing with environmental issues in an economically beneficial manner. In addition, they will have a forum for presenting their own research and for developing potential future collaborations. Specific student-oriented events will include a full day Student Workshop following the conference proceedings which will focus on hands-on outreach activities to bring back to their respective communities, a student research poster session with prizes, and a student award session concurrent with the presentation of the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards by the Environmental Protection Agency.The NSF award is to fund travel grants, student housing and conference registration for under-graduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, as well as to cover Workshop Instructor expenses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this grant was to provide student education and participation in green chemistry and engineering (GC&amp;E) through educational activities at the 14th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference, June 21-23, 2010.  Student (undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral) involvement was increased by providing:  Student travel scholarships to participate in the GC&amp;E Conference;  A judged student poster session and student awards presented at the GC&amp;E Conference; and A full day Student Workshop and one hour Youth Outreach Event following the conference, on June 24, 2010.    The National Science FoundationÆs funding provided 32 student travel awards to undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students from 20 different colleges/universities for the 14th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference.  The award was extremely competitive this year, with 58% of the applications selected for award through the judging process.  The students were graduate students (59%), undergraduates (22%), and postdoctoral fellows (19%).   Through the design of chemical reactions and processes that reduce or eliminate negative impacts on human health and the environment, green chemistry and green engineering approaches seek to achieve the twin goals of economic prosperity and sustainability.  Green chemistry and engineering are important tools in preventing pollution at the source and providing solutions to global sustainability challenges. This highly interdisciplinary workshop and conference allowed students to learn to present their research, learn the latest developments in green chemistry and engineering from leading thinkers in the field, and expose themselves to the broader economic, social and political context in which these developments occur.  Furthermore, through the workshop, students learned how to lead outreach activities.  Educating the innovators of tomorrow on both the science and their ability to communicate it is a crucial part in securing the well-being of the future.  The full day student workshop was offered on June 24, 2010, the day following the conference, to enhance the experience for student conference attendees and offer training and hands-on experience with leading outreach activities. This NSF grant also provided funding to offset speaker travel costs. The workshop was fortunate to have the leaders in green chemistry outreach and training as instructors. There were 38 participants in the Student Workshop (including 19 of the NSF Scholars).  The workshop was an optional event for all students attending the conference, including the NSF Scholars.  The nature of this yearÆs Student Workshop was a departure from workshops held in the past in association with the Annual GC&amp;E Conference, which were lecture-style introductions to green chemistry and engineering held on the day preceding the conference.  Even the brightest students in the classroom and laboratory can have a challenging time translating their science and research to the general public. This student workshop was designed to take some of the lessons learned throughout the conference and put them into action.  Students learned why green chemistry outreach is so valuable and how they can be a green chemistry ambassador at their school and in their community.   After the morning of training, the newly trained students then led five outreach activities during a one hour Youth Outreach Event, held at the National Education Association building. Over 80 children and camp councilors from the YMCA and Camp Fire USA participated in the hugely successful Youth Outreach Event.  During the event, children had a chance to do five different green chemistry activities, including making blackberry solar cells, making glue, learning about biomimicry through a matching game, learning about the environmental impact factor (E-factor), and making a photoresist.  Green chemistry offers concrete solutions to many of the environmental challenges that societ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
