<AbstractNarration>There is an increasing gap between the assumptions governing the use of cyber-enabled resources in schools and the realities of their use by students in out of school settings.  The potential of information and communications technologies (ICT) as cognitive tools for engaging students in scientific inquiry and enhancing teacher learning is explored.  A comprehensive professional development program of over 240 hours, along with follow-up is used to determine how teachers can be supported to use ICT tools effectively in classroom instruction to create meaningful learning experiences for students, reducing the gap between formal and informal learning and improve student learning outcomes.  In the first year, six teachers from school districts - two in Utah and one in New York - are educated to become teacher leaders and advisors.  Then three cohorts of 30 teachers matched by characteristics are provided professional development and field test units over two years in a delayed-treatment design.  Biologists from Utah State University and New York College of Technology develop four modules that meet the science standards for both states - the first being changes in the environment.  Teachers are guided to develop additional modules.  The key technological resource to be used in the project is the Opensimulator 3D application Server (OpenSim), an open source, modular, expandable platform used to create simulated 3D spaces with customizable terrain, weather and physics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research methodology includes the use of the classroom observations using RTOP and Technology Use in Science Instruction (TUSI), selected interviews of teachers and students and validated assessments of student learning.  Evaluation, by an external evaluator, assesses the quality of the professional development and the quality of the cyber-enabled learning resources, as well as reviews the research design and implementation.  An Advisory Board will monitor the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is to determine the professional development needed to make teachers comfortable teaching with multi-user simulations and communications that students use everyday.  The enactment with OpenSim also provides an opportunity to demonstrate the level of planning and preparation that go into fashioning modules with all selected cyber-enabled cognitive tools framed by constructivism, such as GoogleEarth and Biologica.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Collaborative Research:  Cyber-enabled Learning: Digital Natives in Integrated Scientific Inquiry Classrooms   Project Outcomes Report     This was a research and development project that sought to address the following NSF identified challenges: "How can all students be assured the opportunity to learn significant STEM content?" "How can we enhance the ability of teachers to provide STEM education?" and "How are effective innovations successfully implemented, scaled, and sustained in schools and districts in a cost effective manner?".  The project was a collaborative effort between the University of Connecticut/Utah State University and the New York Institute of Technology. The project focused on enhancing teacher and student learning by taking advantage of the enormous potential of emerging technologies to better engage students in science classrooms. The overarching goal of the project was to determine whether teacher professional development and support using technology and online resources would lead to meaningful student learning experiences and outcomes. A comprehensive professional development program was designed and delivered for teachers, while changes in teaching and teacher and student learning were assessed.  Intellectual Merit. This project advanced knowledge and understanding in the field of science education by 1) providing a model of professional development for teachers that improved their science teaching through the use of technology and online resources, 2) examining the ways in which teachers and students use technologies inside and outside of school and how teacher professional development focused on effectively using technologies changed the ways in which technologies were used inside classrooms, and 3) designing and refining ways to incorporate technologies into science lessons that led to the better science learning outcomes and developed students? new literacy skills. The project also helped demonstrate the positive outcomes that can emerge when teachers are supported with professional development.  Specifically, teachers participating in this project improved their teaching and ways of integrating technologies into science classrooms, which in turn led to documented improvements in student learning.  Broader Impacts. This project informed others beyond those involved in the project by 1) documenting how student learning was enriched by the increased use of technologies and online resources in classrooms, 2) published articles in journals for teachers, researchers, and the public detailing how teachers nationally could use materials like those created in this project and how teachers who used these materials within the project changed their teaching and improved their students? learning, and 3) led to the creation and dissemination of a set of customizable technology enhanced science lessons and units that were made available to teachers nationally.  In the end, this project helped demonstrate the potential that exists for transforming science learning as teachers are supported to teach and students are empowered to learn with technology rather than from technology.
