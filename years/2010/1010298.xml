<AbstractNarration>This project explores from various angles the deep and&lt;br/&gt;intricate connections between the topology and geometry&lt;br/&gt;of a space, the algebraic structure of its fundamental&lt;br/&gt;group, and the algebraic geometry of the associated&lt;br/&gt;cohomology jumping loci.  The study is done in a context&lt;br/&gt;which abstracts two of the crucial features that make&lt;br/&gt;the dictionary between topology and algebra work so&lt;br/&gt;well for complements of hyperplane arrangements:&lt;br/&gt;formality (which leads to the Tangent Cone Theorem,&lt;br/&gt;relating the characteristic and resonance varieties), and&lt;br/&gt;quasi-projectivity (which insures that the characteristic&lt;br/&gt;varieties consist of possibly translated subtori). Together,&lt;br/&gt;these two properties put strong constraints on the geometry&lt;br/&gt;of the resonance varieties, leading to powerful obstructions&lt;br/&gt;to finitely presented groups being realizable as fundamental&lt;br/&gt;groups of smooth, (quasi-) projective complex varieties.&lt;br/&gt;Recently, new connections have emerged, relating the cohomology&lt;br/&gt;jumping loci of a space to the homological finiteness properties&lt;br/&gt;of its free abelian covers, and thereby to the structure of the&lt;br/&gt;Dwyer-Fried and Bieri-Neumann-Strebel-Renz invariants.&lt;br/&gt;Generalizations of the classical jump loci---from rank one&lt;br/&gt;local systems to the non-abelian setting, and from cohomology&lt;br/&gt;rings to differential graded algebras---extend the scope of&lt;br/&gt;the investigation, and broaden the range of its applicability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topological and group-theoretic methods utilized&lt;br/&gt;in this project shed new light on the combinatorial and&lt;br/&gt;geometric structure of objects occurring in a variety&lt;br/&gt;of contexts, allowing for cross-pollination between&lt;br/&gt;different fields, with ideas originating in a given area&lt;br/&gt;being fruitfully applied in new settings.  The theory of&lt;br/&gt;cohomology jumping loci impacts the study of a wide&lt;br/&gt;array of spaces and groups, including toric complexes&lt;br/&gt;and moment-angle complexes; right-angled Artin and&lt;br/&gt;Coxeter groups; real and complex quasi-toric manifolds;&lt;br/&gt;Kaehler and quasi-Kaehler manifolds; Milnor fibrations&lt;br/&gt;of hyperplane arrangements; as well as configuration&lt;br/&gt;spaces and compactifications of moduli spaces.&lt;br/&gt;The study of these objects, with their multiple&lt;br/&gt;connections to the theory of singularities, graph&lt;br/&gt;theory, and low-dimensional topology, provides a&lt;br/&gt;rich interplay between algebra, topology, and&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, yielding applications to areas&lt;br/&gt;ranging from topological robotics to theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science. The investigation is being conducted&lt;br/&gt;together with several collaborators, as well as graduate&lt;br/&gt;and undergraduate students.  Participation in intensive&lt;br/&gt;research periods and workshops is meant to introduce a&lt;br/&gt;new generation of students and young researchers to a&lt;br/&gt;very active, interdisciplinary area of study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, the PI investigated from various angles the deep and intricate connections between the topology and geometry of a space, the algebraic structure of its fundamental group, and the algebraic geometry of the associated cohomology jumping loci. This study has led to a variety of applications in group theory, low-dimensional topology, singularity theory, hyperplane arrangements, toric topology, configuration spaces, and related fields.  Notable outcomes of this research (done in collaboration with several mathematicians and graduate students) include:   A solution to a conjecture regarding the homological finiteness properties of the Johnson filtration of the automorphism group of a free group. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the vanishing of resonance varieties attached to representations of Lie algebras. New relations between the cohomology jumping loci of a space and the finiteness properties of its abelian covers. The discovery of sufficient conditions (in terms of duality properties) that insure the propagation of resonance in higher degrees. The determination of the rational cohomology ring of real quasi-toric manifolds. Classification of those groups that occur as both fundamental groups of 3-dimensional manifolds and smooth, algebraic varieties, under less restrictive assumptions than in previous research. Significant progress towards understanding the homology of the Milnor fiber of a hyperplane arrangement in purely combinatorial terms.    The topological and group-theoretic methods utilized in this project shed new light on the combinatorial and geometric structure of objects occurring in diverse contexts, allowing for cross-pollination between different fields, with ideas originating in a given area being fruitfully applied in new settings.    The theory of cohomology jumping loci impacts the study of a wide array of spaces and groups, revealing hidden connections between various strands of research.  The study of these objects, which provide both qualitative and quantitative answers to a wide array of questions, provides a rich interplay between algebra, topology, and combinatorics, yielding applications to areas ranging from topological robotics to protein function prediction to theoretical computer science.
