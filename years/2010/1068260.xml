<AbstractNarration>Trabecular bone is the sponge-like bone tissue present in the internal regions of bone near joints and in the vertebral centrum.  It has long been known that trabecular bone structure is aligned with mechanical stresses caused by habitual activities but it remains unclear how such alignment occurs.  The research goals of this project are to: 1) establish methods to determine the spatial relationship between trabecular bone tissue stress/stain and bone formation following a single bout of cyclic compressive loading; and 2) determine if the local population of osteocytes (a type of bone cell believed to be responsible for sensing mechanical stimuli) influences the spatial relationship between tissue stress/strain and bone formation.  In this project osteocyte populations are determined by detecting the microscopic holes where osteocytes reside within bone tissue.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trabecular bone is a major structural component in regions of the skeleton prone to osteoporosis-related fractures (hip, wrist, spine) and understanding how mechanical stimuli influence trabecular bone structure has the potential to improve fracture risk assessment and fracture risk prevention strategies.  The methods generated in the work will enhance teaching through integration into a graduate course entitled "Mechanics of Bone."  Additionally, as part of this project the investigators will contribute to an annual workshop targeted to undergraduates and graduate students from an under-represented group with the goal of helping prepare the students for graduate school and careers in science and engineering.  The scientific work in the project will be disseminated through presentations at scientific conferences and publications in scientific journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The idea that bone adapts in shape in response to habitual mechanical stimulation originated over 150 years ago and was based on observations that internal structures of bone are aligned to resist mechanical stresses that occur during walking and other physical activity. While it is known that increased loading due to exercise can make bones more robust, it is not known if the internal structure of bone can realign in an adult animal.     In this study we used high resolution imaging and mechanical modeling to test the idea that when bone gets more dense following exercise, it is because new material is added specifically at the regions of the internal structure that are carrying the most load.  To date we have found a strong correlation between mechanical stress/strain and regions of new bone formation (see Figure), but mechanical models were only able to predict 32% of bone formation, suggesting that there are other factors important in determining where new bone tissue is added following mechanical stimulus.     The findings from this study will influence the fields of medicine in which the importance of exercise to the health of the musculoskeletal system. Additionally the work is useful in the field of physical anthropology, in that it makes it possible to estimate the physical activity of extinct species based on observations of the internal structure of rare fossil bones.     The scientific components of the work were presented at national meetings (the Orthopaedic Resaerch Society 2014 and 2015 annual meetings). The work has, to date, been presented in two peer-reviewed publications and another two publications are in preparation.     As part of the broader impacts the PI and participating graduate students contributed to an annual program seeking to broader participation in science and engineering by an under-represented group (Hispanic) by organizing scientific poster and paper sessions at the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers national meeting. Each year 109-204 abstracts were submitted and over 100 undergraduates and graduate students participated. Over the three years of the project 90% of abstract submissions were from students self-identifying as Hispanic.  30% of abstracts were submitted by women.  Of the undergraduates, 92% of abstracts were submitted by students planning on attending graduate school.  Of the Ph.D students, 89% of applicants are pursuing careers as academics.  The program is therefore attracting students interested in pursuing research careers.
