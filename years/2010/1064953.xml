<AbstractNarration>Spatial diversity has proved to be very effective in increasing wireless network capacity and reliability. However, equipping a wireless node with multiple antennas may not always be practical.  This project explores Cooperative Communications (CC), where each node is only equipped with a single antenna and spatial diversity is achieved by exploiting the antennas on other nodes in the network. Although CC at the physical layer has been under intensive research in recent years, fundamental understanding of CC in ad hoc networks remains limited.  The goal of this project is to optimize network level throughput by exploiting cooperative relaying at the physical layer.  This project focuses on designing network level algorithms based on analytical models for cooperative relaying such that network level throughput can be maximized. Specifically, there are three inter-dependent research thrusts in this project: (1) optimal use of network coding in cooperative relay networks; (2) relay node selection for throughput maximization; and (3) performance limits of cooperation in multi-hop relay networks. This research serves a critical need in advancing cooperative relay network research by developing new mathematical tools to study some open and important problem areas.  The success of this project offers a major step forward in establishing its theoretical foundation. The research on throughput optimization also leads to the development of new algorithmic and optimization tools that are beyond the traditional domain of convex optimization. An important educational objective of this project is to develop new cross-disciplinary course materials for wireless networking.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A critical factor affecting the throughput of wireless communications between a transmit node and a receive node is channel quality.  Channel quality is intrinsic to the underlying radio propagation environment and cannot be easily modified or improved.  Although channel quality between two nodes cannot be changed, one could exploit the differences in channel quality among the neighboring nodes (also known as spatial diversity) to improve throughput.  To make this work, it is necessary to have the nodes in the network cooperate among themselves so as to enable the desired effect.  This is the focus of this project.   There are a number of milestones and highlights from our investigation.  In our paper titled "Joint flow routing and relay node assignment in cooperative multi-hop networks" (IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, vol. 30, no. 2, February 2012), we explored spatial diversity based on a simple three-node mode.  We studied how this model can be applied to relay node assignment and flow routing for a set of communication sessions. We developed a novel solution to solve a joint relay node assignment and flow routing problem.  Our results showed that significant improvement in throughput can be realized by incorporating cooperative communications.  But one problem we found in cooperative communications is its overhead. To mitigate this problem, network coding was considered.  This is what we call network-coded cooperative communications (NC-CC).  In our paper titled "Network coding in cooperative communications: Friend or foe?" (IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, vol. 11, no. 7, July 2012), we showed that although NC could reduce time slots needed for CC, it also introduces something call NC noise, which could adversely reduce throughput.

In "Network-Coded Cooperative Communications with Multiple Relay Nodes: Achievable Rate and Network Optimization" (Elsevier Ad Hoc Networks, vol. 53, December 2016), we further studied the relay node selection problem and develop closed form formulas for the mutual information and the achievable data rate for each session.

We have published a textbook titled "Applied Optimization Methods for Wireless Networks" (Cambridge University Press, 2014), with several chapters in the book coming directly from this research project.
