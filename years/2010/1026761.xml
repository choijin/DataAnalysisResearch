<AbstractNarration>The University System of Maryland (USM) Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP)&lt;br/&gt;seeks funding to add a fifth cohort of Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Fellows to its current retention&lt;br/&gt;initiatives. The first cohort of BD Fellows matriculated at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County&lt;br/&gt;(UMBC) in the fall of 2005. In fall 2006, the second cohort of fellows enrolled at the University of&lt;br/&gt;Maryland, College Park (UMCP). The third cohort enrolled at UMCP in the fall of 2008 and the fourth&lt;br/&gt;cohort enrolled at UMBC in the fall of 2009. Since the first BD cohort matriculated at UMBC in 2005,&lt;br/&gt;there have been 48 BD Fellows enrolled in STEM graduate programs at UMBC and UMCP. Eleven&lt;br/&gt;students have completed MS degrees and 37 students are still enrolled.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#56256;&amp;#56473; INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will provide a cohort of 12 students who have participated in LSAMP Programs, as&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates, the opportunity to receive substantial funding and other critical support to successfully&lt;br/&gt;pursue graduate degrees in diverse STEM fields at one of the nation?s top research universities. The&lt;br/&gt;participants also will have opportunities, early in their academic careers, to conduct cutting-edge research&lt;br/&gt;with top research scientists on the UMCP campus and at national laboratories located in close proximity&lt;br/&gt;to the campus. The following will be required of BD fellows:&lt;br/&gt;? To participate in community meetings and individual advising meetings;&lt;br/&gt;? To apply for the NSF Graduate Student Research Fellowship during the first year;&lt;br/&gt;? To serve as role models to current undergraduate LSAMP students in the process of applying for&lt;br/&gt;graduate school;&lt;br/&gt;? To present research at national or local conferences;&lt;br/&gt;? To participate in the University System of Maryland?s Graduate Research Symposium;&lt;br/&gt;? To attend and present posters at the NSF Joint Annual Meeting (JAM);&lt;br/&gt;? To present research and serve as mentors at the joint LSAMP/LSAMP-BD Research Symposium;&lt;br/&gt;? To participate in various seminars on campus in order to promote professional development and&lt;br/&gt;growth;&lt;br/&gt;? To participate in joint USM BD cohort events such as Summer Success Institute and the Harvest&lt;br/&gt;Dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#56256;&amp;#56473; BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;Many LSAMP students are members of groups that traditionally have been underrepresented in STEM&lt;br/&gt;fields. The proposed activity will increase the number of such students in the pipeline to earn doctoral&lt;br/&gt;degrees in these fields. In addition, activities are planned that would provide the participants with&lt;br/&gt;information about a variety of STEM career options, and help to motivate some of them to prepare for&lt;br/&gt;careers in the professoriate.</AbstractNarration>

Some of the research and education activities were:     BD Monthly Community Meetings  BD Advising, Counseling and Follow-up BD Research and Conference Participation  Participation in NSF Joint Annual Meeting (JAM) BD Conference  Participation in the Joint LSAMP/LSAMP-BD Research Symposium  Participation in UMD Professional and Personal Development Seminars        Below were other components of the BD Program:   BD Project Directors-Faculty Advisors/Graduate Program Staff Partnership.  The BD Project Directors formed partnerships with the academic departments of the BD Fellows to build a stronger connection between the BD program and the academic units.  Funding Commitments Post-BD. In Fall 2010, the Project Directors received written confirmation from each academic department of the 2010-2012 BD Fellows committing funding for the students once BD ended in July 2012.  BD Program Evaluation. Using the original 2009 evaluation protocol, a second evaluation by an external evaluator was completed with the 2010-2012 BD cohort. The overall goal of the evaluation was to examine the experiences of current and past BD fellowship participants to understand the factors that contribute to the success of the students as well as those that impede their progress. Many common themes emerged to show that there are significant barriers that are impeding studentsÆ success in graduate programs. Some of these themes are transition issues, understanding the "norms" of the department, and the importance of mentoring. Some new findings also emerged such as the need for personal development and additional career workshops for participants. Based on the findings of this exploratory study, nine recommendations were offered to assist the BD program with assessing the needs of the students and the programÆs initiatives for next year.    BD Information Dissemination. During the 2010-2012 project, the BD Project Directors disseminated information on the BD Program on the LSAMP website and the BD Cohort listerv.     Broader Impacts: Many LSAMP students are members of groups that traditionally have been underrepresented in STEM fields. The proposed activity increased the number of such students in the pipeline to earn doctoral degrees in these fields. Additionally, activities were planned to provide the participants with information about a variety of STEM career options and careers in the professoriate.  BD Program Accomplishments.  Since 2006, UMD received three BD grants (2006, 2008, and 2010) with a total of 40 students being awarded fellowships. Since the first cohort began in 2006, 4 students have received doctoral degrees. 17 students have received masterÆs degrees. 26 students are currently enrolled in a masterÆs or doctoral program. 10 of the 26 students have advanced to Ph.D. candidacy.  As of September 2012, 1 student has graduated with a ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
