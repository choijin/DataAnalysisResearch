<AbstractNarration>Current tectonic models for the Cretaceous opening of the Amerasia Basin are controversial due to our poor understanding of circum-Arctic geology. This uncertainty is derived from a lack of field-based observations and data from remote portions of the North American Arctic continental margins.  A better understanding of circum-Arctic geology is also critical to testing hypotheses related to the origin and evolution of exotic crustal fragments now incorporated within the Cordilleran orogen of North America.  Some of these "suspect" terranes have Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic basement that record completely different evolutionary histories in comparison to the western margin of Laurentia (western North America). The elusive origination of these crustal fragments has remained a longstanding question in the geological literature. In addition to a number of previously proposed models for the origin of these exotic terranes, it has recently been proposed that they were born in the Baltic and eastern Laurentian realm and subsequently migrated to western Laurentia as a result of their entrainment in a mid-Paleozoic Caribbean/Scotia-style subduction system that formed between northern North America and Siberia. Of these displaced terranes, Pearya (Northern Ellesmere Island) and Arctic Alaska are the closest to their putative homeland in the Baltic realm. We are currently integrating detailed stratigraphic, paleontological, geochemical, and geochronological studies on Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic rocks from northern Ellesemere Island, Arctic Alaska, and the Yukon to provide tests for: 1) The recently proposed model for the Paleozoic northwest passage of exotic terranes from their formation in Baltica; 2) The SAYBIA-Rubia hypothesis, which posits that the southern half of Arctic Alaska formed a ribbon continent with other "suspect" terranes that was exotic to North America until accretion in the Cretaceous; and 3) A North American origin for Arctic Alaska. Ultimately, the characterization of the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic geology in Pearya and Arctic Alaska will constrain models for the origins of exotic Cordilleran terranes and will provide the geological background for reconstructing the Cretaceous opening of the Amerasian Basin. The project is a collaborative effort between researchers at Harvard University and the University of Iowa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mineralogical and Geological Museum at the Harvard Natural History Museum (HNHM) hosts one of the premier meteorite and mineral collections in the United States. HNHM is visited annually by  approximately 33,000 school children in groups, presenting a unique forum to introduce students to the Geosciences.  An exhibit on the geology of the Arctic is currently being developed at the HNHM. The exhibit will include: 1) photographs from expeditions in the Alaska National Wildlife Reserve of the NW Brooks Range, Northern Ellesmere Island, and on Arctic Icebreakers; 2) rock samples from formations at each of these localities including the North Slope oil source and reservoir rocks; and 3) educational displays about the geological evolution of the Arctic. The HNHM will provide a kid friendly microscopes and a Microsoft touch-table that will enable students to interact with animations of Arctic plate tectonic reconstructions and zoom in on Arctic satellite and geological data. Beyond mineralogy, expanding the MGM?s educational displays to the integrative and exciting nature of modern Geosciences, particularly the geological evolution of the Arctic, has the potential to influence a portion of the 33,000 students who visit the HNHM to pursue studies in the Geosciences. The project is also contribute to the training of two Ph.D. students, one at Harvard and one at the University of Iowa, and is providing support for training of undergraduate students at both universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the tectonic development of the Arctic margin of North America, which is in part underlain by crustal fragments (terranes) that lie outboard of deep water marine deposits that defined the continental edge 450-500 million years ago.  Rocks with similar characteristics and histories now occur in Arctic Alaska and along the western margin of North America.  We have attempted to define the origin and reconstruct the displacement history of these crustal fragments through integrated stratigraphic, paleontologic, and geochronologic analysis.  U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotope geochemistry of detrital zircons from sedimentary units in the terranes provides information about the age of the sedimentary host, the geographic origin of the sediment, and the crustal development of the source region.  U-Pb geochronology, geochemistry and isotope geochemistry of igneous rocks provides information on the tectonic setting of the terranes and the timing of their emplacement and/or translation along the Arctic margin.      Following are the primary outcomes from research conducted at the University of Iowa in collaboration with researchers at Harvard University.     1) The Pearya terrane, northern Ellesmere Island, originated on or near the northeastern Arctic margin of North America in proximity to Greenland and Svalbard in Neoproterozoic time and was translated and accreted to its current position by Silurian time.     2) The North Slope subterrane in the northeastern Brooks Range also originated on or near the northeastern Arctic margin of North America in proximity to Greenland and Svalbard in Neoproterozoic time.  The timing of translation of the terrane is still poorly determined.      3) The Alexander terrane, which likely formed along Baltica margin and migrated along the Arctic margin of Canada and Greenland as well, left fragments adjacent to the Pearya terrane and North Slope subterrane.      4) Terranes in the northeastern Brooks Range are separated from rocks of northwestern North America by a major Paleozoic or younger sinistral shear zone that likely accommodated translation of the Pearya terrane, Alexander terrane, and North Slope subterrane along Arctic margin of North America.     This project has also contributed to the development of international relations by fostering collaborations between several academic institutions (University of Iowa, Harvard University, Acadia University) and three government agencies (Geological Survey of Canada, Bundesanstalt fur Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe (BGR), and Yukon Geological Survey).
