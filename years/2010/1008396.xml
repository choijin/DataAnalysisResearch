<AbstractNarration>Smith&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1008396&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project aims to better understand the role of&lt;br/&gt;inertia-gravity waves in two highly relevant problems in&lt;br/&gt;geophysical fluid dynamics: (i) the origin of observed ocean wave&lt;br/&gt;spectra, and (ii) tropical cyclogenesis and the preconditioned&lt;br/&gt;state for the development of hurricanes.  Both studies involve a&lt;br/&gt;similar dynamical core, namely, the rotating Boussinesq equations&lt;br/&gt;with strong stratification.  Previous theoretical progress toward&lt;br/&gt;understanding ocean spectra has been made by considering exact&lt;br/&gt;three-wave resonances under the weak turbulence paradigm.  Here&lt;br/&gt;the investigator studies new partial-differential equation models&lt;br/&gt;including all three-wave interactions, thus capturing more&lt;br/&gt;complete physics.  Effects of rotation, stratification and&lt;br/&gt;hydrostatic balance are deduced analytically through explicitly&lt;br/&gt;derived, nonlinear coupling coefficients.  Numerical simulations&lt;br/&gt;characterize energy spectra and generation of shear.  Adding&lt;br/&gt;simplified cloud dynamics (condensation and evaporation of water)&lt;br/&gt;to the Boussinesq core allows for investigation of the hurricane&lt;br/&gt;embryo.  The latter project involves numerical implementation and&lt;br/&gt;exploration of a minimal, active moisture model including fast&lt;br/&gt;waves, extending recent work using imposed heat sources to&lt;br/&gt;incorporate moist processes within the context of balanced models&lt;br/&gt;(excluding fast waves). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Inertia-gravity waves result from the earth's rotation and&lt;br/&gt;density stratification of the atmosphere and oceans.  The effects&lt;br/&gt;of inertia-gravity waves are varied, for example, waves can&lt;br/&gt;self-organize to form large-scale coherent structures widely&lt;br/&gt;observed in nature, such as cyclones and/or anticyclones,&lt;br/&gt;east-west jets, and horizontal shear layers.  Yet there are&lt;br/&gt;critically important flows for which the dynamical role of&lt;br/&gt;inertia-gravity waves is yet to be described by a fully&lt;br/&gt;self-consistent mathematical theory.  The project addresses two&lt;br/&gt;such fundamental application problems using a combination of&lt;br/&gt;analytical and numerical calculations: (i) the scale distribution&lt;br/&gt;of wave energy in the oceans, and (ii) tropical cyclogenesis&lt;br/&gt;(also known as the hurricane embryo problem).  In the oceans,&lt;br/&gt;tidal and wind forcing generate internal gravity-wave breaking,&lt;br/&gt;ultimately establishing the balance between small-scale mixing&lt;br/&gt;and global circulation.  For the problem of tropical&lt;br/&gt;cyclogenesis, previous mathematical models have filtered out the&lt;br/&gt;fast waves, and there is much to learn about the role of fast&lt;br/&gt;waves for the emergence and stability of low-altitude cyclonic&lt;br/&gt;vertical vorticity, leading ultimately to the formation of a&lt;br/&gt;hurricane.  The topics involve ocean mixing and ocean-atmosphere&lt;br/&gt;interactions, which are important factors in climate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the project was to further investigate the formation of coherent structures in fluid systems related to geophysical flows, such as cyclones and/or anticyclones, east-west jets, and rising plumes.  One Ph.D. student and one postdoctoral researcher were partially supported by the project, promoting the interdisciplinary training of young mathematicians, with the ability to use techniques of applied mathematics to attack problems related to weather and climate.    In the earth's atmosphere and oceans, there exist a multitude of physical processes that may lead to structure formation, for example, self-organization of wave motions generated by flow over topography, organization of turblence by large-scale winds, the moisture cycle of condensation and evaporation of water, and the diurnal heating cycle, to name a few.  Our project involved idealized studies to isolate fundamental mechanisms for structure generation associated with some of the possible environmental conditions.  During the first part of the funding period, we focused on flows including the effects of inertia-gravity waves, which are the waves generated by the earth's rotation and stable density stratification (density/temperature decreasing with height). Inertia-gravity waves were investigated analytically and numerically in so-called dry flows without the effects of water substance (e.g. clouds and rain).  Among other results, we demonstrated that a model including only inertia-gravity waves generates strong vertically sheared horizontal flows, such as found in the earth's stratosphere.  The model of three-wave interactions is a generalization of weak-turbulence theory including a special subset of  `resonant'  three-wave interactions, but the latter cannot generate these strong horizontal flows. Thus our model represents a significant step in understanding the dynamics of rotating and stratified systems.  Broadening the scope of our numerical computations, we later added the ability to simulate moist flows including phase changes of water: condensation of water vapor to form liquid water in the form of clouds and rain, and evaporation of rain water to form water vapor.  A numerical investigation of moist dynamics was aimed at understanding the combined effects of inertia-gravity waves, low-altitude wind shear, and low-altitude excess moisture, such as might be found above a warm ocean.  When excess moisture is present in localized patches, latent heat release from condensation leads to rising plumes of relatively warm air which inherit the cyclonic vorticity of the earth's background rotation.  These plumes resemble the vortical hot towers observed in both cyclogenesis and mature hurricanes. In our idealized simulations with localized, low-altitude moisture forcing, small-scale cyclonic hot towers could merge together to form larger moist vortices, reminiscent of cyclogenesis.  Weak low-altitude shear was observed to enhance the merger process, while strong low-altitude shear altered the monopole structure of the individual towers and thus prevented the organization of larger-scale moist vortices.  Our work linked the transition from monopole to dipole structure of rising plumes with shear inhibition of cyclogenesis.   The final two years of the project were devoted to analyzing the heat transfer by rising plumes of warm fluid, such as might be generated by heating of the earth's surface by the sun.  In order to isolate some essential physics associated with convection alone, this part of the project focused on the unstable stratified environment (temperature decreasing with height as often found in the troposhere), in the absence of rotation, moisture and background wind.  We studied flow in two space dimensions, in between two parallel plates, with heating (cooling) on the bottom (top) plate.  In this classic Rayleigh-Benard convection problem, one practical goal is to predict how the heat transport depends on the temperature difference between the ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
