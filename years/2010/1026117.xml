<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for participants in the conference "Control, Optimization, and Functional Analysis: Synergies and Perspectives," held 2-3 October 2010 at the University of California, San Diego.  The workshop brings together mathematicians and theoretical engineers working on functional analysis, systems theory, optimization, and real algebraic geometry, and aims to steer the mathematical talent gathered through the workshop towards problems of increased physical and engineering relevance.  Topics to be addressed at the workshop explore the interconnections between control theory, optimization, and functional analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will foster collaborations among junior and senior researchers.  An article on the findings of the meeting will be published in the Control Systems Magazine of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, junior researchers, and members of under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  http://flyingv.ucsd.edu/synergies-workshop</AbstractNarration>
