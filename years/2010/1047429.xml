<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the design of a robust and low-cost enzyme immobilization system to increase the cost-competitiveness of bio-catalytic processes.  The lack of a universal, sound, and affordable enzyme immobilization technique has been a large barrier to widespread deployment of bio-catalysis for chemical production, which hold immense promise for reducing the chemical industry?s environmental footprint.  This Phase I project will lift this barrier by developing a robust and low-cost enzyme immobilization system with broad application for many different bioprocesses using one of Arzeda Corp.?s proprietary enzymes as the basis of the binding strategy. Ultimately, this project will lead to an economically viable system for immobilization of any enzyme on a bio-catalysis column with increased catalytic efficiency and longevity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research result from the fact that Arzeda has the only proven technology to design novel enzymes with catalytic machinery not existing in nature And is helping address many of the most pressing needs of the bio-refinery industry:&lt;br/&gt;? Developing bio-catalytic routes to currently inaccessible renewable chemicals and&lt;br/&gt;? Increasing profitability through extending enzyme lifetime and increasing enzyme lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;As such, Arzeda sees the success of this project as a way to increase the adoption of bio-catalysis and thereby increase the market for its enzyme products.  To achieve this, Arzeda will apply its core technology along with the proposed enzyme immobilization strategy to develop bioprocesses enabling high value, renewable chemicals from biomass.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Arzeda developed an enzyme immobilization system whereby high cost enzymes (enzyme-of-interest) can be bound to reactive surface for a long time utilizing a chemically orthoganal binding protein/peptide for the attachment to a surface.  This long-use enables reusing the enzymes during multiple reaction "batches" effectively recycling the enzymes and decreasing the cost of the expensive enzymes.    We successfully demonstrated the technical merit of the proposal in that we successfully bound proof-of-concept enzymes to the surface of microscopic beads and to the surface of 96-well plates. The bound, or immobilized, enzymes were able to be washed repeatedly and remain active while immobilized on the surfaces.  The necessary molecular (protein) interactions were thus long-lived and stable and reusable.  The chemistries required for the interactions were properly worked out and showed little variability suggesting reasonable and reproducible results over multiple experiments. We worked with a New England-based company to validate the chemistry successfully. The cost of the chemistry will have to be reduced in the future in order to achieve commercial viability as an immobilization system, however. The cost for related strategies on the market is low, but the recyclability of this validated system shows future promise- especially if a good market utilizing its key features is identified.  Arzeda demonstrated that the immobilization of the enzyme-of-interest is achieved through multiple control steps and reactions where the individual components are tested and compared to the assembled system (shown in Figure). The individual components did not maintain enzymatic activity as the components were washed away.  The final experiment of immobilizing the enzyme-of-interest directly was not as successful.  This suggests that improvement of the selectivity of the interactions in the system will aid in improving the cost for larger scale applications but reducing the purification costs of the enzyme-of-interest.
