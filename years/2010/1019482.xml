<AbstractNarration>Developers and researchers at TERC, the Education Development Center, and Mount Holyoke College are participating in the development and systematic investigation of a teaching model to assist teachers in developing ideas about proof in grades 2-5.  The teaching model provides both a tool for learning on the part of elementary teachers and a model of practice from which they can learn as they implement it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a teaching experiment in which the model is iteratively implemented and refined, first with teachers experienced in incorporating ideas about proof into their classroom instruction (Phase 1), then with teachers who are relatively inexperienced, both in their own understanding of proof and in their knowledge of how their students can learn about proof (Phase 2). Research questions focus on developing the components of the model, the learning of teachers as they implement the model, and the learning of students as they engage in the instruction that is guided by the model, with particular attention to students with varied histories of achievement in grade-level work on number and operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcome is a teaching model that can be tested on a larger scale as well as instruments for assessing student learning and teacher understanding of proof.  The model includes printed material with descriptions of the routines and instructional sequences, guidelines for implementing each component, and a teaching framework as well as written and video case examples.</AbstractNarration>

After the model was developed in classrooms of the experienced teachers, it was implemented and refined in classrooms with teachers inexperienced with mathematical argument.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project also aimed to deepen understanding about how young students develop knowledge and practices that enable them to engage in mathematical argument and what it is that teachers need to know and be able to do in order to support this student learning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Intellectual merit</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We developed a teaching model, which consists of five phases: 1) noticing a pattern or regularity; 2) articulating a claim about that regularity; 3) investigating what has been noticed and articulated through representation; 4) constructing a mathematical argument about why the regularity occurs; and 5) comparing what occurs in one operation with what occurs in similar circumstances with another operation. With our collaborating teachers, this model was elaborated and implemented, resulting in the development of the educational resources described below.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project created a video database of both classroom lessons and student interviews. The classroom lessons illustrate how elementary students learn to engage in mathematical argument and how teachers support that learning. Analysis of the student interviews led to the development of two theoretical frameworks that characterize what elementary students can do, given the opportunity to engage in the practice of mathematical argument.&nbsp; The first framework characterizes students&rsquo; articulations of conjectures.
