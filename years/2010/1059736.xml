<AbstractNarration>During geomagnetic storms relativistic electron fluxes of the outer radiation belt exhibit highly dynamic behavior. The two basic processes controlling the variability of electron fluxes are radial transport of electrons across their drift shells and large-scale reconfigurations of the magnetic field due to the storm-time ring current. This project will address the following science questions: (1) What is the role of magnetic field distortions and inductive electric fields produced by the storm-time ring current on the global loss of radiation belt electron populations? (2) How do ULF oscillations induced by fluctuations of the solar wind dynamic pressure influence the global structure of the outer electron belt? The research is based on a series of controlled numerical experiments of electron transport and losses. It uses a 3D test-particle model which provides a kinetic description of global evolution of the radiation belt in the guiding-center approximation. The following features of the model are especially important for addressing the role of global mechanisms: (1) it is based on the Tsyganenko-Sitnov magnetic field model with inductive electric fields. The model accounts for realistic dynamic reconfigurations of the inner magnetospheric fields which can produce rapid electron losses during storm main phase; (2) it includes ULF fluctuations that are directly induced by variations in the solar wind dynamic; (3) it will use a newly developed model that resolves the three dimensional drift-bounce electron motion and therefore accounts for the features such as the drift shell splitting and orbit bifurcations, which are not described by two dimensional models. The project will determine the relative contributions of the adiabatic response and permanent losses during storm-time variability of the belt as a function of the solar wind and geomagnetic conditions; (2) it will quantify the degree of adiabaticity of the belt during storm recovery phase; (3) it will determine where and under what conditions radial transport in the outer belt can be described as radial diffusion; and (4) it will quantify the average transport rates as a function of the solar wind and geomagnetic conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the proposed project is to understand global variability of Earth's radiation belt.  This has great relevance to space weather and phenomena that can create hazards for spacecraft and astronauts. The average radial transport rates derived in this study will be provided for the modeling community to use in diffusion and data-assimilation models of the outer bet electron fluxes. The work will also provide research training for student summer interns via a summer intern program.</AbstractNarration>

Following are our major outcomes.      Quiet-Time Transport in the Outer Belt  Generally radial transport a exhibits large deviations for the radial diffusion approximations. Diffusion-like scaling in radial transport can be attained after additional averaging of electron motion over multiple statistically similar realizations of electron motion, i.e. time intervals characterized by similar solar wind conditions. Radial transport of radiation belt electrons at large pitch angles is affected by so-called drift orbit bifurcations.

Drift orbit bifurcations conserve the first adiabatic invariant but violate the second adiabatic invariant. The radial transport in the presence of bifurcations can produce a stronger energization of radiation belt particles than a transport that conserves both the first and the second adiabatic invariants.     Zebra Stripes Patters  Our analysis of electron data from the RBSPICE instruments on board the twin Van Allen Probes spacecraft mission showed that energetic electrons across the entire inner radiation belt (&gt;3 RE) are organized in regular patterns, which we referred to as ?zebra stripes?. The patterns were observed during all spacecraft orbits and appeared to be more regular during quiet geomagnetic conditions (quiet times) than during geomagnetic storms.We developed a theory according to which the zebra patters are produced by the rotation of Earth. The rotation induces an electric field that controls cold magnetospheric plasma within 4 RE region around Earth, referred to as the co-rotation region. Owing to an ~11 degree offset between the magnetic dipole axis and the planetary rotation axis, the entire co-rotation region oscillates relative to the outer magnetosphere with a period of 24 h. This relative motion causes global diurnal perturbations of the magnetic field over the entire co-rotation region. Because the inner-belt electrons are embedded inside the co-rotation region, their drift motion around Earth is influenced by the inductive electric field produced by these diurnal perturbations.     Storm-Time Transport and Losses  Solar CIR and CME events result in strong magnetopause compressions that wipe out the intensities of relativistic electrons deep inside the outer radiation belt over the timescales of several hours.
