<AbstractNarration>Energy-proportional and low power computing, together with the increasing demands for high resiliency to random faults could benefit enormously from a "Unified Memory" - a memory cell that operate either as a dynamic cell or as a non-volatile cell, and switch seamlessly between the two states.  This effort focuses on  the development of such a cell based on a dual floating gate concept. The gate stack is optimized to low voltage operation.  Because the dynamic storage mode relies on direct tunneling, the electric fields required are modest, and ALD methods are used to construct robust oxides, this device has potential for high endurance when operating in the dynamic storage mode.  The device has a relatively low leakage compared to a DRAM cell and thus needs less frequent refreshing.  The read is fast - almost SRAM speeds - and non-destructive, reducing power needs.  Conversion between dynamic and non-volatiles modes is very fast - an entire row at a time, and consumes a lot less power than interfacing to a solid-state drive.  The device can simultaneously store a non-volatile bit with a different volatile bit enabling fast in-situ check-pointing and rollback or state-saving to improve error resiliency.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ he main objective of this work was to create a new unified memory that could store a volatile and non-volatile bit simultaneously.  The original approach was primarily the idea of a Dual Floating Gate FET (DFG-FET), in which the single floating gate of a conventional flash device was replaced by two tightly coupled floating gates.  Moving some of the charge in between the opposing floating gates modulated the gate capacitance and thus  created a volatile bit.  The collective change on the two floating gates created a non-volatile bit that on which the volatile bit was superimposed.  However, we found control of floating charge distribution around the intermediate dielectric to be difficult to manage with strong temporal variations probably arising from traps. It was realized that a potential substitute for one of the floating gates could be the oxygen vacancy boundary in a Vacancy Modulation Conductive RRAM (VMCO RRAM).  This is a recent type of RRAM that has been observed to show non-filamentary memory behavior by modulating the inherent oxygen vacancies inside the dielectric. These memories are forming free, and memory operation can be both volatile and non-volatile. The volatile operation in VMCO RRAM is predicted to be because of temporary re-arrangement of oxygen vacancies inside the dielectric. On the other hand, these vacancies can be physically moved inside the dielectric bringing a stable non-volatile memory transition.  Unlike filamentary RRAM, memory operations in VMCO RRAM does not require a current flow through the dielectric. However, the VMCO RRAM still suffers from typical "RRAM" issues include device non-uniformity, requirement for a selector device, etc.  By putting the "RRAM" in the gate stack we avoid these difficulties.  The location of the oxygen vacancies in the gate dielectric modulates the drain source current via its impact on capacitance, and this current is not very sensitive to the density of the oxygen vacancies.  Thus there is potential for much more uniformity in device operation than with a pure RRAM device. Thus there is potential to build these as large memory arrays. It was then further realized that the most immediate potential for this concept was to have no floating gates at all, and create a 1T-0C DRAM replacement (or ZRAM for Zero C RAM).

The following personnel were supported, in part, under this award:  Franzon, Misra (PIs); DiSpigna (Research Assistant Professor); Pitts (Postdoc); Sarkar, Jayant, Xue (PhD students); Kotipalli (MS student).  The following students performed tasks on this effort but were not supported by the award:  Karthikeyen, Bhattacharya (MS students).  Franzon co-developed and co-taught (with DiSpigna) an emerging devices and circuits module for the graduate course, ECE 733 Digital Electronics.   This module covered the broad spectrum of emerging devices and circuit enablement, including devices under investigation in this project.   In two of the years covered by the award period, the class research paper topic was related to this module. Typically, around 60 students took this class every year.  Over the award period, Franzon was the editor of the "Emerging Research Architectures" sub-chapter of the ITRS chapter on "Emerging Research Devices".  He is very active in the ERD section in general.  The goal of this sub-chapter is to provide information on the research gaps between devices and architectures.  He edited, and wrote large portions, of the 2011 and 2013 chapters, and is currently preparing the 2015 chapter.  During this time, he led or assisted in three workshops specifically designed to collect information for this chapter.  He also participated in other ERD workshops on memory and logic devices.  These workshop reports are publicly available through the ITRS web site.  Franzon originated the idea of publicly available VLSI design kits that can be used in classes as they don?t contain any proprietary data.  Right now, Davis and he are leading the preparation of a 15 nm kit.  An early release can be found at http://www.eda.ncsu.edu/wiki/FreePDK15:Contents .  During the time covered by this award, Misra led the creation of the ASSIST Engineering Research Center. Her "broader impact" activities mainly focus on this Center.
