<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on Engineering Leadership Education and Development (E-LEAD) at Alfred University. Designed specifically to address some of the social and environmental factors that contribute to underrepresentation, the project has three main objectives: (a) to develop and deliver a dynamic outreach program to attract high-schoolers to the field of engineering, (2) to increase the number of engineering students at Alfred University by awarding engineering scholarships to academically talented but economically disadvantaged students, and (3) to develop and deliver effective co-curricular programming that will help engineering students succeed as leaders in the profession. Informed by gender-and-education research, co-curricular programming will be centered around three main themes: community building, leadership training, and career development. Community-building features include peer mentoring, co-located student housing, and networking events. Building upon the current activities of the Women's Leadership Center at Alfred University, leadership development activities include seminars, workshops, and a two-credit course on Gender and Leadership. Additionally, the scholars will hone their leadership skills by developing and delivering an outreach-and-recruiting program for high-schoolers. Career development activities include on-campus research experiences for first-year scholars, resume and interviewing workshops, and optional co-op educational experiences and summer internships. The long-term goal of the project is to develop a sustained scholarship and leadership at Alfred University.</AbstractNarration>

NSF Award 1060482 funds supported a cohort of twenty-five academically talented yet economically disadvantaged U.S. citizen undergraduate students within the unique E-LEAD program offered within the Alfred University Kazuo Inamori School of Engineering. Of the E-LEAD cohort of twenty-five undergraduate students, seventeen (68%), including six of ten (60%) from underrepresented group(s), have earned degrees in Biomaterials Engineering (3), Ceramic Engineering (5), Glass Engineering Science (1), Material Science and Engineering (2), Mathematics (1), Mechanical Engineering (4), and, Renewable Energy Engineering (1). As of today, the cumulative grade point average of the students is 3.40 with ten earning graduation honors of Summa Cum Laude (1), Magna Cum Laude (4), and Cum Laude (5). Additionally, six students (24%) of the cohort continue to earn their way toward the Bachelor of Science degree in a STEM discipline, while three students (12%) withdrew from the program and institution. Of the seventeen graduates, one student earned a double major (BA of Arts), four students earned double minors and five students earned single minors in areas of: Business Administration (3); Chemistry (4); Mathematics (3); Material Science (1); and, Renewable Energy Engineering (2). As compared with the overall undergraduate student body within the Kazuo Inamori School of Engineering, the E-LEAD cohort has represented a significantly more diverse body, including ten students (40%) from underrepresented group(s). Of the cohort, nine students (36%) reported paid STEM research and/or internship opportunities with seven students (28%) reporting multiple summer and/or semester paid STEM opportunities. Using data from the above information, the cohort of twenty-five students represents a significant increase of underrepresented group(s), specially women (40%), participating in STEM and has reasonably approached the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data Systems (IPEDS-2016) norm of all campus wide discipline representation of women (53%). The average (4-year) retention rate of the cohort (97%) significantly exceeds first year retention rates of the institution (75%). The graduation rate to date of 68% significantly exceeds the institutional campus wide rate of 60% with six more students (24%) still in progress toward their degree that could result in an astounding graduation rate of 88% in STEM disciplines. Importantly, six students (24%) of the cohort have graduated with a Bachelor of Science in a specialty discipline, ceramics or glass, for which this institution, Alfred University, is the sole conferrer of the Bachelor of Science in Glass Science Engineering in the country and is one of only a few institutions to confer the Bachelor of Science in Ceramic Engineering. Further, although the available NSF funds could not eliminate the cost of education for the academically talented yet economically disadvantaged U.S. citizen undergraduate students, the NSF funds did substantially reduce the financial burden upon each student within the cohort with regard to their cost of education. Government support of specialized programs, such as NSF investment in the Alfred University Kazuo Inamori School of Engineering E-LEAD program, has here and can for other programs result in a high return on investment, through providing incentives that attract and retain the human intellectual capital that can be used to support STEM infrastructure, in directed technology areas like ceramics and glass that are vital to national defense as well as to the economic well-being of the United States of America.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/17/2018<br>      Modified by:
