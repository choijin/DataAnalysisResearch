<AbstractNarration>This study will examine the physiological and evolutionary responses to the Gulf of Mexico oil leak of a small crustacean, the copepod Eurytemora affinis. This species is a dominant member of coastal ecosystems, especially those in the Gulf of Mexico. This project will address the following questions: (1) How quickly and to what extent can organisms evolve in response to the toxic effects of crude oil? (2) Which traits evolve in response to crude oil exposure? (3) Do different populations (independently-derived selected lines, and populations from different locations in the field) respond in a similar manner? (4) Is there a cost to adaptation to the toxic effects of crude oil? It will accomplish these goals by conducting a laboratory selection and comparing those reponses to evolutionary changes in Gulf populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding evolutionary responses is essential for determining the long-term survival and recovery of the impacted populations, given the acute toxicity of crude oil. Beyond the copepods, the results of this study will provide critical information for understanding responses in other gulf species. The project will also result in the training of two graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2010 Deep Horizon Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico was the largest offshore oil spill in history. As support for offshore drilling is increasing, it is critical to assess the impacts of future oil spills. To avoid extinction in the face of an oil spill, a key question is whether populations could evolve in response to crude oil toxicity. However, until now this response has never been explored. In this study we examined evolutionary response of the copepod Eurytemora affinis, a small crustacean that is a dominant member of the Gulf of Mexico food web and critically important as a food source for fish. This population was extremely abundant prior to the oil spill, but population abundance plummeted drastically right after the oil spill. We collected from this population prior to the oil spill and then after the oil spill as the population numbers recovered. The goals of this study were to determine (1) whether this copepod population has evolved resistance to crude oil toxicity following the Deep Horizon Oil Spill and (2) whether the copepod population could adapt to crude oil toxicity in a laboratory selection experiment.  The first goal was addressed by comparing fitness (hatching rate, survival rate, and development time) between copepod populations collected before the Deep Horizon Oil Spill and that collected after the oil spill. We found that the population collected after the oil spill had evolved resistance to crude oil toxicity, and exhibited significantly higher hatching and survival rate and shorter development time under high levels of water soluble fraction of crude oil, relative to the population collected prior to the oil spill. We are currently performing a selection experiment to determine whether this same evolutionary shift in response to crude oil could be demonstrated in the laboratory in a controlled setting. We are also determining whether there has been an evolutionary shift is detoxification enzymatic response.    This study is the first to demonstrate an evolutionary response to crude oil toxicity.  Moreover, this evolutionary shift occurred within a time span of only three years. Results of this study have important implications for how quickly populations in the wild could respond to environmental disasters.  Previous studies had examined whether populations could tolerate crude oil toxicity, but none had examined whether populations had actually evolved (or could evolve).  Evolutionary potential and limits to evolution are critical to know in order to assess impacts of oil spills and the potential and speed of recovery.  This study included the participation of two graduate students, a research technician and three undergraduate assistants.  The undergraduate students were mentored by the graduate students and received training in field work, laboratory techniques, and statistics.  The students are preparing the results for publication and will present their results in public talks and professional conferences.
