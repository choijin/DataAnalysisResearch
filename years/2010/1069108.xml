<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to investigate the use of light-activated heating (photothermal effect) of metal nanoparticles embedded in a polymer composite as a tool for material processing and actuation.  In this photothermal process, irradiation with visible light tuned to the specific nanoparticle properties results in nanoparticle heating and local transfer of energy to the surrounding polymer.  Measurements of the internal temperature within the composite will be utilized to determine the nanoparticle concentration and light intensity required to cure, melt, or actuate.  Photothermal activation of shape memory polymers (materials that alter their shape or size upon temperature change) will be compared with actuation via traditional heating methods. Changes in mechanical strength and modulus due to photothermal heating of nanofibrous samples will also be studied.  Multi-component samples where nanoparticles are limited to a specific region will be investigated to test the spatial specificity of the heating. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will enable new processing approaches for polymeric materials, where heat is applied from within rather than from the exterior, enabling the internal temperature to exceed that of the material surface. Polymeric structures could be cross-linked to improve strength, be repaired, or undergo a shape change at a working location while avoiding significant increase in the temperature of the surroundings. The selective placement of nanoparticles would enable heating of specific regions to allow for melting, curing, or re-crystallization, while the remainder of the material would be unaffected.  In this manner, materials with new hybrid properties can be designed and developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Metal particles of size 500 nm or less have an unusual property in that they strongly absorb light which is converted to heat within the particle.  This is a photo-thermal (i.e., light converted to heat) effect.  The research funded by this grant utilized the photothermal effect of metal nanoparticles to explore new ways to process polymers (plastics).  Most polymers are made into products by melting.   Applying heat and then re-cooling can also usefully change the strength and rigidity of polymeric objects.  The research showed that by incorporating a very low level of metal nanoparticles within a polymer (i) the polymer could be heated to melting, (ii) that polymer crystallinity (the fraction of chains that are organized into crystals versus randomly packed) could be increased, which will change the material's strength and rigidity, (iii) that special, shape memory polymers could be heated to result in a change of shape (actuation), and (iv) that liquid materials could be made solid by using heating to drive a cross-linking (connection between polymer chains) reaction.   A unique property of photothermal heating is that the heat is generated within the material.  For the systems studied, the applied light passes through the polymer (i.e., is not absorbed) and the light energy is only taken in by the metal nanoparticles.  Each particle acts as externally-driven, nanometer-sized thermal source (a hot spot) within a material.  As a result, the ultimate temperature distribution within a photothermally heated object is not uniform.  There are warmer regions near the nanoparticles and much cooler temperatures far from any particles.  This heterogeneous (non-uniform) temperature distribution has several advantages.  The research showed that because of this localization of the heat to the nanoparticle's location very delicate ultra-thin fibers of polymer could have their interior heated while preserving their surface and shape.  In contrast, uniform heating of such a system results in destruction of the entire fiber.  The research also focused on measuring the non-uniform temperature within the material (over distances of 50 nm - 5 microns) using a variety of techniques, including (i) using light-emitting molecules placed throughout the polymer as thermometers, (ii) estimating the temperature near the particle (the warmest temperature in the system) by observing the rotation of a rod-shaped particle within a tiny region of molten polymer, and (iii) using polarization of light to distinguish molecules within the molten and the solid regions within the polymer.  The research revealed that with anisotropic particles (not spheres) light polarization could be used to control heating and that the thermal properties of the polymer such as its glass transition could be measured using heat from metal nanoparticles.  Overall, this work showed that photothermal heating can produce outcomes and allow processing that cannot be obtained by heating conventionally (which results in uniform temperature throughout an object).  In particular, the results of the research indicate that this approach is particularly useful for cases where one portion of a sample needs to be warmed without disturbing the remainder, where one type of material (for instance, amorphous or crystalline) distributed randomly throughout the sample must be heated while the other remains relatively cool, or where an implant or object needs to be heated while keeping its surface cool to avoid melting the surface or damaging the surrounding material (e.g., human tissue).
