<AbstractNarration>Stream restoration is a multi-billion dollar industry, however the dearth of information about the efficacy of restoration efforts has created a need for long term studies of stream ecosystem recovery following restoration. Restoration in the White Clay Creek watershed has involved reforestation of meadows and pastures with native deciduous trees and the removal of invasive plants. The sequence of changes in the physical environment (e.g., water temperature, light availability in the stream), in aquatic biological communities (e.g., species composition, trophic dynamics), and in the fate of nutrients within White Clay Creek will be studied as the planted streamside deciduous forest grows and matures. This project will build on a long term study of stream restoration, adding to our basic understanding of ecological change following restoration and informing resource managers tasked with implementing restoration efforts. Additional broader impacts will include week-long workshops for teachers from SE Pennsylvania and Northern Delaware to introduce them to research at White Clay Creek.  Middle and high school teachers will be trained in the use of long term environmental data, enhancing their ability to use ecological data to enhance students' math skills, analytical abilities, and their environmental knowledge and understanding of the nature of science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   River restoration is a multi-billion dollar industry with a limited or highly fragmented database on the efficacy of riparian reforestation, channel alteration, and reducing river nitrogen loads. The need for assessment and guidance of river restoration activities includes generating knowledge of key time scales for ecosystem restoration, as this is fundamental to understanding and predicting the dynamics of ecosystem recovery. The research described here addresses questions concerning the temporal dynamics of stream ecosystems in response to reforestation.   Scientists from Stroud Water Research Center with expertise in geomorphology, ecosystem science, geochemistry, and microbial, macroinvertebrate and fish ecology are in the midst of a multi decade-long research plan to understand and document changes in the ecology of a section of White Clay Creek (WCC) in southeastern Pennsylvania during reforestation. Restoration involves reforestation of meadows or pastures with native deciduous trees. As the planted forest matures, scientists consider the time frame over which physical, chemical, and biological components of stream ecosystems change (Fig. 1).  Restoration of a 3rd order reach of WCC began in 1967, when the Stroud Center was established, on land adjacent to the stream that was used for livestock grazing. Restoration of a 2nd-order reach was initiated in 1994. In both cases, livestock were fenced out of the meadows traversing the stream, invasive plants were removed, and native tree seedlings were planted to reestablish a contiguous forest extending upstream to a border with a mature "Forest" reach (&gt;80 yrs). For the 3rd-order site, a "Meadow" reach downstream of the "Reforested" reach has been maintained without trees. The research described here was initiated in 1998 to measure changes in stream ecosystem structure and function as the Restored forest grows and to compare changes with long-established Forest and Meadow reaches.  Research results provide insight towards the physical, chemical, and biological response of stream ecosystems to riparian reforestation. For example, changes in the physical properties of these stream reaches show that the Forest reach has a largely stable channel geometry (width, depth) with some lateral movement, whereas the Reforested reach is actively widening and aggrading (Fig. 2). The channel in the Meadow reach remains more narrow and deep and is actively eroding its steep banks, which slump into the channel and create temporary, small-scale grassy islands. Furthermore, it appears that where large wood debris (LWD) has entered the Reforested reach, channel widening and bar formation has accelerated, supporting the hypothesis that LWD accelerates channel recovery (re-widening to resemble the mature forest).    Biological responses have been observed in microbial, aquatic macroinvertebrate, and fish communities.

This trend has not been observed in the 3rd-order stream reaches. Fish communities in the 3rd-order Reforested reach are more similar to the Forest reach than the Meadow reach. However, evidence suggests that fish communities in the Reforested reach are still changing. Preliminary analyses of water chemistry data indicate that dissolved organic carbon concentrations are similar among reaches, while nitrate concentrations were significantly lower in the Forest reach.
