<AbstractNarration>SES-1020468&lt;br/&gt;Alan Booth&lt;br/&gt;Jennifer  Buher Kane&lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania State University, University Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Providing insights into how to improve infant health outcomes is an important goal of health disparities research given that conditions such as preterm birth and low birth weight often contribute to poorer physical and cognitive outcomes later. Prior research has shown that poor infant health outcomes are not randomly distributed in the population; thus, social stratification processes likely play a central role in explaining differential incidence and risk factors. This dissertation studies how such inequalities are produced and reproduced through interactions between individuals and social structures such as families and neighborhoods. More specifically, this study investigates (1) the social processes that underlie the marital disparity in infant health outcomes, (2) the role of social resources (at the individual- and neighborhood-level) in attenuating the risk of poor infant health outcomes, and (3) the intergenerational processes that explain mother-daughter similarities in infant health outcomes. To address these goals, this study will employ advanced quantitative analytic techniques using multiple secondary data sources including the newly released National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG Cycle 7), (restricted-access) spatially located data from the NSFG (which will be performed onsite at the National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Maryland), the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979 cohort, and the Children of the NLSY79.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project, using theoretically-motivated empirical research, presents a unique opportunity to expand the health disparities and family sociology literatures by providing insights into how persistent infant health disparities in the U.S. are produced and reproduced. Research findings will be made available through publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and sharing with policymakers and practitioners via conference presentations (particularly within interdisciplinary venues).</AbstractNarration>

We know for example that men and women are now much more likely to live with a cohabiting partner before marriage than in the past, and that more children are now born within nonmarital unions. We also know that, on average, these children face several disadvantages compared with children born within marital unions but as cohabitation, divorce, and remarriage become a larger part of the "typical" experience for families in the U.S., these patterns may change.  This project focuses on one type of disadvantage that has been consistently documented among children born to unmarried women: they are at a higher risk of being born low birth weight (or, less than 5 &frac12; pounds at birth) and preterm (or, less than 37 weeks of gestational age). Both outcomes are consequential for infantÆs long-term development. For example, low birth weight and preterm infants are more likely to experience several physical problems as they age including a higher risk of Type-2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease, poor bone density, cerebral palsy, deafness, impaired cognitive ability, and poorer neuromotor functioning. Thus, identifying the causes of low birth weight and preterm birth may also help us better understand a variety of other health problems as well.  Previous studies have shown that poor infant health outcomes are not randomly distributed across the population, but are rather more common among women who are poor, unmarried, non-Hispanic Black (vs. non-Hispanic White or Hispanic), live in impoverished neighborhoods, and report poor health status.

This project began by simultaneously investigating two possible explanations of the "marriage advantage" in a way that has not yet been accomplished in past research: a life course or selection model (suggesting that advantages are grounded in womenÆs experiences&mdash;either observed or unobserved&mdash;in prior life stages such as childhood and adolescence) and a mediation model (suggesting that marriage leads to positive prenatal health characteristics, which in turn lead to better infant health outcomes).

We found that in neighborhoods characterized by high levels of violent and serious property crimes, infants born to cohabiting mothers were more at risk of poor infant health than their counterparts born to cohabiting mothers who lived in neighborhoods with relatively low levels of crime.
