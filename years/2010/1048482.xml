<AbstractNarration>The Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico has created an oil spill of unprecedented magnitude. This spill is also unprecedented in that unlike most oil spills that occur due to shipping accidents and result in release of oil near the surface of the ocean, here oil is gushing out of the ocean from a depth of approximately 1500m. While there are several ongoing efforts to understand the impact of this catastrophe on the ecosystem of the Gulf of Mexico, much of the initial attention focused on the surface slick and on the potential for oil to wash up onshore. However, there is increasing evidence that there is substantial amount of oil subsurface, although there are no estimates of how much, its distribution in the water column, or the impact on ecosystem, including primary producers. In particular, it is unclear how physiological status, photosynthetic capacity and population structure of these organisms are affected by both oil itself as well as the by dispersants such as Corexit. Given that the oil, the dispersants and their breakdown products are expected to have a long lasting presence in the Gulf and one of current estimates of the amount of oil released already exceeds one million barrels, these changes may have significant and enduring affects on the microbial community and primary productivity of this region. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This award funds the investigators to contribute to the multidisciplinary team being formed by Montoya, Villareal, and Bracco in their upcoming cruises on the R/V Oceanus and R/V Cape Hatteras from mid August to mid September to study the distribution and spread of the bio-environmental oil impact on horizontal and vertical scales using state-of-the- art fluorescence and Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Meter techniques. In addition to detecting oil itself through spectrofluorescence techniques, they will study the biomass, photosynthetic capacity and population composition of photosynthesizing organisms with regard to the potential effects of the oil spill using the Advanced Laser Fluorometer (ALF). They will detect subsurface plumes of oil using APEX floats and study vertical and horizontal velocities in the water column using LADCPs. Data from these instruments can also be used to validate numerical models being used to study the spread of the plume in the Gulf. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The Deepwater Horizon oil spill has grabbed the public's attention with daily frontpage coverage in national and international newspapers. The investigators are active in outreach explaining the potential consequences of the spill to the media. They will investigate some of the most fundamental questions about this event, to try and estimate the location and magnitude of the subsurface plumes, to map the spatial extent of the near surface plume and to understand the effect of the plume on the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem by investigating its effect on photophysiology of phytoplankton, the base of the food chain. In addition, the work will complement and inform other interdisciplinary investigations including high-resolution modeling work being carried out in the Gulf. The data collected as a part of this project will be submitted to appropriate public databases close to near real-time or as soon as possible after appropriate QA/QC. One Postdoctoral Fellow will be trained as a part of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Deepwater Horizon accident released in the Gulf of Mexico over 87 days an estimated 4.4 million barrels of oil (Crone and Tolstoy 2010) and 500,000 t of gaseous hydrocarbons. This release was unprecedented in the magnitude of total hydrocarbon introduced into the marine environment in the U.S. waters. Detecting and mapping the distributions of the subsurface hydrocarbon plumes, understanding and monitoring the chemical and biological processes of oil degradation, and assessing the impact of the hydrocarbon plumes and dispersants on the ecosystem of the Gulf of Mexico were among the most pressing issues raised during and after this accident.  The goal of the project research was to study the bio-environmental oil impact on horizontal and vertical scales using state-of-the-art Advanced Laser Fluorometry (ALF), in situ vertical profiling with Autonomous Profiling Explorers (APEX), and Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Meter (LADCP) measurements.  The LDEO project team participated in the multidisciplinary research cruises in Aug. - Sept. 2010, July 2011, and May-July 2012.  Our research effort was focused on three important research goals:  1) Detection and identification of hydrocarbon plumes in the water column using optical fluorescence and light scattering measurements.  2) Use of oxygen concentrations to track the subsurface hydrocarbon plumes even after consumption of the hydrocarbons by biotic and abiotic reactions  3) Studying the effect of these plumes and degradation processes on primary productivity  The biomass, photosynthetic capacity and population composition of photosynthesizing organisms was studied with regard to the potential effects of the oil spill using the Advanced Laser Fluorometer (ALF). The ALF instrument was upgraded with a UV excitation laser to detect the oil fluorescence and spectrally discriminate it from other fluorescent constituents.

Finally, the echo-amplitude data from the LADCP profiles were corrected for beam-spreading and attenuation effects to yield full-depth profiles of acoustic volume scattering and detect acoustic signatures of potential submerged oil-spill plumes.
