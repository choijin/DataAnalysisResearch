<AbstractNarration>Urban, suburban and exurban environments are important ecosystems and their extent is increasing in the U.S.  The conversion of wild or managed ecosystems to urban ecosystems is resulting in ecosystem homogenization across cities, where neighborhoods in very different parts of the country have similar patterns of roads, residential lots, commercial areas and aquatic features.  Funds are provided to test the hypothesis that this homogenization alters ecological structure and functions relevant to ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics, with continental scale implications.  The research will provide a framework for understanding the impacts of urban land use change from local to continental scales.  The research encompasses datasets ranging from household surveys to regional-scale remote sensing across six metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) that cover the major climatic regions of the US (Phoenix, AZ, Miami, FL, Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, St. Paul, MN and Los Angeles, CA) to determine how household characteristics correlate with landscaping decisions, land management practices and ecological structure and functions at local, regional and continental scales.  This research will transform scientific understanding of an important and increasingly common ecosystem type (?suburbia?) and the consequences to carbon storage and nitrogen pollution at multiple scales. In addition, it will advance understanding of how humans perceive, value and manage their surroundings. The award will leverage an extensive, multi-scale program of education and outreach associated with ongoing LTER and/or ULTRA-EX projects. Activities include K-12 education and outreach to community groups, city/regional planners, natural history museums, state and local agencies and non-governmental organizations. Graduate students will participate in a Distributed Graduate Seminar in Sustainability Science (DGSS) initiated by NCEAS and the University of Minnesota Institute on Environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Urban land use change is one of the major components of modern environmental change and has large effects on fluxes of water, carbon and nutrients across large areas of the globe. Urbanized land in the United States covers more than 1.4 million square kilometers and houses more than 80% of the US population. Most new US population growth now occurs in the suburban and exurban areas around major metropolitan centers.  Urban ecosystems potentially great impact on human well being, but the diversity of natural and human controls, and very high heterogeneity at very small scales complicates their analysis and management. This project tested the idea that urban land use change leads to the homogenization of the things homeowners want from their yards, their approach to yard management, and the ecological structure of residential properties that lie in urban, suburban and exurban single-family residential landscapes&mdash;and that the residential systems made up of individual proper ties across diverse US urban areas would be more similar to each other than to the native ecosystems from which they were originally derived. It was hypothesized that this similarity would extend to ecological functions relevant to soils, climate, and carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The study included Phoenix, AZ, Miami, FL, Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, St. Paul, MN, Los Angeles, CA and Salt Lake City, UT.  Major finding included:  (1) There was great similarity of yard management across metropolitan areas. Approximately half of homeowners applied fertilizer and irrigation water to maintain lawns;  (2) Desires for attractive and easy to care for yards were very similar across the US, and outcomes like providing habitat, biodiversity, and avoiding effects on waters were of much lesser importance across all metropolitan areas;  (3) All metropolitan regions had temperature and humidity that was more similar to each other and varied less than native ecosystems, supporting the idea that residential landscapes homogenize microclimate;  (4) Yards had more homogenous plant species richness, composition and structure than natural areas and cultivated tree density was more similar in residential areas than in natural areas;  (5) Yards had higher numbers of plant species than natural areas but similar phylogenetic diversity, indicating that yard species were drawn from a relatively small number of lineages;  (6) Lawn plant species composition was much more similar across metropolitan areas than were the understories of natural areas;  (7) The spontaneous weed species in lawns were even more similar than were planted lawn turfgrasses, indicating that there exists a highly similar set of weeds that occupy lawns across very US residential areas in very different climatic regions.  This project played an important role in training a new generation of young students and postdoctoral scholars in the emerging field of urban ecosystem and landscape ecology.
