<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to encourage and enable academically talented, but financially needy transfer students from diverse backgrounds to enter the workforce or continue in graduate studies following completion of a baccalaureate degree in electrical engineering.  The specific objectives are to provide 20 students full ($10,000 per year) and/or partial ($5,000 per year) scholarships for up to three years, increase the diversity of our incoming engineering students, maintain high retention rates, institutionalize and disseminate successful components of the program, and increase the number of well educated and skilled engineers in the workforce.  The intellectual merit of the program includes active mentorship and student support services. A focus on hands on learning through laboratory oriented classroom activities, a design emphasis throughout the curriculum, a required engineering internship, academic and industrial mentorship throughout students? studies, study hall, and other social and academic activities are included.  Broader impacts of this project are primarily focused on broadening diversity with intentional ethnic recruiting from community college transfer students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This effort has addressed the increasing technical needs of our country by increasing the number and diversity of engineering graduates from our programs and by providing valuable lessons learned regarding how a small, private university can institutionalize successful supports that transition low-income engineering students into thriving engineering graduates.  Thus, by assisting low-income students in attending our nurturing, private college environment and then successfully persisting until graduation and entering the engineering workforce, the project has opened up professional engineering opportunities for diverse low income students and suggests pathways for the engineering workforce to benefit from this group who may struggle to succeed in other university settings.     Broader impacts: Generally, the students who came to us under this scholarship and supports program came from low-income households, underrepresented populations, and atypical backgrounds, such as first generation college students or military veterans.  Resulting from this S-STEM award (and one before it), we have institutionalized some key aspects of their success such as: strengthened recruiting connections with STEM faculty at community colleges, an annual mentor night, industrial mentoring opportunities, engineering-wide social events, study tables, and faculty who are vigilant in addressing individual student needs. This scholarship and support effort has resulted in a) significantly increasing the diversity of our incoming and graduating engineering students, b) high retention rates, and c) diverse, well-educated engineering graduates added to the workforce. This S-STEM grant has provided 33 financially needy transfer students with scholarships to aid them in completing their B.S. degrees in engineering. Thus far, 30 of these 33 have persisted (91%), 20 have graduated, and 10 students are continuing to pursue their engineering degrees.  Of the 20 students who have graduated, all but 3 have found engineering employment: leading to 85% placement for our graduates.  The remaining 3 who have graduated, but not yet found engineering employment, are just a few months out of graduation and actively seeking engineering work.  The 3 who did not persist left our institution due to varying combinations of academic and/or intense personal or family issues. Thirty percent of our S-STEM students under this grant are first generation college students, and six percent are veterans. Thirty-nine percent are under-represented minorities.  During the timeframe of this grant, our engineering programs have risen from 24% to 33% underrepresented ethnic minorities.      Intellectual Merit: Low income students bring varying, valuable experiences with them, and they also bring varying needs. By working closely with 56 students from this group over nine years (for the two S-STEM grants combined), we have learned that these needs can be met by connecting the students in a community through empathy and understanding, accompanied by a comprehensive set of supports that can be tailored to each student individually.  The support set provided must be comprehensive in that it needs to support students emotionally, academically, and socially in addition to financially.  Individualized support involves faculty and staff developing relationships with our students, tracking and interacting with them sufficiently to know when the above supports are needed.  Many students will not seek out these supports, for various reasons, some of which may be related to the culture in which they were raised.  Sometimes a faculty or staff member?s efforts to provide either encouragement to seek out specific supports or to match the student with a specific form of support can make a tremendous difference in a student?s success.  We have found that students perceive this as being cared for, and this can lead the student to work harder, persist and care more themselves.  Note that many of these supports can be accomplished with little or no funds, rather with simply a faculty or staff champion and a departmental culture aimed at providing such supports.  Even on the financial side, sometimes the needed financial support is as simple as a faculty member or fellow student loaning a low income student a textbook for a week or two until they have the funds to purchase the text.   Funds to support students, however, do make a crucial impact. Beyond scholarships, financial support can take the form of paid on-campus jobs relevant for engineering such as lab manager, tutor, lab assistant, study table host, grader or undergraduate research assistant. This ideally would eliminate the need for off-campus jobs which limit students? time availability for studying, socializing, tutoring and mentoring.    Thus, the attainable goal for our low income, diverse students is for them to obtain meaningful employment and to bring value to society through their engineering competence and diverse experiences. We have learned that with intentional efforts to bring these students into community and to offer both comprehensive and individualized support, high retention rates into graduation and the engineering workforce can be achieved.
