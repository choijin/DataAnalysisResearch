<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to address the need for versatile broadband microwave dielectric spectroscopy systems based on fully-integrated silicon platforms. The approach is based on (1) developing a sensor array consisting of true-time-delay sensing units with phase/amplitude read-out circuits; (2) designing a wideband microwave frequency sweep generator to excite the sensor array; and (3) combining the sensor array, and read-out electronics with a fluidic module and an external processing unit as a hybrid lab-on-chip platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed spectroscopy scheme enables complex permittivity measurements over a broad microwave frequency range to realize a self-sustained lab-on-chip platform through the paradigm shift of employing integrated true-time-delay passive sensors. High sensitivity material characterization is based on detecting phase/amplitude change of a signal caused by localized electromagnetic interaction between sensor and sample. An array of sensors is excited with a wideband sweep generator and the phase/amplitude of each sensor is detected using a time-multiplexed control loop to enhance detection resolution and bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Low-cost and small-size microwave spectroscopy systems could significantly enhance the capabilities for point-of-care medical diagnosis, bio-threat detection, agriculture and food/drug safety. The project promotes education and outreach activities through research projects for students. Educational opportunities for under-represented groups will be explored by collaborating with Enrichment Experience Engineering program at Texas A&amp;M University to provide workshops for minority high school teachers in engineering. Attending annual ECE?Unplugged and Society of Women Engineers summer camps will help to inspire high school and women students to join the engineering program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the life of this award, a variety of novel miniaturized and fully-integrated broadband spectroscopy systems were realized to detect complex permittivity of organic chemicals and their mixture with water with high level of accuracy at RF/microwave frequencies.  Different novel RF/micorwave integrated circuit techniques were employed to investigate two major categories of integrated broadband dielectric spectroscipy systems: (1) receiver-based systems which could easily detect both real and imaginary part of the material permitivitty with high accuracy while requiring an additonal power-hungry wideband signal generator, and (2) oscillator-based systems which could detect real part of permittivy with very high accuracy and imaginary part with high accuracy using complex detection  algorithms while being self-sustained with lower power consupmtion compared to the first system. Also, novel integarted sensing elements were implemented using full-wave electromagnetic simulations for suitable on-chip integration.  The implemented dielectric spectroscopy systems represent how advanced RF/microwave integrated circuit design techniques can be related to other disciplines including chemical/biochemical sensing and fluidics. The effort to merge these areas of research and come up with solutions to characterize chemicals/biochemicals is unique. The PI belives the outcomes of this project have the potential to provide an opportunity  to realize new generation of inexpesnive, portable systems for field applications such as material characterization and point-of-care systems.   Regarding development of human resources, a number of Ph.D. and MS students were able to gain exparience in integarted RF/microwave circuit design along with performing related electrical and chemical meausrements which made them prepared to tackle complex mutil-disciplinary projetcs in real world. One Ph.D. and one MS student were fully devoted to this project  while a few other PhD studnets were partially involved  to help acheiving the current outcomes. A  numer of jorunal and conference papers were publihsed in prestigous IEEE Transactions of Microwave Theory and Techniques and presented in IEEE RFIC and International Microwave Sympousiums, respectively.  Finally, a review paper reporting the outcomes of this project along with the state-of-the-art efforts of other research groups working in the same area was prepared by PI and studnets involved in this project and submitted to Micorwave Magazine for publication.
