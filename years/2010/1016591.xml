<AbstractNarration>The investigators will study improved computational algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;model reduction of complex fluid flows.  This research will have two&lt;br/&gt;main thrusts, new closure models and a parametric modeling framework.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will investigate closure for models that are based on &lt;br/&gt;the proper orthogonal decomposition.  This component of the research &lt;br/&gt;will leverage current developments in large eddy simulation along with &lt;br/&gt;two-level algorithms for efficient computational implementation.  The&lt;br/&gt;fact that the closure models follow from both mathematical and physical &lt;br/&gt;arguments will allow for a methodology that generalizes to physical &lt;br/&gt;settings other than fluid flow.  A new globalization methodology that&lt;br/&gt;combines more accurate local models with an interpolation framework&lt;br/&gt;to evaluate the models in parameter space will also be studied.  The &lt;br/&gt;local model improvements are provided using flow sensitivity analysis &lt;br/&gt;and basis functions are constructed using a multidimensional Hermite &lt;br/&gt;interpolation method.   The investigators will emphasize problems in &lt;br/&gt;geophysical fluid dynamics as well as flows with free convection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will expand the applicability of computationally&lt;br/&gt;efficient simulations to a wider class of fluid flows.  The availability&lt;br/&gt;of dramatically faster simulations is important to many engineering &lt;br/&gt;applications including optimization and control of fluid flows, data&lt;br/&gt;assimilation and uncertainty quantification.  Therefore, the research &lt;br/&gt;conducted in this project has direct application to a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;problems that include data assimilation in climate and weather modeling &lt;br/&gt;as well as simulation, optimization, and control of energy efficient buildings.</AbstractNarration>
