<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compatibilized polymer blends continue to be important in traditional bulk applications as well as in thin film related applications (e.g., polymer solar cells, fuel cell membranes, and battery technology). A better understanding of how copolymer additives can enhance polymer blends will enable further advances in these technologies. The research to be conducted as part of this Research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI) renewal award will broaden the knowledge of how copolymer structure can influence bulk and thin film polymer blends. The research will be conducted on compatibilized polymer blends divided into two main areas, bulk blends and thin film blends. Both areas of research will investigate the influence of copolymer additive structure. First, the copolymer effect on the bulk polymer blends will be investigated using scattering techniques, solid state NMR, and atomic force microscopy focusing on thermodynamics and interfacial properties. Second, compatibilization of thin film polymer blends will be investigated with atomic force microscopy both as static films as well as at higher temperatures studying the dewetting and phase separation kinetics. The primary polymer system to be studied is a blend of polybutadiene and polystyrene homopolymers with the additives being various diblock, triblock, and tetrablock copolymers of butadiene and styrene.  The research will take place in a predominantly undergraduate institution, providing summer research experiences for at least four undergraduate students. Outreach activities are also be included that provide opportunities for underrepresented students through the local Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of today's biggest challenges include providing clean energy production through new solar energy and fuel cell technology. The capability of manufacturing high performance materials, which can address needs in these technologies, is very import. Similar advanced materials can impact many other technologies as well, ranging from environmentally friendly roofing materials, mobile devices, coatings, to critical components in automobiles. The research to be conducted as part of this NSF Research in Undergraduate Institutions renewal award will help increase our fundamental knowledge of how to make these kinds of materials with tailored properties and may eventually lead to an increased ability to manufacture new plastics with specific properties. Undergraduate students will be the primary participants in this research giving them vital experience and facilitating their movement into post-baccalaureate education as well as in the scientific work force.  This award will also be beneficial to the educational efforts of the principal investigator's institution through the broadening of research experiences for undergraduate students during the summer and the academic year. Outreach activities are also included that bring underrepresented high school students from a local Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program to our labs for a polymer materials workshop.</AbstractNarration>
