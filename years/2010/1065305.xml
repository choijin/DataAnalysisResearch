<AbstractNarration>Research on 3D image/video perception in the light of general principles of stereo&lt;br/&gt;processing in the human visual system is being used to derive 3D quality metrics for 3D&lt;br/&gt;video applications in order to deliver the best 3D experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human observers can detect differences in depth with high sensitivity, but limited&lt;br/&gt;precision. Moreover, while the visual system can represent fine details of the 2D image&lt;br/&gt;that are carried by high spatial frequency components (even when the image is rapidly&lt;br/&gt;changing), it can not track variations in depth with comparably high resolution in space&lt;br/&gt;or time. Thus the representation of stereoscopic depth is restricted both in bandwidth and&lt;br/&gt;in bit depth. Because of those limitations, some deviations from accuracy in the&lt;br/&gt;representation of depth at the retinal level are perceptually salient, and others less so.&lt;br/&gt;Measurements of perceived image fidelity across a range of spatial and temporal profiles&lt;br/&gt;for the depth signal are being used to guide the development of optimal video processing&lt;br/&gt;techniques, and to allow evaluation of the advantages and limitations of alternative 3D&lt;br/&gt;video coding algorithms such as multiview versus video+depth).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vision experiments investigate both perceived fidelity and perceived image quality in 3D&lt;br/&gt;video generated using a variety of encoding schemes. From those results quality metrics&lt;br/&gt;are developed and integrated into video processing and communications applications. A&lt;br/&gt;human-centric disparity estimation and view synthesis algorithm is being developed for&lt;br/&gt;video processing and communications applications; this can also be used to improve the&lt;br/&gt;performance of object detection, classification and tracking, and to generate multi views&lt;br/&gt;for autostereoscopic display, which finds applications in 3D enabled diagnostic medical&lt;br/&gt;imaging and surgical systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The thrust of our work is in the compression, processing, and analysis of 3D images and video. 3D imaging lies at the intersection of several different fields, a fact that is reflected in the diversity of our work.  Additionally, our collaboration between the Video Processing Lab in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Vision Lab in Psychology Department has resulted in perceptually aware 3D methods for 3D processing.    This year, we focus on crosstalk modeling and cancellation based on our analysis for 3D displays, efficient sparse sampling and depth data reconstruction from sparse samples, adaptive denoising by using targeted database, and psychophysical experiments revealing mechanisms of depth processing in the human visual system.  Circularly polarized LCD (CP LCD) has severe crosstalk especially at certain viewing zone.  We proposed a simple method to calibrate the intrinsic parameters of the display by observation of the screen at 4 different locations.  A linearly rescale algorithm is applied to the input image luminance before applying crosstalk cancellation algorithm yields better preservation of image contrast and color vibrancy. Proposed an adaptive image denoising algorithm that learns a denoising filter by optimally utilizing a given targeted database.  Develop a regularization method using cross similarity, as well as first-pass estimate. Show that, as opposed to natural images, depth maps can be well approximated using a sparse subset of wavelet bases. Moreover, we show that a combined dictionary of wavelets and contourlets can further improve the reconstruction quality. Propose a fast numerical algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multi-pliers (ADMM). We derive novel splitting strategies that allow one to solve a sequence of parallelizable subproblems. We also present a multiscale implementation that utilizes the depth structures for efficient warm starts.    Study the role of texture orientation in the sensing of horizontal disparity.  We psychophysically investigated contrast sensitivity in sensing disparity to bandpass filtered textures of different orientations and center frequencies.  We developed a computational model for the data based on the power spectrum of the stimulus that accurately predicts the sensitivity thresholds of the subjects. Our disparity energy model suggests that the visual system weights the contributions of spectral components based on how effective they are at discerning a particular disparity.   The collaborative nature of our work has also led to several mentoring opportunities and personal development as researchers.
