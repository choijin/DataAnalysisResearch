<AbstractNarration>This award will support the PI Dr. Andrei Stanishevsky and graduate student Michael Walock from the University of Alabama at Birmingham to visit Dr. Corinne Nouveau in the Arts et Métiers ParisTech - Cluny Center, France; Dr. Philippe Jacquet in École Catholique d'Arts et Métiers, Lyon, France; and Dr. Jari Koskinen in Aalto University School of Science and Technology, Espoo, Finland to plan collaborative projects in materials research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This visit is driven by the growing interaction of parties in the area of surface plasma processing, and it is expected to initiate new joint research and student training activities in plasma-assisted processes of fabrication of multiphase nanocomposite materials with controlled microstructure and surface morphologies and understanding the phenomena associated with their formation.  Specific tasks of this planning visit include: (i) coordination of basic and applied research activities to understand the phenomena associated with the synthesis of hard and tough multiphase nanocomposite materials in plasma-assisted processes; (ii) collaborative studies of the mechanical properties, long-term tribological performance, corrosion and thermal stability of such materials through the optimization of the composition, microstructure, surface morphology, and smart design of the interfaces; and (iii) discussion of international student research and training perspectives and establishment of multilateral student training programs in the areas above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is sponsored jointly by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Ceramics program in the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF OISE #1027692 Project Outcomes Report: "U.S. - France - Finland Planning Visit: Collaboration in Plasma-Aided Processing of Nanoscale Materials"          International collaboration in science and technology is increasingly growing around the globe. A recent report from the UKÆs Royal Society indicates that today over 35% of articles published in international journals are internationally collaborative, which illustrates the value of engaging in international collaboration in terms of increasing the impact of research.   Despite the developments in communication technologies, the face-to-face meetings remain critical in establishing the working scientific ties and understanding the cultural customs of the research communities in different countries. For these reasons, a team of a faculty member (Prof. Andrei Stanishevsky) and a graduate student (Mr. Michael Walock) from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) has visited during an intense two-week trip the four institutions in France and Finland, namely, Arts et M&eacute;tiers ParisTech of Cluny (AMPT-Cluny), Ecole Catholique d'Arts et M&eacute;tiers (ECAM) in Lyon, University of Technology of Troyes (UTT), all in France, and Aalto University School of Science and Technology (TKK), Espoo, Finland. The main purpose of this visit was to facilitate a long-term international collaboration in research and education on plasma-aided synthesis and surface modification of nanoscale composite materials. Plasma is the unique state of matter and it has been applied in a wide range of science and technology fields, including advanced semiconductor devices, fabrication of bio-materials, plasma displays, polluted air/soil purification, plasma-engines for space craft, etc. These fields are considered at the frontier of comprehensive science and technology to support industry and society as well as the global environment in the 21st century.         During this visit in October 2010, Prof. Stanishevsky has given seminars on the UAB programs for all four visited sites and discussed the opportunities for U.S. and European students in collaborative research and training. As one of the results of this visit, a PhD co-tutorship agreement has been signed between UAB and AMPT-Cluny, and one UAB graduate student has started an international dual-PhD program in physics and materials.
