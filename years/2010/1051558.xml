<AbstractNarration>Most biodiversity research programs now use biomolecules (DNA and RNA) to help identify, determine evolutionary relationships, or study population biology of species. To meet this need, the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, the largest natural history museum in the Southeast U.S., routinely preserves biomolecules in the form of tissue samples taken from voucher specimens. The collection contains tissues from many species of vertebrates and aquatic invertebrates, including rare and not easily replaced species, and the number of tissue loans made by the museum to external scientific researchers is beginning to outpace that of traditional museum specimens. This important genetic resources collection has been at risk because ultra-cold facilities are not available at the museum to prevent biomolecules from degrading over time at warmer storage temperatures. This project addresses this shortcoming by providing two ultra-cold freezers, associated tissue storage supplies, and technician time to transfer the collection into ultra-cold storage and update the online collections database.&lt;br/&gt;Ensuring the long-term preservation of this collection will greatly improve its utility to a wide variety of user groups in the scientific and resource management communities, especially those in the fields of systematics, population genetics, and conservation genetics. Such research will facilitate informed decisions by conservation planners mitigating loss of biodiversity. The positive scientific impacts of this project will be shared with the U.S. public through three exhibits on biodiversity research at the museum, which is free-of-charge and potentially reaching over 800,000 visitors annually.</AbstractNarration>

These collections are made available to researchers free-of-charge in the global scientific community. There is a growing demand by researchers to not only study the preserved specimens, but also to analyze biomolecules (such as DNA and RNA) that are associated with these specimens. To meet these needs, the museum has been rapidly expanding its genetic resources collection (tissue samples associated with voucher specimens for the purpose of molecular analysis). This valuable collection contains tissues from a great diversity of species and geographic regions, including many rare and not easily replaced organisms. In the past, facilities were not available at the museum to store these genetic resources in ultra-cold conditions to prevent long-term thermal degradation of the biomolecules contained in the tissues.
