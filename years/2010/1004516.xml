<AbstractNarration>James Madison University will host an eight-week undergraduate research program for eight undergraduates per year during the summers of 2010-2014.  The program will provide its student participants with an authentic mathematical research experience by having each participant: (1) Work with another student on a research project with a faculty mentor; (2) Write a research paper containing project results; (3) Participate in common seminars; (4) Present results to the other research groups throughout the program; (5) Participate in a poster session with students in the other NSF-REU programs in Biology, Chemistry, and Materials Science; (6) Have the opportunity to attend the seminars in Biology, Chemistry, and Materials Science; (7) Participate in social activities with undergraduate research students in the other sciences; (8) Present results at professional meetings during the following academic year; and (9) Remain in contact with his/her mentor after the end of the project.  As part of the evaluation process, students will complete the ROLE survey developed by David Lopatto at Grinnell College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant effort will be made to recruit and select students of mathematically underrepresented groups, as well as from institutions less likely to have resources available to support research activity, and our relatively high percentage of female mentors (40% over the past 3 years) should help encourage female applicants. Our program also advances discovery and understanding by the very nature of the research experience, and promotes teaching by supporting student presentations at conferences.  The interaction among the participants and the undergraduate research students in the other sciences will disseminate mathematical insight across scientific disciplines and increase the understanding of other scientific topics among the mathematics participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At James Madison University (JMU), during each of the summers of 2010 - 2014, 8 undergraduate students worked in groups of 2 or 4 under the direction of 1 or 2 (resp.) faculty mentors on research projects in mathematics or statistics.  Each of the projects followed the same trajectory: learning background material, identifying one or more open problems, working to solve those problems, writing the results in the form of a research paper, and presenting those results to others on the last day of the program.  For many of the summers, the mathematics students interacted with research students from the areas of biology, chemistry, and materials science.  In addition, there were internally-funded mathematics students as well as those supported by other external means.  This resulted in a vibrant undergraduate research community.  Each summer, 3 speakers of various types gave presentations to the NSF students (as well as the others): a former JMU REU student at the end stages of his/her PhD program, a mathematics student with an advanced degree that works in industry, and a representative of a mathematics PhD program.  Each of these speakers took on a different role, but the common denominator to all of them -- and perhaps their greatest value to the students -- was their ability to answer the students' questions about life after undergraduate school.  The results of these projects were presented at national, regional, and local meetings.  We had a high acceptance rate in the Undergraduate Research Special Sessions at the Joint Mathematics Meetings over the years, which was probably our primary venue, but in some cases our students opted to participate in the poster session instead.    Depending on the volume of the results, various types of publications were often (but not always) generated, from standard research journals to undergraduate journals.  The students who participated in our REU program were provided with an authentic research experience.  In some cases, this encouraged students to pursue a PhD in mathematics (when they were previously unsure of that course), and in other cases, students realized that another career choice was better suited to them.  But each of these cases should be classified as a success.       Last Modified: 06/18/2015       Submitted by: Leonard A Vanwyk]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
