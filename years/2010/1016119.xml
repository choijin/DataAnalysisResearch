<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21 July 2010&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1016119&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Oregon State University&lt;br/&gt;PI:   P. Zerr&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) item for Oregon State University?s R/V WECOMA; namely a large diameter mooring block.   This item will improve safety on deck and help bring the R/V WECOMA into compliance with the latest version of the UNOLS Research Vessel Safety Standards.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The R/V WECOMA supports federally funded scientific research in the Pacific in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house events.  The WECOMA is scheduled to complete eighty five (85) NSF sponsored days in 2010.</AbstractNarration>
