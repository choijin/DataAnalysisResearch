<AbstractNarration>This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) grant provides funding to assess the effectiveness of oxygen plasma as a means of tuning the workfunction, and therefore charge injection properties of zinc oxide (ZnO) films for potential use as anodes in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).  Measurements of the workfunction, composition, structure, conductivity and luminescent properties of pulsed laser deposited and magnetron sputtered ZnO films before and after they had been exposed to oxygen plasma treatments of specific duration, plasma density and applied power will determine the induced workfuction alterations, as well as correlate structural modifications with changes in electro-optical properties.  To gain insight to the charge injection mechanism, temperature dependent current-voltage measurements of "hole-only" structures with as-deposited ZnO films will be compared to structures with plasma treated films and known workfunction changes.  In parallel, Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations of defected ZnO surfaces will compute properties such as defect structure and workfunction changes due to surface modification by oxygen plasma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work addresses the need for significantly reduced OLED materials and processing costs.  The combination of experimental methods and computational techniques is expected to provide predictive models for the ZnO surface modification and properties changes due to oxygen plasma processing, and a deeper understanding of the basic mechanisms involved.  The results will indicate the feasibility of using ZnO for hole injection instead of the typical ITO/organic hole injector/ organic hole transporter multilayer stack.  The higher ZnO thermal conductivity compared to organic materials can be expected to reduce device operating temperature, and increase device stability and lifetime.  Its relatively low cost compared to ITO and organic hole injectors can be expected to have a significant positive impact on OLED commercialization.  As such, ZnO anodes could potentially be the foundation for a second generation of low cost OLEDs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Solar cells are a critical component of renewable energy generation and organic light emitting diodes OLEDs are significantly more energy efficient than incandescent or fluorescent lighting.  Indium-tin-oxide (ITO) is the most widely used transparent conducting oxide (TCO) in solar-cells and OLEDs. However, the Earth's reserve of indium is only 6000 tones according to the US Geological survey. When it is considered that solar cells must be deployed on a Terawatt scale to have a noticeable impact on energy needs for example, then the need for TCOs constituted from Earth abundant elements becomes obvious. Additionally, there is a significant need for reduced cost TCO materials (compared to ITO) because materials and manufacturing costs are principal bottlenecks to more widespread deployment of the aforementioned  technologies.  ZnO satisfies both the Earth abundant and reduced cost criteria, and study of this material system for the aforementioned applications is therefore justified.   Zinc oxide (ZnO) films were grown by radio frequency magnetron sputter deposition and the changes to its surface composition and workfunction induced by argon sputter-cleaning and oxygen plasma treatments were characterized using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and density functional theory (DFT) modeling. Compared to a workfunction of 3.74 eV for the as-deposited ZnO films, a workfunction of 3.95 eV was obtained after Ar sputter-cleaning and 4.21 eV after exposure to oxygen plasma.  The data indicate that oxygen plasma treatment leads to a more negative ZnO surface. The dipole induced by this charge redistribution reinforces the original surface dipole, which results in an increase of the surface dipole moment and an increase of workfunction.  The reverse is true for hydrocarbon contamination of ZnO surfaces. Excellent qualitative agreement between the experimental results and computational modeling was obtained. The results suggest that specific surface functionalization may be a viable method of controlling the workfunction of ZnO for use as the transparent conducting oxide in optoelectronic applications such as solar cells and organic light emitting diodes.
