<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research proposal seeks to discover and describe the conditions and experiences that impact science learning for female and male language minority (LM) and English Language Learner (ELL) adolescent students in urban middle schools.  LM students are students who live in homes where a language other than English is spoken.  ELLs are language minorities who have been identified as having limited proficiency in spoken and written English. This study will explore the interactions among school administrators, teachers, parents, and adolescent LM/ELL students from ethnic/language subgroups in the context of science learning in urban middle schools through a gender lens. Because national data are rarely disaggregated by gender, race or ethnicity, little is known about the educational needs, achievements, or problems of LM/ELL students, and specifically, how the needs of female LM/ELL students may differ from their male peers.  This research will focus on adolescent LM/ELL students in science highlighting the role of gender in the context of ethnicity and culture in grades 6-8 science classrooms. The study is designed as an exploratory, three-year, mixed-methods study to examine the experiences of female and male LM/ELL students from particular marginalized subgroups, including Latinas/os (Dominican, Puerto Rican, and Mexican) and Southeast Asians (Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Indonesian) and Chinese (Fujianese, Cantonese, and mainland).  In exploring the science learning experiences of linguistically and ethnically diverse female and male adolescent students the researchers will develop case study examples that illustrate relationships and tensions between learning science, students' gender, ELL status, ethnicity and class.  Specifically, the research will explore inter-categorical complexity and socio-cultural learning theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impact of this research will be the dissemination of findings to researchers,science teacher educators, K-12 educators, school administrators, and policymakers who can positively transform practices and policies to better support science learning for female and male LM and ELL students. Ultimately, these new understandings have the potential to increase male and female language minority students' participation in STEM fields, particularly females who are most significantly underrepresented in STEM majors and careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Objectives  Gender and Science Proficiency for English Language Learners (Project G-SPELL) was an exploratory research project that focused on the connections between gender, attitudes, experiences, and practices in relation to science learning and to future careers in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) for female English Language Learners (ELL). To provide a multifaceted view of the participantsÆ experiences and practices, data was also collected from teachers, administrators, and families. Results from the project addressed the following areas, all of which were found to influence ELL girlsÆ achievement in STEM: (1) the participantsÆ attitudes about science and science learning; (2) the pedagogical practices used by the participantsÆ teachers; (3) teachersÆ expectations related to the ELL studentsÆ family involvement; (4) institutional factors in the school and community; and (5) the teachersÆ use of cogenerative dialogues as a means to better understand the studentsÆ needs as STEM learners. ParticipantsÆ Attitudes about Science   ELL students in an urban middle school and who participated in the project, expressed concern that teachers were asking them to help boys who were truant learn science.  In addition, the girls recommended that teachers use laboratory stations and supportive reading strategies to enhance their learning of science concepts.   A survey that was implemented as part of the project and focused on studentsÆ science attitudes and practices found no gender differences on four of the five subscales.  The exception was for the subscale Views of Science.  For this subscale, the mean score was significantly higher for boys than it was for girls. It appeared as though boys exuded more confidence in their science ability when compared to girls and boys were more likely to see themselves remaining in science classes as compared to girls.  In the survey, Asian girls reported that adults in their home were not very supportive of their academic studies.  The Asian girls and boys had significantly lower mean scores than Latina/o and African American students on "What parents/adults do". However, in spite of less home support as compared to their peers, Asian girls had more positive views of science when compared with Latina girls.  Latina/o studentsÆ attitudes towards science were significant lower than their African American and Asian counterparts. This differed depending on whether or not the Latina/o students spoke Spanish or English at home.  Middle school Latina/o students who reported speaking Spanish at home had less positive attitudes towards science when compared to the Latina/o students who spoke English at home. In addition, the Latina/o students whose home language was English had similar attitudes towards science as compared to their African American or Asian peer.  These attitudes skewed positive.  An implication of this is that with increasing diversity in the K-12 population and emphasis on language skills such as argumentation, science educators need to explore the different learning needs for Latina/o students in connection with their home languages and current proficiency levels in English.   Pedagogical Practices and Cogenerative Dialogues of Teachers   Through the use of cogenerative dialogues, science teachersÆ lessons were analyzed using the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) and the Sheltered Instruction Observational Protocol (SIOP).   Results of the analyses revealed that effective science teachers consistently engaged the students through questioning strategies about the science concepts. Moreover, effective science teachers gave students time to answer questions and had high expectations for the level of respect that class members would show each other as well as the teacher.  In addition, these science teachers provided language support to their ELL students through linguistic strategies that taught vocabulary (e.g., asking students to write down wor...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
