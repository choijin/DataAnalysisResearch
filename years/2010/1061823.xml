<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The past few decades have accumulated mounting evidence of profound anthropogenic effects on fundamental biogeochemical processes across the planet, especially in coastal environments that support a diverse array of highly productive ecosystems including coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and estuaries. The ecological significance of seagrasses is largely due to the remarkable degree of adaptation they exhibit to a submerged aquatic existence. Despite numerous successful adaptations, however, seagrasses have high light requirements that make them vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbances. The paradoxical vulnerability results largely from their high reliance on dissolved aqueous CO2 for photosynthesis. The potential for rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations to have significant warming impacts on the global climate has long been recognized, but the potential impacts of the "other CO2 problem", also known as ocean acidification, have only recently begun to be appreciated. As with other impacts of climate change, the increased concentrations of dissolved aqueous CO2 [CO2 (aq)] in the oceans of the world will elicit both negative and positive responses among organisms, ultimately potentiating ecological losers and winners. This project will explore the response of eelgrass to increased CO2 (aq) within the context of a warming coastal ocean using a combination of manipulative experiments, physiological/biochemical investigations and mathematical modeling. The investigators hypothesize that rising CO2(aq) will increase the high temperature tolerance of plants by improving the Q10 response of photosynthesis relative to respiration, thereby leading to higher growth rates, improved survival of vegetative shoots at high temperature, and even flowering output and seed production. This project will investigate the key relationships between environmental parameters that have both negative (ocean warming) and positive (ocean carbonation) impacts on the light requirements and dynamics of carbon balance in these critically important marine angiosperms. By focusing on Chesapeake populations growing near the southern limit of eelgrass distribution on the Atlantic coast, the investigators  will gain predictive insight into how climate change may alter the geographic distribution of this critically important species in other coastal environments that may be subjected to less temperature stress but similar levels of ocean carbonation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This work will provide training in plant physiology and biochemistry to the co-PI, Dr. Victoria Hill and will support the dissertation research of at least two graduate students over the course of the 4-year study. Collaboration with the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center will facilitate the development of educational interpretation and programming from this project that will be specifically targeted to the 650,000 to 700,000 people that visit the Aquarium each year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Seagrass meadows create diverse and productive ecosystems in shallow seas through the world.  Our ability to predict their response to climate change, however, remains elusive.  Eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) populations of the Chesapeake region lie near the southern limit of their range in the Western North Atlantic, exposing them to increasing temperature stress as the climate warms.  However, ocean acidification may offset some of the negative effects of temperature by stimulating photosynthesis of these carbon-limited aquatic plants.  We explored the response of Chesapeake Bay eelgrass to carbon dioxide availability and climate warming using manipulative experiments and mathematical modeling.  In our experiments, carbon dioxide enrichment increased eelgrass photosynthesis, growth, sugar production, shoot survival and flower production, even under warm temperatures that typically cause plants to die.  The experimentally determined effects of temperature and carbon dioxide were translated into a mathematical model we call GrassLight, that provided a predictive environment for evaluating the interaction of multiple stressors on eelgrass distribution and density in the sea.  Model predictions were verified against the experimental data and validated against field observations of eelgrass distribution in the Chesapeake Region.  The model accurately reproduced the submarine light environment from measured water quality parameters, and predicted their impacts on eelgrass distribution.  It also reproduced the negative effects of warm summer temperatures on eelgrass distributions in the absence of ocean acidification, and demonstrated that carbon dioxide increases projected for the next century should stimulate photosynthesis sufficiently to offset the negative effects of temperature stress on eelgrass growing in the Chesapeake Region.  Thus, improved water quality should facilitate the survival of eelgrass populations in Chesapeake region, even in the face of a warming climate.  The model is now being used to provide options regarding bay wide strategies for managing eelgrass and other aquatic plants in the face of a changing climate.  This project provided training in plant physiology, oceanography and marine ecology opportunities for one postdoctoral associate, five graduate students, two undergraduate students and two high school interns.  Results were disseminated through peer-reviewed publications in major scientific journals, numerous oral and poster presentations given at scientific conferences, in several publications by ODU, by Virginia Sea Grant, and the Virginian Pilot newspaper.  We held several open-house days in association with Virginia Aquarium public events, making our experimental facility and scientists available for public inspection, often talking to more than 100 visitors on any given day.  We worked with the Mentoring Young Scientists Program at the Virginia Aquarium, teaching students from local middle schools about the importance of eelgrass for the Chesapeake Bay, and the potential impacts of climate change on their survival, using hands-on experiments and demonstration projects.
