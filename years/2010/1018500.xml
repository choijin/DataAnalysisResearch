<AbstractNarration>Quantum computing offers more efficient ways to solve certain computational tasks by taking advantage of quantum mechanical principles in its computational operations.  However, successful quantum information processing requires mechanisms that make the basic operations reliable.  This project will extend the theory of subsystem codes, a class of quantum error-correcting codes that have rich structure and the potential to realize fault-tolerant operations more efficiently.  The goal of this project is to generalize the theory of subsystem codes from finite fields to more general arithmetic structures.  The objective is use this theory to derive better means to protect quantum information and obtain a wider class of efficient fault-tolerant quantum operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An outreach component directed towards K-12 students tries to wet the appetite for theoretical computer science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A quantum computer stores information in the states of quantum mechanical systems. A computation can take advantage of quantum mechanical properties when manipulating the information. For many computational problems, a quantum computer is able to solve the problem much faster than any classical computer. Thus, quantum computing promises a new computer technology that can change the world.       The engineering of a quantum computer is complicated by two major sources of errors:   (E1) Since the quantum bits tend to interact with their environment, it is a challenge to keep the information safely stored in quantum states, so storage errors likely affect the computation.   (E2) Performing the computational steps without error is another challenge since it requires a level of quantum control that is difficult to engineer. So operational errors likely affect the computation.   This project developed quantum error-correcting codes over nice nearrings to reduce the probability of storage errors. Reducing the storage errors requires keeping the information protected by quantum error-correcting codes. The project developed fault-tolerant operations that act on the encoded states and are designed to reduce the likelihood of operational errors. This project made significant contributions to reduce the likelihood of the two main sources of errors in quantum computers.   This project developed the theory of subsystem codes over nice nearrings, a special class of quantum error-correcting codes.  We investigated different alternatives to discretize the errors. We showed how to derive such subsystem codes from classical codes and how to obtain the parameters of the quantum code from the classical code.   Our approach allowed us to compare several alternatives for the arithmetic of subsystem codes.  Among other results, we proved that free subsystem codes over a finite chain ring cannot perform better than those over a finite field. It is remarkable that one can compare quantum codes over different arithmetic at all, let alone derive subsystem codes over fields that have the same rate than a subsystem code over a finite chain ring.   We designed subsystem codes and entanglement-assisted codes that allow us to mitigate storage errors.       Apart from storage errors, a big source of errors is given by operational errors. These errors occur because the quantum operations are imperfect. One way to mitigate operational errors is by using fault-tolerant operations. We constructed fault-tolerant quantum operations for a wide class of quantum codes over nice rings. We introduced the notion of a triorthogonal stabilizer code over a nice ring. In the binary case, a universal set of gates is given by Hadamard gates, phase gates, controlled-not and Toffoli gates. Remarkably, we were able to generalize each of these gates and derive fault-tolerant operations for triorthogonal CSS codes over nice rings.        Impacts. Computational devices that manipulate and store information in the state of quantum mechanical systems have striking applications that cannot be accomplished by traditional computers. This project explored the arithmetic of nice nearrings and nice rings in the construction of quantum codes. The advantage is that one might be able to use arithmetic that is quite simple to implement and so does not induce a high hardware overhead.      The project laid the foundations for a theory of quantum subsystem codes over nice nearrings. General principles for subsystem code constructions were derived. New techniques were developed that relate the quantum subsystem codes over nice rings and finite fields. We found a large set of fault-tolerant operations for quantum codes over nice rings. The combination of results allows us to make quantum devices more robust against storage and operational errors.           The mathematical techniques that have been developed in this project for the construction of quantum subsystem codes will likely find applications in other areas of mathematics such as group and representation theory.           The project trained three graduate students that have derived their theses from this project. The project also had a direct impact on the development of new course materials for a course on quantum algorithms that leads undergraduate and graduate students without background to the research frontier of quantum computing within a semester.   We organized a interdisciplinary quantum computing seminar that was attended students and faculty from many departments.
