<AbstractNarration>Biosensors are one of the potentially transformative applications of nanotechnology. One of the promising application areas is in the agrifood sector, where biosensors could be used for the tracking and monitoring of potentially diseased animals. This proposal is for a workshop to convene multiple critical stakeholders to investigate the ethical and social issues involved in the deployment of biosensors in this domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is conceived as a networking process that will generate and incorporate new interactions and ideas before, during, and after the workshop event. In so doing, the project creates some of the possible conditions for an anticipatory community of practice that is built around discussions of social and ethical issues. Such a community does not presently exist in responnse to the agrifood applications of nano-biosensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: A key outcome will be the beginning of a network map of the supply-chain within which nano-biosensors will be integrated. The information will be used for the development of larger stakeholder workshops that include up to 20-30 participants, and that can generate data on the social and ethical issues. The information will also improve further anticipatory governance activities for non-expert citizens like science cafes and consensus conferences, not just on agrifood, but nanotechnology more generally. For example, some of the ideas on social and ethical issues could be used by rganizers of these activities as the basis for discussion between citizens and experts, and as background material for preparing participants to discuss nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
