<AbstractNarration>The BP oil spill began on April 20th, 2010 and leaked oil into the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of 35,000 to 60,000 barrels per day for a period of about three months.  Various technologies have been deployed to attempt to collect or disperse the oil and to minimize damage to wildlife and property.  This includes the use of about 1 million pounds of chemical dispersants to disperse the oil.  The large-scale introduction of dispersants into the environment has led to an intense focus on the safety and environmental impact of these chemicals.  The objective of this project is to develop "bio-dispersants" that are effective and minimally toxic to key organisms native to the Gulf of Mexico.  The bio-dispersants will be produced by the natural process of fermentation.  Specifically, microorganisms will be used to convert underutilized agricultural residue (for example, soybean hulls) into bio-dispersants.  Gene engineering methods will be used in the laboratory to generate many different pure cultures of the microorganisms, each of which produces a different bio-dispersant.  Each bio-dispersant will be purified, and the ability of each bio-dispersant to disperse oil will be measured.  Bio-dispersants that are effective will be tested to determine whether they are toxic to key organisms, the benthic infauna, which are important members of the Gulf food chain and ecosystem.  The objective of this research is to use iterative rounds of design, production and testing to discover bio-dispersants that are safe and effective.  All significant findings from this work will be published promptly.  All results and data collected as part of this research will be made available to other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  &lt;br/&gt;The integration of computer design tools with robotic manipulation enables the use of cellular and molecular biology to produce new chemicals and materials. The field created by the convergence of computer science, robotics and biology is called "synthetic biology".  There was a revolution in chemistry that occurred between 1930 and 1960, typically referred to as the "synthetic chemistry" revolution. It was during that period that scientists and engineers learned to use petrochemical feedstocks to produce the vast array of organic chemicals, polymers and plastics available to us today. We are in the early phase of a new revolution in chemistry. In particular, "synthetic biology" is enabling engineers to generate the chemicals and materials needed by our society from renewable raw materials, similar to the way "synthetic chemistry" enabled the production of organic chemicals from petroleum.  Synthetic biology is enabling a "sustainable chemistry" revolution, which represents a significant opportunity for America because it depends on combining three areas of U.S. strength and excellence:  agriculture, biotechnology and chemical manufacturing.  According to the BIO Organization, sustainable chemistry could lead to the generation of $190 billion in domestic revenue from chemical sales, and to the creation or retention of 237,000 U.S. jobs.  This research project represents a collaboration between a leading company in this important field, Modular Genetics, Inc. and scientists at three universities:  Columbia University, Iowa State University and Louisiana State University.  This project should simultaneously lead to the launch of new commercial products, and to the training of scientists and engineers prepared drive this industry forward.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Today, surfactants and polymers are widely used in various industries, such as personal care, pharmaceutics, and mineral processing. Surfactants are also used for oil dispersion in oil spills. In the majority of these applications, surfactants are used in the form of mixtures/formulations. In this regard, the use of conventional surfactants, has spurred debate with regard to their toxicity. Therefore, the development of greener surfactants is considered to be more environmentally benign; especially to minimize the possible toxicity effects of surfactants on the sea habitats. In this investigation, various bacillus subtilis-derived biosurfactants were evaluated for their potential use in oil spill remediation.     As a major component of the NSF RAPID funded project, various microbially derived surfactants (named as FA-GLU and Surfactin) were evaluated for their oil dispersion capability.  These surfactants were observed to disperse oil at a dosage level that is comparable to some of the conventional surfactants available or used for oil dispersion.          FA-GLU            COREXIT           Figure shows that oil (indicated by red dye) is dispersed in water beyond certain concentrations of the surfactants (CMC).      Figure shows a comparison of the dispersion capability of conventional (Corexit) and "green" surfactants. Table outlines that CMC (Critical Micellar Concentration), a parameter typically defined as the concentration above which a surfactant will disperse oil in water, was observed to be lower for the greener surfactants.        Table: CMC values of conventional (Corexit) and "greener" (FA-Glu and Surfactin) surfactants         The research findings as presented above show promise for the usage of greener reagents for oil spill remediation. Furthermore; an understanding of the scientific role of these molecules in oil dispersion is expected to pave pathways for development of numerous other microbially derived molecules.
