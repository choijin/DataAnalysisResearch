<AbstractNarration>In response to the Deep Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Tulane University is awarded a RAPID grant to expand and enhance the Fishnet2 network of fish collection databases (http://www.fishnet2.net).  They will expand and enhance the network to facilitate rapid searches and extraction of archived data on Gulf of Mexico fishes. The oil spill has the potential to have far-reaching, long-term impacts on species, communities and food webs in both offshore and near-shore areas of the Gulf of Mexico. It occurred at a time when many oceanic species are spawning in areas of the Gulf of Mexico affected by the spill, including critically endangered species such as the bluefin tuna, which spawns in the gulf from April to June.  The bluefin tuna is just one of the thousands of marine fishes and other organisms whose larvae are currently being exposed to oil-derived toxins in the Gulf of Mexico.   The ability of scientists to assess the impacts of the spill on the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem depends critically on the availability of baseline data on the composition and structure of biotic communities in the region under natural conditions.  Natural history museums contain a wealth of data on marine resources spanning decades to hundreds of years. In most instances, the sampling was conducted by national marine natural resource agencies, which regularly census various components of the marine biota and routinely engage members of the scientific community in this endeavor.  As a result of the scientific engagement, specimens from the cruises have made their way to various museums to be identified, studied and archived.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enhanced portal will serve as a research resource for assessing impacts of the current oil spill and other such environmental disasters in the future. It will also serve as a model for enhancing data networks for other groups of organisms.  The specific enhancements planned for this project include a new mapping interface, the ability to conduct online spatial queries and searches based on gear-type and user-defined depth zone. The new map interface will be based on OpenLayers and will support Open Street Maps, Google and Bing. The Fishnet2 portal already supports downloading results as .KML files for visualization of point occurrences using Google Earth and/or ArcGIS. With the proposed enhancements, a user could draw polygons on the search interface map or upload a .KML file describing a search area (e.g., the projected spill impact area) and use this as a spatial filter for extracting data from Fishnet2.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Platform explosion on 22 April 2010 and subsequent release of millions of barrels of crude oil into the northern Gulf of Mexico now officially rank among the worst environmental disasters in U.S. History.  The full environmental and ecological impacts of the spill will not be fully understood for some time, but are potentially far-reaching and long-term, including impacts on species, communities and food webs in both offshore and nearshore areas of the Gulf of Mexico.  The ability of ecologists and other scientists to assess the impacts of the spill on the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem depends critically on the availability of baseline data on the composition and structure of biotic communities in the region under natural conditions.  Natural history museums contain a wealth of data on marine resources, spanning decades to hundreds of years, gathered by scientists from academic institutions and marine resource agencies (e.g., NOAA, MMS).  Taxonomic specialists identified the specimens and archived the material in various natural history collections for future study.   The Tulane University Biodiversity Research Institute (TUBRI) is actively involved in managing a network specimen records from fish collection databases called Fishnet2 (http://www.fishnet2.net).  The Fishnet2 portal contains more than 100,000 records of fish occurrences from the Gulf of Mexico, representing more than 1,900 valid fish species.  The project aimed to expand and enhance the Fishnet2 portal to make it easier for researchers to find and download data on Gulf of Mexico fishes archived in natural history museums.  Specific enhancements completed include a new data-mapping interface and capabilities to perform online queries by gear type, and user-defined surface area (spatial query) or depth zone.   We have also added the capability to search Fishnet2 by common name and a system for resolving synonyms (multiple names applied to the same species).   The spatial query interface is based on OpenLayers (http://openlayers.org/) and uses data from Open Street Maps, Google Maps and Bing Maps as optional base maps.

In addition to ".csv" (comma-separated value)  and  ".txt" (text) formats, search results can be dowloaded as ".kml" files, which permits visualization of all geospatially-referenced search results in Google Earth and/or ArcGIS.  We also improved the service used to harvest data from various institutional collections provider data to Fishnet2 (data providers) and improved the search results summaries presented to users.  Search results can be viewed in the form of full specimen records or summaries organized by taxon (species or higher taxonomic groups), institutions and geographic areas.   Lastly, we added a number of new data providers to the network, increasing the number of lots based holdings by 906,655 records to over 4 million records:  University of Arkansas Collections Facility, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology Texas Natural History Science Center - Texas Natural History Collections Louisiana State University Museum of Zoology Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Ohio State University - Fish Division California Academy of Sciences Florida Museum of Natural History Natural History Museum and Institute - Chiba Kagoshima University Museum Swedish Museum of Natural History University of Tennessee-Etnier Ichthyological Research Collection    A number of presentations on the project were given at scientific meetings, including the 2011 Biodiversit...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
