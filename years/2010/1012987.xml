<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program supports Professor Jory A. Yarmoff of the University of California-Riverside in a project involving the use of low energy alkali ion scattering to characterize the surface properties of metal oxides and related materials. Energy spectra of the projectiles that scatter from the surface provide a measure of the elemental composition at the surface, while the fraction of ions neutralized and their angular distribution provide information on the inhomogeneous local electrostatic potential. The research will utilize other surface analysis tools, such as scanning probe microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy, to enable a complete characterization of the materials under investigation. The systems to be studied include clean metal oxide surfaces, surfaces that have intentional oxygen vacancy defects, and atoms and molecules adsorbed on the oxide surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will expand basic knowledge of ion-surface charge exchange for an important class of materials that are ubiquitous in nature and technology, as well as enable the development of new analytical methods. These experiments will impact applications in electronics, catalysis, photochemistry and other technologies that rely on the electronic and chemical properties of metal oxides. The project will contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students through hands-on laboratory experience in an important area of modern research. Outreach efforts will impact local high school teachers through a summer program that includes actual laboratory experience.</AbstractNarration>

Their importance ranges from the abundance of naturally occurring oxide minerals to their uses as supports for chemical catalysts and as insulators in microelectronic devices. To understand and quantify the fundamental behavior of metal oxide materials, particularly for applications that involve devices and processes at the nanoscale, it is necessary to measure their surface electronic properties at the atomic level and determine how they change with the introduction of defects and adsorbates that might stick to the surface.

In particular, metal nanoclusters deposited onto oxide surfaces are driving the development of nanoscale electronic, opto-electronic, micro-mechanical and molecular-based devices that are impacting diverse arenas such as microelectronics, solar power and cancer detection.  This project uses a specialized technique, neutralization during low energy ion scattering (LEIS) with alkali projectiles, in conjunction with other surface analysis tools to interrogate the properties of metal oxides and related materials as defects, adsorbates and nanoclusters are introduced in a controlled fashion in ultra-high vacuum (on the order of 10-10 torr). Additional experiments are performed in an effort to quantify the ion-surface charge exchange mechanisms needed to fully interpret the LEIS data.  LEIS involves the bombardment of a surface with low energy ions (1-5 keV) and measuring the energy and angular distribution of the projectiles that backscatter after colliding with the sample. The energy distribution has features related to the mass distribution of the surface atoms, while analysis of the angular distribution can be used to determine the detailed atomic structure in the surface region. The novelty of our particular approach is to use alkali ions, such as lithium or sodium, and to measure the probability that these ions neutralize during scattering. The neutralization occurs as the ions pick up an electron from the material, and the probability for neutralization of an alkali projectile depends on the local electrostatic potential at the surface, which is a fundamental property of a solid.  The particular experiments performed include:  1)    A novel oxide material, the high-Tc superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&delta; (abbreviated as BSCCO), was subjected to low energy argon ion bombardment and interrogated with alkali LEIS. The evolution of the spectra showed that the Sr feature becomes attenuated while the Bi peak grows, indicating that the surface becomes covered with a Bi oxide overlayer as a result of the energy deposited by the argon ions.  2)    The charge transfer from a silicon surface to scattered lithium projectiles was investigated as a function of the sample doping level and quantified with a simple theoretical model. This work has implications in the use of ion-surface charge exchange for interrogating any material with a band gap.  3)    An instrument was constructed for studying the chemical activity of oxide materials with temperature programmed desorption (TPD). This technique involves the adsorption of precursor molecules onto a surface, followed by rapid heating to remove the reaction products.  4)    Low energy alkali ion scattering was used to investigate how the electronic structure of a platinum thin film deposited onto titanium dioxide changes when bombarded with argon ions. It was found that the energy deposited by the ions induces the formation of nanoclusters, but that the clusters become encapsulated by the oxide substrate. This encapsulation is a chemical effect that has implications for the usefulness of certain metals as nanocatalysts.  5)    The surface termination of the topological insulator, Bi2Se3, which is a promising materia...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
