<AbstractNarration>The center is significantly strengthening and expanding the impact of faculty development across the ATE Program and stimulating program improvement in technician education by adapting and implementing innovative strategies and using Web 2.0 technologies to: (1) expand the services and increase use of www.TeachingTechnicians.org; (2) scale up peer mentoring and technical assistance to affect program improvement in technician education; (3) identify and broadly disseminate proven and promising strategies for program improvement, with a specific focus on broadening participation of underrepresented groups; and, (4) stimulate the use of evaluation tools to identify and sustain success and help foster a culture of evaluation in the ATE program. The center is initiating a sustainable process for transforming implicit know-how from mature ATE Centers and projects into explicit knowledge and tools to improve technician education, in part, through the adaptation of a successful business model developed by the National Dropout Prevention Center, Clemson University. The adaptations are linking educators to advice and evidence-based "ATE Solutions" to move ATE forward and minimize duplication of effort in technician education.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The SCATE National Resource Center for Expanding Excellence in Technician Education: Advancing Faculty Development and Program Improvement (AFDPI) has expanded excellence in technician education with innovative, highly-acclaimed curriculum products, effective faculty development, and successful program improvement (e.g., recruitment, retention, industry partnerships, and internships). &nbsp;&nbsp;TeachingTechnicians.org was launched and effectively delivers via targeted contact content to technician and related STEM educators to support program improvement in technician education. &nbsp;The TeachingTechnicians.org website serves as a matching service that alerts and connects registered users to faculty development opportunities across the NSF ATE Program and beyond. TeachingTechnicians.org has more than 4,000 registered users, more than 1,300 faculty development events have been posted, and over 330 published works are searchable via a unique <em>Compendium of Research on Technician Education </em>which was<em> </em>created in 2013.&nbsp; Thirty-four ?TNET?&nbsp;videos providing assistance for NSF ATE Principal Investigators have been produced with over 1800 views; and, ATETV, a SCATE Center partner initiative led by Pellet Productions, is accessed via the TeachingTechnicians.org website.&nbsp;</p> <p>TeachingTechnicians.org features all ATE TV video products produced by Pellet Productions. The Build Your Own (BYO) Customized Recruitment Video project, implemented in partnership with Pellet Productions, provides online, user-friendly tools that enable faculty and others to develop create cost-free videos customized for their colleges and programs. Online tools, which include tutorials, have been augmented by numerous BYO faculty development workshops that provide hands-on help for faculty as they learn to develop customized student recruitment videos to attract students to technician education programs.&nbsp;</p> <p>The SCATE National Resource Center addressed the problem of early dropouts in technician education programs by disseminating a previously-developed Technology Gateway problem-based learning, multi-discipline curriculum that contextualizes mathematics, science and communication courses that are foundational to technician education programs and technology careers. This curriculum and adaptations thereof are in use nationally. Implementation of the SCATE Technology Gateway curriculum has produced a dramatic impact; e.g., data from implementation in two-year colleges across South Carolina show that graduation rates increased more than tenfold; students from underrepresented populations succeed at the same rate as traditional students in engineering technology; minority enrollment increased; and employer satisfaction reached a new high. The SCATE Engineering Technology Core Curriculum has been rated, in an independent study conducted by Western Michigan University, as one of the four best curriculum products created by NSF/ATE?funded projects.&nbsp; The SCATE Engineering Technology Core Curriculum received a rating of 4.0 on a 0-4.0 scale for "its effectiveness in helping students learn the knowledge and skills and/or practices needed to be successful in the technical workplace." In diffusing innovation, SCATE National Resource Center has also developed mentoring strategies and systemic approaches to addressing challenges in technician education.
