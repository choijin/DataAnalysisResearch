<AbstractNarration>This award is to support the 2011 Atmospheric Chemistry Gordon Research Conference.  The conference will be held in Mt. Snow, VT on July 24-29, 2011, and will be convened under the auspices of the Gordon Research Conferences.  The conference will bring together a large and diverse group of scientists from the atmospheric chemistry community and related fields to discuss new developments in chemical observations, mechanisms and models; the formation, composition and impacts of aerosols; biomass burning; and the role of atmospheric chemistry in climate change.  Researchers at the frontiers of atmospheric chemistry will meet in an informal setting and exchange ideas and new information at the forefront of this field.  Broader impacts stem from the societal importance of atmospheric chemistry to air quality, public health, and climate change, and also from the participation of at least 25 early-career scientists whose attendance costs will be partially offset with funds from this award.</AbstractNarration>

In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field. Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
