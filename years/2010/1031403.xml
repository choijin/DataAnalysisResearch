<AbstractNarration>Fe powders show tremendous potential for improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of electric motors.  However, the lack of a coating material, which is mechanically durable, electrically insulating, and magnetic, is a fundamental obstacle to the implementation of Fe powders in electromagnetic cores.  In this project, candidate oxide coatings, prepared by molecular beam epitaxy, will be identified by investigating the magnetic and structural properties of oxide-Fe interfaces in the form of thin film heterostructures.  The combination of atomic scale microscopy and neutron scattering techniques will reveal how the atomic structure and magnetic behavior of the interfaces are correlated, providing unprecedented insight into how defects, strain, and local stoichiometry alter interfacial magnetism.  Based on these results, optimal coatings and processing conditions will be identified for use in Fe-powder-based electromagnetic devices.  The work addresses known hurdles within existing industrial production environments and is strategically targeted towards the next generation materials and processing necessary for the future direction of electromagnetic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have both educational and economic impacts.  Outreach programs will be developed to expose students to job opportunities in our growing energy efficient industry and economy.  These will bring together groups of students from West Philadelphia (predominantly minority) schools for workshops and career fairs associated with electric motors, hybrid vehicles, and alternative energy.  Development and understanding of these new materials will provide a tangible benefit to society.  Electric motors have over a 50% increase in energy conversion over internal combustion engines, and thus, the development of these materials for automotive applications steer the automotive industry away from the dependence on fossil fuels and drives down consumer costs.  This will translate into the development of the skills and knowledge for upcoming engineers and technical professionals that will become involved in the automotive, aerospace and industrial sectors.</AbstractNarration>
