<AbstractNarration>College of Menominee Nation (CMN), together with the University of Wisconsin Madison and the &lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin Platteville, is applying to the National Science Foundations Science, Tribal &lt;br/&gt;Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) Pre-engineering Education Collaborative grant to strengthen &lt;br/&gt;CMN?s capacity to establish CMN as an Associate Degree granting engineering program of distinction.   . &lt;br/&gt;The CMN PEEC: Providing for the Education of American Indian Engineers collaborative project &lt;br/&gt;proposes the following objectives: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#61607; To build CMN?s capacity and infrastructure to sustain a Pre-engineering Associate Degree Program. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#61607; To implement a Pre-engineering program of distinction. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#61607; By September 2015, to graduate at least twenty students from CMN?s pre-engineering program and &lt;br/&gt;   transition into U.W. Madison?s and U.W. Platteville?s engineering programs. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Project Intellectual Merit:  This project recognizes and embraces diversity and the role Tribal Colleges &lt;br/&gt;play in coordinating demonstrative research on increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities &lt;br/&gt;in STEM fields. Tribal Colleges are key contributors to the body of knowledge on American Indians. &lt;br/&gt;Project research, data, and outcomes focused in the ultimate outcomes of increasing the number of and &lt;br/&gt;performance of American Indian students in engineering, leading to increased numbers of American &lt;br/&gt;Indians in engineering careers, will provide key nationally recognized research. This collaboration will &lt;br/&gt;develop, apply and assess evidence-based practices shown to increase the participation of &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority students in science and engineering. Furthermore, the partnership between &lt;br/&gt;CMN and its UW partners is tailored to establish robust connections between institutions that will serve as &lt;br/&gt;a model for the engineering community in general and other minority-serving institutions as we assess, &lt;br/&gt;document and disseminate the success of this process. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Project Broader Impact: This project will build upon the research of previous STEM activities, continuing &lt;br/&gt;the investigation of essential research in discovering and understanding how Tribal Colleges and the &lt;br/&gt;unique strategies they implement promote education in minority students. The project further advances &lt;br/&gt;the research of American Indian undergraduate education in engineering and contributes to the global &lt;br/&gt;body of knowledge in underrepresented minority engineering education. The short term outcome of this &lt;br/&gt;effort will be to increase the knowledge, understanding and interest in engineering among students in &lt;br/&gt;rural populations, with emphasis on the American Indian population of Northern Wisconsin.  The long &lt;br/&gt;term outcome will be an increase in the participation of American Indian students graduating with degrees &lt;br/&gt;in engineering.  This will ensure that the voices, perspectives and talents of a population that is so &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in engineering have an opportunity to contribute to the development of the engineering &lt;br/&gt;profession.</AbstractNarration>

Faculty at CMN provided the UW-Platteville team with information about courses at CMN that could fulfill the general education requirements at UW-Platteville. As a result, a transfer agreement between the two institutions was established. The agreement states sensitivity to historical trauma and recognizes the infusion of culture and language in the CMN curriculum. UW-Platteville accepts the study of Menominee and Oneida languages for students from the pre-engineering program at CMN and this also signifies that CMN transfer students have met foreign language requirements. Including a statement regarding historical trauma and the acceptance of culture and language as part of CMN&rsquo;s curriculum was historically significant in that no other known articulation or transfer agreements includes this type of wording.&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout the project UW-Platteville faculty and staff developed recruitment materials and aided CMN staff in recruitment efforts. Support was provided for 3 Native American students that each earned 1 college credit for GE 1030 Introduction to Engineering projects, a required course through the Explore Engineering Summer Program. The first EESP at CMN was in summer 2013. Both UW-Platteville and CMN faculty were instructors, providing opportunities for UW-Platteville faculty to develop cultural awareness. A second EESP at CMN was planned for Summer 2014 but was cancelled due to flooding on the Wolf River. A third EESP was planned for summer 2015, but was cancelled due to some unfortunate events in the community. That year, focus shifted to establish and strengthen relationships between the community and faculty who were attending as instructors. Environmental Engineering faculty toured the three water treatment facilities on the Menominee Reservation and discussed ways to involve CMN and UW-Platteville students in ways to address infrastructure redevelopment and design in the Menominee community.</p> <p>The UW-Platteville CMN Special Programs Manager attended many recruitment events including CMN&rsquo;s career days, attended by more than 300 high school juniors and seniors, numerous meetings with the STEM faculty and staff at CMN, participated in Menominee Indian School District events, and established relationships with the Pulaski and Seymour school districts which both have significant native student populations. The program manager developed and modified an Academic Action Plan specifically for the needs of CMN Pre-engineering students. This two-part document was used as a guide for CMN students to establish academic and person goals, identify academic and personal champions, and to assist students as they prepare to matriculate to a four year mainstream partner. The goal of the Academic Action Plan is to bring balance to a student&rsquo;s academic career as it fits with community, faculty, and school.</p> <p>UW-Platteville delivered STEM course content and supplemental instruction to CMN. Several UW-Platteville faculty and staff developed online course material in Calculus I and II, Chemistry, Physics, and Statics. CMN students who have matriculated to the engineering programs at UW-Platteville are also using the materials directly to aid in current courses and as a review of previous courses. The students who are currently in the program have travel restrictions and are very open to online courses. These materials are used by current students at UW-Platteville, emphasizing that when programs like PEEC develop support mechanisms directed at underrepresented students, all students benefit.</p> <p>Faculty at UW-Platteville have a significant amount of expertise delivering online engineering courses due to the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering programs in the Collaborative Engineering Program (CEP). The CEP delivers BSEE and BSME degrees to students throughout the state of Wisconsin with the help of the UW System&rsquo;s two-year colleges. An ongoing goal for the college is to include CMN in the CEP. &nbsp;Two CMN graduates have opted to use the CEP at UW-Fox Valley to get their UW-P BSME degrees. Both are in contact with UW-Platteville faculty or staff on a regular basis and have used the on line materials described above. Their experiences and feedback have prompted the CEP to develop an orientation program for students new to the program.</p> <p>In the last year of the grant, Co-PI Sealy and his family members created an endowment to support scholarships for CMN students who transfer to UW-Platteville in either engineering or visual arts. The establishment of this endowment helps to institutionalize the realtionship between the campuses. Additionally, and most importantly, this scholarship provides much needed resources to support CMN graduates pursing their degress at UW-Platteville.</p> <p>Finally, over the course of the PEEC grant, approximately 30 UW-Platteville faculty and staff in the College engaged in extensive cultural competency.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Tammy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Salmon-Stephens</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1037626/1037626_10020870_1511969030064_CMNPEEC6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1037626/1037626_10020870_1511969030064_CMNPEEC6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Female UW-Platteville college student explains electrical engineering laboratory to American Indian students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1037626/1037626_10020870_1511969030064_CMNPEEC6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Female UW-Platteville college student explains electrical engineering laboratory to American Indian students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">UW-Platteville college student, Ashley Smith explains electrical engineering concepts to participants of the Explore Engineering Summer Program at the College of Menominee Nation.</div> <div class="imageCredit">UW-Platteville</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Tammy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Salmon-Stephens</div> <div class="imageTitle">Female UW-Platteville college student explains electrical engineering laboratory to American Indian students</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1037626/1037626_10020870_1511968829509_CMNPEEC2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1037626/1037626_10020870_1511968829509_CMNPEEC2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="High school and college students participate in hands-on activity related to Industrial Engineering"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1037626/1037626_10020870_1511968829509_CMNPEEC2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="High school and college students participate in hands-on activity related to Industrial Engineering"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">College of Menominee Nation students and local American Indian students participate in Explore Engineering Summer Program</div> <div class="imageCredit">UW-Platteville</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Tammy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Salmon-Stephens</div> <div class="imageTitle">High school and college students participate in hands-on activity related to Industrial Engineering</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1037626/1037626_10020870_1511968689456_CMNPEEC1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1037626/1037626_10020870_1511968689456_CMNPEEC1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CMN students looking at a physics laboratory project"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1037626/1037626_10020870_1511968689456_CMNPEEC1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CMN students looking at a physics laboratory project"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">College of Menominee Nation Students and local high school students participate in Explore Engineering Summer Program</div> <div class="imageCredit">UW-Platteville</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Tammy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Salmon-Stephens</div> <div class="imageTitle">CMN students looking at a physics laboratory project</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
