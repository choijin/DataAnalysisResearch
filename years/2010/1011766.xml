<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a proprietary product intended to be added to commercially available semen extenders to help improve fertility and embryo viability in cattle.  Handling, freezing and thawing of bull sperm generates oxidative free radicals leading to irreversible damage to DNA and membranes causing lower pregnancy rates.  The proposed project will test antioxidants derived from plant extracts.   Phase I will determine if varied doses of these plant derived antioxidants added to semen extenders will improve post-thaw sperm quality, fertility and embryo development as assessed by DNA degradation, mitochondrial assays, and in vitro fertilization.   The goal is to determine if there is a reduction in oxidative stress and an improvement in post-thaw sperm quality, fertilization rates and embryonic development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, is an improvement in pregnancy rates in cattle, which directly impacts the profitability of dairy and beef farmers.    Dairy and beef farms generally are low-margin operations and increased fertility will provide profit protection during fluctuating milk and beef price cycles.  A 2-3% increase in pregnancy rate may improve profit by as much as $40,000 per 1000 head of cattle.  Therefore, family and commercial farmers stand an increased chance of remaining in business.   In addition, these plant extracts may be applied to human and other animal fertility problems.</AbstractNarration>
