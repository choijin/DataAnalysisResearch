<AbstractNarration>While the Internet has far exceeded expectations, it has also stretched initial assumptions, often creating tussles that challenge its underlying communication model. Users and applications operate in terms of content, making it increasingly limiting and difficult to conform to IP's requirement to communicate by discovering and specifying location. To carry the Internet into the future, a conceptually simple yet transformational architectural shift is required, from today's focus on where ? addresses and hosts ? to what ? the content that users and applications care about.&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates a potential new Internet architecture called Named Data Networking (NDN). NDN capitalizes on strengths ? and addresses weaknesses ? of the Internet's current host-based, point-to-point communication architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of communication. By naming data instead of their location, NDN transforms data into a first-class entity. The current Internet secures the data container. NDN secures the contents, a design choice that decouples trust in data from trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to optimize bandwidth.  The project studies the technical challenges that must be addressed to validate NDN as a future Internet architecture:  routing scalability, fast forwarding, trust models, network security, content protection and privacy, and fundamental communication theory. The project uses end-to-end testbed deployments, simulation, and theoretical analysis to evaluate the proposed architecture, and is developing specifications and prototype implementations of NDN protocols and applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on security and privacy in a candidate next-generation  Internet architecture: Named-Data Networking (NDN). It was conducted as part of a larger NDN FIA project spanning multiple organizations and involved  collaborations with PARC, UCLA, Northeastern, CISCO, Colorado State, and University of Padova (UPD).     Research conducted in the course of the project proceeded along two directions: investigative and constructive. The former concentrated on identifying and assessing security and privacy issues in NDN and its industrial "twin" CCN (Content-Centric Networking). The latter focused on constructing methods and techniques for mitigating such issues.    Investigative research highlights include:   DoS and DDoS in NDN/CCN: assessment of interest flooding and content poisoning attacks (ICCCN'13).  Cache privacy: exploration of side-effects and impact of router content caching on privacy (ICDCS'13).  Consumer privacy: exploitation of router PITs and caches for consumer geo-location and covert channels in NDN/CCN (AsiaCCS'14 and ACNS'15).  Pitfalls of negative acknowledgments: an assessment of the value and trade-offs in using NACKs in CCN/NDN (ICCCN'15).   Constructive research highlights include:   Anonymous communication:  ANDANA tool that provides Tor-like service over NDN/CCN (NDSS'12, CCNC'16).  Securing specialized communication settings, e.g., audio conferencing, sensing and actuation (AWFIT'11, NOMEN'13 and NCA'14).  Accounting for content usage/popularity: an architecture for secure accounting in NDN/CCN (NOMS'16).  Content flushing: a light-weight technique for best-effort deletion of stale or unwanted content by producers (NETWORKING'16).  Content fragmentation: an efficient scheme for secure cut-through in-network fragmentation of large content (CCNxCon'13 and NCS'15).    Trust management at the network layer and mitigation of content poisoning: a method for secure minimal-effort processing of content in routers that relies on interest-key binding rule (SENT'14 and CCR'14).   Access Control: a interest-based access control scheme for restricted content (ICN'15).  Bi-directional communication: a technique for bundling interest and content messages to provide an efficient means for supporting synchronous bi-directional communication in NDN/CCN.   A total of 24 articles/papers appeared in refereed conferences, workshops and journals. Other notable accomplishments:   Best Paper Award, IEEE Network Computing and Applications (NCA) Conference, 2015. Best Student Paper Award, Applied Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS) Conference, 2015.   On the training and education side, four MS degrees were earned based on work related to this project. Furthermore, three students (two at UCI and one at UPD) have conducted (and are continuing to do so) their PhD dissertation research on various aspects of the project. Seven keynote talks were given by the PI at various international meeting venues. Also, eight invited seminars were presented by the PI at research labs and universities.
