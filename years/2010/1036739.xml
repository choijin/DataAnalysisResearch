<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC) proposes to conduct a three-year research project that seeks to understand opportunities for STEM advancement for women through community college education. The goal is to identify the individual and institutional factors that contribute to women's successful recruitment, progress, and completion of community college STEM degrees and certificates. The researchers will examine data from the Beginning Post-Secondary Surveys (BPS) from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and will conduct case studies of four STEM community college programs (two terminal associate degree programs and two transfer degree programs) at two STEM-rich and supported community colleges. While women?s experiences in four-year and graduate STEM programs have been extensively analyzed, the experiences of women in STEM community college programs remains under-examined. Theories such as student engagement, life course, and gender schema, which have been developed to understand women's underrepresentation in four-year STEM programs, may apply differently in the community college STEM context where students are older, non-residential, from lower income families, and more likely to work compared with students who begin college in a four-year institution.  Further, institutional systems of support for STEM community college education have not been adequately studied. Quantitative research proposed in this project will provide a comprehensive look at women's and men's experiences in STEM community college education while testing hypotheses concerning student engagement, life course, and gender schema theories of gender differences in STEM education. The case study research will additionally provide analysis of the policies, programs, and practices that support STEM community college education and the extent to which these institutional supports meet women's needs. While the quantitative research will identify the factors that contribute to progress through community college STEM and differences for men and women, the qualitative analysis will explore why these gender differences persist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Community colleges often lack the resources and staffing to conduct the institutional and program effectiveness research required to understand, evaluate, and strengthen systems of support for women's and men's STEM education.  By delineating what is working and what is lacking in community college systems of support for women in STEM as well as the factors that predict STEM community college progress, this research will identify areas for educators and administrators to best allocate scarce resources for program, practice, and policy development. Furthermore, the student survey and focus group protocol developed through the research to gauge student engagement in STEM community college programs and how assessments vary by gender may be used as a piloted tool to measure the effectiveness of STEM support on community college campuses. The interview protocols may also serve as a piloted tool to measure the effectiveness of systems of support for women?s STEM education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Little is known about the factors that contribute to women's under representation in community college (CC) science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields especially engineering and computer science technologies where women's participation has been stagnant or falling over the last ten years.  Our project documents for the first time the individual and institutional factors that are correlated with women's lack of representation in STEM fields (both nationally and at two case study schools) with the goal of identifying policies, practices, programs, and organizational structures that facilitate women's engagement and persistence in community college STEM.      What applies to the 4-year and higher context in regards to gender differences in STEM is not necessarily applicable to the community college setting where students tend to be older, poorer, single parents, English language learners, the first in their family to go to college, and academically challenged.  Research from our project, thus fills an important gap at a time when federal and state governments are turning policy and financial attention to community colleges for workforce and economic development and alleviating poverty.   Key findings from our research show that women remain highly under represented in community college STEM programs due to gender gaps in both entrance and attrition which are attributed to four main barriers that women face including; a male-dominated culture that is marginalizing and hostile to women; lack of information about what engineers, technologists, and scientists do; and lack of curriculum, academic, and counseling bridges between female or neutral programs of study and male-dominated STEM fields at the CC; lack of interest from administrators and faculty in recruiting into and promoting women in male-dominated CC STEM fields.  Unlike 4-year and higher institutions, math or science aptitude is not barrier to entering STEM fields; CC STEM students can move from remedial math, science, and English courses to engineering and computer technology majors. The barriers facing women in CC STEM, therefore have more to do with gender stereotypes, biases, and marginalization than academics.  Additional findings show that;  (1) In our case study schools, women were as likely as men to be satisfied with their community college (CC) STEM education and confident they could reach their educational and career goals even though very few women had entered these programs.  Women in community college STEM were as likely as their male counterparts to be committed to transferring to a 4-year post-secondary program.  Compared with male community college STEM students, women were more likely to engage in the kinds of activities which are known to support student retention including meeting with faculty members after class, joining clubs, meeting with an adviser, and spending time with other students.  Even so, according to the national data, three years after entering a community college STEM program, women were more likely than men to leave the STEM major and less likely to have entered a STEM major from a non-STEM major (48% of women versus 58% of men remained in STEM). After six years of entering CC STEM, 43% of the women had left STEM versus 28% of the men.     (2) Interestingly, no matter the highest level of math taken in high school, women entering community college STEM programs were more likely than men to be placed into remedial math. For example, 2% of the men but 4% of the women who completed high school calculus were placed into remedial math. Similarly, 3% of the men but 11% of the women whose highest math class in high school was pre-calculus were placed into remedial math.  Since taking remedial math classes can slow progress to completion, this gender differential in placement maybe contributing to womenÆs under representation in CC STEM programs.  Our research suggests that increasing womenÆs participation in community col...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
