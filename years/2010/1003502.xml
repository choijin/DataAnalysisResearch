<AbstractNarration>The research team, in this collaborative proposal, aims to compare speleothem records, instrumental observations of the last ~100 years, and climate models to study Caribbean climate spanning the last millennium.  The research team will address two foundational questions with their project, as follows: (1) What do the high-resolution Caribbean speleothem delta oxygen-18 isotope records, together with Cariaco Basin sediments, indicate about the low-frequency, Caribbean-wide hydroclimate variations during the Late Holocene? and (2) What can be learned about the large scale Atlantic-Pacific climate interactions during the late Holocene by comparing the detailed regional Caribbean hydroclimate history with other proxy records outside the region?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students, most notable at the University of Puerto Rico.  The research results on tropical hydrology could have widespread utility in the study of climate and water resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF ATM 1003219 Amos Winter (P.I.) David Black, Yochanan Kushnir, Thomas Miller: Collaborative research: Hydrological variability during the last millennium from high-resolution proxies.    Intellectual Merit:  Speleothems (or stalagmites) are carbonate deposits that form usually in caves.  Speleothems are increasingly used as archives of the past climate and often provide long (order of 100,000 years) environmental records that can be sampled at very high-resolution. Reliable growth-ages provide accurate and precise absolute dating. Speleothems are gaining importance in deducing past climate variations mostly in tropical and subtropical regions and thus they complement accurately dated information gathered from high latitude ice cores. Tropical speleothems are used primarily and routinely to reconstruct rainfall variability from changes in stable oxygen isotope ratios (&delta;18O).  Cave monitoring studies are essential to interpret speleothem climate records correctly and to identify site-specific cave processes.  We obtained 22 speleothems chosen from different parts of Mesoamerica some of which contain records of annual or near-annual fidelity through part of the last 1,000-10,000 years.  Results of our analyses of geochemical proxies show multi-decadal changes in hydrology forced by ocean modes of variability (Winter et al., 2011) as well as persistent drying events of Mesoamerica driven by volcanic and solar forcing (Winter et al., 2015). Furthermore a speleothem from Puerto Rico recorded strong hydrological changes ca. 3.7 thousand years ago that forced humans to develop adaptation strategies (Rivera-Collazo et al., 2015).  We found evidence in speleothems from Puerto Rico and Venezuela for a Caribbean wide rainfall decrease 8.2 thousand years ago, corresponding to a well-documented, northern hemisphere abrupt cooling event recorded in Greenland ice cores (Rolf Vieten, Ph.D. thesis).  A surprising growth pattern emerged from the stalagmites that we studied: Stalagmites in the Caribbean grew in spurts that occurred primarily during distinct well-known cold climatic episodes of the northern Atlantic.  This not only shows an interesting climate tele-connection between the northern Atlantic and the Caribbean region but also something about the local environment needed for stalagmite growth.   We conducted a two-year cave-monitoring study in Cueva Larga, Puerto Rico that give us an important clue: carbonate precipitation in this tropical cave takes place primarily during the winter months where increased cave ventilation boosts carbonate oversaturation of the drip water (Rolf Vieten, Ph.D. thesis)     Broader Impacts:  The work was done at one of the largest Hispanic Serving institutions (HIS) in the U.S.  Our work established a regional background for pre-anthropogenic climate variability.  Our observations on growth patterns of stalagmites and our cave observations may be a paradigm shift in the interpretation of speleothems as climate archives. The paleoclimate data is one of the motivations for a large Model Intercomparison Project on the climatic response to Volcanic forcing (VolMIP).
