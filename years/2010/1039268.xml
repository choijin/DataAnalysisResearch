<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests support for the University of Hawaii at Manoa to host the 2010 NSF-ECCS Grantees Conference.  The conference will be held at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, a conference facility in Honolulu, Hawaii, during the period of November 17-19, 2010.  During this 2 and 1/2 days conference, 145 presentations by "Third Year" ECCS PIs will be scheduled in two parallel sessions with each presentation of 15 minutes including Q&amp;A period.  Fifteen papers will be scheduled in each of the morning and afternoon sessions and with two parallel sessions during the two and half days conference &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special effort will be made to invite representatives from 2- and 4-year colleges and universities in the State of Hawaii. In addition, a special session that highlights NSF/ENG research and educational opportunities will be organized, and special invitations to attend this session will be sent to EPSCoR funded colleagues and organizations in the State of Hawaii  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conference will be responsible for arranging attendees local expenses at the government approved rates for hotel rooms and per diem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A conference website will be established, and all third year NSF-ECCS grantees will be invited to submit a one page summary highlighting their research methodology and both research and educational achievements of their NSF funded work.  These one-page summaries will be published in pre-conference proceedings to be distributed to all conference attendees.  Furthermore, all conference presentations will be compiled in a post-conference proceeding and published in a CD ROM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The conference will provide invaluable opportunities for the NSF-ECCS PIs to listen and learn of accomplishments by their NSF funded peers, and possibly discuss opportunities for establishing collaborations between their groups. The 2 and 1/2 day conference will also provide opportunities for stimulating discussions with NSF Program Directors. The special NSF/ENG Opportunities session will be invaluable in highlighting research and educational opportunities at NSF for faculty in 2- and 4-year colleges from across the State of Hawaii.   The pre- and post-conference publications will provide significant record of accomplishments from NSF-ECCS Division funded programs.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The pre- and post-conference publications will provide an up-to-date record of research accomplishments within the NSF-ECCS Division which could be disseminated to interested researchers across the US and also shared with other government agencies.  Highlighting EPSCoR activities and available opportunities will be most valuable to academic and research colleagues from across the State of Hawaii.</AbstractNarration>
