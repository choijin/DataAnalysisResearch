<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to advance the state-of-the art with respect to our understanding of the mechanisms and significance of consolidation-induced contaminant transport for high water content geo-materials. The phenomenon of coupled consolidation and contaminant transport occurs for a variety of practical applications in geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering. Such applications include confined disposal of contaminated high water content geo-materials (e.g., tailings, dredgings, sludges, and slurries) in ex situ engineered impoundments, mechanical dewatering of contaminated high water content geo-materials, in situ remediation of source zones contaminated with chlorinated solvents via injection of granular zero valent iron (ZVI) slurry and soil mixing, and in situ capping of subaqueous contaminated sediments. Research has demonstrated only very recently that consolidation-induced transport of contaminants is a valid transport mechanism that may have lasting effects on the contaminant migration behavior for a given system. However, little is known about the general significance of this mechanism for practical applications. Current understanding of consolidation-induced contaminant transport is limited with respect to: (1) the effects of higher chemical concentrations and multispecies contaminants, such that typically occur in field sites; (2) the importance of facilitated transport via colloidal particles, which is likely to be an important mechanism for natural fine-grained materials with highly sorbed contaminants; (3) testing of realistic geo-materials, such as mine tailings or dredged sediments; and (4) absence of work conducted for constant rate-of-strain or centrifuge loading conditions.  &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will consist of a fundamental experimental and computational investigation of the mechanism of consolidation-induced contaminant transport for several materials and conditions, and then assess the significance of these findings for relevant geotechnical and geoenvironmental applications. The research plan has six tasks: (1) material procurement and characterization; (2) material property testing; (3) consolidation-induced transport testing; (4) development and validation of computational models; (5) computational simulations; and (6) project collaboration and dissemination of results. The proposed research has both intrinsic scientific merit in terms of a fundamental assessment of this transport mechanism and associated parameters as well as practical implications in terms of improving our ability to predict contaminant outflows from high water content geo-materials during consolidation. As a result, a better understanding of the mechanism and significance of consolidation-induced contaminant transport will be achieved, thereby enhancing the ability of designers and regulators to protect the public health and the environment from the effects of contaminants. Results from this research have the potential to transform the way contaminated high water content geo-materials are currently characterized, handled, dewatered and/or disposed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a collaborative research effort between the University of California-San Diego and Colorado State University.  The primary goal was to advance the state-of-the-art with respect to understanding the mechanisms and significance of consolidation-induced contaminant transport for soil materials and geoenvironmental systems.  Consolidation-induced transport and outflow of contaminants occurs when contaminated soil undergoes volume reduction due to material self-weight or external loading.  The transport processes are similar to those for rigid soil and include advection, dispersion and sorption.  The difference is that, in this case, transport is driven by transient fluid flows within the material.  Thus, as this is essentially a transient transport process superimposed on a transient fluid flow process, the outcomes can be interesting and sometimes unexpected.  The research has both intrinsic scientific merit in terms of fundamental assessment of a new transport mechanism and associated parameters as well as practical assessemnt of the implications for engineering design.  The work has produced better understanding of contaminant transport for geoenvironmental applications, such as landfill liner systems, confined disposal facilities, mechanical dewatering of soils, and subaqueous capping of contaminated sediments.  This knowledge is expected to enhance the ability of designers and regulators to protect public health and the environment.  Major activities for the project centered on the development of five new computational models for consolidation and consolidation-induced transport of contaminants.  Validation exercises were conducted to the maximum possible extent for each model using available analytical, numerical, and experimental data.  The models were then used to simulate conditions for several types of engineering systems.  The results demonstrate that consolidation-induced transport often leads to significantly higher contaminant outflow than transport due to diffusion alone.  The effects of consolidation can be important not only during the consolidation stage but also long after.  Consolidation has a lasting effect on contaminant migration because transient fluid flows change the distribution of contaminant mass in a given system, which then becomes the initial condition for subsequent transport processes.  Broader impacts of this work included the training of one Ph.D. student, who is now an assistant professor of civil engineering in the U.S., and ongoing collaboration with our partner organization, Colorado State University.  In addition, the project investigators collaborated with several other researchers, including persons active in universities, community college, consulting, and government, and with representation both nationally and internationally.  Technical results of the research have been disseminated to the scientific and professional engineering communities through refereed articles and conference presentations.  A total of 15 journal papers and 9 conference papers are in various stages of publication for the project.                Last Modified: 11/24/2015       Submitted by: Patrick J Fox]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
