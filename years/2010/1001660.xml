<AbstractNarration>The principal investigators continue their research in geometric character theory and geometric representation theory of unipotent groups over a field of positive characteristic. They define the "dual space" of such a group as an algebro-geometric object parameterizing L-packets of character sheaves on the group. The principal investigators then develop a conjectural geometric theory of the spectral decomposition of the equivariant derived category with respect to the dual space, which is similar to the classical decomposition of representations as direct integrals of irreducible ones. They also formulate several conjectures on this spectral decomposition in the setting where the orbit method is applicable and discuss certain related quantization problems in the theory of tensor categories. The difference between these quantization problems and the standard ones is that the role of the universal enveloping&lt;br/&gt;algebras is played by group algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project combines several active directions of current research in mathematics and mathematical physics -- geometric representation theory, algebraic geometry, the theory of tensor categories,  quantum groups, and conformal field theory. The notion of geometric spectral decomposition will deepen our understanding of the general patterns of geometric representation theory. The research will also lead to new applications of the quantization philosophy in the theory of tensor categories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have proved that the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible l-adic local systems on a smooth variety over a finite field does not depend on the prime l (assuming that l is different from the characteristic of the field). This was conjectured by Pierre Deligne in 1980.  We have developed the theory of character sheaves on unipotent groups over fields of positive characteristic. The problem of constructing such a theory had been formulated by George Lusztig.  We have developed the theory of D-modules on quasicompact algebraic stacks in characteristic 0 with affine automorphism groups of points. In particular, we showed that the direct image functor is continuous if and only if the automorphism groups of each point of each fiber is an extension of a finite group by a unipotent one.  We have constructed a version of the exponential map that identifies locally the continuous K-theory and cyclic homology of p-adic algebras. We have found a p-adic version of the Poincar'e lemma and developed a new derived algebraic geometry approach to the p-adic Hodge theory and integration theory of p-adic differential forms based on it.   We have shown that Grothendieck's standard conjectures follow from existence of a canonical t-structure on the category of mixed motives as well as from a weak version of Suslin's conjecture.  We gave a simple proof of Kisin's theorem about crystalline Galois representations.          Last Modified: 07/11/2015       Submitted by: Vladimir Drinfeld]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
