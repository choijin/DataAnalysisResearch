<AbstractNarration>The shortage of women in computer science related education is a significant and continuing problem. This effort is engaging high school, college freshman, and college sophomore women in information assurance (IA) activities. The project is increasing the participation of women in SFS-related areas and attracting women to specifically explore and work on IA efforts. A three-phase plan is being utilized to increase IA visibility and hands-on experiences to acquaint female students with IA. Phase I provides rising 11th and 12th grade high school girls a summer-camp experience, exposing them to the careers and opportunities in IA. Phase II exposes freshman women to long-term research experiences where they work collaboratively to solve real problems; increasing their motivation to work in the information assurance field. Phase III engages sophomores in summer internships with federal agencies, where they explore opportunities that will enable them to contribute to the national good. A mentoring program has been established for the women participating in all phases of the project and an advisory board of female faculty from CAE/IAE or CAE-R institutions is helping guide the efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to determine how to increase the number of women interested in cyber security, and to get them to join the SFS program and enter federal service.  During this project, a plan was developed to get young women interested in computing and cyber security through same-sex summer camps, where they could be introduced to computing and cyber security in an environment where they were not challenged by the presence of members of the opposite sex and the stress that this brings.  The second part of the plan was to involve young college-aged women in research experiences in the summer in cyber security to help them understand the value of the field, and gain some confidence in their ability to contribute to it.  The third part of the plan was to get the young women internships in cyber security to further increase their confidence in the value of the field as well as their ability to contribute.  The results of this project were that evidence showed that summer camps were definitely useful in recruiting young women to the field and increasing their interest.  Research experiences were also supportive of the goals of the project, but are very expensive to run.  With enough funding, they can support the retention of women in the field.  Internships were not useful in general, or at least did not prove to be as the government was in a hiring freeze during that part of the project.  Overall, the project was  very successful in increasing the participation of women in cyber security at Mississippi State University.  Female participation in the SFS program at MSU went from 8% in the first year of the project to nearly 50% by the end of the third year of the project.  Participation has stayed at over 40% consistently since.       Last Modified: 12/17/2015       Submitted by: David A Dampier]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
