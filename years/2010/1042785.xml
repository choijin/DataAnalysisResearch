<AbstractNarration>The investigators propose is to establish a general statistical methodology to&lt;br/&gt;estimate error rates for any of the existing second-generation&lt;br/&gt;sequencing technologies. They have identified an approach that is broadly&lt;br/&gt;applicable, fast, and easy to implement. Important strengths are that it&lt;br/&gt;only requires intensity data; it is applicable to the data types that&lt;br/&gt;are typically shared publicly; and it does not require the availability&lt;br/&gt;of a reference genome or genomes ---a key condition in threat detection&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequencing is a technology to read small words made out of DNA or RNA.&lt;br/&gt;In may applications across biology we need to identify words that occur&lt;br/&gt;in a book where they are not supposed to be (for example mutations in&lt;br/&gt;cancer or pathogens in the intestinal flora). Often these 'bad' words&lt;br/&gt;are similar to other words which occur elsewhere in the book, differing&lt;br/&gt;only by a letter or two. As seqeuncing is not free of errors, to know&lt;br/&gt;whether we are seeing a bad word or a poorly read good word we need to&lt;br/&gt;know how easy it is to misread a letter. This proposal is to assess&lt;br/&gt;exactly this, with the goal of providing better foundations to all&lt;br/&gt;scientific research that uses sequencing.</AbstractNarration>

In each of these activities the project's faculty trained and mentored postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.   The remainder of this document provides additional details on the three component of the project's outcome.   1) the program solicitation called for research to address challenges in genome sequencing research, and specifically "development of quantitative methods and models to estimate errors for the various sequencing platforms". Our work established a general, flexible and robust statistical methodology to estimate error rates for second-generation sequencing technologies. The fundamental advance behind the proposed methodology is our observation that there is a linear relationship between the frequency of short reads (tags) and the frequencies of their ?neighboring? tags, where neighbors are defined by sequence similarity. This linear increase reflects sequencing errors, as frequently occurring tags cast larger ?shadows? of errors on neighboring tags. Thus, regression of shadow counts on tag counts can provide a solution to the challenge posed by the program solicitation. We investigated statistical and mathematical properties of the shadow regression method. We implemented the methodologies in a Bioconductor package and a parallel R implementation.  All tools are open source. Research results were published in the journal "BMC Bioinformatics".   2) following participation in an ADT workshop, we identified an additional opportunity to leverage our experience with alignment-free methods in pathogen detection for DNA sequencing data. This is motivated by field-work in threat detection, where computing resources are limited and/or sequencing data cannot be uploaded in full to cloud-based computing resources. We developed statistical theory extending standard alignment-free methods to Markov structures, which significantly increases detection ability. We derived general requirements on the detection of rare contaminations in terms of the DNA read-size, the size of the DNA read-throughput and thedissimilarity of the contamination compared to host DNA. We were also able to characterize the proportions of foreign DNA needed for alignment-free and genome-map-free detection to work. The resulting manuscript is being revised for submission.   3) we branched out the the related field of microbiome studies. Human microbiome studies use sequencing technologies to measure the abundance of bacterial species or Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in samples of biological material. Typically the data are organized in contingency tables with OTU counts across heterogeneous biological samples. In the microbial ecology community, ordination methods are frequently used to investigate latent factors or clusters that capture and describe variations of OTU counts across biological samples. It remains important to evaluate how uncertainty in estimates of each biological sample?s microbial distribution propagates to ordination analyses, including visualization of clusters and projections of biological samples on low dimensional spaces. We propose a Bayesian analysis where similarity between microbial distributions is represented by latent factors that concentrate in a low dimensional space. We use a shrinkage prior to tune the dimensionality of the latent factors. The resulting posterior samples of model parameters can be used to evaluate uncertainty in analyses routinely applied in microbiome studies. Specifically, by combining them with multivariate data analysis techniques we can visualize credible regions in ecological ordination plots. The resulting publication is posted in arxiv and is under review.       Last Modified: 08/17/2016       Submitted by: Giovanni Parmigiani]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
