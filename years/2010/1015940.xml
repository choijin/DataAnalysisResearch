<AbstractNarration>Developmental biology has a central place in the life sciences.  By focusing on the study of whole organisms using a wide variety of approaches and technologies, the field has contributed significantly to our understanding of the common processes that regulate the development of life on our planet.  Over the last decade, developmental biologists have made significant, Nobel-prize winning, discoveries in aging and in the control of cell death (Nobel 2002). They have worked out the mechanisms by which small RNAs turn genes on or off (Nobel 2006 and Lasker award in 2008) and have driven the development of new techniques; for example gene replacement in mammals (Nobel 2007) and the ability to see proteins in living cells (Nobel 2008). The 2010 Santa Cruz Developmental Biology (SCDB) meeting provides a forum for developmental biologists working at a variety of levels and using a wide range of experimental subjects to come together under the theme of 'Diverse strategies in Development'. Here, researchers can learn about the newest major breakthroughs and how these can further accelerate their progress in fields under the umbrella of developmental biology. Over 150 developmental biologists are expected to attend the SCDB meeting at University of California, Santa Cruz from June 30th--July 3rd, 2010 to discuss recent progress, to exchange ideas and to educate both the current leaders in the field and upcoming researchers and students.  Due to the high visibility and quality of the invited speakers participating in this endeavor and the small size of the meeting, the SCDB provides unprecedented opportunities for interactions between established and young scientists. The conference program is well balanced to promote participation of women and members of groups traditionally underrepresented in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Developmental biology is one of the most exciting areas of modern biology.  Advances in the field have been so rapid in recent years that it is challenging for current scientists to stay abreast of the field and for new students to appreciate the breadth and depth of current research. Over the past two decades, the biennial Santa Cruz Developmental Biology (SCDB) Meeting gained an international reputation as a superb venue for presentation and discussion of current results across the field of developmental biology, bringing together established leaders in the field with junior faculty, graduate students and postdocs. It provides for all of the participants a broad view of some of the most exciting new developments in developmental biology.  Unlike many comparably sized meetings, SCDB meetings emphasize interdisciplinary approaches, and are not focused on specific processes or organisms, allowing cross-talk among scientists from diverse backgrounds, seeding new ideas and new approaches and stimulating new collaborations.     The 2010 Meeting was organized around the theme "Diverse strategies in Development" and held seven plenary sessions to address key current questions such as: how does an embryo form correctly? What allows stem cells to renew themselves, and how does this go wrong in instances of cancer? How is the nervous system wired and how do we obtain our final shapes? In each session, speakers addressed how similar events are regulated in different plants and animals, helping reveal the diverse solutions evolution has crafted to similar developmental challenges.    The 2010 SCDB meeting also fostered training of the next generation of developmental biologists.  Two formal workshops for "getting into the game" and "staying in the game" emphasizing strategies for successful early career development.  In addition, the small size of the meeting and multiple chances for informal meetings over meals and poster activities gave students and young researchers access to prominent scientists in the field.  Such meetings are critically important to train our next generation of biomedical researchers.       Last Modified: 06/07/2011       Submitted by: Dominique Bergmann]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
