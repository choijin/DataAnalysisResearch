<AbstractNarration>The Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) plays a key role in global climate and ocean biogeochemistry. Using a recently collected series of cores from the Peruvian margin, this collaborative research generates an integrated paleoceanographic data set from this region, including alkenones, trace elements, stable isotopes, and sediment composition. These data are used to document lateral and vertical gradients in key aspects of physical, biological, and geochemical properties of the cold tongue region of the EEP. The approach is structured around three time streams of increasingly high resolution: last glacial maximum (LGM) through Termination I, the Holocene, and the last 2 millennia.  The research team tests the hypothesis that the paleoceanography of the EEP has been dictated by two distinct drivers: the remote influence of the high latitude southern ocean, which dominated surface and subsurface properties from the LGM to the middle Holocene, and tropical dynamics which drove the modern El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system over the past ~5 ky. Broader impacts include graduate and post-doctoral training, internships for disadvantaged high school students, and collaborations with South American scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project addresses the physical and biological evolution of the eastern tropical Pacifc (ETP) "cold tongue", a region of global climatic and biological significance, since the last ice age to the present.  The archives we used come from marine sediment cores collected near the Peru/Ecuador  border and from the Galapagos platform. We traced the variability of surface properties, such as sea surface temperature and biological activity, through geochemical analyses of compounds and skeletons made by planktonic organisms.  Important subsurface properties, such as the underlying density structure of the water column, and nutirent and oxygen content, were reconstructed at the same sites to give an integrated picture of the coupling between the surface and deeper oceanographic properties.     Results of Work supported by this grant led to three major findings with significant implications for understanding the interplay between regional and global climate change in the eastern tropical Pacific.  First, we found that the temperature history of the "cold tongue" is quite separate from that of the Humboldt Current that comes north from Chile and Peru. Today, the Humboldt Current and cold tongue appear to merge into one feature, but that has not been the case for most of the last 25,000 years.  The ETP did not reach its modern temperature until the middle Holocene, a situation that must have affected the evolution of the El Nino cycle over time. Second, we found evidence for significant changes in the density structure of the region, with variability on the time scale of a few centuries and perhaps shorter.  As the water below the surface originates thousands of kilometers away in the high latitudes of the southern hemisphere, our data imply that climate change can be imported into the ETP from a long distance.  Lastly, we found evidence for a profound biogeochemical divide on either side of the equator.  Since the last ice age, sediment cores tell a precisely mirror image of biological activity to the north and south of the equator, although their surface temperature patterns look very similar. This result again points to the influence of subsurface properties, in this case, different sources of nutrients, in controlling the surface activity of the ETP.  This grant has supported Ph.D. work by students at Rutgers and Brown Universities, and also undergraduate and high school student research.  Results have been presented by the PIs and their students at national meetings.  Outreach has also included presentations to teachers and students at local schools, emphasizing the ocean's role in global climate.
