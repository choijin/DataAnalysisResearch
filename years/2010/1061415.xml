<AbstractNarration>Prior research notes that police officers often rely on nonverbal behavior, such as gaze aversion and fidgeting, to detect deception. These behaviors, however, have been shown in studies to not be reliable indicators of deception. Rather, they are indicators of anxiety.  Other than guilt, there are many reasons why a suspect may be nervous when talking to the police.  One often overlooked reason is the race of the subject since prior research shows that being stereotyped is an anxiety provoking process. The current project uses three studies to test the present police reliance on cues to anxiety when assessing the credibility of a suspect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This line of research seeks to expand the research on the role of race in interviewing and interrogation. As such, the results will inform practitioners in the legal system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over 300 people have been exonerated by post conviction DNA testing, unequivocally proving their innocence.  Nearly 70% of these post conviction DNA exonerees are members of minority groups, and approximately 69% of those convicted as a result of false confessions are racial/ethnic minorities (www.innocence project.org).  To date, there is little research on the role of suspect race in police interviews and interrogations.  The present research sought to examine Black and White participantsÆ experiences during a mock crime interview, as well as police officersÆ veracity judgments of these suspects.  Black and White mock crime suspects reported similar levels of anxiety during the interview and exhibited similar rates of nonverbal behaviors commonly believed to be cues to deception.  In Study 2, when asked to make veracity judgments of these mock suspects, police officers exhibited chance levels of accuracy in their culpability decisions.  When evaluating innocent Black suspects, however, police officers made significantly more mistakes than when evaluating innocent White suspects; yet officers showed no difference in their accuracy rates for guilty Black and White suspects.   Intellectual Merit  Despite the overrepresentation of African-Americans in the criminal justice system, little research has examine how suspect race affects police interviews and interrogations. The results of this study extend the police interviewing and interrogation literature by comparing police officersÆ veracity judgments of Black and White suspects.  Broader Impact  The current research suggests that innocent Black suspects are at considerable risk of being erroneously judged as deceptive during a police interview. Consequently, these misjudgments may place innocent Black suspects at a significant risk of being interrogated about crimes they did not commit.  This is the first U.S. study that we know of to compare police officersÆ perceptions and culpability judgments of Black and White suspects.  More research is needed to identify the specific causes for these misjudgments and as well as potential remedies for these misjudgments.
