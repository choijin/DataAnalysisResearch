<AbstractNarration>This Targeted Research project is investigating the impact of an approach to K-12 professional development for mathematics teachers that rests on the explicit cultivation of teacher creativity in producing short explanatory videos to help engage students in learning mathematics concepts. All videos are reusable and shareable using NSDL-compliant standards so that they may accumulate over time into substantial and sharable personal resource collections. Underlying this research is an emerging theory of personalized learning communities and pilot work carried out with support from NSF's Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate and the Department of Education's Institute for Education Sciences. Target audiences for this research include middle and high school mathematics teachers, undergraduate teacher education and mathematics faculty; members of various learning science, mathematics education, policy and creativity research communities; and individuals in professional development policy and decision-making roles. The project's intellectual merit stems from its underlying theory base involving prior research in classroom dynamics, current pilot work on the integration of digital library resources with teacher professional development, and a methodical approach to research on digital library impact. The project is exerting broader impacts by contributing creativity-centric approaches to teacher participation in resource collection adaptation and generation to NSDL and to the usability of certain types of resource libraries. Additionally, this impact extends to its potential influence on pre-service teacher education in undergraduate mathematics departments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal goal of this National STEM Digital Library (NSDL) project was to determine the impact of engaging teachers in producing curriculum materials through creating digital media, especially videos. We expected impact to occur in areas of intructional effectiveness, content knowledge, technology proficiency, and professional satisfaction.  A secondary goal was to explore the nature of teacher creativity in areas not typically associated with teachers.  Each of these expectations was framed as a conjecture about how media-making could influence teachers, and each was confirmed.  This project came about through an unexpected detour in an earlier learning technology development effort..  A software platform meant to promote high speed feedback between students and teachers in mathematics classrooms required teachers to populate part of the system with short video content.  Content production through video-making was considered a relatively secondary aspect of the system, but it eventually emerged as the most important aspect, for several reasons that will resonate with those engaged in the makerspace efforts that have come inbto ascendancy since this project was first proposed in 2009.   Among the project outcomes was documenting ways in which the opportunity for teachers to produce their own digital media, in the form of short instructional videos, seemed to activate a cycle of virtuous processes. First among these was the development of skill in using digital representations to express mathematical ideas.  This meant not simply learning new technology skills, but doing so in service of mathematics teaching.  Producing, editing and finalizing a mathematics video embodies mathematical structure into a permanent digital representation and teachers developed the skills to fashion those representations.  But the practice and revisions that skill development required implicitly also set in motion intense reflection on how to optimize presentation, combined with repeated reasoning in producing the representations.  Such reflection also included anticipating misconceptions by students and attempting to build a coherent picture of a mathematical idea.  The process of analyzing and producing a lesson on a frame-by-frame basis affords an opportunity for coherence not readily possible in live classroom settings.  These dynamics were documented in the project based on teacher interviews and participant surveys.  Additionally, within the context of creating a video, the experience seemed to stimulate a sense of creativity and ownership among participating teachers.  It was also an immersive experience that routinely evidenced classical characteristics of flow consciousness, such as intense concentration, time dilation, and autotelic motivation.  This project led directly to four areas NSF has begun to support or is reviewing currently..  1. Teachers routinely indicated that they were not able to find the time to use their media-making skills effectively, no matter how enamored they were with the process.  This led to experimentation of teachers collaborating with students around video-making, and to a new study on intergenerational collaboration supported by DRK12. This work also led to the development of a Fulbright Research Fellowing in the Republic of Namibia (2015-2017).  Approximately 80% of the work in the Fulbright project relates directly to the design that appeared in and defined by this NSDL proposal.  2. This pair of NSDL/DRK12 studies gave rise to new research on learner engagement and was instrumental in the development of the US-Finland collaborative (SAVI) on learner engagement (2012-2014).  3. The findings on engagement, flow and intergenerational collaboration in the context of media making and creativity led to a Cyberenabled Learning Exploratory Project.  (2013-2017)  4. This NSDL project has focused on teachers in formal school settings.  The advent of media-making clubs to help teachers develop media opened an informal science aspect to the project.  The international aspects and the media-making clubs led to a 2015 proposal to the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program to create student &amp; teacher media making clubs in the US, Finland, Kenya and Namibia.  That proposal is under review at the time of this summary submission.          Last Modified: 08/28/2016       Submitted by: Eric Hamilton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
