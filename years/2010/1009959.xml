<AbstractNarration>Biello&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1009959&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Our understanding of tropical meteorology and its ability to&lt;br/&gt;influence the middle latitudes is the major stumbling block to&lt;br/&gt;increasing medium term (two week) weather prediction over the&lt;br/&gt;United States (midlatitudes).  The investigator studies&lt;br/&gt;multiscale asymptotics for the partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;that govern tropical atmosphere atmospheric waves and their&lt;br/&gt;connection to midlatitude waves, extending his previous work in&lt;br/&gt;the field.  The three aspects of this project are: (1) The effect&lt;br/&gt;of the climatological flow (the Hadley circulation) on the&lt;br/&gt;Intraseasonal Multiscale Moist Dynamics models of the&lt;br/&gt;Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO); (2) The effect of mean shear on&lt;br/&gt;the non-linear interaction of equatorial Rossby or Kelvin waves&lt;br/&gt;with midlatitude Rossby waves; (3) The coupling of tropical waves&lt;br/&gt;to a stochastic model of moist convection and the derivation of a&lt;br/&gt;closed, single scale, stochastic model of the Madden-Julian&lt;br/&gt;Oscillation.  This last project could yield a transformative&lt;br/&gt;development because it would be the first MJO model whose&lt;br/&gt;structure is systematically derived from multiscale asymptotics&lt;br/&gt;(Biello and Majda) and whose convective forcing arises from a&lt;br/&gt;tested model of cloud dynamics (Khouider, Biello and Majda). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The effect of small and fast phenomena on large and slower&lt;br/&gt;phenomena is a ubiquitous question in modern science and&lt;br/&gt;policy-making.  In economics, for example, the question may be&lt;br/&gt;phrased, "How do individual actions organize to yield steady&lt;br/&gt;economic conditions or unstable economic conditions?"  In&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric science, this question is manifested as "How do small&lt;br/&gt;scale events such as storms and storm systems organize themselves&lt;br/&gt;to affect the mean climate in which they sit?"  While large&lt;br/&gt;modern computational simulations have yielded many insights into&lt;br/&gt;this multi-scale organization, they are limited in that the&lt;br/&gt;smallest structures they can resolve are still large; for&lt;br/&gt;example, most climate computations cannot see structures smaller&lt;br/&gt;than 60 miles across.  So, the equations that these computers&lt;br/&gt;solve must resort to a model (whether empirically determined, or&lt;br/&gt;ad hoc) in order to describe these unresolved structures.  A more&lt;br/&gt;systematic approach is to use techniques of modern applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics in order to isolate the phenomena at each scale that&lt;br/&gt;are the essential elements of this multi-scale coupling.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator's work focuses on using these modern applied math&lt;br/&gt;techniques to understand the multi-scale coupling of the tropical&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere.  Specifically, he seeks to understand how storm&lt;br/&gt;systems, which live for several days, organize to affect&lt;br/&gt;planetary scale wind patterns, which modulate over the course of&lt;br/&gt;several months.  Furthermore, these wind patterns generate&lt;br/&gt;weather waves that propagate away from the tropics over the&lt;br/&gt;continental U.S.  The investigator uses similar mathematical&lt;br/&gt;techniques to understand this wave generation.  Improving our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of these phenomena will increase the accuracy of US&lt;br/&gt;weather forecasts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Solar heating drives the atmospheric circulation in the tropics.   This large scale circulation consists of poleward flow and eastward jets in the high troposphere, and equator ward converging flow and westward trade winds in the lower troposphere.   The circulation, itself, is driven by the release of latent heat of condensation in tropical storm systems - which, although much smaller than the planet as a whole, combine to drive the planetary circulation.    It is on this circulation that tropical atmospheric waves propagate.    These waves are generated by storm systems which act like a pebble landing on the surface of the water - sending waves away from the source of the disturbance.    These waves are important in that they carry pressure and wind signals that were generated, say, in Indonesia, all the way across the Pacific Ocean to the Americas.      The waves have been studied for many years, bearing the name Kelvin and Rossby waves - but have mostly been understood to propagate on either a motionless  atmosphere or an atmosphere containing only east/west winds.     Among the most significant results of this project is that these large scale Kelvin and Rossby waves are completely mangled by the equator to pole Hadley circulation.   This provides an explanation of why observed Kelvin waves do not exist at low frequencies - something not explained in previous studies.    We also found that tropical Rossby waves, themselves the nesting regions of tropical cyclones, leak their energy into the middle latitudes when they travel through a longitude of strong equator to pole circulation.     The easterly/westerly winds in the subtropics have long been known to be unstable, shedding waves poleward with regularity.  In our studies, we discovered a new coupled instability which looks like, both, a Kelvin and a Rossby wave.   This result is significant because the resulting wave propagates along the equator - not a characteristic of previously studied instabilities.  Furthermore, the two underlying waves carry different physical quantities (the Kelvin carrying atmospheric density while the Rossby wave carries angular momentum).    Not only have we found the physical explanation for the existence of this wave, but we have determined the atmospheric conditions in which it arises.    In doing so, we collaborated closely with atmospheric observationalists.  We   developed new models of the heating effect of tropical storms by studying detailed computer simulations on 50 mile horizontal length scales in order to infer the storms' effects on larger scales.  This involved international collaborations with faculty and graduate students in the Netherlands.  We also developed a new simplification of the tropical atmospheric equations appropriate for the deep tropics (very close to the equator) on time scales of a few days - these equations capture the wave phenomena which arise when tropical cyclones form and could explain how packets of tropical cyclones can form in quick succession in the tropical Pacific Ocean.  Though these projects are united by a common goal - understanding tropical waves and their interaction with smaller scale storm systems and larger scale winds - they also share the fact that the mathematical technique of asymptotic analysis was used to arrive at simplified models.    The success of these mathematical techniques spun off two new projects, one in fluid flows in elastic media and the other in diffusion in hydrocarbon cracking, a problem of interest to the oil industry.     Through this project, the NSF directly funded the training of one graduate student while indirectly, two undergrads were involved in associated research - both of whom are now graduate students at US institutions.   A postdoctoral researcher (funded through a separate NSF VIGRE grant) was mentored by the PI, while two international collaborations and two collaborations within the US arose as part of the project.
