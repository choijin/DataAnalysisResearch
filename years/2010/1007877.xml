<AbstractNarration>Since the publication of the NSF landmark report "Visualization in&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Computing" in 1987, computer-aided visualization has been&lt;br/&gt;recognized as one of the most potent tool sets for scientific&lt;br/&gt;discovery. However, discoveries based on data displays are often&lt;br/&gt;criticized because they are not secured by statistical inference. The&lt;br/&gt;team of researchers from Iowa State University, Rice University and&lt;br/&gt;University of Pennsylvania is addressing exactly this issue by&lt;br/&gt;bringing the rigors of statistical inference to visual data&lt;br/&gt;exploration. Statistical inference for plots are cast as comparison of&lt;br/&gt;a plot of the actual data with plots of null data simulated under a&lt;br/&gt;null hypothesis. If the actual plot stands out from a background of&lt;br/&gt;"null plots", it amounts to the rejection of the null hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;Executing this idea leads to rigorous protocols that can confer proper&lt;br/&gt;statistical significance to visual discoveries. Tools of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;statistics are employed to reduce composite null hypotheses to single&lt;br/&gt;reference distributions: conditioning on a minimal sufficient&lt;br/&gt;statistic, bootstrap plug-ins, and posterior predictive sampling. The&lt;br/&gt;protocols also have the potential to shift the perception of&lt;br/&gt;exploration-based findings in the scientific communities and&lt;br/&gt;dramatically increase the impact that these findings are allowed to&lt;br/&gt;have. The testing protocols will be made accessible with&lt;br/&gt;implementation in the open-source R language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data graphics are an essential part of communicating information. But&lt;br/&gt;how reliable is the information that we gather from them? The&lt;br/&gt;investigators will develop a rigorous framework for visual inference&lt;br/&gt;modeled after formal statistical testing. This framework allows the &lt;br/&gt;reader of a graphic to determine whether structure is real or spurious &lt;br/&gt;(is that a man in the moon, or just some rocks?). These protocols have &lt;br/&gt;the potential to shift the perception of exploration-based findings in &lt;br/&gt;the scientific community and dramatically increase the impact of &lt;br/&gt;exploratory work. Some aspects of the protocols are so intuitive that &lt;br/&gt;they can be used for general audiences and integrated in the teaching &lt;br/&gt;of introductory statistics at from grade school to college.</AbstractNarration>

The difficulty of getting funding for this work, and the way in which the NSF handled budget cuts (i.e. smallest impact on most senior co-PI, largest impact on most junior co-PI), the amount of busy-work required for the sum of money awarded and the general hostility towards visualisation research were contributing factors to my departure from academia.
