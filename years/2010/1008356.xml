<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Chemistry Division, Profs. Eric Conte and Stuart Burris and their groups at Western Kentucky University are studying the chemistry affecting electrically-controlled adsorption of surfactants on various conductive metal surfaces.  Under conditions when the surfactant is held onto the conductive surface, the system will be devised to serve as an alternative approach to preconcentration for organic substances, whereby the surfactant acts as an adsorbing phase.  The surfactant, together with the trapped material, will then be released by changing the electric field.  If release by electrical control proves efficient, the organic solvents used in conventional preconcentration procedures will not be required, making this procedure environmentally advantageous. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an intrinsically "green" chemistry program, in the sense that it may provide an effective way to reduce the use of toxic solvents.  The work has additional impact in that it entails multidisciplinary training for Masters and undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups (minorities and Appalachia) in Kentucky.  Students will gain valuable hands-on experience in Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy and High Performance Liquid Chromatography.  The work is synergistic with Dr. Conte's Taiwanese student exchange and collaboration, supported separately by the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A material has been investigated and developed that uses electricity to control the release of surfactant onto a solid surface.  Surfactants, which are contained in detergents, allow organic substances such as pollutants to become soluble in an aqueous solution. In this work surfactants were attached to a surface through a metal ion (Cu2+) linkage.  Three organic molecules were absorbed to this modified surface.  After this adsorption step, the entire surfactant-organic substance association was desorbed by reducing the metal ion to the free metal atom which thus broke the surfactant-surface link.  The three step process to produce this material began with a bare indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode.  Next an aminosilane was introduced followed by Cu2+ ions.  Lastly, the surfactant, hexadecylamine was introduced.  It is envisioned that this material can be used to perform analytical scale extractions, allowing the determinations of organic compounds such as pollutants.  The concept of this device may also find applications in the area of environmental remediation.  Several Western Kentucky University graduate and undergraduate students, and Gatton Academy High School students have worked on this project.  Graduates of this work are pursuing further graduate studies in the sciences, employed in the chemical industry or in science teaching positions.
