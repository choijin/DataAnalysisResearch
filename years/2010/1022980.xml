<AbstractNarration>This project is examining connections between the affective domain and the cognitive domain for thousands of students in introductory geoscience courses at 8-10 colleges and universities across the United States. These institutions include large research universities, comprehensive universities, small liberal arts colleges and two-year community colleges. GARNET - the Geoscience Affective Research NETwork - is promoting excellence in STEM teaching and learning by examining how students' learning is influenced by their "affective characteristics" (motivation, attitudes, values, beliefs, etc.) and by pedagogical strategies designed to help support student learning and interest in the content. GARNET is helping to fill a little studied, yet highly significant gap in our understanding of student learning of science, by asking "how do students' motivations and beliefs about their learning skills influence their understanding of course content?"  This project is integrating research and education by providing fundamental data about the role of the affective domain in learning, while simultaneously helping students develop better learning skills. The project is building on the results of a previous collaborative GARNET project that tested two key hypotheses: (1) the affective domain has a major influence on student learning; and (2) different teaching methods significantly influence student affect and, consequently, learning. Results of that previous project revealed that learning beliefs, such as self-efficacy, were related to student performance but that the use of different instructional strategies had minimal impact on students' affective constructs. This project is moving the original GARNET focus away from what instructors do to improve learning, to study "what students do" to modify their own affect and improve their abilities to learn. The affective domain is linked to a four-stage self-regulated learning cycle that instructors are using to train students to monitor and regulate their affective constructs, and are measuring and evaluating the associated impact on student learning. On the basis of such findings, the project is developing affect-based pedagogical resources and strategies that will allow instructors to develop better introductory geoscience classes and improve student engagement, attitude, and ultimately, learning across a variety of STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most science education research tends to focus on what students learn.  This research specifically focused on what factors influence why students learn.  Motivation and effective use of self-regulation are critical for student success.  The "GARNET II: Self-regulated learning and the affective domain in physical geology" project used data from students in introductory geology classroom across the country ranging from Research 1 institutions to community college classrooms to small liberal arts colleges to public universities.  In particular, we wanted to know if there were specific interventions we could employ in the classroom to impact student use of self-regulated learning strategies and ultimately improve student learning.  Self-regulation of learning includes student motivation, use of learning strategies, and how students attribute their successes and failures.  All of these factors contribute to whether students choose to engage in learning or not, how successful they are at learning, and ultimately if they decide to continue to persist when they encounter challenges and/or failure.  These are important factors to consider if we want to increase numbers of students in the geosciences, particularly if we want to increase the diversity of students represented in the geosciences.     What we found was that while student motivation declines in all introductory courses (much as it has in other courses), there are factors that are not specific to the content that impact how successful students are at learning and whether they are likely to continue to persist in the geosciences.  The student specific factors are related to motivation (specifically a students belief and confidence in their ability to be successful), student interest, and their ability to use effective learning strategies in the classroom. In addition, the instructor plays an important role, in which classrooms that are more interactive and allow opportunities for students to engage in the content rather than listen to the instructor are more likely to learn the content and to persist to another geoscience class.  Lastly, we find that there are specific interventions that may play a role in increasing student motivation, interest, and valuing of the content, all of which contribute to student learning of the content.  Some of these interventions include student goal setting activities, opportunities to reflect on what is interesting beyond just what they learned, and making explicit how practices in the classroom can impact their ability to be successful.  Interventions are described in more detail on the GARNET webpage: http://serc.carleton.edu/garnet/index.html          Last Modified: 12/12/2014       Submitted by: Katrien Kraft]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
