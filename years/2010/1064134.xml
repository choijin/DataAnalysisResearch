<AbstractNarration>This award supports the University of Alaska Anchorage to host a two-day workshop on climate science and ethics to draw attention to the social and ethical discourses of climate change.  The conference will bring together an interdisciplinary group of scientists and philosophers in order to improve understanding both of climate science and its philosophical terrain.  The conference will bring together graduate students and senior scholars working in the areas of climate science and ethics to give presentations on social and philosophical perspectives on climate change. The presenters will be invited to consider implications of their arguments and conclusions for Alaska and the circumpolar region.  In addition, the conference seeks expanded opportunities for students to receive invaluable feedback from senior scholars in the fields of environmental bioethics and environmental ethics and the conference organizers anticipate that one of the outcomes will be to increase the profile of the developing field of climate ethics within the field of environmental ethics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will be open to the public and presentations will canvass issues related to research ethics, health, animal ethics, scientific uncertainty and risk, concepts of social, distributive and intergenerational justice related to global climate change, indigenous rights, the well-being of human and non-human communities in the Arctic, eco-technologies and the moral status of mitigation and adaptation strategies. The conference and resulting publications will also offer the public insight into the complexities of climate change science and philosophy.  The organizers anticipate that the conference will assist the public in identifying gaps in their knowledge and hopefully gain insights into social and moral responsibilities in the wake of environmental challenges.</AbstractNarration>

The objectives/outcomes of the grant were fourfold:  To promote scholarship by graduate and PhD students working in the area of climate ethics and to partner them with senior scholars from the fields of environmental bioethics and environmental ethics in the hopes that they will receive invaluable feedback. Currently, there are not many opportunities for graduate and PhD students in this sub-section of environmental ethics to receive philosophical critiques and encouragement of their work in part because the area of climate ethics is relatively new. To provide attendees with the opportunity to identify gaps in our knowledge, especially as it relates to ethics and the circumpolar region, in order to facilitate more open discourse and pointed decision-making. To facilitate deeper public conversations regarding the ethical dimensions of climate change on the Arctic and circumpolar regions though a public symposium lead by ethicists and other experts working in this area To promote the University of Alaska Anchorage's (UAA) mission as public square by requesting that some of the papers that materialize from this conference be published in a special issue of the journal Ethics and the Environment and to make the presentations available to members of the local community through UAA's philosophy department's website at through podcasts of relevant discussions.   All the outcomes above have been met. Publications from the conference can be found in the special issue on climate ethics in Ethics and the Environment (2012), 17(2)  In addition, the following paper published in 2013 also received support from scholarly activites related to this grant: "Animistic Pragmatism and Native Ways of Knowing: Adaptive Strategies for Responding to Environmental Change and Overcoming the Struggle for Food in the Sub-Arctic" in the International Journal of Circumpolar Health 72: Supplement 1.
