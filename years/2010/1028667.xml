<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to make major advances in the energy-efficient thermal design of heterogeneous systems by enabling thermo-electric-based active cooling for efficient control of on-chip thermal field to manage and eliminate hotspots and minimize spatiotemporal thermal gradients. The approach is centered on a holistic modeling and 3D simulation framework that strongly couples the sensor design, dynamic control principles, thermo-fluidics model, and device optimization model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research integrates techniques from electronic devices, thermal physics, and solid state cooling for the development of a physics-based integrated 3D framework.  This integrated framework will develop distributed sensor-driven, real-time feedback methods to activate on demand active cooling on chip and establish guiding principles for eliminating the bottlenecks of active cooling in 3D heterogeneous system. The research will lead to optimized thermoelectric device properties and develop system-level sensing and control principles for enabling efficient active cooling in a heterogeneous system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The sensing and control methods for active cooling on chip and assisted device optimization methods are expected to have a transformative impact on the development of energy-efficient electronic systems and software tool chains. The research will integrate education through graduate course development and preparation of a model tutorial on 'Hot spot management,' which will be posted on nanoHUB.org.  Undergraduate students will be advised through the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program and the Discovery Park Undergraduate Research Internship program. Participation in Facilitating Academic Careers in Engineering and Science for African-American students and Summer Undergraduate Research Experience for minorities will facilitate involvement of underrepresented minorities in the research program.</AbstractNarration>

These materials are currently used in niche applications but would have a more significant societal impact if their efficient were improved.  One way to increase their efficiency is to decrease their thermal conductivity; put in simple terms, this is because a low thermal conductivity help maintain the temperature gradient. This project focused on understanding and reducing the thermal conductivity of materials using atomic level simulations with three main thrusts: the study thermal transport in superlattices, the development of novel simulation methods that enable the description of thermal transport in metals, and transport through metal-semiconductor interfaces.  1. Superlattices are laminated structures where two materials are mixed at nanometer scales. These structures are interesting because the high number density of interfaces leads to very low thermal conductivities. The researchers used molecular dynamics to show that thin-film superlattices could exhibit lower thermal conductivities than corresponding superlattice nanowires when the total specimen length was very small (tens of nanometers). This is surprising because nanowires tend to have lower thermal conductivity than films because of surface scattering. The simulations enabled the authors to derive a simple explanation of the reasons of the intriguing behavior of the thin-film superlattices.  2. Molecular dynamics simulations follow the motion of individual atoms and consequently provide an accurate description of thermal transport caused by the motion of atoms (phonons).

The team developed a new method to capture the electronic contribution to thermal transport in molecular dynamics simulations.
