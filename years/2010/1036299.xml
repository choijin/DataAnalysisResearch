<AbstractNarration>North Carolina A&amp;T State University's project entitled - TALENT-21 Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Program at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology - is developing an interdisciplinary undergraduate program at the interface of Mathematics and Biology. The goal of this program in mathematical and computational biology (MCB) is to provide African American students from diverse STEM educational backgrounds with an integrated education, research training and professional development environment to prepare them for graduate studies or professional careers in the field of MCB. The TALENT-21 Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Program will synthesize research efforts that link student research engagement with course and curriculum development, faculty teaching and learning scholarship, and faculty research development.  The program will devise an academic minor program in mathematical and computational biology as a curriculum and research option to broaden the participation and enhanced preparation of STEM students in MCB. It will facilitate research growth for faculty by contributing to professional development in research and by promoting interdisciplinary and collaborative research opportunities. This program has the potential to be a model for increasing the number of minority students to pursue STEM degree programs and careers, as well as for helping junior faculty to build a progressive academic career, while assisting some senior faculty to retool themselves to be active and productive in scholarship in teaching and learning.</AbstractNarration>

As<strong><em> </em></strong>a result of this implementation project, an applied math minor program was developed in spring 2011 and has been offered since fall 2011 with an annual fall enrollment of 9, 9, 13, 17 and 17 for the past five years. The program has so far awarded seven minors. A biology minor program was developed in spring 2012 and has been offered since fall 2012 with an annual fall enrollment of 2, 3, 4, 7 and 7 for the past five years; and it has awarded four minors so far. A one-year sequence of college algebra and trigonometry for STEM majors, MATH 103 and 104, were developed in spring 2011 to prepare their readiness for calculus and has been offered since fall 2011. The total enrollment of MATH 103 from fall 2011 through spring 2016 was 2,775 with an average ABC rate of 57%, and the total enrollment of MATH 104 from spring 2012 to spring 2016 was 2,158 with an average ABC rate of 64%. A total of 81 students have been supported by either academic year research traineeships (44) or summer REU internships (22) or both (15). Of 81 supported research trainees, 48 have already graduated and more than half of them went on to graduate or professional schools. The program offered three 2-day intensive GRE preparation short courses and four 3-month GRE preparation courses to a total of 105 NCA&amp;T graduate school bound students, and more than half of them went on to graduate schools. The TALENT-21 program provided 69 student travel awards, and its supported students made 79 conference presentations, and won 11 awards. One student, Nadine Jensen, won the prestigious Berry Goldwater Fellowship in 2013 and NSF Graduate Research Fellowship in 2014. The TALENT-21 program implemented vertical peer mentoring, and arranged to have its supported research trainees serve as math or science tutors for gateway courses. Each supported research trainee was required to sign a research and service contract, maintain a weekly activity log validated and signed off by his/her research advisor monthly, and attend the monthly meet organized by the program coordinator, writing workshops and other graduate school application and resume preparation information sessions. It also leveraged with several federally funded programs to co-sponsor MORE on STEM research retreats and symposia. The TALENT-21 program supported a total of 242 faculty to participate in professional development activities. The program upgraded the Mathematics Department Undergraduate Mathematical and Computational Modeling Lab by providing with multi-screen A/V projection system. Leveraging with an NSF MRI grant, the TALENT-21 program helped set up an advanced visualization lab in 200 Marteena Hall. It also helped upgrade a smart classroom in 216 Marteena Hall to support a group of calculus instructors to pilot an active learning model, SCALE-UP, in Calculus I classes. The 3<sup>rd</sup> HBCU-UP implementation project at NCA&amp;T has had a catalytic effect on institutional teaching and learning, and student and faculty engagement and success. The average GPA of 148 TALENT-21 supported NCA&amp;T students was 3.32. The 4-year and 6-year graduation rates for the 123 TALENT-21 supported students who have either graduated (117) or dropped out (6) were 76% and 87%. The graduate/professional school attending and graduation rates for the 123 TALENT-21 supported students were 53% and 27%. It also increased project team&rsquo;s research productivity resulting in over $650,000 leverage funding, 10 scholarly publications, and over 20 conference presentations.</p> <p>It co-sponsored the 2010 National Wabash Study in Mathematics by providing travel, facility and graduate student support to a group of math faculty&rsquo;s participation in this study and by leveraging with other funding resources to provide assistance to MATH 101 and 102-Fundementals of Algebra and Trigonometry I and II, and MATH 131-Calculus I redesign and pilot implementation of the Math Emporium model in MATH 101 and 102 and SCALE-UP model in MATH 131. This pilot study provided the groundwork for developing and securing a 1.76 million dollar grant from the NC GlaxoSmithKline Foundation to establish a STEM Center of Excellence for Active Learning at NCA&amp;T. With an HBCU-UP implementation project supplemental funding grant to NCAT College of Arts and Sciences, a gender equity and faculty success study was conducted, which led to the development and securing a $3.2M NSF Advance IT grant to NCA&amp;T in 2014.
