<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Patrick Livingood at the University of Oklahoma, Elsbeth Dowd will investigate a series of ancestral Caddo archaeological sites in southeastern Oklahoma.  These sites, situated along the Mountain Fork River in the Ouachita Mountains, were home to a series of horticultural communities from approximately A.D. 1200-1600.  These people, ancestors of the modern Caddo, were some of the original residents of the state of Oklahoma - and yet much remains to be understood of their early history in this area.&lt;br/&gt;Archaeologists have long been intrigued by the social and political history of the ancestral Caddo, who lived at the boundary of the woodlands and the plains.  Researchers have commonly suggested that these communities were organized politically as chiefdoms, in which a powerful leader exercised coercive power over a number of surrounding communities.  However, it is becoming clear that more diversity existed in sociopolitical organization across the Caddo area than has previously been recognized.  Ms. Dowd will examine the social and political dynamics of these Mountain Fork Caddo communities in order to test the hypothesis that they were organized as a political entity characterized by leadership strategies of negotiation and power-sharing, rather than simple hierarchical coercion.  This will involve examining the relationship between Woods Mound Group and surrounding residential sites.  Woods Mound Group is a site with multiple ceremonial earthen mounds, constructed and used by one or more communities.  These mounds, embodiments of of ceremonial, social, and political action, will provide a locus for studying the social relationships, political organization, and chronological history of the communities in this region.  This research is important because it intersects with current anthropological debates about the complexity and dynamics of small-scale societies.  It incorporates new theoretical perspectives into the study of a significant ceremonial and political landscape in the Caddo archaeological area.  &lt;br/&gt;Research methods will primarily involve comparing pottery styles, in terms of technology and decoration, between the mounds and between archaeological sites.  Data will be acquired from existing collections and from upcoming excavations at Ramos Creek, the newly-discovered largest and northern-most site in this drainage.  A series of 25 radiocarbon dates will also be obtained from existing collections and Ramos Creek to clarify this region's chronology.  In addition, to learn about subsistence at Ramos Creek, faunal and paleobotanical samples will be analyzed.  &lt;br/&gt;This project will have broader impacts in addition to addressing research questions of interest to social scientists.  First, the project will involve collaboration with the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma in learning about the history of their ancestors.  Second, undergraduate students at the Ramos Creek field school will learn archaeological methods and Caddo heritage and history.  Third, the results of this project will be broadly disseminated in both academic and non-academic venues, including presentations at schools, museums, and local archaeological societies and publication in peer-mediated journals.  Finally, this project will support the doctoral research of a student at an EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) institution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Archaeologists have long been interested in the Native American societies who lived in the southeastern United States in the centuries before Europeans arrived (ca. A.D. 1000-1600).  Some of these societies, especially those surrounding famous sites with large mounds such as Cahokia, Moundville, and Spiro, have attracted much attention from researchers.  These societies have been characterized as chiefdoms, which were polities lead by strong hereditary leaders who exercised economic and religious control over the surrounding communities.  Many archaeologists, however, now argue that we should pay more attentions to smaller mound sites and their surrounding communities that also existed during this period, because these settlements may represent different types of societies.  Some of these societies may have had looser political organizations, perhaps being lead by councils whose influence and power was not absolute over their people.   This project investigated an ancestral Caddo society in southeastern Oklahoma, which was composed of a series of communities living along the Mountain Fork River in the Ouachita Mountains between approximately A.D. 1100-1500.  Based on accounts by the early Spanish and French explorers, some Caddo societies were apparently chiefdoms, lead by a caddi (chief) who passed his title on to his descendants.  The accounts also mention councils, though, who advised the caddi, and who may have played a more important role in policy making in different times and places.  This project aimed to examine the chronological, social, and political relationships among the Mountain Fork communities in order to determine whether leadership was more or less centralized in this society.  A major goal was the determine the relationship between Woods Mound Group, a site with eight small buried structure mounds, and surrounding communities, in order to study the intersection between ceremonial and political practices in this valley over time.   In order to explore the sociopolitical dynamics of this ancestral Caddo society, this project undertook several major research and education activities.  First, excavations were conducted at Ramos Creek, the recently-discovered and northern-most site with a Caddo component in the drainage, in order to learn more about occupation of the northern Mountain Fork.  This was accomplished by holding an archaeological field school sponsored by the University of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Archeological Field School, in which 24 undergraduate students learned about archaeological methods and about the history and heritage of the Caddo people.  Second, charcoal samples were submitted from both the Ramos Creek site and from previously excavated sites, in order to assist with the reconstruction of the valleyÆs occupational history.  Third, the pottery from Ramos Creek and all previously excavated Caddo sites in the valley is being analyzed both to refine the chronological relationships between sites and to examine social and political relationships between communities.  Finally, soil samples from Ramos Creek were sent to a consultant in order to analyze plant remains that will tell us about what this community was eating.  This will help us to learn more about the relationship of maize cultivation and other subsistence practices to sociopolitical organization along the Mountain Fork.  The pottery and plant remain (paleobotanical) analyses will be finished shortly, and all of the project results will be written up in the co-PIs dissertation, which she anticipates finishing by May 2012.    This project has a number of important broader impacts.  First, the project has had educational benefits.  At least 28 undergraduate students have participated in the project, learning about archaeological excavation and lab techniques and about Caddo history and heritage.  One student has gone on to use data from this project for his own research.  Three graduate students also had the opportunity to develop t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
