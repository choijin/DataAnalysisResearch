<AbstractNarration>This three-year REU Site program at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville (UA) focuses on nanomaterials and nanomechanics.  The objectives of the proposed REU program are: 1) to engage 10 undergraduate students each year in nanoscale engineering; 2) to allow students to self-assess their interest in graduate school; 3) to increase the number of future professionals in nanomaterials and nanomechanics; and 4) to enable the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UA to become and be recognized as a nationally top tier undergraduate and graduate program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU participants will also be engaged in seminars and workshops to expose them to nanoscale engineering as well as professional development, emphasizing research and graduate studies.  Complementary social activities include tours of regional research and industrial facilities, group outings to local areas of interest in collaboration with the other UA REU programs. The seminars and workshops will be delivered by faculty mentors and professional practitioners.  Seminar topics include the following: 1) entrepreneurship; 2) nanoelectromechanics; 3) nanobiomechanics; atomistic modeling; and pico and nano satellites. The following six workshops will be held: 1) introduction to the library; 2) advanced library topics; 3) applying to graduate school; 4) GRE Practice Tests; 5) presentation skills and report writing; and 6) research and ethics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During week two of the program REU students will participate in a mini-symposium where they will make a 5 minute presentation on the rationale, objectives and proposed methodology for their research to faculty, graduate students, interns and the public. At the end of the program, the students will present their project results in a 12 minute conference style presentation to faculty, graduate students, interns and the public.  Finally, they will be required to prepare a final written report of their research results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will be targeted to undergraduate students from institutions with limited research activities, minority institutions, women, persons with disabilities and other UA programs. Participants will be strongly encouraged to present their research results at a technical conference related to their research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Intellectual Merit  During the summer of 2012, the following 10 research projects were conducted with the REU student participants and represent our major research activities:     - Manipulation of Graphene by Atomic Force Microscopy  - Fabrication of an Ion-Sensitive Field-Effect Transistor for Microliter Applications  - A Review of Particle-Bubble Interactions Focusing on Enhancing the Machining Potential of a Cavitating Bubble  - Diffusion of Atmospheric Penetrants Through Polydimethylsiloxane-based Nanocomposites  - Characterization of Nanochannels for use in a Nanofluidic device  - The Numerical Simulation of a PDMS-based Peristaltic Micropump  - Study of Polydopamine as a Surface Primer for Improving Tribological Property of Thin PTFE Films  - A Review of Microbubble Life Cycle for Application in Sonothrombolysis  - Atomistic Simulation of Ion Bombardment on Gamma-Alumina  - Development of a Nanochannel System with Integrated Electrodes for Rapid DNA Sequencing   Results from these projects have been utilized by faculty mentors to facilitate the development of various technologies in the principal disciplinary field.     Broader Impacts   As a result of our aggressive advertising campaign, there were 32 total applicants &ndash; 11 of which were under-represented, 6 offers made to under-represented applicants that resulted in 3 acceptances (50%), and 1 female participant.  As a result of this funding, 10 students participated in this REU program for the Report Submission Period: 05/01/2012 to 04/30/2013.   The REU participants came from a variety of locations and schools, and they will increase the awareness of University of Arkansas (UA) activities at these locations. They participated in various activities with other REU programs on UA campus.  The participants were trained in Presentation Skills, Technical Report Writing, Graduate School Preparation, Experimental Techniques, Engineering Ethics, Nanomaterials and Nanomechanics Overview, Team building, and Leadership Training in Engineering. Furthermore, we improved the performance and skills of members of underrepresented groups that will enhance their access to or retention in research careers.     Summary of Outcomes of Award   As a result of this award, 30 undergraduate students participated in the REU program.  Eight of the participants came from non-doctoral institutions, providing them the opportunity to experience research that may not have been available at their institutions. Six of the thirty participants were female and fifteen were under-represented participants. Twenty five of the thirty student participants express deep interest in graduate school, specifically; they will pursue careers related to research and development.  These participantsÆ research findings resulted in at least 10 journal and conference publications.   The REU participants visited micro/nano-fabrication facilities of Texas Instrument in Dallas.  This was an incredible experience for all the participants.       Last Modified: 06/21/2013       Submitted by: Uchechukwu C Wejinya]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
