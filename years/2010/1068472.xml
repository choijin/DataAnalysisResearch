<AbstractNarration>OISE- 1068472 &lt;br/&gt;U.S.-Nepal Planning Visit to Initiate Collaborative Research in Geography and Environmental Engineering with Faculty at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, Nepal, November 2010. &lt;br/&gt;PI Mohan Dangi of California State University (CSU) will undertake a planning visit to the Tribhuvan University (TU) where he will meet with the Heads of the Institute of Science and Technology, the Central Department of Environmental Science, and the Central Department of Botany.  He and the foreign collaborators will identify future research opportunities in waste management, biogas generation, and climate change issues affecting Nepal.  He will also examine the laboratory facilities, field research sites, appropriate mentors and the logistics in preparation for submission of an International Research Experience for Students (IRES) proposal to the Office of International Science &amp; Engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit- This project will examine the effectiveness of low-cost waste treatment techniques that could be feasible for Nepal and other developing countries where managing urban waste is a growing challenge for governments.  Dangi has thoroughly documented the analysis of waste management in Kathmandu and the indications are that a participatory style of management that promotes local protocols and strengthens the capacity of the municipality with waste specific treatment options can sustain such practices.  Dangi is an Assistant Professor of Environmental Systems and Policy in the Department of Geography at CSU and a recent PhD from Johns Hopkins University in Geography and Environmental Engineering.  He has conducted extensive research on understanding the technical-social interface of managing waste.  The counterparts at Tribhuvan University are a well-matched, cross-disciplinary team that includes an environmental scientist, a botanist, and economist.   &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts- There are several broader impacts expected to result from this planning visit.  One is that the visit will lay the groundwork for initiating a lasting research partnership between a US and Nepalese university.  Secondly, the results of the research undertaken as part of this partnership could serve as a model for improving waste management practices in developing countries.  During the visit, the PI will also develop a framework for the submission of an IRES proposal to NSF that will provide unique opportunities in environmental engineering for US undergraduate and graduates to work on research projects mentored by Nepalese professors.  Directly connected with this is the co-development with TU faculty of effective IRES research projects for the US students that are mutually beneficial.</AbstractNarration>
