<AbstractNarration>Climate change may alter the outbreak dynamics of forest-defoliating insects, with potential consequences for both the economy and the environment. Although numerous studies predict that climate change will increase the frequency and severity of outbreaks, few studies have examined whether recent climate trends have impacted outbreak dynamics. Furthermore, the results of those few studies have not been consistent. Outbreak histories of 10 forest-defoliating insect species and long-term climate datasets will be examined to determine whether the regularity, frequency, and magnitude of outbreaks have shifted over time relative to long-term norms, and to evaluate whether shifts in dynamics may be influenced by climate changes. Potential causes of shifts in outbreak dynamics will be investigated by fitting quantitative population growth models to historical outbreak data, and then integrating the results from the models with existing knowledge of biological interactions (e.g., disease, parasitism) that influence the population sizes of each defoliator species. Finally, the impacts of climate change on the outbreak dynamics of forest-defoliating insects as a whole will be assessed by synthesizing the findings for individual species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to a better understanding of whether changes in climate have led to shifts in the population behavior of forest-defoliating insect species. The project will also shed light on the effects of changes in climate on the biological interactions ultimately responsible for population cycles. Broader impacts of this project include potential recommendations for pest control programs. For example, control plans could be modified by selecting biological control agents (e.g., diseases) that are likely to become more effective in the future due to climatic trends. In addition, research techniques and findings will be disseminated to science-curriculum supervisors for preK-12 schools.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project increased understanding of the effects of climate change on economically and ecologically damaging outbreaks of forest insect pests. The studies focused on a class of pests known as forest defoliators, which exhibit periodic outbreaks in which large numbers of leaf-feeding insects defoliate large areas of forest. Such outbreaks can lead to increased tree mortality and have adverse effects on nutrient cycling and wildlife. Prior to this project, limited amounts of research revealed few general patterns about effects of climate change on the severity or frequency of defoliator outbreaks. In this project, analyses of historical records of defoliator outbreaks showed that the frequency, severity or regularity of outbreaks of individual species have shifted several times and in a variety of ways over past decades and centuries. One fairly common pattern observed among defoliator species studied here and elsewhere, however, is a recent decline in the tendency of outbreaks to occur at regular time intervals.
