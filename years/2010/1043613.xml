<AbstractNarration>The project is a collaborative effort involving Manhattan College, University of Kentucky, and Bucknell University that uses the skills possessed by a media savvy generation of students to enhance conceptual learning of thermodynamics.  The project is having students develop an instructional video that teaches a concept in thermodynamics using common metaphors, and then watch a similarly constructed instructional video developed by peers at a different institution. The former employs autodidactic learning, while the latter takes advantage of peer-to-peer learning. To measure the effects of these treatments on conceptual learning, the investigators are conducting a baseline assessment using a thermodynamics concept inventory and a post-treatment assessment using a similar instrument. Additionally, student affective domain responses are being measured with a questionnaire.  The collection of videos is being made available through prominent springboards, such as the resources section of the AIChE Education Division Website and the NSDL library, and they are being aggressively promoted using a press kit sent out to those who teach thermodynamics and similar courses at other institutions as well as through further distribution of the kit at national conferences (e.g., ASEE and AIChE).  Traditional dissemination efforts include faculty workshops at national meetings, conference presentations, and journal publications.  Broader impacts include the strong dissemination effort with video postings on YouTube and the aggressive promotion of the approach through various mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Current college students have near-constant ability to shoot their own video and near constant access to user-generated videos.  YouTube and similar video sharing sites have changed the educational landscape as educators can easily create, share, and refer to educational materials online as well as assign video generation to students as a reasonable part of a lab report or project.  This project focused on studying the impact of student-generated video production and watching on studentÆs performance in the challenging course, Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics.  Our hypothesis was that students would learn the material better as they created their own videos as they reflected on the material.  We further hypothesized that watching videos would enhance learning, as students are more likely to generate metaphors that make sense to their peers than are faculty.   Students participating in this study were chemical engineering undergraduate students at three different colleges in the United States.  At the start and end of the course, they took a conceptual test on their understanding of thermodynamics, and the change in scores was used to judge learning of key concepts.  At the end of the course, students who had produced, watched, or both produced and watched videos performed as well on the conceptual assessment as students in the same courses applying other active learning approaches.  This demonstrates that video-based projects perform similar to other active learning approaches and the additional cognitive load of video production does not detract from studentsÆ learning of topical content.  In addition, students generated an impressive array of videos in which they present accessible metaphors for difficult thermodynamics concepts.  These videos are available to other students and the public through the "Lights, Camera, Thermodynamics!" channel on YouTube and also combined with additional educational materials through the http://www.projects.bucknell.edu/LearnThermo/index.html website.  These videos are useful as introductions and additional explanations for thermodynamics concepts and appropriate for both the undergraduate and high school AP chemistry and physics courses.
