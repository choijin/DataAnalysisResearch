<AbstractNarration>Our current understanding of continental rifting is largely based on studies of evolved and relict rift systems. Observations from these studies have motivated and constrained numerical models that describe rift evolution from initiation to rupture. However, there are very few field observations that constrain processes occurring at the earliest stages of rifting and the structural controls on these processes. This project involves a project to investigate the question of what happens in the early stages of continental rifting.  The East African Rift System (EARS), because of its proximity to the pole of rotation, exhibits a strong gradient in rift evolution along its length.  This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the processes that drive rift initiation and control early rift localization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will undertake a multidisciplinary investigation of the southwest branch of the EARS, which includes the very early stage Okavango Rift Zone, where classic geomorphic rift features are just beginning to emerge, and the Mweru, Luangwa (Zambia) and Malawi Rifts, where geomorphic features are fully developed but magma (if present) has yet to breach the surface.  The PIs will apply a combination of geophysical, geological, geochemical and geodynamic techniques across the southwest branch of the EARS to test the predictions of those hypotheses.  Passive seismic data will constrain lithospheric-scale structure and upper-mantle flow patterns.  Wide angle seismic profiling, along with gravity data, will constrain variations in crustal and uppermost mantle structure.  Magnetotelluric  measurements will provide system-scale constraints on lithospheric thin spots and the presence of melt, while remote sensing and field mapping will be used to map surface deformation. Geochemical analysis of hot spring fluids will identify the presence of mantle-derived melts. Geodynamic modeling will synthesize the new geophysical observations and geochemical results to develop the next generation of continental rifting models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Continental rifting plays an important role in the development of sedimentary basins and if it continues in the development of ocean basins.  Rifting is less well understood than other tectonic processes because it is a temporary process, which often stops before forming an ocean basin.  The East Africa Rift System is the most prominent continental rift system in the world.  It begins in the Afar Triangle and has propagated through Ethiopia, splitting into two rifts through Kenya and Uganda, coming together again in Tanzania and then becoming less prominent and younger as it propagates into Malawi, Zambia, and finally Botswana.  In Botswana the rift is referred to as the Okavango Rift because it occupies some of the area of the Okavango Delta.  The Okavango Rift is has yet to produce magmas, which are characteristic of continental rifts worldwide.  However, large normal faults are present which have produced significant earthquakes in recent history (Fig.1).  The Okavango Rift is an excellent place to study continental rifting in its early stages.  Some of the questions we seek to answer in this research are:  1) how do preexisting structures influence rifting; 2) how do the driving mechanisms of rifting sustain strain (crustal stretching); and 3) how do crustal and upper mantle structures evolve beneath young rifts.  To investigate these subsurface geologic structures, we collected a combination of wide-angle reflection and refraction seismic data (along the line shown in Fig. 1) across the western part of the Okavango Rift.  This was done by distributing 800 seismic recorders (instruments) over a 400 km long line, extending from the southeast to the northwest.  Twenty large (1 ton) explosions were detonated in boreholes along this line to produce the seismic waves recorded on the seismic instruments.  The recorded data were generally good and are currently being analyzed to determine the crustal and upper mantle structure under the rift as well as on either side of the rift.
