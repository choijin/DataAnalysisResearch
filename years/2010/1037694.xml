<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to expand the use of a pedagogy developed by the PIs, project enhanced learning (PEL), significantly extending the scope of it use across engineering science courses and at two partner universities.  The project will document difficulties encountered in spreading the PEL method across departments and universities, thereby contributing to the STEM community's understanding of barriers for broad adoption of effective pedagogies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to build partnerships and networks in support of an adaptation of a teaching method that has been well-established by rigorous research to be effective at improving learning for engineering students.  The partnership addresses inclusion of under-represented groups in engineering, particularly those from urban environments.  All three partner universities are located in urban centers.  Should this project be successful, it could have broad impact on how "core" engineering science courses are taught.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Half of entering US engineering undergraduate students drop out, æweeded-outÆ or æturned-offÆ before experiencing interesting design, applications or laboratory work. Even students who obtain good grades by memorizing facts and problem-solving recipes have difficulty applying the knowledge imparted. Diverse students with challenging life situations at urban institutions are particularly at risk of drop out of engineering study.   Beyond the freshman engineering experience, retention after entering the major is connected to learning and self-efficacy in key sophomore and junior courses. In particular, students perceive the early courses on engineering science fundamentals of their major as abstract, difficult, and not obviously connected to their aspirations. Learning enhancements in these highly analytical courses must illuminate logically structured course topics, and must be manageable both for students and for instructors who may have high workloads.  Research already indicates that well-designed project assignments can significantly enhance student learning. Project-enhanced learning (PEL) uses a well-integrated project within a traditional lecture-based course, implementable in a gradual and transferable way, and across multiple sections and instructors. PEL is structured around the sequence of topics in a traditional course on fundamentals of engineering, mathematics, or analytical science. It integrates course topics with one or two term-long projects that provide a scaffold for anchoring concepts and lessons.  The work on this grant expanded and disseminated a PEL model over multiple courses, departments and institutions by learning from prior difficulties, replicating best practices, identifying barriers, and assisting faculty. PEL was implemented in three different courses at multiple urban institutions.
