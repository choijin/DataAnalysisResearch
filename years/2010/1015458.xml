To develop this new line of applications, suitable materials whose spin properties can be harnessed for such spin-based device purposes must first be fabricated.

Gallium Manganese Arsenide (GaMnAs) is a promising example, and a sizeable literature has already found focus on the properties of this ferromagnetic semiconductor.  The focus of this study on a spin-dependent electron transport effect called tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in GaMnAs-based heterostructures fabricated into magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ).
