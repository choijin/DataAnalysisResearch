<AbstractNarration>Models to describe the relationship between earthquakes, faults, and tectonic strain generally three different types: those based on (a) seismicity,(b) faults, and (c) geodetically or geologically observed strain rates. Seismicity-based models often rely only on past earthquake data, ignoring fault information completely. Fault-based models generally apply only to earthquakes on pre-identified faults, either singly or in combination. Strain-based models assume that earthquake rates are related to some form of strain rate. They generally assume that earthquakes can occur anywhere, although strain based models may use fault slip information to infer strain rates. While hybrid models exist, they generally assume that future large earthquakes will occur on pre-identified faults. Many existing models show modest skill, but none includes fault properties, fault history, stresses from large and small earthquakes on and off of known faults, earthquake triggering, and tectonic strain accumulation. In this project the researchers will construct short-term and long-term models of earthquake interactions including all of the above effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their models of temporal clustering would be based on the Omori law of aftershock delay times, modified to account for the observed loss of detection capability for early aftershocks of large earthquakes. Their models would have several adjustable parameters, which would be optimized for best fit to earthquake data according to a likelihood criterion. They would then formalize the model as a forecast to be tested in the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP) program.</AbstractNarration>

Our approach is comprehensive and probabilistic. We call it forecasting, rather than predicting, because we don?t expect warnings of particular earthquakes, but rather the probability of earthquakes per unit area, magnitude, and time. We aim for accurate estimates of that probability whether it is large or small, in regiona dangerous or relatively safe. That probabilistic information is useful for decisions like where to live or build, whether to retrofit, whether to buy insurance, whether to upgrade rescue capabilities, etc.   There are many different approaches to probabilistic forecasting, representing different views of how earthquakes are caused and how their ruptures is stopped, in large part because we have limited seismological data an large earthquakes, and because many studies deal with specific regions, which may or may not differ substantially from others. Observations show that earthquakes are strongly clustered in space and time. Aftershocks are a manifestation of that clustering, but we also know that a significant number of "aftershocks" exceed the magnitude of the "main shocks" preceding them.     Some questions that have been debated include (1) whether we know most of the faults on which future earthquakes will occur, and whether their spatial interaction affects the clustering; (2) whether the stresses left behind from previous earthquakes ("sources") provides useful information about probabilities of future ones ("targets"), and (3) whether indirect information about strain rates at the earth?s surface from geological and geodetic studies can help us understand clustering and help us forecast earthquakes.     Answers to those questions are of course debated, in large part because of the data limitations and regional approaches mentioned above. We address those problems by using global data and uniform procedures whenever to avoid geographic boundaries. We also limit our earthquake data to magnitudes and times for which earthquakes everywhere will be observed with very high probability.

We hope that future more accurate measurements will lead to better forecasts based on CFF.  (3)    A careful combination of past earthquake date and strain rates from geodesy and geology makes a very good global forecast.
