<AbstractNarration>1053233&lt;br/&gt;Boyden&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tools that enable the perturbation of specific cellular processes in a temporally-precise manner are critical in the field of neuroscience for determining when and how such processes contribute to neural computations, behaviors, and pathologies. Without such tools, mechanistic understandings of how neurons and neural networks function are sometimes tentative, limiting not only basic science but also clinical progress, as the core mechanisms that contribute to normal function and disease states, and that might enable potential therapies, can remain obscure. To open up the ability to test the causal role of defined neurons in emergent brain functions, the PI has recently pioneered a set of molecular tools that, when genetically expressed in specific neuron classes within the brain, enable those neurons to be electrically activated and silenced in response to specific colors of light. These molecules are opsins, light-driven membrane proteins from nature that, when illuminated, transport charge from one side of the cellular membrane to the other. Since neurons are electrically excitable cells, expression of these genes in neurons and illumination of the resultant transgenic neurons can effect their electrical activation or silencing. Over the last few years, this lab at MIT has distributed these "optogenetic" reagents to ~300 research labs around the world, enabling these groups to study the causal role of specific cell types in brain functions. Despite their broad impact, these tools are chiefly useful for analyzing neural circuits at the level of seeing how specific cells causally affect behavior and neural dynamics; they do not enable detailed analysis of the contribution of computational processes within neurons, mediated by specific ion channels and receptors, to neural network operation. Accordingly, the PI proposes to engineer a new generation of molecular reagents and hardware to enable the study of the causal roles of receptors and ion channels in neural computations and behaviors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The brain is an incredibly complex circuit made out of cells called neurons.  The Boyden lab at MIT has been creating a toolset, called optogenetics, to allow neurons to be controlled by light.  By activating and silencing neurons, optogenetic tools allow scientists to probe how these cells contribute to emergent behaviors and diseases states.  In this NSF CAREER Award, Boyden proposed to extend the optogenetic toolbox to make it more powerful &ndash; more precise in terms of biological effect, and more scalable in terms of being able to address the large-scale 3-D circuits of the mammalian brain.  The Boyden lab developed several optogenetic tools &ndash; Jaws, which enables neural circuits to be shut down by red light (which can go deeper in the brain than other colors of light that are absorbed by blood), Chronos, which enables neural circuits to be activated at very high speeds (important because the electrical pulses generated by neurons are very fast, lasting perhaps a thousandth of a second), and Chrimson, which enables neural circuits to be activated by red light &ndash; that have opened up fundamental new opportunities in neuroscience, and are in use by hundreds of research groups around the world.  Other molecules developed by the Boyden lab, like ChromeQ and lumitoxin, allow specific ions to enter neurons (and not others), enabling the control of specific signaling pathways in cells.  Chronos, Chrimson, and Jaws are also being explored as potential therapeutic technologies, for helping human patients with conditions such as blindness, and have begun to undergo technology transfer to multiple companies seeking to perform clinical trials to alleviate human suffering.  The Boyden lab has also developed hardware &ndash; 3-D light delivery devices made out of optical fibers and microfabricated waveguides, as well as 3-D recording electrodes that enable modular and easy-to-use interfacing to the brain for optogenetics.   To make these technologies practical, the Boyden lab has developed a set of accessory technologies &ndash; devices that can automatically do brain surgery and lower electrodes into the brain, for example &ndash; as well as imaging tools that enable fine neural processes to be observed across large-scale neural circuits.  These accessory tools are having impact in their own right, but also help scientist deliver optogenetic tools to the right sites in the brain for maximal effect.  These tools are collectively being used by perhaps thousands of research groups in academia and industry to understand how the brain works, and to prototype novel strategies for repairing the brain.  The broader impacts of the work include the training of over a dozen graduate students and postdocs, many of whom are now leading their own groups as professors or continuing along the training path of science, as well as a greater public awareness of neurotechnology (Boyden has given two talks posted on the TED.com website on the above technologies, which have been seen collectively over 1.8 million times, and has delivered hundreds of lectures at universities and conferences to teach about these tools).  Teaching is a big emphasis of the Boyden lab: the technologies have been widely disseminated, with Boyden?s group hosting hundreds of visitors to come by MIT and learn how to use tools in their research.  Several of the technologies have been commercialized, with three spinout companies emerging from this project (Kendall Research, Neuromatic Devices, and Expansion Technologies), as well as one close partnership with a startup company (Leaflabs), and multiple licensing deals to major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, resulting in job creation and hopefully sustainable growth in neurotechnology, with improvements in our understanding of the brain and also our ability to heal those with brain disorders.
