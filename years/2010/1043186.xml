<AbstractNarration>This grant will defray (partial) travel costs of PhD students attending the IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh, and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON) 2010.  SECON has established itself as one of the premier conferences in the areas of sensor, ad hoc, and mesh networking, serving as a meeting point of researchers from academia and industry, as well as practitioners in diverse fields of wireless networking.  SECON 2010 will be held in Boston, Massachusetts, June 21-25, 2010.   Participation in such technical forums is critical to a PhD student?s maturity and development.  To facilitate such experiences, this proposal requests funding to defray partial travel support to students who might otherwise be unable to attend the conference. Today?s graduate students will play a central role in shaping the future of wireless technology. Attendance and participation in the top conference in one's field is a key part of the socialization of graduate students to the academic and research community,  which will broaden their perspectives and have cascading impacts.  We outline specific plans to use the travel grant to encourage the broadening of the demographics of students in attendance at SECON.</AbstractNarration>
