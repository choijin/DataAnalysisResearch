<AbstractNarration>Software engineers often do not get access to confidential data because of internal security rules that are put in place by organizations that own these data and because of several laws that regulate data protection and privacy. This situation complicates basic software engineering tasks such as testing. To give some access to required data, data owners typically use a commercial tool to anonymize or "sanitize" the data. Unfortunately, none of the existing tools takes into account basic software engineering tasks such as testing, which leads to situations where the anonymized data is of little to no value for software engineers. Currently, software engineers operate with little or no meaningful data, which is a great obstacle to creating high quality software. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program addresses a fundamental question of software engineering: how can a data owner protect private information so that the data subjects (e.g., persons, equipment) cannot be re-identified while the data retains their efficacy for software engineering tasks? To preserve the usefulness of data for software engineering tasks, algorithms are needed that take into account the structures of the applications. This work will lay a foundation for a new direction of research on interactions between software engineering and data privacy, and the PIs will support it with a set of tools for low-cost software development and evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Data anonymization affects the general public, as insufficient data anonymization can lead to data leaks and identity theft. The techniques and technologies developed in this project may improve data anonymizationin practice.  Intellectual Merit  This project has produced several data anonymization techniques and technologies that maintain the usefulness of the anonymized data for software engineering tasks. At the core, these techniques and technologies build detailed models of the things a software application does while it executes. These models include precise information about how the software application uses data and how data anonymization may influence the application behavior and thereby affect software engineering tasks.  (1) The first outcome is a prototype implementation of the proposed program analysis and data anonymization techniques in the TaDa system. TaDa analyzes programs written in the widely used Java programming language.  (2) The second outcome includes techniques for building precise models of long-running program executions and for estimating the amount of program behavior that is affected by individual program elements. These techniques are implemented in the CarFast system. The implementation is distributed via the CarFast web site.  (3) The third outcome is an automatic technique for building detailed models of the execution behavior of Big Data applications. Many Big Data applications are written in the MapReduce programming model pioneered by Google. The developed technique can analyze such MapReduce programs. This technique is implemented in the SEDGE system. The implementation is distributed via the SEDGE web site.  (4) The fourth outcome is a technique for generating large-scale programs. This technique allows researchers to generate many programs of various sizes (ranging from toy programs to several millions lines of code) for evaluating data anonymization and other program analysis techniques. This technique is implemented in the RugRat system. The implementation is distributed via the RugRat web site.  Broader Impacts  This project has provided research experiences in software analysis and data anonymization for several graduate students. Some of these students are from underrepresented groups such as female students. These graduate students have published the results of their research experiences in several research papers.  The research papers describing the project outcomes have appeared in selective academic venues. Other researchers have cited these papers and built on the results presented in these papers.  The TaDa paper received the Best Paper Award at the 21st IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE). From a total of 130 full paper submissions the program committee selected one paper for this award.  Beyond disseminating the project outcomes via traditional academic venues such as conferences and journals, research outcomes are also disseminated to the general public via web sites. That is, developed software and related documents are available for free on the project web sites.       Last Modified: 11/26/2013       Submitted by: Christoph Csallner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
