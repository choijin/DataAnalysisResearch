<AbstractNarration>Over the past decade, Internet usage has grown by more than 3.5 times,&lt;br/&gt;to about 1.6 billion users; about 300 million of these are broadband&lt;br/&gt;subscribers.  Unfortunately, despite this growing penetration and users'&lt;br/&gt;increasing reliance on broadband networks for critical or&lt;br/&gt;performance-sensitive applications, neither the research community nor&lt;br/&gt;industry knows much about the performance of access links, or how users&lt;br/&gt;configure and use networks inside the home.  The lack of visibility into&lt;br/&gt;today's home networks makes it nearly impossible to understand the&lt;br/&gt;problems that users experience in these networks, let alone how to fix&lt;br/&gt;them.  A critical first step towards improving our understanding of home&lt;br/&gt;networks is gathering data from homes.  Towards this end, we are&lt;br/&gt;developing a home network measurement infrastructure consisting of (1)&lt;br/&gt;customized routers deployed in homes and (2) a central data collection&lt;br/&gt;server.  We are deploying both the measurement infrastructure across&lt;br/&gt;hundreds of homes and collecting a corpus of active and passive&lt;br/&gt;measurements that will shed more light into home network performance and&lt;br/&gt;use.  Given the proliferation of network devices in the home and the&lt;br/&gt;general public's growing attention to the performance of access&lt;br/&gt;networks, we expect that the infrastructure that we deploy and the data&lt;br/&gt;that we gather from this infrastructure will play in important role in&lt;br/&gt;improving our collective understanding of how home networks are used and&lt;br/&gt;how well they perform.  We will disseminate our results through&lt;br/&gt;conference and journal publications, as well as talks with and&lt;br/&gt;presentations to researchers, policymakers, and practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to understand the performance and behavior of broadband access networks.  As part of the project, we developed many tools and open-source systems that are widely used and deployed around the world.  Our research informed the technical underpinnings of the FCC's Measuring Broadband America program, as well as fixed and mobile broadband measurement studies in other countries.  The project has both technical and policy objectives.  The technical objectives include developing and deploying methods to better understand network performance (and behavior) of access networks (specifically, home and cellular networks).  We are also instrumenting the edge of the network to understand user behavior (e.g., how users deploy and use home networks).  The specific policy objectives of the project include the following.    Providing an objective base for benchmarking broadband prices as an input into the public discussion around affordability and quality of service;    Developing methods to monitor performance on broadband data services that create transparency for users, regulators and operators;    Identifying competitive bottlenecks, and pricing and performance opacity; and    Contributing to policy formulation and the planning of regulatory interventions    BISmark: Custom Router Firmware for Measuring ISP and Home Network Performance. BISmark is custom router firmware that runs directly on a home user's router and performs both active and passive measurements. BISmark's active measurements characterize the performance that a user is achieving from their ISP: in particular, the measurements inform the user about the downstream and upstream throughput that they are receiving from their ISP, as well as the latency that the user is experiencing on the first hop between the home network and the ISP. The results from this work have become particularly timely, as our data was the first to reveal the persistent congestion between content providers and access ISPs that ultimately offered technical input for the FCC's Open Internet Order.  Network Dashboard: An Interface for Viewing and Accessing Data To allow users access to the performance measurements collected from BISMark, we have developed a portal that we call the Network Dashboard, that allows users to see the active measurement data that is collected from their devices. The site is currently accessible at http://networkdashboard.org/. At this site, users can plot various performance measurements performed from their home router over a range of time.

Peeking Behind the NAT:An Empirical Study of Home Networks. We present the first empirical study of home network availability, infrastructure, and usage, using data collected from home networks around the world. In each home, we deploy a router with custom firmware to collect information about the availability of home broadband network connectivity, the home network infrastructure (including the wireless connectivity in each home network and the number of devices connected to the network), and how people in each home network use the network. Downtime is more frequent and longer in developing countries&mdash;sometimes due to the network, and in other cases because users simply turn off their home router. We also find that some portions of the wireless spectrum are extremely crowded, that diurnal patterns are more pronounced during the week, and that most traffic in home networks is exchanged over a few connections to a small number of domains. Our study is both a preliminary view into many home networks and an illustration of how measurements from a home router can yield significant infor- mation about home networks.   uCap: The Design and Evaluation of a Data Cap Management Tool For the Home We...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
