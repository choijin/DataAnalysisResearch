<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This award will support the continuation of snow observations and technology development that began as SnowNet-I during the International Polar Year (IPY 2007-2009). The SnowNet-II observing effort is part of the NSF Arctic Observing Network (AON), which supports long-term, science-driven observing that enables research into understanding rapid environmental system change in the Arctic. AON is a component of the broader Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH). SnowNet-II aims to develop snow measurement technologies and data sets that will enable others to answer critical questions concerning the changing Arctic. For example, is winter precipitation increasing, and how is snow cover changing? The development of new technologies for snow, basically the invention of snow-measuring gadgets, also has inherent intellectual value. SnowNet-II will operate at (i) Barrow and Imnavait on the North Slope of Alaska, and, (ii) in a collaboration with Environment Canada, at a site at Trail Valley Creek, Yukon. Instruments to be operated at each site include a solid-state snow water equivalent sensor, a rotating sonic snow depth sounder and a load cell-based precipitation gauge. In addition, the measurements at the Barrow and Imnavait sites will be supplemented and extended geographically by extended snow courses on the order of tens of kilometers in length and by airborne lidar surveys. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: SnowNet-II will rectify deficiencies in the Arctic Observing Network and by so doing the network should be better positioned to provide data that can answer key questions about Arctic change. SnowNet data are freely and openly available to the broader scientific community at CADIS (Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service), the AON data repository. SnowNet includes international collaboration with Environment Canada scientists. During fieldwork on the North Slope of Alaska, the SnowNet team will continue its long-standing involvement in education and outreach to indigenous people and northern residents by visiting schools in Barrow, Atqasuk and Nuiqsut.</AbstractNarration>
