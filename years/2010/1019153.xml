<AbstractNarration>This award will support student and postdoc participation at the 2010 Gordon Research Conferences (GRC) on Correlated Electron Systems to be held at the Mount Holyoke College, MA, June 13-18. The subject is developing rapidly, driven both by high-resolution and  novel measurement techniques and remarkable recent theoretical developments. The conference consists of a broad swath of emerging ideas such as topological insulators, non-Abelian statistics and quantum computation, novel superconductors, and graphene amongst other topics. It is very likely that new technologies will emerge from these ideas and it is important that students and postdocs are well versed in these ideas to make important contributions to the society in the future. The conference will provide a unique opportunity for students and postdocs to further their careers by not only engaging in leading edge science, but also an opportunity for them to network with the leaders and their peers in the field. The guiding principle of a GRC is unique because of its emphasis in presentation of new, unpublished work and the free, unhampered discussion that follows, consistent with its "off the record" policy. Every effort is being made to involve a diverse group of participants and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

The Conference was well-attended with 168 participants (attendees list attached). The attendees represented the spectrum of endeavor in this field coming from academia, industry, and government laboratories, both U.S. and foreign scientists, senior researchers, young investigators, and students.

In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.  Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
