<AbstractNarration>This is a travel grant for research visits of Professor Tribikram Kundu, University of Arizona, to Professor Nobuo Takedas' laboratory at the University of Tokyo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of these visits is to initiate a collaborative research between these two institutes on the detection of impact induced barely visible impact damage in composite laminate panels by combined piezoelectric and wave visualization technique. It requires successful completion of two tasks - 1) predicting the impact location and 2) damage assessment near the impact region. First, under task 1 the approximate location of impact needs to be predicted by applying appropriate optimization technique and then under task 2 the damage can be assessed in the impact region by the non-contact laser induced Lamb wave technique.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When a critical structure such as an airplane, helicopter, space shuttle or nuclear power plant is hit by a foreign object, the region near the point of impact can be damaged.  To avoid catastrophic failure of critical structures the damaged region needs to be inspected and repaired if needed, as soon as possible.  Therefore, the structure must be monitored continuously day and night, and the point of impact needs to be identified automatically, without any need of human intervention.  This process is known as the acoustic source localization or ASL.  ASL is also important for identifying the point of crack initiation and propagation.  Moving cracks and newly formed cracks generate acoustic waves. Localizing the source of the generated acoustic waves the crack position can be identified.  In this research project efforts were made to develop an efficient technique for ASL in anisotropic composite plates &ndash; whose properties are different in different directions. Conventional ASL techniques available in the literature work well for isotropic plates whose properties are same in all directions.  However, those techniques fail for anisotropic structures.  A new technique that can predict the acoustic source point in an anisotropic plate even when the plate properties are not known has been developed under this project.  The intellectual merit of this activity is in the mathematical analysis associated with developing this new technique.  The proposed technique has been experimentally verified at the University of Tokyo for both isotropic metal plates and anisotropic composite plates and shells.  The principal investigator travelled to the University of Tokyo to conduct the experimental investigation in collaboration with the Japanese scientists.  The research results from this investigation have been published in scientific journals and presented in international scientific conferences.  The proposed new technique can be followed for developing algorithms to localize other types of source &ndash; such as electromagnetic source and heat source.  Thus this research has application potential in other fields of science and engineering as well. This specific investigation is important for continuous monitoring of the health of critical structures and saving human life by preventing catastrophic failures of such structures.
