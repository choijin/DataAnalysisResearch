<AbstractNarration>The proposal is motivated by the need to introduce probabilistic concepts for sensing and managing changing electric energy systems. The very nature of many new distributed resources, including responsive demand, is highly variable and hard to predict. Moreover, the system may be prone to cyber-security threats which represent low-probability high-impact events. This challenges the fundamental assumptions underlying today?s operations and planning which are by and large deterministic. In particular, a holistic stochastic formulation is needed to state the problem of sensing and communications as an integral part of supply/demand dispatch during normal conditions as well as during failures. Failures could be caused by either forced outages or intended attacks on portions of the system. The probabilities of events threatening the integrity of the system and the ability to balance supply and demand are generally dependent on system conditions and are not determined once for good. In order to begin to fill this gap, it is proposed in this project to view the changing electric power grid as an electric network with many highly variable distributed resources, micro-solar and micro-wind plants, in particular. Very many distributed loads are also varying and must be monitored; moreover, they are also responsive to the sensed and communicated information. The key idea in this proposal is to represent such future grid as a factor graph. Once this is done, it becomes possible to draw on formal communications theory methods to compute the probabilities of portions of the system being in certain states of interest. This, in turn, creates the basis for an affordable sensors and communications architecture design in support of novel operating practices. It is key to bring probabilistic reasoning into supply and demand balancing because without such proactive tracking of system state the worst-case design approach to ensuring reliable services becomes unacceptably inefficient, and, at the same time, does not provide information about the likelihood of the worst-case service scenario. The approach proposed in this project brings together the probability estimates based on the sensed and communicated information. These estimates are then used to introduce a self-dispatch by different distributed resources with minimal coordination by the system operators, as already proposed by one of the co-PIs for balancing supply and demand during normal conditions. In collaboration with the communications and security co-PIs on this project, the self-dispatch concept will be further generalized to probabilistically account for equipment failures. These failures could be either forced equipment outages, or initiated by cyber attacks on the power grid. The objective is to provide proof-of-concept illustrations of probabilistic self-dispatch facilitated by the factor-graph-enabled probability estimates about the severity of system state. The effects of sensors and communications on the overall performance will be illustrated using the grid of the Hawaiian island of Oahu as the experimental example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The fundamental intellectual novelty in this proposal is the penetration of probabilistic reasoning into the field of power-grid monitoring and control. The project will apply factor-graph and secure-belief-propagation formalisms to pave the way towards distributed monitoring, assessment, safe-guarding, control and risk management in power grids ? the goal being a proof-of-concept illustration of probabilistic self-dispatch on a portion of the power grid of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The research activities in this project will lead to methods for efficient utilization of scattered renewable energy resources. This will contribute to the accelerated pace of transformation towards a clean/renewable energy economy. The co-PIs will continue to be engaged in integrating the participation of under-represented groups in engineering through research experience programs for undergraduates under the umbrella of the Native Hawaiian Science and Engineering Mentorship Program (NHSEMP).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In order to achieve a more sustainable energy future, the electricity industry has been increasing the use of distributed energy resources, intermittent renewable energy sources, and demand side technologies in the electricity grid. This increased penetration of non-conventional resources is likely to change the generation and demand patterns in the electricity grid and increase the level of variability and uncertainty associated with these patterns. In order to handle these changes in the electricity grid, the current infrastructure needs to be enhanced to allow for a greater level of operational flexibility in the grid. This can be achieved by what is known as a "Smart Grid". A Smart Grid is an electricity grid that is embedded with intelligent control, communication, and sensing technologies in order to provide more operational flexibility and increase efficiency in the grid.  In the area of electricity transmission, more flexibility can be embedded through the use of Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Devices (FACTS). However, even though these technologies have existed for some time, the current regulatory and market framework for the transmission sector is not equipped to provide the appropriate incentives to encourage optimal investment and operational behaviors in both conventional and intelligent transmission technologies. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop an optimal investment model for a smart transmission system that accounts for both conventional and novel transmission technology.  This model is used to evaluate and quantify the value of operational flexibility in the transmission sector and also to develop regulatory and market policy to encourage optimal behaviors among stakeholders in the electric transmission sector.  The results of this project demonstrate that flexible transmission devices can reduce the need for investments in new line capacity and lower the overall operational and investment costs in the system. However, this can only be done if well designed regulatory and market policy is in place to encourage optimal investment behaviors. Several policy recommendations were made as a result of this study:  The selection process for transmission investment options needs to be broadened to account for the broader patterns of congestion in the electricity grid in order to account for the value of flexible devices in the system. The transmission pricing and cost recovery framework needs to be broadened to account for the value of flexible electrical parameters in the system in order to fully account for the value of control devices in the system.  The notion of congestion needs to be broadened in considering transmission investments in power flow control devices to improve market efficiency.  Power system operation framework has a significant impact on investment efficiency. We need to rethink our power system operational framework to better account for the value of flexibility. For example, the preventive N-1 security constrained economic dispatch is highly inefficient and hides the value of flexibility in the system. We need to develop policy and market mechanisms to enable increased participation of loads in electricity markets to fully account for the value of flexibility. Well-designed long-term market that allows for information and risk sharing among stakeholders is needed to encourage efficient long-term investment decision.   Overall, this project demonstrates that more work needs to be done to develop the analytical framework, regulatory processes, and computational tools required to encourage optimal investment behaviors in the future smart electric transmission system. Such analytical, regulatory, and computational tools should be designed to account for the value of flexibility in the transmission grid in order to capture the full value of the technologies under consideration.
