<AbstractNarration>The explosion of the oil rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010 has released ~3 million barrels of crude oil to the Gulf as of mid-June (The Economist, 2010). This oil has a range of deleterious effects on the aquatic and coastal ecosystems of the Gulf. One such effect may include alteration of biogeochemical cycling of heavy metals in the coastal wetlands. Cycling of mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) both depend on microbial activity, particularly iron and sulfate reduction, which may be promoted by the influx of organic matter (i.e. oil). Coastal wetlands are particularly susceptible to heavy metal contamination and may therefore be especially vulnerable to altered heavy metal cycling as a result of the oil spill. This project would examine solids and pore waters from sediment cores in Weeks Bay, Alabama for changes in microbial activity, arsenic concentration and speciation, and mercury concentration and speciation over the next eight to twelve months.&lt;br/&gt;Results will be of broad interest to the fields of bioremediation, biogeochemistry, geomicrobiology, and environmental health. During the progress of the study, PIs will be cooperating with local scientists and government officials, and plan on presenting technical seminars and workshops in the Alabama Gulf shore region.  Because ocean oil spills are a common environmental problem worldwide, the data gathered in the research should benefit many other affected regions. Research will expose students from Alabama to state of the art methods and to a timely research topic. The Weeks Bay field site will serve as an outdoor laboratory for Auburn University Water Education for Alabama Black Belt (WET) outreach activities and existing courses.</AbstractNarration>

Crude oils often contain elevated levels (up to hundreds of mg/kg) of trace metals due to chemical complexation among organic compounds and metals.   At Louisiana heavily oiled sites (e.g., Bay Jimmy, Bayou Dulac, Bay Batiste) elevated levels of metals and total organic carbon extend beyond shallow (post-industrial) profiles to greater depths (down to 30 cm), suggesting that oil and various associated metals might have spread at all levels of the water column and invaded through the deeper sections of marshes sediments.  Geochemical analyses of pore-waters show very high reduced sulfur levels (up to 80 mg/kg) but fairly low ferrous iron concentrations (&lt; 0.02 mg/L) in heavily oiled sediments.
