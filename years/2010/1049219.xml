<AbstractNarration>This project supports a team of researchers in a major research thrust in decadal climate prediction entitled "Investigating Decadal Climate Predictability and Climate Impacts (IDCPI) on the Western US."  The IDCPI is an interdisciplinary effort to use instrumental records of climate and paleoclimate data to assess the skill level of Earth System Models (EaSM) to forecast decadal climate variability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally, the research team will focus on the region of the western Unites States because both historic and prehistoric records document recurrent decadal-scale hydroclimate variability, including repeated drought, which has been attributed to Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the team will use models, in combination with an isotope "fingerprinting" methodology, to: 1) assess the ability of Earth System models (global and regional models) to accurately simulate the atmospheric response to SST forcing; 2) retrospectively investigate whether models can predict drought in advance and estimate how long the events will persist; 3) assess whether a future drought in the western U.S. is currently predictable with existing models; and 4) develop future hydrologic predictions with uncertainty estimates for the western U.S. where models exhibit skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to improve the reliability of regional climate predictions in the southwest Unites States.  In doing so, the research would be of importance to resource managers and policy makers.  The project also provides a unique cohort approach to the training and mentoring of post doctoral scholars associated with the collaborating institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was to deepen our understanding of the drivers of longterm droughts in the Southwestern United States and to develop a computer-based multi-year prediction system for hydroclimate variability in this region.  The key results of this project can be summarized as follows  - The large-scale sea-surface temperature gradient between tropical Atlantic and Pacific is an important driver for decadal changes in precipitation, soil moisture and wild fire frequency in the Southwestern United States. It also contributed to the generation of recent equatorial Pacific trade wind trends, accelerated sea level rise in the Western tropical Pacific and the Global Warming Hiatus.  - Tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature changes played a major role in driving recent decadal anomalies in Pacific climate.  - The Atlantic/Pacific sea surface temperature gradient and corresponding sea level pressure anomalies have a potential predictability of up to 3 years. This is a useful time frame for stake-holders and policymakers to respond and take pro-active and adaption measures.  - Using NCARÆs Community Earth System model and global ocean temperature and salinity data assimilation a new multi-year climate prediction system was developed and tested. The prediction model successfully hindcasts past hydroclimate anomalies in the Southwestern US with up to 3 years lead time.  - Initialized in 2015, the prediction model predicted an overall weakening of the drought in California for the water year 2015, in agreement with the observations and the expected 2015/2016 El Ni&ntilde;o impact.  - The interaction between strong El Ni&ntilde;o events and the seasonal cycle leads to a very predictable development of wind, sea level pressure, precipitation and ocean circulation and sea level anomalies. A new mathematical framework to describe these interactions in terms of "Combination Modes" has been developed.  - Using a combination of paleo-proxy records we developed a new reconstruction of the variance of the El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, for the past 600 years. According the statistical analysis of this reconstruction, the last 40 years in ENSO variance exceeded any previous period.
