<AbstractNarration>Funds from this grant will be used to support projects in nucleon structure and in tests of fundamental symmetries.  Two specific projects will be supported. One is the development of a sensitive, segmented detector for fast neutrons, using the method of capture-gated spectroscopy where incident neutrons are slowed through scattering in a plastic scintillator and then captured in He-3 proportional counters.  The project will provide information about the neutron flux and energy distributions for sensitive underground experiments and further the technology for neutron detector for Homeland Security applications, and will result in a Ph.D. thesis for a Maryland graduate student. The second project is a measure of antiquark distributions in nucleons and nuclei at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) using the "Drell-Yan" process of muon pair production from proton-proton and proton-deuteron collisions. This grant supports a postdoctoral researcher who is leading efforts in target systems, data acquisition and data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this group's research is through outstanding research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students.  In the neutron project, the additional broader impact is further development of neutron detection technology for fundamental physics experiments and for Homeland Security. Students are exposed to nuclear physics concepts and provided with hands-on experience developing hardware.  They can make significant contributions to the experiments, and have the opportunity to visit and participate in programs at major national laboratories, in this case FNAL and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Experiment E906/Sequest at Fermilab  is a measure of antiquark distributions in the proton using the Drell-Yan process.  The non-perturbative nature of the quark-gluon interactions that account for the internal structure of the proton continues to pose a challenge to understanding the nature and underlying mechanisms governing the quark-gluon sea.  A series of early experiments showed an asymmetry in the abundance of up and down quarks, strongly suggesting that the perturbative picture of gluons splitting into quark-antiquark pairs is insufficient and a more collective type of behavior accounts for the protonÃ†s internal structure.  The Drell-Yan process, in which quarks/antiquarks in the beam (of protons) and target (of protons or deuterons) annihilate to form muon pairs, is an ideal mechanism to study the role of antiquarks in the nucleon over a wide range of energies.  The University of Maryland group had responsibilities related to the cryogenic hydrogen and deuterium targets and for the data acquisition systems. Production data collection began in December 2013. Assistant Research Scientist Kaz Nakahara had a major role in the development and maintenance of the cryogenic target system and in the development of the data acquisition system.  Postdoctoral researcher Yen-Chu Chen assumed these responsibilities, along with other contributions, during this most recent grant period.  Preliminary analysis is coming to completion and collaboration members will be presenting preliminary data at the APS Division of Nuclear Physics meeting in Vancouver, BC in Fall 2016 as well as other conference venues.
