<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Ceramics in the perovskite family have useful properties and are encountered in applications including electroceramics, superconductors, refractories, catalysts, magnetoresistors, spintronics, and proton conductors.  Understanding the way crystal defects, which are very common in all engineering ceramics, affect structure and thereby properties is of great importance to both science and industry.  Models which aid the prediction of structure and, by extension, properties are extremely useful in both the understanding and designing of materials with engineered properties without expensive trial and error, yet existing theoretical models are inadequate to describe such ceramics.  Their dual approach to this problem involves both an experimental component, using a well-chosen representative perovskite system, plus a theoretical computational component.  This combined approach may result in much higher quality functional ceramics, and the impact on the $350-billion cellular telecommunications industry alone could include more efficient filters leading eventually to higher data rates for multimedia applications and ultimately a reduction in the overall number of cellular masts required.  Outreach to the greater community will occur via the Jason Project, Family Engineering Day, the annual "BSU Day with the Legislators", the UIUC Minority Outreach and Retention Program, UIUC Engineering Open House, and "Project Lead the Way" for secondary teachers.  In addition, a web site created and maintained by project participants will become a useful tool for teaching aspects of solid-state chemistry as well as materials science and technology; therefore, funding continues to support their multi-faceted and highly successful outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Models which aid the prediction of structure and, by extension, properties are extremely useful in both the understanding and designing of materials with engineered properties without expensive trial and error, yet existing theoretical models are inadequate to describe such ceramics.  Their experimental approach using a well-chosen representative perovskite system, on the other hand, overcomes these shortcomings and has already been successfully demonstrated.  In this project, several complex ceramic compositions are being synthesized via an advanced chemical processing method, the resulting crystal structures analyzed, and properties measured in order to complete a predictive structural model.  Computational structural models are simultaneously being developed to verify and complement the empirically derived ones, adding an additional dimension of understanding to the modeling of structure and phase transitions.  The predictive models could then be used to find new perovskites with new and interesting properties.  The educational impact of the project is strong and varied. The international exposure gained by the students involved, who will be trained in cutting-edge characterization techniques including neutron diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, will be formative and extremely valuable for their future careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Perovskite compounds (Fig. 1) are ubiquitous and are at the heart of multi-billion-dollar industries, so improving the predictability of their structure (and thereby  properties) could aid size reduction, speed, cost, and quality of a  variety of devices.  Several previous models have been proposed to predict the structure/stability of perovskite phases; however, none are suited to realistic, defective structures used in actual devices.  Researchers at Boise State (Fig. 2) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have created a simple mathematical model for the effective cubic unit-cell size of defect-containing perovskites, based solely on easily available ionic radii data, which yields results accurate to within 0.15% (Fig. 3). This model reveals both an effective bond deformation as well as the effective size of vacancies (defects in which an ion has been removed from the crystal) in various perovskites, as shown in Fig. 4.  Our simple empirical model also allows us to quantify the effects of cation ordering (the non-random distribution of ions on crystallographically distinct sites) and potentially gauge the degree of such order even when it exists only on a nanoscale and so is undetectable via routine techniques like x-ray diffraction.  For example, (Na0.5La0.5)TiO3 exhibits no long-range Na-La ordering, but electron diffraction (Fig. 5) shows evidence of short-range order, the degree of which decreases as the Na:La ratio increasingly deviates from the ideal 1:1, exactly as our model predicts.  Another effect which can be quantified is the so-called second-order Jahn-Teller distortion, which is exhibited by some cations with certain electron coonfigurations and results in the formation of a stereoactive "lone pair" of electrons.  These distortions result in antiparallel (therefore polar) ionic  displacements of cation and anion sublattices and typically yield  piezoelectric or ferroelectric behavior exploited in numerous devices, e.g., nonvolatile memory (NVRAM).  With further development, our model also has the potential to predict non-cubic distortions, that is, distortions of the perovskite away from the ideal cubic form.  It can already be used in some tetragonally distorted cases.  With this capability, the model could be used to predict the composition or temperature of structural phase transitions - a functionality beyond the abilities of more conventional, more parameterized, and much more numerically-intensive theoretical modeling techniques.  The project has involved a total of six graduate students and 11 undergraduates.  The group at Boise State presented their work each year at both the undergraduate research conference (Fig. 6) as well as at the STEM Exploration Day (a free event a free event for all ages  with a wide variety of engaging activities designed for K-12 students  and their families), where all visitors to our lab both learn about materials research and discover new applications of science in 21st century careers.
