<AbstractNarration>John H.Willis         IOS - 1024966&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LiT: Genomic analysis of life-history adaptation to variation in seasonal water availability in Mimulus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global warming trends indicate that many geographic regions are experiencing shorter, milder winters and longer, hotter summers.  Due to the accelerated onset of summer drought in western North America, local plant species reliant on snowmelt and ephemeral water supplies will experience strong selection to grow and reproduce earlier. The evolutionary response of plant species to continued changes in seasonal soil moisture availability will likely involve earlier flowering and flowering under shorter day lengths in order to escape periods of prolonged drought. Tremendous genetic variation in day length sensitivity and flowering time was recently discovered in the ecological genomic model system Mimulus guttatus and its closely related wildflower species. This adaptive variation is associated with local environmental differences in the onset of drought, and it likely represents the kinds of genetic changes that could occur in response to continued climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses powerful genome mapping approaches and experiments in natural habitats to identify key genes involved in variation in seasonal timing of flowering and drought escape. The investigators will engage high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in workshops and research projects. Additionally, valuable collections of seed stocks and genome data will be made available to the entire scientific community. The seed collections will be available for evolutionary studies for up to fifty years from now. This will allow them to be compared to future samples from the same populations and to identify genes involved in future climate change adaptations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research supported by grant 1024966 addressed the extent to which wild plant populations contain sufficient genetic variation in flowering time and in their transition to flowering in response to seasonal environmental cues such as photoperiod (daylength). Global warming trends reveal that much of the world is experiencing shorter, milder winters and longer, hotter summers. In western North America, less winter precipitation is falling as snow, and snow pack is melting earlier in the spring, substantially reducing water available to terrestrial ecosystems during the dry summer months. The west can expect both earlier spring warming andearlier onset of dry summer conditions. Such rapidly changing soil moisture patterns are likely to impose strong natural selection for earlier growth and reproduction on plant species reliant on spring rains and melting snow.  If plants are to adapt to these challenges, they must genetically shift their life history schedules earlier in the season. How might plants, like spring-flowering annual forms of M. guttatus and its relatives that are acutely sensitive "indicator species" of wet soils, adapt to the earlier onset of spring warming and summer drought predicted for the West?  The primary evolutionary response of such drought-intolerant annual species is likely to involve shifts to earlier spring flowering under shorter photoperiods. Annual M. guttatus, like many spring-flowering species, typically requires the long photoperiods of late spring to flower. However, we recently discovered, in growth chamber experiments, substantial genetic variation in flowering traits in the species complex. Closely related species endemic to soils with low water holding capacity (M. nudatus on serpentine soils, and  M. laciniatus on granite outcrops - as noted in our 1st annual report we have discontinued work on M. cupriphilus on copper mines because it is extensively admixed with sympatric M. guttatus) flower rapidly and under shorter photoperiods than nearby, interfertile annual M. guttatus populations inhabiting wetter soils. We also discovered that annual high altitude populations of M. guttatus and M. laciniatus require longer photoperiods to flower (and flower more slowly under long photoperiods) than low elevation populations. These genetic differences in flowering are likely to be locally adaptive.  We argue that the profound differences in flowering among annual M. guttatus populations and close relatives inhabiting contrasting seasonal soil moisture regimes are likely to mirror the types of genetic changes expected to occur within populations as they adapt to the changing climates in the West. We are currently working on three interrelated projects that aim to discover the genetic underpinnings and ecological significance of this current genetic divergence in flowering time and photoperiod responses, so that we may better grasp the mechanisms and limitations of future plant adaptation to climate change.  We examined the flowering behavior of dozens of populations of M. guttatus and closely related species native to different latitutes, altitudes, and seasonal soil moisture regiems in controled experiments in the greenhouse, growth chambers with different photoperiods, and in common garden experiments in the field. We found tremendous genetic differences among these populations, with populations from low latitudes, altitudes, and earlier onset of summer drought displaying more rapid flowering in long days, and transitions to flowering under shorter photoperiods. These broad patterns strongly suggest extensive fine-tuned local adaptation via flowering time and critical photoperiod.  In order to identify genetic loci that contribute to this adaptive diversity, and to see whether similar or different loci were responsible for this variation throughout the geographic range, we conducted high resolution genome mapping studiesin crosses between 8 pairs of populations with divergent flowering times.
