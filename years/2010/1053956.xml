<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to enable design for integrity in Shape-Shifting Surfaces (SSSs), i.e., surfaces which retain their effectiveness as a physical barrier while undergoing changes in shape. These shape changes could be motions (e.g., expanding, shrinking, twisting, encircling, wiggling, swallowing or constricting), which would make the surface more effective at performing its function. The SSSs are a new invention, and are composed of tiled arrays of polygonal cells, each cell consisting of flexures attached to overlapping thin plates or shells. The research will develop techniques for using these surfaces to achieve a specified shape shift, for mechanized motion of the surface, and for sensing the loads that are applied to the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will enable engineers to create more dynamic, responsive surfaces. In the short term, demonstration of this technology will be achieved in recreational and commercial applications, such as a foldable kayak, a weight-measuring floor, and an SSS-based robot. In the long term, devices with biomedical or military significance, such as artificial heart muscles and flexible body armor, will be pursued. Teaching innovation will be achieved through projects that reach under-graduate and graduate engineers and through thought-provoking educational and recreational products that target both K-6 students specifically, and a wider audience in the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In April 2010, the Deepwater Horizon undersea oil well began to spew millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, and for a period of months, despite worldwide concern, no one seemed capable of stopping or containing the massive flow. Partially in response to this disaster, I initiated a research initiative on &ldquo;The Design for Integrity in Shape-Shifting Surfaces&rdquo;. The design intent of the research is to develop design methods and practical prototypes which address the problem of having mobile, reconfigurable surfaces of significant strength which retain their effectiveness as physical barriers while undergoing changes in shape. We developed several small initial prototypes which had the capability to change their shape based on two components: a flexible guiding mechanism, and a rigid shield. Using this approach, we were able to demonstrate (and patent) prototypes for a Shape-Shifting Surface (as seen in Figures 1-4). The flexure-shield approach enabled us to develop flexible surfaces which had line-of-sight integrity, or integrity against assaults which travel in a straight line (such as light, projectiles, etc.) These designs did not have fluid integrity (the ability to prevent fluid flows) due to the gaps between shield layers. To remedy this, we also investigated alternative designs which consisted of a shape-morphing skeleton (or space frame) and a flexible, water-proof skin. We had a great deal of success developing techniques to morph to the skeleton (Figures 5-6), and made some progress on the flexible skin approach. While these techniques and prototypes are still some years from commercialization, they do show promise for creating objects that are both flexible (able to move) and strong (able to resist assaults without breaking).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/23/2018<br>      Modified by: Craig&nbsp;P&nbsp;Lusk</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1053956/1053956_10073044_1516729059174_ShapeShiftingSurfaceatrest--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1053956/1053956_10073044_1516729059174_ShapeShiftingSurfaceatrest--rgov-800width.jpg" title="A Shape-Shifting Surface at rest"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1053956/1053956_10073044_1516729059174_ShapeShiftingSurfaceatrest--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A Shape-Shifting Surface at rest"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A square Shape-Shifting Surface unit cell.
