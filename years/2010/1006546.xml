<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract: Soft materials are easily deformed, and their fundamental properties are often defined by their susceptibility to deformation.  Deformation can occur on many length scales, defining the unique properties of a soft material. The proposed research is centered on investigation of soft materials where the basic components of the material are themselves deformable. For example, dispersions of microgel particles which can be deformed by compression, squeezing the fluid out of the particles will be probed to explore new dynamic behavior and to investigate possible crystallization. The unusual properties of biomolecular networks, which exhibit history-dependent mechanics resulting from stretching of the filaments due to deformation; will be investigated with a combination of imaging and rheology. New soft materials will be made using the exquisite precision of microfluidics, and methods to scale up the production to yield useful quantities of material will be developed. The research will be carried out in a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary environment that provides high quality training for the next generation of scientists and engineers that will provide the manpower for our nation's economic competitiveness.  Much of the work will be done in collaboration with industry, and jobs will continue to be created by the success of the start-up companies that are created with the help of the support from the NSF.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract: Soft materials are those that are very easily deformed by small forces.  They are typically solids, but they can change in shape or even flow when small forces are applied.  For example, a foam such as shaving cream, is made from water and air; however, mixing a liquid and a gas together produces a material that is a solid.  But, it is a weak solid, that can also easily flow as happens, for example, when it is used for its intended purpose of helping to lubricate a razor blade.  Thus, like all soft materials, both it solid-like and its fluid-like properties are important.  This research will develop new methods to explore such materials, and will investigate the properties of these new materials.  The results of the research will lead to new, fundamental understanding of the materials.  This understanding will be applied to help learn about important biological materials, such as that which forms the cartilage so essential in the functioning of our knees.  In addition, new materials will be created that have technological uses for applications including drug delivery or protection of active ingredients in foods and person care products.  The research will be carried out in collaboration with industry, and will help train the next generation of scientists and engineers that will power the economic competitiveness of our nation.  In addition, the technology developed will continue to form the basis of start-up companies, that are already providing new high-quality jobs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work performed with NSF support focused on four major topics.  First, suspensions of solid particles, or colloids, were studied and the properties of gel structures, formed by the colloids were investigated to determine their stability.  The same type of gel network is often used in consumer products, and collapse of the gel can cause phase separation within the product, leading to spoilage; these results help establish a means of understanding the origin of this collapse.  Second, the behavior of cells grown on substrates was investigated and a remarkable analogy was discovered between collective motion of a nearly complete layer of cells on a surface, and a molecular system undergoing a glass transition.  This analogy provides insight in collective properties of cells as would occur, for example, in the healing of a wound.  Third, a new class of emulsions, consisting of drops within drops within drops, was produced using microfluidic devices.  These materials have potential for encapsulating and preserving active ingredients, protecting them from harsh environments.  They can therefore find numerous technological uses, and the IP on their production has been licensed by both large companies and small companies.  One of the small companies is a start-up that is based on the technologies developed with NSF support, and produces products that are sold to the cosmetics industry.  This is an international company, whose headquarters are in Paris, and whose sales go to cosmetic companies in the US, as well as in Asia and Europe.  Other drop-based microfluidic work established the viability of the techniques for very high-throughput screening, where drops are made at tens of kilohertz.  Each drop contains a volume of about 1 pL, and each drop is used as a microreactor in the screen.  The group developed many new components that enable precise manipulation of these drops, enabling them to be used for the high-throughput screening.  These enable many new classes of experiments to be performed, and several different biology groups are now collaborating to apply these techniques.  The research had much broader impact.  The main function of the group is to train students and post docs to produce the next generation of scientific leaders.  A total of 10 students and 21 post docs left the group for new positions during the period.  Not all were supported by this grant, but this support was essential to provide the research infrastructure and basic funding for many of the projects that these alumni worked on.  In addition, three new start-up companies were formed during this period, each now providing high quality jobs to benefit our NationÆs economy.  In fact, there are total of about 150 new jobs that have been created from start-up companies formed with IP produced with NSF support.   The PI also continued his development, with his colleague, Michael Brenner, of a popular science course aimed and non-scientists that uses cooking as a way to motivate learning.  This has become a very popular course at Harvard, and, so share the course with a broader audience, it was also launched as an online version.  It had over 80,000 people sign up for it.  This course has a curriculum that is essentially a course in soft matter physics.  This course provides an excellent means of exciting a very broad audience in the science that was supported by this grant.
