<AbstractNarration>The NAACL HLT conference is the major international conference in North America in the field of natural language processing. This project is to subsidize travel, conference, and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the NAACL HLT Student Research Workshop which will be held during the conference June 1-6, 2010 in Los Angeles, California. The workshop consists of two tracks: full paper presentations and poster presentations. All selected work has only student primary authors. The full paper sessions are composed of paper presentations followed by a discussion panel led by respected researchers in the field. The workshop is organized and run by students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Student Research Workshop provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of natural language processing researchers to enter the computational linguistics community. It allows the best students in the field to take their first important step toward becoming professional computational linguists by receiving critical feedback on their work from external experts, and by making contacts with other students and senior researchers in their field. The students who are involved in running and selecting papers for the workshop also gain valuable opportunities for professional growth and interaction with the researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference. The workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a skilled and diverse computational linguistics and natural language processing research community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Student Research Workshop in Computational Linguistics took place during the NAACL HLT conference (June 2010) in Los Angeles, California.  NAACL HLT is a conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), the primary international organization in the field of natural language processing and language engineering. While the ACL's annual conference is the major international conference in this field, the NAACL meeting (organized by the North American Chapter of the ACL) is the main conference in North America.  The Student Research Workshop provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of natural language processing researchers to enter the computational linguistics community. It allows the best students in the field to take their first important step towards becoming professional computational linguists by receiving critical feedback on their work from experts outside of their dissertation committee, and by making contacts with other students and senior researchers in their field. The students who are involved in running and reviewing for the workshop also gain valuable opportunities for professional growth via interaction with both the workshop faculty mentors and the researchers on the committees of the main conference.  The workshop was organized and run by 3 graduate student co-chairs, supervised by 2 faculty mentors.  20 paper submissions were received, with 14 accepted posters/presentations representing 5 countries.  The workshop consisted of two types of sessions (oral presentation and poster presentation), both of which were scheduled during the main conference.  The oral presentations were held in two sessions on the first day, separated by a lunch (for student and faculty organizers, student authors, and faculty panelists) to provide social and networking opportunities.  Each paper presentation was followed by a panel discussion led by two respected researchers, focusing on in depth research feedback and suggestions for future directions.  The posters were presented at the main conference's evening Poster and Demo session. Students with oral presentations were invited to participate in the poster session.  All conference participants were invited to attend and participate in the workshop.  The workshop was well-attended; many non-presenting students found it useful to observe their peers' presentations and to participate in the ensuing discussions.  The workshop encourages a spirit of collaborative research, and builds a supportive environment for a new generation of computational linguists.  The workshop contributes to the development of a skilled and diverse workforce, helping to produce a pool of researchers with the scientific knowledge for computational linguistics.
