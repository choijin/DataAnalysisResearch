<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and the Chemistry Division, Bruce Bowler and colleagues Charles Thompson, Michele McGuirl, Klara Briknarova and Stephen Sprang from University of Montana will acquire a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.  The acquisition is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study that will impact proteomics research on: synaptic vesicles, cellular targets of organophosphate insecticides, the replication/transcription complex of arenaviruses, and lipidated virulence factors.  It will be used for protein biochemistry research investigating: fundamental aspects of protein dynamics related to G-protein activation, protein aggregation specific to the pathology of amyloids/prion proteins, the physiologically-important aggregation of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin, the catalytic mechanisms of enzymes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis, and engineered thermophilic enzymes for use in biofuel production.  It will also be used to characterize new chemically-modified nanoparticles for metal-sensing applications, and polyketide antibiotics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometers (MS) are used to identify the chemical composition of a sample by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer.  Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) is a technique for preparing the sample to be ionized by a laser before injection into the mass spectrometer.  The time of flight (TOF) mass analyzer has high sensitivity and mass accuracy to assist the analyses and interpretation of the resultant data.  This open access instrument will be available for training students in several departments in the use of this analytical tool. It will be used by undergraduate students in research and in laboratory instruction courses and in outreach to Native American students in tribal colleges and in high schools on or near reservations in Montana.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project allowed purchase of a state-of-the-art Bruker microflex LRF MALDI-ToF mass spectrometer which replaced an obsolete Applied BioSystems Voyager DE MALDI-ToF mass spectrometer which was a the end of its usable lifetime. The new Bruker instrument is a turn-key instrument that allows easy acquisition of mass spectral data for users across a broad range of skill levels. Its acquisition was critical to maintaining mass spectrometry facilities at the University of Montana.  The Bruker microflex LRF MALDI-ToF mass spectrometer has been used in research projects in nine laboratories at the University of Montana involved in a broad range of chemical and biochemical research. Projects impacted by acquisition of this mass spectrometer include:  1. Studies on the intrinsic conformational biases of denatured proteins that allow them to achieve their functional three-dimensional shapes.  2. Studies on structural factors that control access to alternate conformers of cytochrome c that are related to its function in programmed cell death (apoptosis).       3. Work on the structural elements of the extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin, which cause to aggregate.  4. Studies on the infectivity of arenaviruses.  5.

Development of peptide inhibitors of G proteins that can be used to manipulate changes in metabolism related to disease.  7. Analysis of diblock polymers that will be used in electrokinetic chromatography for the rapid and efficient separation of chemical mixtures.  8. Studies on the mechanism of the enzyme,  indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, an important enzyme in the breakdown of the amino acid, tryptophan. Understanding of this biochemical process has potential implications for understanding the progression of cancer.
