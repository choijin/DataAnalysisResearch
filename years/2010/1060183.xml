<AbstractNarration>The University of North Dakota is using environmental awareness to recruit and retain academically talented and financial-needy students to major in biology, chemistry, mathematics or environmental geography.  The teaching of environmental science "in context" is being employed to provide engaging and meaningful learning experiences as students progress toward degree attainment and career goals. To achieve the recruitment objectives, 16 students, in two cohorts, are being awarded scholarships with priority given to American Indian students.  To help ensure the retention and progress of these students, the scholarship program also places a premium on intensive advising and student engagement activities, of which participation in an environmental issues seminar series is most prominent.  This scholarship program enables students from underrepresented groups with limited financial opportunities to enter STEM programs. The University of North Dakota has a history of successful work with American Indian students by providing a strong support system; however, these students have minimal involvement in non-medically related majors.  Therefore, this project is taking an important step that is increasing awareness about opportunities in STEM majors and engaging these American Indian students as majors in traditional STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

This award enabled the creation of a program named Undergraduate Scholarships with Mathematics and Science Training in Environmental Research (US MASTER I). The goal of this program was to provide <strong>16 scholarships</strong> targeting 1<sup>st</sup> generation and underrepresented minority (URM) students. Over 20 faculty members from Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, and Geography created and participated in this program.</p> <p>From 2011-2017, <strong>nearly 50 students</strong> participated in the US MASTER I program (Table 1), far exceeding the proposed reach of the program. Twenty-six (54%) were from rural settings, twenty-six (not the same) were 1<sup>st</sup> generation students, as result of collaboration with UND TRIO. This indicates that we were able to reach a diverse array of individuals specifically addressing needs in a rural setting.

The demonstrated effectiveness of the 1<sup>st</sup> year seminar resulted in the permanent implementation of a similar seminar into the required Chemistry curriculum. One essential and highly valued outcome (based on external assessment) has been success with the close <strong>mentoring and advising of students.</strong> One-on-one mentoring and daily interaction were critical for student retention, especially among underrepresented minority students.

The joint session approach also involved a newly implemented &ldquo;a non-fiction book club format&rdquo; that involved popular science books.
