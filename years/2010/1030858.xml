<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to investigate the interactions during electrowetting between liquid electrolytes and dielectric surfaces. These interactions result in a cessation of spreading with increasing voltage and ultimately irreversible failure of the insulating properties of the dielectric layer. Electrowetting is a phenomenon where the application of an electric potential causes a conducting liquid to spread upon an insulated electrode. This effort seeks to develop a fundamental understanding of limiting phenomena in electrowetting and its dependence on the properties of the ions, solvent, and dielectric layer.  Furthermore, protocols will be developed for the fabrication of oxide dielectrics and self-assembled monolayer topcoats so as to achieve significant, reversible, and reliable electrowetting behavior. The research effort is motivated by the application of capillary force actuators. These actuators for microelectromechanical systems can deliver forces up to 100 times greater than similarly sized electrostatic actuators. Of particular interest is the optimization of the surface/liquid system so as to enhance the performance of these microactuators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding limiting phenomena in electrowetting will lead to improved electrowetting performance in a variety of applications including microdevice actuation, hand-held medical testing equipment, electronic paper and displays, and focusable liquid lenses for cameras. Moreover, this effort will provide both undergraduate and graduate students a highly interdisciplinary research opportunity.  As undergraduates from underrepresented groups will be part of the research team, this effort will directly impact the training of a diverse engineering workforce and the preparation of underrepresented students for graduate study.</AbstractNarration>
