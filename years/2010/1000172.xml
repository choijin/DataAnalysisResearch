<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to use modeling and simulation methods to understand the fundamental deformation and failure mechanisms of asphalt concrete, which will lead to designing better performing mixes of balanced capability against rutting, fatigue and thermal cracking; and integration of mix design into pavement structure design. It will be achieved though making use of advanced x-ray computed tomography to no-destructively characterize the three-dimensional representations of aggregate particles (Digital Particle), high performance computing to select an optimum gradation through packing a set of digital particles based on maximizing the particle contacts and loading transfer uniformity, and the digital specimen and digital test techniques developed through a previous project supported by the National Science Foundation to evaluate asphalt concrete?s resistance against permanent deformation, fatigue and thermal cracking. These innovations have great potential impact on designing long-lasting mixes, and more accurate predictions of the behavior of these mixes under real road conditions, leading to extended pavement life and reduced life cycle cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asphalt paving industries directly and indirectly employ about 900,000 people. Designing and constructing long-lasting asphalt concrete pavements have significant impacts on saving limited natural and economic resources. The project will also integrate fundamental mechanism identification, simulation and visualization into both practical use and teaching of next generation engineers. In addition, the project will tie into an existing Virginia Tech Transportation Institute?s K-12 program to allow these participants have hands-on experience on performing both traditional mix design and digital mix design during their visit. A mini Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program will be managed during the last year of the project to expose the undergraduate students, especially those of minority and underrepresented to the advanced technology and attract them to graduate study in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Asphalt concrete is a composite material consisting of aggregates, asphalt binder and air voids. The constitutive behavior of the material depends largely on the interaction between aggregates and asphalt binder. The aggregate skeleton determines the load carrying mechanism and the asphalt binder serves as an adherent, which enables the mixture to withhold tensile and shear stresses. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) can be used to model the aggregate-aggregate, aggregate-asphalt interbations at particle level in the asphalt mixture. It can be used to assess the effects of asphalt content, gradation and relative slippage among aggregate particles. Given the proper internal structure and contact models, the simulation could avoid a huge amount of sample preparation work in lab and provide preliminary assessment of the behavior of asphalt mixtures, aiding the mix design by providing fundamental understanding of the experimental mix design procedures.  Major works performed in this study include: developemtn of a  modeling method for packing aggregates and determining the optimal gradation through DEM simulation; development of a method for determining the optimal asphalt content by simulating compression tests on asphalt mixtures via a computational method; and develoment of a method for estimating the film thickness based on determined gradation and asphalt content in order to represent visco- elastic properties of asphalt binder.  DEM was used to simulate the formation of the skeleton and the void structures in asphalt concrete for different gradations of aggregates before compaction (see FIGURE 1). The particle surface texture can be included in the inter-aggregate contact model. The void content before compaction may be used to judge the relative merits of a gradation. It is assumed that an optimum gradation can be achieved, and the structure is most stable if the number of inter-aggregate contacts of coarse aggregates reaches the maximum value. The optimum gradation could be determined by manipulating the particle locations and orientations, and placing smaller particles in the voids among larger particles.

The computational method developed can take the mechanical properties or performance of the mixture into consideration, such as inter-aggregate contacts and local stability.  Once a gradation is selected, the Voids in Mineral Aggregate (VMA) can be determined. For a certain target air void content, the asphalt content can be determined. If the asphalt content is known, then the average binder film thickness, which is related to the total surface area of both aggregates and fillers, can be conveniently determined. As the binder layer might affect the permanent deformation of particles in contact, this layerÆs thickness might be directly related to the rutting performance of the mixture. A detailed view of the layer is shown in FIGURE 2.  In addition, if the asphalt film thickness is too small, aging and wearing of the asphalt binder will reduce its fatigue life. Therefore estimation of the film thickness is important and it can be conveniently obtained via the computational method.   Mineral aggregates constitute approximately 95% of hot-mix asphalt (HMA) by weight. The mineral aggregate is made up predominantly of coarse aggregates. Aggregate characteristics such as particle size, shape, and texture influence the performance and service ability of hot-mix asphalt pavement. Flat and elongated particles tend to break during mixing, compaction, and under traffic. Therefore, aggregate shape is one of the important properties that must be considered in the mix design of asphalt pavements to avoid premature pavement failure.
