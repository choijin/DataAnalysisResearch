<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the development of a therapeutic gel containing the full complement of naturally occurring growth factors secreted by the choroid plexus (CP) for use in the active wound care market, including problematic superficial skin wounds such as diabetic ulcers. High doses of single recombinant factors have shown limited value in treating these wounds, with long-term side effects manifesting after cumulative exposure to milligram quantities. The unique technology that CytoSolv has developed employs multiple CP proteins to elicit a synergistic ?cocktail? effect that reduces the cumulative exposure to any one protein, while enhancing the pharmacologic impact by involving multiple regenerative pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research extend to tissue regeneration, and CytoSolv has initiated preclinical development to treat diabetic ulcers.  These wounds are responsible for the majority of lower extremity amputations in the world, and are among the principal reasons for hospitalization of diabetic patients, accounting for 25% of all admissions in the US.  Recently developed biologic therapies have not been widely accepted clinically due to inconsistent evidence of useful efficacy.   As a result, the problem of managing complications of diabetic ulcers remains a major source of disability and cost to our health care system, with an active wound care market estimated at $20 billion in the US alone, and more than 115 companies delivering products for 5.7M patients. The goal of the current project is to develop an inexpensive, efficacious therapy based on the CP factor technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was designed to evaluate a topical formulation of growth factors derived from the choroid plexus (CP) in an animal model of impaired wound healing, with the principle goal of accelerating the wound healing process by delivering complementary regenerative molecules at biologically appropriate doses.  Growth factors secreted in vitro from porcine CP were isolated, concentrated, and formulated for topical delivery in a composition containing the hydrogel carboxymethylcellulose.  The gel was evaluated in vitro in cultures of skin cells (fibroblasts or keratinocytes) in a monolayer defect model, and in vivo in an open wound model in diabetic mice with known healing impairments.  A commercially available formulation of topically applied recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was used as a comparison.     In vitro, CP factor formulations accelerated the closure of both fibroblast and keratinocyte monolayer defects.  These findings were supported in vivo, where histologically, CP factor treatments lead to a more natural organization of healed tissue including a much higher density of adnexal structures (hair follicles and sweat glands) that are usually only present in normal skin.  There was also a marked reduction in inflammation, allowing for a more natural rebuilding of the extracellular matrix supportive of multilayered cellular organization.  In comparison, PDGF treatments and unloaded carboxymethycellulose gels were associated with fibrotic scars containing a high density of inflammatory cells and very few adnexal structures.  Additionally, immunohistochemical labeling of cytokeratin 6 showed that epithelialization of wounds treated with CP factors was significantly more advanced than PDGF or control gel groups.     The wound healing factors in the CP factor cocktail may function synergistically through a complicated mechanism of action. A PCR wound-healing array was used to characterize gene expression of tissue harvested from the center of the wounds. Nearly 40% of the genes present in the array profile were modulated by the CP treatment groups by at least a factor of 2. The inflammatory cytokines were significantly upregulated by CP factor treatments after 10 days, as well as a number of chemoattractant cytokines. This may suggest that, at this early time, CP factors interact within multiple wound healing pathways by modulating acute inflammation,  potentially allowing for subsequent steps of remodeling and rebuilding to occur in a healthy wound bed.     The endpoints selected for this study are widely accepted in the literature, and they are supportive of continued development of CP factor products for treatment of problematic wounds          Last Modified: 03/26/2012       Submitted by: Chris Thanos]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
