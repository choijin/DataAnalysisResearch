<AbstractNarration>1043517/Clark&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to develop a better understanding of the response of the WAIS to climate change. The timing of the last deglaciation of the western Ross Sea will be improved using in situ terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (3He, 10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl) to date glacial erratics at key areas and elevations along the western Ross Sea coast.  A state-of-the art ice sheet-shelf model will be used to identify mechanisms of deglaciation of the Ross Sea sector of WAIS. The model results and forcing will be compared with observations including the new cosmogenic data proposed here, with the aim of better determining and understanding the history and causes of WAIS deglaciation in the Ross Sea. There is considerable uncertainty, however, in the history of grounding line retreat from its last glacial maximum position, and virtually nothing is known about the timing of ice- surface lowering prior to ~10,000 years ago. Given these uncertainties, we are currently unable to assess one of the most important questions regarding the last deglaciation of the global ice sheets, namely as to whether the Ross Sea sector of WAIS contributed significantly to meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A), an extraordinarily rapid (~500-year duration) episode of ~20 m sea-level rise that occurred ~14,500 years ago. The intellectual merit of this project is that recent observations of startling changes at the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets indicate that dynamic responses to warming may play a much greater role in the future mass balance of ice sheets than considered in current numerical projections of sea level rise. The broader impacts of this work are that it has direct societal relevance to developing an improved understanding of the response of the West Antarctic ice sheet to current and possible future environmental changes including the sea-level response to glacier and ice sheet melting due to global warming.  The PI will communicate results from this project to a variety of audiences through the publication of peer-reviewed papers and by giving talks to public audiences.  Finally the project will support a graduate student and undergraduate students in all phases of field-work, laboratory work and data interpretation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to constrain the timing of Antarctic ice sheet retreat, just after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), approximately 21,000 years ago.  This is important for understanding the role of Antarctic ice sheets in past climate and sea level changes.  Of particular interest is the origin of rapid sea level rise approximately 14,000 years ago, identified from global sea level records, when sea level rose extremely rapidly (15-25 meters in 400-500 years; the event is referred to as Meltwater Pulse 1A).  One goal of the project was to evaluate the potential contribution of melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to sea level in general, but also to this remarkable event.  The strategy was to use isotopes produced by cosmic rays in surface rocks (cosmogenic nuclides) to date glacial moraine deposits on the margins of McMurdo Sound.   The field sites were all accessed from the U.S. base at McMurdo Station and were selected based on satellite imagery and previous research in the region.  The field work was carried out in the Austral summer of 2012/2013 and the field party included lead-PI Peter Clark, co-PI Mark Kurz, graduate student Nilo Bill, and field assistant Shaun Marcott.   The field team sampled glacial boulders from six locations around the McMurdo Sound area: two locations at the mouth of Taylor Valley (Hjorth Hill and New Harbor), adjacent to Blue Glacier, three locations on Ross Island (Cape Evans, Cape Royds, and Cape Crozier), and on the western flank of Mt. Discovery.  Nearly 200 samples of granitic and basaltic boulders were collected for dating with cosmogenic nuclides (beryllium-10, helium-3, and carbon-14). Multiple samples (5-10) were collected at sites that were considered likely to constrain the post-LGM glacial history, based on field relations.  Sample selection and prioritization, along with most of the mineral separations, and all 10Be measurements were carried out by Nilo Bill as part of his Ph.D. thesis research, an important educational opportunity.   The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) laboratory component of the project was to carry out helium measurements; we made at least 190 helium measurements on mineral separates. The helium data provided a rapid and valuable method to assess the presence of complex exposure histories (e.g., long exposure), which allowed selection of samples for the more laborious 10Be measurements, and proved to be an effective procedure.  Prior to this field research, it was unknown if there were granite boulders of both sufficient size, abundance, and exposure geometries, in the areas of interest. Granite is ideal for cosmogenic dating with 10Be because it is relatively resistant to wind erosion and contains quartz which can be separated. One of the most important results was the determination that large granite boulders were abundant in the regions of interest, and that cosmogenic 10Be and 3He could be effectively used on these localities. Comparison of the paired 3He and 10Be ages shows a large scatter, with 3He significantly younger than the 1:1 relationship. This suggests that diffusive helium loss is important issue in this sample suite, but uncertainty with respect to initial isotopic composition may also be a factor.  However, the 3He data allowed identification of samples with prior exposure, an important factor.  The most promising chronology was derived from 10Be ages in Taylor Valley, demonstrating that the approach was successful.  Eleven samples from lower Taylor Valley suggest retreat from the LGM ~21 thousand years before present (ka), which is significantly older than suggested by the existing chronology on algae 14C ages, followed by remarkably slow retreat with final deglaciation of the valley ~6.8 ka, in agreement with previous 14C ages on marine shells from lower Taylor Valley. Twelve samples from the valley side of lower Taylor Valley suggest a similar slow rate of retreat, with better resolution suggesting slow retreat betwe...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
