<AbstractNarration>Wind-forced inertial oscillations of the surface mixed layer generate propagating near-inertial waves, which eventually break and drive small-scale mixing in the ocean interior. The importance of such small-scale mixing for the large-scale circulation is becoming increasingly apparent. However, based on the current range of estimates, the flux of energy from the mixed layer to propagating near-inertial waves may either play a major role in the ocean's power budget, comparable to the tidal input, or may be entirely negligible - a fundamental uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study uses data analyses, supplemented by numerical modeling, to assess the role of eddies in shaping the global character of mixed layer oscillations. The primary goal is a more accurate estimate of the global contribution of wind forcing to the near-inertial wave field. The strategy is built around accessing and interpreting the dynamical information contained in a recently enhanced dataset - the Global Drifter Program network of surface buoys, now available with approximately hourly resolution since 2005. The use of a new set of mathematical tools will capture the time-varying properties of inertial oscillations in the mixed layer, and simultaneously, those of the mesoscale eddies expected to modulate the inertial environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This process-oriented study will be an important step in the larger goal of understanding and quantifying the mechanical energy budget of the ocean. It will have a direct benefit to the representation of the ocean's response to wind forcing in general circulation models, and consequently, to our ability to accurately predict climate-scale variability. Furthermore, the approach which brings together advances and expertise in data collection, analysis, and numerical process modeling will make optimal use of newly available resources and will identify outstanding areas for future research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: A primary societal benefit of this work is its potential impact on our ability to predict long-term climate variability. Funds are included to support a postdoctoral researcher, who will gain exposure to novel datasets, data analysis techniques, and numerical studies. The project will benefit other investigators by supporting and promoting the use of the high-resolution drifter dataset as a new window on ocean dynamics. Analysis algorithms developed in this work will be freely distributed to the greater scientific community, by inclusion in JLAB, J. M. Lilly's open-source software package for Matlab. The project will also fund two early career scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report  for collaborator Dohan, Earth and Space Research  Collaborative Research: Global Impacts of Eddies on Inertial Oscillations of the Mixed Layer  All exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean, including momentum, occurs within the planetary boundary layer interface between the atmosphere and ocean.  The coupling between the atmosphere and ocean occurs within this very thin layer, and as such it is vital to the dynamics of the entire planetary system. Although winds are an essential driving force for surface currents and turbulence, fundamental questions remain about the nature of the transfer.  One very important response of the upper ocean to varying winds is inertial oscillations &ndash; waves with frequencies close to the local Coriolis frequency.  These waves can potentially contribute as much mixing to the interior of the ocean as tidal motions.  However, reproducing these waves from observed winds alone, in particular how and why they are damped in time, remains a challenge.  This project was a collaborative research effort to quantify the relative eddy and inertial oscillation energy content and evolution characteristics in the global upper ocean using novel statistical and analytical methods on a new high-resolution global drifter database, coupled with numerical simulations to inform the analytical methods and aid in the interpretation of the inertial wave statistics. One main result of this collaborative project was the development of a stochastic technique to separate inertial oscillation statistics out of high temporal resolution drifter trajectories (Sykulski et al. 2016, Lilly et. al 2016, Elipot et al. 2016) in the presence of eddies. The Lagrangian time series models for ocean surface drifter trajectories that were developed during this project resulted in a global map of damping time scales for the inertial oscillations based on observations. The objective for Earth and Space Research (ESR) within this collaboration was to interpret and validate the damping parameter results and provide physical insight using upper ocean physics and global observations.  The simplest method to model inertial motions in a wind-driven upper ocean is the damped slab model.  In the damped slab, properties are assumed to be well-mixed so that the upper ocean mixed layer (typically the top few tens of meters of the ocean) moves as a "slab". Motions are damped with a drag term &ndash; the inverse of the damping time scale. The task of ESR was to implement this variable damping parameter within a damped slab model for the upper ocean and compare the ocean currents to satellite-derived currents (OSCAR, www.esr.org/oscar_index.html) and to global drifting buoy velocities. This was done with damped slab models applied to satellite wind forcing and using Argo mixed layer depths. The modeled inertial oscillation statistics are available from the ESR website (http://www.esr.org/oscar/oscar_data.html).  The comparisons of the new model with both satellite derived currents and drifting buoys are promising.    The variable damping shows consistent improved performance over standard constant damping values. This global analysis showed an eddy-dependent decaying of inertial motions within the mixed layer, with the shortest time scales of decay in the presence of eddies.  Outside of eddies and in strong winds, the upper motion momentum does appear to have a slab-like nature. However, when eddies are present, the damped slab fails and the vertically varying steady Ekman solution in OSCAR is a more appropriate model.  The validated global damping time scale map is a new accomplishment. Through this, the link between eddies and decaying inertial motions is firmly established on a global scale. The time scale for decay of inertial motions has been a question for decades. Direct observations of the evolution of inertial motions is challenging because moorings are fixed. This is the first global observation of decay time scale.  The ocean is a challenging place to observe in situ on a global scale. Methods such as those that were developed in this project to distinguish important new information out of the data from our existing network of unmanned observational platforms will help in this understanding.
