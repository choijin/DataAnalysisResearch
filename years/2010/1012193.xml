<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the collaborative research project of Prof. Lee Penn and Prof. William Arnold of the University of Minnesota. The collaborating investigators and their students will study the mechanism of reductive transformations of highly oxidized contaminants on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles. The study will make use for the first time of cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) for the analysis of vitrified iron oxide nanoparticles. Results are expected to lead to vastly improved predictions of contaminant fate in both natural and engineered nanoparticle systems. The study will provide excellent opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Minnesota to work on a cutting edge research project in environmental chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ More than thirty years after the passage of the Superfund legislation, groundwater contamination by organic contaminants is still a pervasive problem. Additionally, pesticides are continuously applied in the environment to increase crop yields such that the growing world population can be fed and provided with fuel. Because many of these organic contaminants are or can be oxidized or reduced, redox reactions occurring at mineral surfaces in aquatic systems, particularly iron oxides, are a critical component of the transformation of contaminants in both natural and engineered systems.     The overarching goal was to elucidate the role of the iron oxide surfaces in the reductive transformations of highly oxidized contaminants. Key elements are quantifying changes in mineralogy and accessible surface area of natural and synthetic materials caused by the reductive transformations of selected contaminants and the quantitative link between these changes and the evolving kinetics of contaminant degradation. In addition, the PIs examined how species in solution can modify the reactivity of iron oxide surfaces in aqueous environments.  Of particular importance is the relationship between reactive surface area and aggregation state.     Rates of organic contaminant degradation were quantified and solid materials characterized using advanced materials characterization methods.  A particularly novel aspect of the proposed work was direct imaging of the particles in the reaction media by way of cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM).  This technique enabled quantitative evaluation of aggregation state and semi-quantitative assessment of in situ accessible surface area.     Generally speaking, an increase in aggregation is generally associated with a decrease in redox reaction rates.  However, when species that inhibit aggregation but block reactive surface sites are present, reactivity is also inhibited.  Several fundamental observations have included how reactive and accessible surface area changes as a function of simple experimental variables like the use of co-solvent in pollutant dosing as well as the method by which pH is maintained within an environmentally relevant range. Aggregation state and overall reactivity are very sensitive to the pH buffer employed.  Unfortunately, the commonly employed buffers that provide tight pH control strongly impact the reactivity of iron oxides, making them unsuitable for reactors designed to model environmental systems.  Furthermore, the presence of ions (e.g., calcium and cobalt cations) substantially changes the reactivity of the iron oxide particles. Substantive progress in developing consistent methods for quantifying reactive and accessible surface area as well as how those evolve as a function of reaction progress has been made.     The intellectual merit of the work is that the results represent a critical step towards developing a fundamental theory to interpret the macroscopic behavior of iron oxide mineral surfaces based on specific surface processes occurring at the oxide-water interface. Results have lead to a substantial improvement in the fundamental, mechanistic understanding of how iron oxide surfaces mediate important reductive degradation reactions as a function of aqueous chemistry.     The broader impacts of this work is the substantive improvement in the fundamental understanding of how organic contaminants are degraded at the iron oxide surface. Given the widespread usage and presence of redox active contaminants in aquatic systems and the ubiquitous nature of iron oxide minerals in environmental systems, such information will facilitate predictions of reactivity in natural and engineered systems depending on the aqueous chemistry and minerals present. In addition, participants in this project participated in outreach events involving middle school and high school students. For example, members of the Penn group served as science fair judges at a Minneapolis pu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
