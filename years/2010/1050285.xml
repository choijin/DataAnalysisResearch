<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;An international conference on energy with a focus on molecular photonics has been organized for September 2010 at the University of Washington?s marine biology station in the San Juan Islands in Washington State. This is being organized on a similar basis as the 2007 conference under the name of "International Conference on Molecular Photonics: Interaction of Light with Nanostructured Materials". This conference follows up on the 2007 conference with a focus on light-matter interactions and expands to additional novel energy related research topics. The goal is to highlight the science and technologies that can provide the means for sustainable energy. For example, significant advances have been made in developing organic materials for both photovoltaic applications and solid state lighting. These advances as well as other energy fields, such as energy storage and photocatalysis, promise to provide novel technologies that can develop into robust renewable energy strategies and address the challenges of climate change.  The Solid State and Materials Chemistry program provides support for the participation of graduates students, post-docs and young faculty to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;One of the major goals for this conference is to increase participation from graduate students and post-docs. With this in mind, the number of invited speakers has been kept intentionally small (15 speakers over 2.5 days) such that ample time can be allocated to students and post-docs to interact with key researchers in the field. More than 50 out of the 60 participants are expected to be students or post-docs. Through the outreach program that has been set-up through the University of Washington, Science and Technology Center (STC) - Materials &amp; Devices for Information Technology Research (MDITR), students from Norfolk State University, a Historically Black-College and University (HBCU) have also been invited to attend the conference.</AbstractNarration>
