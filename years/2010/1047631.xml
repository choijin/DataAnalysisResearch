<AbstractNarration>This travel award supports student participation in the Tenth ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM and ACM SIGMETRICS, in cooperation with USENIX, held in Melbourne, Australia, November 1-3, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMC 2010 will expose students to new ideas, and allow them to interact with other researchers in the field of network measurements; specific topics include, internet traffic analysis, internet structure and topology characteristics, internet performance measurements, measurement-based network management such as traffic engineering, inter-domain and intra-domain routing, network applications such as multimedia streaming, gaming and on-line social networks, measurements of content distribution, peer-to-peer, overlay, and social networks, data-centric issues, including anonymization, querying, and storage, measurement-based inference of network properties, design of monitoring systems, sampling methods, signal processing methods, network anomaly detection and troubleshooting, network security threats and countermeasures, software tools and environments in support of measurement, measurement-based assessment of simulation/testbeds, measurement-based workload generation, measurement-based modeling, and reappraisal of previous measurement findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 10 US-based graduate students are provided the opportunity to attend IMC 2010. The travel awards will target graduate students, in particular female and under-represented minority students, since they often have limited travel funds to attend workshops; attendance at such events is an important part of their educational experience.</AbstractNarration>

IMC is the primary venue for presenting new research results on collecting and analyzing measurements of the Internet. This travel grant, by enabling students who might not otherwise be able to attend IMCÆ10, has increased the dissemination of the conferenceÆs research results to a larger and more diverse audience. It also integrated research and education of graduate students by allowing students to present their work (for awardees who are authors), observe high-quality presentations, and interact with senior researchers in the field.   By giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students, we helped widen the participation among these underrepresented groups. Furthermore, by advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions are able to attend and benefit from the conference. Out of the seven awardees, two are female and two other students are from under-represented institutions (i.e., they were the first participants from their institutions at the IMC conference). Among the recipients, three are "first author" of papers presented at the conference, one is a co-author of two papers, and one submitted a paper to IMC but was rejected.
