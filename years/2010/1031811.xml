<AbstractNarration>In preliminary work, we have adapted a stochastic, nonlinear, partial differential equation model of mesoscale cortical dynamics to study seizure waves. We have applied the model to the sleeping cortex, and developed the capacity for automatic, continuous, real-time sleep staging. We have made a significant advance in model reduction using Locally Linear Embedding to associate patient EEG data and model dynamics. We have developed an understanding of how to apply ideas from feedback control theory to ameliorate?or eliminate?seizure waves rapidly in the model. To do so, we have understood the role of uncertainty or fluctuations on bifurcations. We have examined the model to consider possible pathways to changes in cortical physiology (mathematical bifurcations of the infinite dimensional model) from a normal state to one that can support seizures. Our technical goals for the project include the following: to explore propensity for seizure dynamics at different parts of the sleep cycle (in the model and in patients); to develop further our seizure control algorithms to more closely track designs of sense and actuation electrodes; and to explore the ways in which electrophysiological data of seizure onset in patients is related to cortical seizure susceptibility via different kinds of bifurcations in the model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 50M people worldwide suffer from epileptic seizures. Of 2.5M Americans so afflicted, 20% suffer epilepsy that does not respond well to pharmacological treatment; they may undergo surgery to remove the affected part of the brain as a last resort. Our work to improve understanding of epilepsy will aid in the challenge to find a better form of treatment. Our approach is to explore seizure occurrence and control through a computer model, along with patient observations in a hospital setting. Eventually, seizure control may prove to be possible by sensing and application of electrical fields in affected parts of the brain. Appropriate methodologies will depend on brain state, the details of electrode placement and design, and how measurements might reveal they way in which seizure onset occurs. These are all points of study in project. These investigations will provide the foundation for new understanding of brain dynamics and will contribute to the development of a pathway to effective treatment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This was a project aimed at understanding dynamically evolving mathematical systems that mimic brain states, averaged over thousands of individual neurons and featuring rapidly fluctuating ('stochastic') inputs. The mathematical equations are capable of faithfully reproducing collective dynamics of neurons in sleep, emergence from anesthesia, and also undergoing seizures. Because early foundational research investigating treatment strategies is risky, it is important that mathematical models be used to explore ideas before they are tried on animal or human subjects.  Intellectual Merit  In this project the mathematical system was used to explore the potential to control epileptic seizures. These can be understood as pathological states of hypersynchronized activity among populations of neurons. In earlier work, control strategies were developed that relied on sensing electric fields with one set of electrodes, and projecting a controlling electric field with another set. In this project, that work was taken further, into the new area of optogenetics. Here, light-sensitive ion channels in neuronal cell membranes provide the way to alter neuronal population dynamics to control seizures, rather than projected electric fields. To argue for the plausibility of this optogenetics approach, additional equations describing the action of light-sensitive ion channels were added to the mathematical model, and successful strategies were developed for relating the illumination necessary for control to the measured electric fields.  An additional area of work was focused on relating patient data recorded in a hospital setting to the mathematical model of cortical dynamics. This was accomplished in a way that is robust to the highly variable nature of the patient data, and yields results that tie closely the mathematical model to real cortical dynamics.  Broader Impacts  Over 50M people worldwide suffer from epileptic seizures. Of 2.5M  Americans so afflicted, 20% suffer epilepsy that does not respond well  to pharmacological treatment; they may undergo surgery to remove the  affected part of the brain as a last resort. The work on this project to improve  understanding of epilepsy and to investigate potential new treatment ideas will aid in the challenge to find a better  approach to treatment.

Appropriate methodologies will depend on brain state, the  details of sensing and actuation technology placement and design, and how measurements might  reveal they way in which seizure onset occurs. But the work supported by this award has provided strong arguments for the plausibility of this approach.  In terms of the people associated with the research project, the broader impacts relate to research training and advancement. Two doctoral students (one female, one male) were supported by this research grant, and the research activities form the main part of the material in their doctoral dissertations. A former student (female) of the research group, who was a consultant on this project, secured a tenure-track faculty position in Biomedical Engineering at a research-intensive university. Beyond the students, a long-term collaboration between UC Berkeley, UCSF and the University of Auckland (New Zealand) was supported; it is a collaboration between engineering and different fields of medicine.
