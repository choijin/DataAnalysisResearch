<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This award will support the continued development of an Indigenous Observation Network (ION) that focusses on water chemistry, water quality and discharge, and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in the Yukon and Tanana river watersheds in central Alaska. This community-based effort is part of the NSF Arctic Observing Network (AON), which supports long-term, science-driven observing that enables research into understanding rapid environmental system change in the Arctic. AON is a component of the broader Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH). Operated by the Yukon River Inter-tribal Watershed Council, the ION will involve individuals and communities who will make measurements and obtain water samples year-round along the two rivers. The water samples will be analyzed at no-cost by the U.S. Geological Survey. The variables to be measured and analyzed include: water temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, major ions, alkalinity, dissolved gasses (oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane), trace metals, stable oxygen isotope ratios (O-18/O-16), nutrients and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC). This project will produce the first year-round water chemistry and water quality data set for the Yukon and Tanana rivers, which will permit assessment of the seasonal variability of biogeochemical fluxes and their response to changing hydrology and ecosystems in the watersheds. The Yukon River watershed is a sentinel watershed for understanding climate change and plays a vital role in the Bering Sea and Bering Strait ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project builds capacity in the rural and widely-dispersed native communities of the Yukon and Tanana river watersheds. It trains local tribal technicians to use standardized protocols to collect, analyze and interpret baseline water chemistry and water quality data, and equips local communities with the tools and training necessary for them to carry out their own research and contribute to broader scientific scientific objectives in a meaningful way. The data are freely and openly available to the scientific community and all other interested parties via a project Web site and at CADIS (Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service), the AON data repository. The ION also collaborates with the NSF-funded Exchange for Local Observations and Knowledge in the Arctic (ELOKA) for the purpose of advising on recording and curation of the TEK that will be obtained.</AbstractNarration>

One of the key goals of this project was to collect year-round water-quality data in order to assess the influence of seasonality on biogeochemistry. Collection of winter water samples in Alaska is difficult due to the harsh weather conditions brought by the winter season. Despite these conditions we were able to collect 41 under-ice samples between the months of February and April throughout this grant period. These samples complement the regular sampling period of May to October and will allow us to understand the changes the hydrologic system undergoes throughout the winter months. In addition, both a winter and summer synoptic Healing Journey were completed on the Tanana River to provide both an understanding of the riverÆs spatial heterogeneity and educational outreach to the communities along the river.   All of the water-quality data collected as part of this program since 2006 has been archived in either at the ACADIS Gateway database at https://www.aoncadis.org/project/YRITWC.html or as a USGS Open File Report and webpage on the NRPÆs website. Currently, all data, sample location information, and quality control/quality assurance data through sample year 2013 is freely available for download at http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/SWC_Yukon/YukonRiverBasin. Data collected in the 2014 field season is currently in USGS review and will be available soon. In addition to making the data freely available and easily downloadable the YRITWC and USGS have produced two sets of community reports (2013 and 2015) containing data collected in individual communities with explanation o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
