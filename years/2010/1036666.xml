<AbstractNarration>Principal Investigator: Kevin Sellner&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No: CBET-1036666&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chesapeake Community Modeling Program (CCMP) seeks to improve modeling tools and related resources specific to the Chesapeake Bay, its watershed, and connected environmental systems by fostering collaborative open source research. Toward this end the CCMP is convening the Chesapeake Modeling Symposium 2010 as a venue to identify and showcase existing modeling efforts as well as communicate how models are used as decision support tools by different developer and user groups. ChesMS'10 is the second symposium convened by CCMP. ChesMS'08 focused on highlighting and communicating new and innovative Chesapeake ecosystem open source models and building the existing library of available models and tools. ChesMS'10 expands on this by continuing to showcase new modeling efforts while also demonstrating how new and existing models can be applied to aid in Management, Research, and Restoration decision support.  By bringing together the model developer and user communities at the symposium, they hope to foster greater intra group understanding and communication.  This will lead to more product-focused model development and a more intelligent use of these models. Funding is sought to support travel costs for two invited plenary speakers and funds to defray a portion of registration costs for students.  The plenary speakers are established leaders in model development and access while the student stipends ensure affordable access and networking for new modelers, critical for continued student exposure and maturation, model development, and more importantly, application throughout the basin.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF funding was critical to expansion of student exposure and familiarity with the bay modeling, management, and science communities as that network and the interactions within it should guide student options and career choices as their science and skills mature.  These new skilled modelers need to see how their skills can be displayed and delivered, and how their mentors address challenges and alternative explanations for model acceptance and use,  The students ideally have greater recognition for the work they have begun and through that exposure and community acknowledgement, now be able to more easily immerse themselves into the modeling community.   Specific outcomes from the various sessions included:  1)     Identification of the need for increased attention to the shallow waters of Chesapeake Bay despite the difficulty in modeling these dynamic systems.  2)     Four key challenges were identified in addressing model uncertainty: communication, data, risk, and a forum/process to address issues.  3)     A dialogue was initiated regarding what technologies are the most critical to the next generation of Chesapeake Bay numerical modeling setups.  4)     A NOAA Technical Report summarizing the challenges facing both scientists and managers in moving towards model operationalization and use will be developed.  5)     In order to be able to predict and/or respond to extreme events such as tropical storms or oil spills, the existing observational network must be very much more integrated and the data better aggregated to allow for a more rapid (real-time or nearly so) sharing of data and information across a robust network.  6)     In the next generation of land use and land cover change models, and in hydrologic and ecosystem models, it is likely that understanding and capturing process will be an emerging area of research       Last Modified: 08/02/2011       Submitted by: Kevin G Sellner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
