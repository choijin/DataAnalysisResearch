<AbstractNarration>Building on their successful traveling exhibition and Web site, "Invention at Play," funded by the NSF Informal Science Education Program, the Smithsonian's Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation (National Museum of American History) in collaboration with Smithsonian Affiliates around the country is developing "Places of Invention" (POI).  Major deliverables include a 3,500 square-foot permanent exhibition at NMAH and a highly interactive Web site that focus on practicing inventive skill-building and illustrating the ways that place and social collaboration shape the creative process.  The POI exhibition features an interactive Invent Town area and five stories about "hot spots" of invention from the mid-19th century to the present, each providing hands-on experiences that relate to particular "21st Century skills" and to the social, psychological, and spatial dimensions of invention, science, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;The project intends to establish a new model for the co-creation of exhibition content among NMAH visitors, Web site users, Lemelson Center staff, and partnering Smithsonian Affiliate museums around the country.  The exhibition and Web site will be designed with inter-linking features that allow museum visitors and people from around the country to add local stories of creative activities in their home towns, share their own inventive designs, and dialog with each other about the inventive process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On July 1, 2015, the SmithsonianÆs Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation debuted its Places of Invention exhibition at the National Museum of American History (NMAH). Since then it has been a popular destination in the Museum's first floor Innovation wing, where it will be on public display for at least five years. Annually, NMAH welcomes more than four million visitors through its doors and an additional 13 million visitors online.  Building upon primary and secondary research on the geography of invention, clusters, and regional advantage, Places of Invention (POI) demonstrates that invention, innovation, and creativity thrive not just in the Silicon Valleys of America but also in communities across the country and around the world. The POI exhibition explores the special chemistry of time and place that fosters the drive to create and improve. These new ideas and models make our daily lives better, business more efficient, and the country more successful. POI embraces the idea that understanding AmericaÆs rich invention history can help inspire new cultures of innovation. We hope this exhibition will inspire visitors to take a fresh look at their communities. They just may be places of invention.  The 3,300SF POI interactive exhibition features six American communities representing what can happen when the right mix of inventive people, ready resources, and inspiring surroundings come together:  1. Precision manufacturing in Hartford, Connecticut, late 1800s: Factory town puts the pieces together in explosive new ways.  2. Technicolor in Hollywood, California, 1930s: Young town gives birth to the moviesÆ Golden Age.  3. Cardiac innovations in Medical Alley, Minnesota, 1950s: Tight-knit community of tinkerers keeps hearts ticking.  4. Hip-hopÆs birth in the Bronx, New York, 1970s: Neighborhood streets create new beats.  5. The rise of the personal computer in Silicon Valley, California, 1970s&ndash;80s: Suburban garage hackers + Lab researchers = Personal computing.  6. Clean-energy innovations in Fort Collins, Colorado, 2010s: College town combines its energies for a greener planet.  Through narratives, artifacts, archival materials, videos, low- and high-tech interactives, and other multimodal interpretive techniques, the exhibition strives to communicate the importance of the role of "place"&mdash;defined at the city/regional level&mdash;in supporting, enhancing, and encouraging inventive activity. 21st Century Skills practiced by inventors, including Adaptability, Collaboration, Communication, Creativity, Problem Solving, and Risk-Taking, are highlighted as key elements of the invention process and are also modeled by visitors as they interact with the exhibition.  In the Hub of the exhibition gallery is the signature POI Interactive Map (http://invention.si.edu/map), which offers a unique opportunity both in the gallery and online not only to share additional stories curated by the Smithsonian and 12 POI Affiliate Project teams, but also, more importantly, to invite visitors to collaborate on the exhibition itself by contributing stories about their "places of invention" at kiosks in the gallery or via the Web. Our aim is to stimulate the publicÆs thinking about elements of place and social interaction as ingredients in invention and innovation and to see themselves as part of the inventive ecosystem.  12 POI Affiliate teams from around the U.S. (http://invention.si.edu/taking-it-nation-places-invention-affiliates-project) participated in professional development training workshops, led by Lemelson Center staff and consultant Dr. Lorraine McConaghy, and then received funding to produce videos for the POI Interactive Map, to create podcasts and/or video oral history interviews about inventors and inventions from their places, and to host POI programs in their communities?some of which continued beyond the scope of the original project.  In addition to the exhibition at NMAH and the POI Affiliates net...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
