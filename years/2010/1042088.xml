<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and test a non-thermal atmospheric plasma food processing technology to reduce microbial populations on fresh produce.  The technology will reduce the risk of foodborne infections while decreasing microbial spoilage, preserving the fresh attributes and nutritional quality of the produce while avoiding the deposit of unwanted by-products.  The proposed development will leverage previous research concerning the destruction of infectious agents by atmospheric plasma.  In this project, a Plasma Produce Sanitizer prototype will be developed to treat pre-packaged produce.  Key parameters, including plasma power and exposure time, will be varied in seeking a preliminary design and concept of operations that will yield up to 4-log reduction in microbial load without negatively impacting the food quality or shelf life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research will be realized through a reduction in the health and economic impacts associated with food borne illness. According to the USDA, foodborne illnesses account for about 1 of every 100 U.S. hospitalizations and 1 of every 500 U.S. deaths, while costing the country $6.9 billion in medical costs and lost productivity annually.  While the impact has been reduced in recent years through improved detection and traceability of contaminated food, the rate of food contamination has held steady and the economic burden has shifted to the food industry in the form of increased food recalls.  For example, in 2007 the California spinach industry lost close to $100 million following an E-Coli outbreak.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Minimally processed produce is one of the largest growing sectors in the food industry today. The demand by consumers for year-round availability of fresh fruits and vegetables is driving this market. The shelf life of most produce is less than two weeks even when refrigerated. There is an overwhelming need to find technologies that provide the consumer microbiologically safe products with acceptable quality characteristics that maintain nutritional value. It is well known that fruits and vegetables are nutritionally necessary, and are the cornerstone of a healthy diet, offering great benefits to public health such as reducing obesity. Reduction of post harvest losses would translate into a reduction in the cost of production, trade and distribution and reducing the price for consumers.     APP designed, built, and optimized our patented atmospheric plasma technology to disinfect fresh produce rapidly under different processing temperatures.  This treatment process is novel and we routinely obtained pathogen reduction levels of 3 to 4 logs or better on the surface of tomatoes and strawberries.  Shelf life of freshly harvested produce was significantly increased with plasma treatment.  It appeared that the plasma treatment was effective on smooth surfaces and uneven surfaces such as strawberries. Typically, shelf life was extended by 7 to 14 or more days on the produce that was tested, which included: tomatoes, strawberries, green bell peppers, and blueberries.  Sensory tests including odor, color, appearance and texture of the treated produce was compared to untreated controls over time in storage.  It was found that the odor, color, and appearance was superior in plasma treated produce and there was not deterioration in texture.  Chemical tests showed there was no difference between plasma treated and control produce in pH or sugar content.     Being able to significantly impact the safety and freshness of produce will tremendously impact our society because it is well known that fruits and vegetables are nutritionally necessary, and are the cornerstone of a healthful diet, offering great benefits to public health such as fighting obesity. Reduction of post harvest losses would translate into a reduction in the cost of production, trade and distribution and reducing the price for consumers. An additional benefit would be to make available fresh, healthy, and more economically priced minimally processed fruits and vegetables for all.
