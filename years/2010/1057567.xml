<AbstractNarration>Workshop on Usable Verification&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formal verification technology has made significant advances in the last two decades.  Techniques like model checking and theorem proving are now used in both the hardware and software industries.  Current research is focused on increasing the scale and expressiveness of this technology. The biggest challenge facing this technology is in making it more accessible to a wider audience.  This requires powerful automation, more integration, better user interfaces, and deeper embedding into design tools.  To address these challenges,  a two-day workshop on Usable Verification will be held at Microsoft Research in Redmond during November 15 and 16, 2010.  This will be the first of a series of workshops aimed at building a community that is focused on usability issues in verification technology.</AbstractNarration>
