<AbstractNarration>SES-1042357&lt;br/&gt;Ronald Inglehart&lt;br/&gt;Jon Miller&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World Values Survey (WVS) began collecting data from a large number of countries in 1981 and has collected data every five years from more than 90 countries since its inception. It is expected that more than 60 countries will participate in the 6th wave of the WVS in 2010-11.  This project will complete the field work for the U.S. component of the 6th wave of WVS, expanding a set of items concerning attitudes toward science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WVS provides the only source of data on mass values and attitudes from countries containing a majority of the world?s population. The availability of data from the WVS over the last 25 years makes it possible to carryout cross-national analyses that (1) examine the impact of economic and technological change on people?s values, and (2) analyze the impact of individual-level values beliefs on societal-level phenomena such as the extent to which a society has democratic values. A set of items measuring attitudes toward science and technology were added to the 5th wave of the WVS and an expanded set of science and technology items will be included in the 6th wave. Current controversies over topics such as stem cell research, genetically modified crops, and climate change illustrate the importance of understanding the formation and distribution of these attitudes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The values of individuals are changing and these changes have a major impact on a wide range of important societal-level phenomena, including the acceptance of science and technology. They also have a major influence on the extent to which a society has good governance and democratic institutions. Numerous researchers have used WVS data to analyze social change, producing hundreds of books and more than 1000 articles. More than 400,000 students and faculty from all six continents have visited the WVS web site and downloaded data and publications since the completion of the 5th wave in 2007.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Public Report on the United States component of the 2011 World Values Survey  Ronald Inglehart and Jon D. Miller     This project provided funding to cover fieldwork for the U.S. component of the 6th wave of the World Values Survey (WVS) and to add a battery of questions concerning public attitudes toward science and technology to this survey, which is currently being carried out in more than 60 countries on all six inhabited continents. This has made it possible to include the U.S. in a worldwide investigation that now has a 30-year time series covering the full range of cross-national variation, from very poor to very rich countries, having institutions ranging from the most authoritarian regimes to the most liberal democracies, and covering all of the worldÆs major cultural zones.  The World Values Survey (WVS) provides the only source of data on mass values and attitudes from countries containing a majority (in fact, almost 90 percent) of the worldÆs population. The first five waves of research have identified major dimensions of cross-cultural variation, and found that many basic values, beliefs and goals are undergoing substantial and coherent changes over time. The fact that the WVS provides data from scores of countries gives it exceptional leverage for analyzing the social consequences of changing values: it makes it possible to carry out cross-level analyses, (1) examining the impact of economic and technological change on peopleÆs values;  and (2) analyzing the impact of individual-level values and beliefs on societal-level phenomena such as the extent to which a society has gender equality in political, social and economic life; or the extent to which it has democratic institutions. This project will continue to measure mass attitudes toward science and technology, using batteries of items that have been tested and validated in research sponsored by the NSF during the past two decades.  Fieldwork for the U.S. component of the World Values Survey was carried out in English and Spanish by Knowledge Networks of Menlo Park, California from June 9, 2011 to July 5, 2011. The data are now being archived and analyzed.  From its inception, the WVS has made all of its data available interested scholars freely and without restriction.

In order to make effective policy, it is important for policy makers to be informed about these trends among mass publics and the reasons underlying them. The WVS is the most widely-used source of data on social capital, providing time series measures of membership in voluntary associations, interpersonal trust, and trust in government and other institutions, from societies around the world. Numerous researchers have used these data in analyzing the evolution of social capital and its impact on society.           Last Modified: 04/30/2012       Submitte...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
