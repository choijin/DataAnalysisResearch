<AbstractNarration>The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey provides twenty-five S-STEM scholarships each year for talented yet financially disadvantaged students pursuing baccalaureate degrees in computer science and information systems, engineering, computational science or mathematics. The program increases both undergraduate retention and placements in graduate schools or STEM careers. Special outreach activities include awareness campaigns, faculty involvement with high schools/county colleges and a computer fair. Special mentoring is provided to attract and retain female CSIS majors.  Academic support is provided by especially designed courses such as 'Bridges Connecting Computer Science and Calculus' which has resulted in a 20% improvement in performance in calculus.  The 'Women in Computing' course targets first year students to increase and retain female majors. Among the women who intend to major in CSIS, 100% of those in this course are still CSIS majors at the end of the second year and beyond. Tutoring in programming, mentoring and internship and research experiences are also offered.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program builds on a previous successful NSF project which resulted in a 96% retention rate and a 10% increase in GPAs among participating students. Every graduate found a major-related job or acceptance into graduate school. Seventy-three percent of Stockton students qualify for financial need and 26% are first-generation college students. This scholarship program enables students to work less and focus on academics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit- outcomes that advanced the knowledge and understanding in various STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields and other fields.  In our NSF STEM project we had a very successful reserch mentoring program between STEM students and STEM faculty.  Faculty worked one on one with students during the summer to pursue intellectual endeavors.  For example, a STEM student Jared Bland did research with his STEM mentor Dr. Rapatski on the topic Dengue Fever, which is an epidemic in many third world nations and warrants the attention of mathematical modeling to understand its dynamics and propose solutions to combat the deadly disease.  The student presented his results at the Joint Mathematics meetings in January 2015.  The following list is a sample of the research that was done and disseminated by one of our Co- PIs Dr. Taneja and some of his student research partners:  1. Taneja; Vitrano and Gengo; " An empirical investigation of rationality-based beliefs affecting individual's attitude and intention to use privacy controls on Facebook " Computers in Human Behavior,  2014      2. Taneja and Flamensfeld; "The Needs of the Many: Analyzing Individuals? Needs relating to E-Government Adoption"; Proceedings of the 2014 Annual Meeting of the North Eastern Decision Science Institute (NEDSI), Philadelphia, PA;  March 2014     3. Gengo, Pelli and Taneja; "Factors Influencing Consumers' Willingness to Reconcile and Trust Repair in E-Business Environment"; Proceedings of the 2014 Annual Meeting of the North Eastern Decision Science Institute (NEDSI), Philadelphia, PA;  March 2014     4. Taneja, Gengo and Lato; "Users Acceptance of Online Personal Health Record Systems for Enabling Healthcare Decisions"; Proceedings of the 44th Annual Meeting of the Decision Science Institute (DSI), Baltimore, Maryland; November 2013  There are many more examples of research that was accomplished  by our NSF STEM students and their faculty mentors.  The success of the NSF STEM grant in advancing the knowledge and understanding in the STEM fields is reflected in the following IEEE student awards presented by the Southern NJ Professional Societies to Stockton NSF STEM students:  2013 IEEE Student Leader of the Year: Anita Lato  2013 IEEE Student Researcher of the Year: Meredith Flamensfeld  2014 IEEE Student Leader of the Year: David Somers  2014 IEEE Student Researcher of the Year: Nicolas Gengo  2015 IEEE Student Leader of the Year: Sarah Voishnis.
