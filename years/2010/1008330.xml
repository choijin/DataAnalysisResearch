<AbstractNarration>AST-1009544/1008330/1009113&lt;br/&gt;Pitman/Hofmeister/Speck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the nature and formation of cosmic dust is crucial to our understanding of the Universe.  The absorption, scattering, and re-emission of light by cosmic dust has a profound effect on the interpretation of observed spectral signatures and radiative transfer processes in a variety of astronomical objects.  Dust is crucial to star formation processes, and understanding the dust at high redshift is vital to cosmological models and dark energy studies.  To account properly for energy budgets in astrophysical environments requires an understanding of the physical properties of the dust, gained from several types of laboratory data: (1) absorbance spectra, which can be compared to observational spectra, and (2) reflectivity spectra, which may be used to derive (3) optical functions.  However, quality laboratory data are not available for many of the compounds believed to exist in space, particularly at ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) wavelengths.  This project will provide all three forms of UV-vis laboratory data for a suite of solid-state materials found in meteorites and in the condensation sequence.  The major goals are: (1) Determine the spectral behavior of selected silicates, sulfides, oxides, glasses, and other materials that may be present in space; (2) Determine optical functions for these materials; and (3) Apply these data to outstanding questions in astronomy, and make all of the data available to the astronomical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will broaden the participation of under-represented groups and enhance the infrastructure for research and education.  The synergistic, cross-disciplinary study involves scientists in astrophysics, mineral physics, and planetary science, using laboratory, observational, and theoretical modeling techniques.  Laboratory fundamental research for astrophysics is at a critical stage and this work will train new U.S. researchers and students in this area, matching personnel with underutilized but available equipment.  The female lead researchers are all strong role models for women in science, and have strong histories of public outreach and active mentorship of undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

The range measured is the visible to ultraviolet, for which few laborature measurements exist, but the high energies are emitted by the brighter stars.  A broad band exists at 210 nm in the UV which has not been correlated with any substances.  Despite measuring hundreds of substances, we did not find an absorption spectra that matched.

We can rule out oxygen-based solids and SiC, which is common in certain environ ments . At the end of the grant, alternative origins were explored, which suggested a possible origin in physical optics. Additional work is planned.  Our recent  focus was on glasses with chemical abundances suggested by the sun and meteorites.  We gathered data across a wide spectral range on cosmic silicate glass, and provided measures (called optical constants) that can be used to quantitatively analayze observational data.  Our data are a considerable improvement to previous optical constants, which usually merge crystal and glass data.  We applied our data to one object, and provided electronic data so that other researches can apply our data to different stars and nebulae.  This work was published.  Earlier in the grant, we improved the Uv-visible data on the minerals olivine and forsterite which are common in space and meteorites.  We corrected previous mistakes in analyzing the transparent region between the infrared and visible. Our merges were provided electronically, with the publication.  The laboratory capabilites were improved so that data at relevant cold temperatures can be collected.       Last Modified: 12/19/2015       Submitted by: Anne M Hofmeister]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
