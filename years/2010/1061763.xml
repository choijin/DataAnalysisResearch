<AbstractNarration>The proposed work will focus on understanding calcification by marine organisms and will challenge the long-standing view that precipitation occurs via classical crystallization processes. The interpretation of many past studies is based on this notion. It now appears that most carbonate-producing organisms form skeletons by non-classical growth processes which involve an amorphous phase that transforms to a composite of mesocrystals over time. If this is true then the current approaches to inferring environmental effects, and interpreting paleo records, from analysis of calcite skeletons, either recently formed or preserved in marine sediments, will need to be revised as skeleton formation by non-classical processes relies on a different set of chemical and environmental conditions. The proposed research will build on recent findings which suggest that acidification, magnesium concentration, biomolecule chemistry and other factors all influence this pathway to mineralization. The project will investigate a number of hypotheses based on this new paradigm using laboratory studies and innovative analytical approaches. Kinetic and thermodynamic measurements and modeling will be coupled with chemical and structural investigations to establish a complete physical picture of the biomineralization pathway. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific broader impacts of the research go beyond the field of Chemical Oceanography and will have substantial impact if the proposed hypotheses are confirmed. The project has significant educational aspects, with the inclusion of both graduates and undergraduates in the research, and K-12 education development through the NSF-funded Earth to Life series.</AbstractNarration>

These findings have significant geochemical implications, but the question remains whether this transformation pathway is followed when biomineralization involves ACC or is particular to these inorganic experiments.      Many broader impacts emerged from this work for marine biomineralization and their significance grew to additional fields of science and engineering over the project period.      For example, the project complemented a separate effort by PI Dove and other scientists from the geosciences, materials, chemistry and physics international communities.  Their goal was to understand evidence from high-resolution studies that show many crystals grow by the formation and aggregation of different types of particles.  From this effort, we learned that the diverse set of pathways is governed by different types of kinetic factors that map over the traditional thermodynamic picture of crystal growth (De Yoreo et al., 2015, Science).   The ACC to carbonate mineral transformation focus of this NSF study is one of those pathways amongst many.      A predictive understanding of crystallization by particle attachment (CPA), which is now recognized to dominate also solution-based growth of important semiconductor, oxide, and metallic nanomaterials, promises advances in nanomaterials design and synthesis for diverse applications.  With a mechanism-based understanding, CPA processes can be exploited to produce hierarchical structures that retain the size-dependent attributes of their nanoscale building blocks and create materials with enhanced or novel physical and chemical properties.   The findings from this project, in combination with the emerging understanding of crystal growth by particle interactions, reiterate the need to revisit the traditional picture of chemical and physical controls on biomineral growth.  By approaching crystal growth through the lens of multiple particle-based pathways to crystallization, an improved process-based approach to mineral formation, including composition and properties, becomes possible for everything from marine animal skeletons to sediment formation and new materials synthesis for advanced technological applications.
