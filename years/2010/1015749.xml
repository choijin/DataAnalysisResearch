<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Technology integration in indigenous cultures can be a challenge without proper understanding of cultural differences, because these differences are rooted in technology design and define how one appropriates technology.  In this project, we set out to develop a localization and culture design toolkit. In addition to the toolkit, we also lay the foundation for a design pattern language. The goal of the toolkit and the design pattern language is to bridge the gap between ethnographic field knowledge and data, of the Aboriginal culture knowledge traditions and the traditional design process. The research activities entailed a brief ethnographic study of two Aboriginal communities, the historical Redfern Community located in the heart of Sydney, New South Wales (NSW) and the Brewarrina community, situated in the outback of NSW; and working with design experts to forge a design toolkit. The results of these activities were realized via four phases described below.  In phase one the expressed interest of the community regarding computing technology was evaluated.  Each Aboriginal group, referred to as a Mob, varies in language, values, practices, and customs. The elders of the Brewarrina community expressed interest in technology; its ability to fill a generation gap and undo the damage of history; educate the kids in respect to their heritage; and to fill the academic voids that exist in their community.  The members of the Redfern community are a mixture of aboriginals from various MobsÆ in NSW and Queensland. As a result, their concentration was more in terms of their struggles to reclaim the land, and its significance to the Aboriginal people as a whole.  In addition, their focal point where more geared towards the movement of unifying the aboriginal people.    In phase two, an analysis was conducted to explore the gap between expectations and what is provided by the current design approaches.  In Brewarrina, this was done via a focus group with the elders of Ourgunya, a womenÆs support organization.  We found that the priority for the Brewarrina community was a matter of identity, it was decided that the objective would be to structure an introduction of computer technology program and its use around the levels of identity within a community. Due to limited resources in the community the partner organization, OLPC Australia, supplied 10 XO laptops to the Brewarrina community. With these resources the end goal was to facilitate a 12-week pilot study where the laptops would be introduced as a community initiative that would reinforce culture and identity through learning.  As a result, the applications/activities featured on the laptops had to then reflect the goals of this initiative.  An analysis of the Redfern community determined a need for a very different design intervention from that of the Brewarrina community. The Redfern community was afforded with government created safe houses on the settlement, for the community children and was equipped with community centers where the community had access to technology, and structured learning opportunities in place. It was observed, that the disconnect existed more so in designing learning applications that accounted for their expressed needs and desires discovered in step one. Because the Redfern community had a different need set and available resources, it was decided that the objective for this community would be to create a design pattern that would inform a designer to account for their cultural conventions, constraints, and affordances unique to an urbanized aboriginal community.   In phase three, a cultural inquiry was conducted using the Cultural Relevance Design Framework (Eugene et al., 2009) to better depict the cultural conventions, constraints, and affordances of Aboriginal knowledge traditions within the technology.  The framework was only enacted with the Brewarrina community. Thus, equipped with the ideas of identity constructed in step one and the applications...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
