<AbstractNarration>The mathematical description and understanding of "diffusive processes" is central to many areas of science, from geometry and probability to continuum mechanics, fluid dynamics, population dynamics and game theory to name a few. Ricci flows, the Navier Stokes equation, non linear elasticity, futures options, all carry an element of diffusion, viscosity, uncertainty that correspond to a similar mathematical description. An extensive theory already permeates, under different circumstances and goals, wide areas of analysis, geometry and applied mathematics. The investigators perceive, however, that there are new, emerging areas of added complexity. It is expected that through the collaborative effort, new general methods will emerge providing some sort of unification and cohesion like the one existing today for classical infinitesimal diffusion processes and their role in the sciences (modeling, simulation, prediction).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problems which are to be studied include reaction diffusion phenomena in random environments, phase transition problems, non local diffusion processes and other applications  motivated by questions of population dynamics, congestion issues in transportation, diffusion and segregation phenomena in social sciences, formation and dynamics of hotspots of criminal activity, phase transition problems involving nonlocal (long range) interactions and surface diffusion related to electric fluid droplets and complex fluids in nano technology and biology. The project involves a system of personnel exchanges between the home institutions, designed to provide a rich training experience for students and postdocs. In addition, there will be an emphasis month every year of the project in one of the home universities and a summer school designed to bring members of the group - including graduate students and postdocs - together to stimulate scientific progress. In this way the fruits of the research will be exposed to a broader audience, thereby, helping educate and attract a new generation of researchers to these exciting emerging mathematical challenges and ideas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Non-local diffusion problems  Diffusion processes like heat propagation, elastic deformations, viscous flows were some of the first phenomena to be modeled through mathematical equations (Fourier law, Cauchy stress tensor, Navier Stokes equations) on the basis that the variation on the variable being modeled (temperature, density, velocity) at a given point was affected by the instantaneous influence of its infinitesimally close surrounding points, giving rise to the theory of space-time partial differential equations that now a day is central for the description of diverse phenomena, from geometric deformations of manifolds, to continuum mechanics like elasticity and phase transition in solids, to population dynamics , image processing, financial engineering.  But it has become apparent in recent years that many phenomena, both the classical ones described above as well as emerging ones like social dynamics, oceans atmosphere interaction, plasma physics are regulated by long range interactions and affected by past memory giving rise to diffusion processes that should be described by integral equations that incorporate the evolution process long distance and past interactions.  Some of the most relevant results of the Austin FRG group are the following:  Variational long-range equations with memory (Caffarelli and collaborators)  As in the case of second order equations, non-local diffusion processes arise in a variational context, usually related to geometry or continuum mechanics and non-variational in probability and optimal control  In the variational case, where equations arise as Euler Lagrange equations from energy minimization principles, it was already established (the DeGiorgi-Nash-Moser theory) in order to understand non linear equations one must develop a regularity theory for linear equations but in discontinuous media  The same philosophy holds for long-range equations.  A few years ago with Chan and Vassuer we developed the corresponding theory and as a continuation of that work, with Allen (an NSF postdoc under my mentorship) and Vasseur we developed the corresponding theory for processes with memory (we point out that the treatment of discontinuous equations is also fundamental in the study of random media, to obtain regularity and stability properties at every scale).  Processes with memory appear in particular in the modeling of reservoirs where deposition or chemical reactions modify the pressure density relation.  We also treated this case in the presence of potential pressure, a continuation of work with Soria and Vazquez.  The quasigeostrophic equation: transmission problems (by Dennis Kriventsov)  The quasigeostrophic equation is a non-local critical equation that describes the surface temperature of the ocean due to the atmosphere-ocean interaction.  The regularity of solutions was finally understood a few years ago.  An obvious question then becomes how do land and ocean interact in determining the passage of the surface temperature from one to the other. This is classically known as a transmission problem: we have an equation for the temperature in each domain and they interact at the transition line. But in this case, while the equation in land is a typical (local) heat equation, in the ocean is a non-local, integral equation, so the interaction goes deeply inside the corresponding domains.  Kriventsov, in his thesis gave a complete treatment of the problem at different scales from assuming rough knowledge of the configuration to fully regular data, in a completely new problem with original and deep analytical methods. (Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal)  Other related work  A series of papers with several coauthors concerning the Lasry Lions model for price formation.  Several authors studied this model and a few years ago, we discovered a connection with Boltzmann type processes that greatly simplify the understanding of these problems.
