<AbstractNarration>This project investigates computability, algorithmics, and complexity in distributed settings with large numbers of machines cooperating on solving computation problems in the presence of dynamic changes in the computing medium. The computation problems are modeled as collections of tasks, such as the problems frequently occurring in the Internet supercomputing. This research has the potential to impact massive cooperative computing in dynamic settings through the use of rigorously developed algorithms with formally proved efficiency and fault-tolerance guarantees. In the longer term this research will also have impact on the development of broader classes of adaptive distributed systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops advanced algorithms enabling efficient and fault-tolerant cooperative computing in dynamic distributed settings. The basic problem is formulated in terms of a collection of processors that need to perform a set of tasks, where the tasks must be executed using either at-least-once or at-most-once semantics. The research considers dynamic settings that are representative of situations in Internet supercomputing. The models of cooperation include: (a) oracle model, where a central authority provides information to the participants. (b) master-worker model, where a single master coordinates the workers in performing the tasks, a typical setting in Internet supercomputing. (c) peer-to-peer mode, where fully-distributed solutions will be investigated, enabling much more dynamic and fault-tolerant solutions. The investigation includes the associated resource discovery problem of identifying the nodes in the distributed system that are willing and able to cooperate; here the investigation focuses on more realistic settings than previously considered. This research also studies supporting services that can provide effective implementations of communication and shared-memory primitives in target dynamic platforms. The quality of algorithms is evaluated using corresponding lower bounds and impossibility results.</AbstractNarration>

We also consider efficient implementations of distributed supporting services, such as atomic memory abstraction in message-passing distributed settings. Lastly we consider optimizing deployment of abstract distributed systems on specific networked platforms.   The outcomes of the project closely correspond to the three main research areas: 1) Dsitributed cooperative problems, 2) Distributed resource discovery, and 3) Supporting services, where our focus was primarily on consistent replicated dsitributed memory services and built-in gossip services. The project develop a series of algorithms covering each area.   Intellectual merit:   Our research develops advanced algorithms enabling efficient and fault-tolerant cooperative computing in dynamic distributed settings. We also investigate the associated resource discovery problem dealing with the identification of the nodes in a distributed system that are willing and able to cooperate. Our initial approach is formulated in terms of the problem of p processors performing n tasks in a dynamic distributed setting.

This project also studies supporting services that can provide effective implementations of communication and shared-memory primitives in target dynamic platforms. The quality of our algorithms is evaluated using corresponding lower bounds and impossibility results.    Broader impacts: The project will developed advanced algorithms for efficient and fault-tolerant cooperative computing and resource discovery in dynamic distributed settings. We believe that a methodical investigation such as the one we are conducting is timely as much prior research pursued limited topics addressing narrower dimensions of the overall problem, and sometimes without a deep theoretical basis. The consequences of our research in the near to medium term has the potential to impact massive cooperative computing in dynamic settings, including the Internet, through the use of rigorously developed algorithms with rigorously proved efficiency and fault-tolerance guarantees. The potential benefits extend to important Internet supercomputing projects such as seti@home, fight_aids}@home---a humanitarian biomedical distributed computing project. In the long run, we believe that this research will also have impact on the development of broader classes of adaptive distributed systems.    Dissemination of results: Research results were disseminated through the web, traditional conference and journal publications, and seminars.
