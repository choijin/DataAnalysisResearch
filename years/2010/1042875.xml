<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking full advantage of community colleges as sources of science and engineering majors is an important component of the nation?s science and technology policy. President Obama has emphasized the criticality of science and technology to the nation?s future competitiveness and welfare, the importance of community colleges within US higher education, and his intention to focus on community colleges as a key part of his strategy to increase the number of college graduates.&lt;br/&gt;Within the engineering and engineering technology communities, the most critical role of community colleges is as feeders to baccalaureate engineering and engineering technology programs. Indeed, some states (e.g., California and Florida) explicitly depend on community colleges as a key pathway for students seeking baccalaureate degrees in all fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this effort is to conduct a pilot surveying of 2-year and 4-year colleges about enrollments, degree attainments, and transfers by e/et students. This can be implemented in a pilot of 50 (35 2-year and 15 4-year) institutions. Data will assist with better understanding and enhancing the role of community colleges in contributing to the baccalaureate engineering population. The immediate impact of this project will be on determining e/et key data from a pilot population of community college e/et students and their transfer to baccalaureate e/et programs.</AbstractNarration>

Many states acknowledge the critical role of their community colleges as feeders to baccalaureate engineering and engineering technology programs in their state universities but when this project began in 2011 there was insufficient data on the numbers of engineering and engineering technology students enrolled in two-year degree programs at community colleges that successfully transfer to four-year engineering and engineering technology degree programs.  The twofold goal of the pilot project was to determine how many students had substantially completed a two-year engineering or engineering technology program and then transferred to an engineering program at a four-year institution and to identify barriers and challenges for these students.

The engineering colleges varied by status (public or private), highest engineering degree granted (i.e., doctorate, masterÆs, bachelorÆs), and institutional focus (e.g., international research, national research, regional comprehensive). The project data (Figures 1 and 2) indicated that two-year transfer engineering student populations are typically more diverse than four-year "resident" students in the two- and four-year schools surveyed&mdash;thereÆs a higher representation of African-American, Latino, and first-generation students&mdash;and the overall BS degree graduation rates of two-year transfer students are comparable to those of students that began their engineering studies at four-year schools.
