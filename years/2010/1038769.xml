<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) is to understand how nanobioprinting affects cell viability and function. The effect of two parameters will be explored.  1. Nanoparticle size and composition; and 2. Nanoparticle location relative to the cell.  Through these objectives, the fundamental understanding of cell-nanoparticle interactions in the bioprinting process will be advanced. This will lead towards advanced studies of nanobioprinting and closer to realizing large scale production of nano-functionalized tissue engineering structures for transplantation and drug discovery.  The intellectual merit of this research lies in discovery of nanoparticle interaction with micron-scale cells in nanomanufacturing processes, and how this interaction translates into biological outcomes. By understanding fundamental mechanisms, nanoparticles can be manufactured and used in ways which minimize cellular effects. Most importantly, these studies will enable scale-up of micro- and macro-scale robust, viable tissue engineering constructs with integrated nanostructures. The dynamic manipulation and tracking of cells and bioactive factors within these structures has potential to transform tissue engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the research project is in its potential to enhance knowledge of nanoparticle biochemical and biomechanical effects, in particular how nanoparticles and cell interact in the bioprinting system. This has a wide reach in nanomanufacturing for medicine, since nanoparticles interact with mechanosensitive tissues (vasculature, bones, lungs) when used for imaging or cancer treatment. Discovery of nanoparticle parameters that minimize negative interaction between nanoparticles and cell mechanics could create safer, more effective nanotherapy. The broader impacts of the project's educational program are to show mechanical engineers how nanotechnology can be applied to improve healthcare, as well as to inspire future engineers through cutting edge technology in a social context.</AbstractNarration>
