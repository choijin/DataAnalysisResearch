<AbstractNarration>With this award Professors Lacks and Sankaran of the Department of Chemical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) will carry out collaborative research with faculty from the University of Botswana (UB).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project, students from the U.S.  and UB together will engage in research on sustainable energy. The projects will be supervised by UB faculty in the Departments of Physics, Biology and Mechanical Engineering and will address topics within the theme of sustainable energy relevant to the desert environment ? specifically, solar energy and biofuels from plants that thrive in arid conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is its multidisciplinary approach to sustainable energy research. Projects address materials for solar devices (both solar concentrators and photovoltaic devices), a study of the technical/economic/ecological/social barriers limiting energy use in Botswana, and the characterization of varieties of locally grown crops (sorghum) for their use as biofuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include training students in sustainable energy research with a global perspective and development and dissemination of knowledge on the multidisciplinary nature of sustainability. To further support the development of a global science and technology workforce, the project includes professional development activities, including weekly research seminars and journal club meetings, as well as social and cultural activities. These efforts build upon successful mentorship of undergraduate research by Professors Lacks and Sankaran as well as existing sustainable energy initiatives of the government of Botswana. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by NSF?s Office of International Science and Engineering and its Engineering Directorate?s division of Chemical, Biological, Environmental and Transportation (CBET) engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

To enhance the global experience component of the program for the US students, 21 undergraduate students from UB also participated in the program. The program ran for 4 weeks during the summer break for US students (it is also the academic break at UB), during four summers (2011-14).  The broader impact of the program is to train US students in research on sustainable energy with a global perspective, specifically, with application to developing countries in arid environments. Botswana is in the midst of major energy initiatives to become self-sufficient for energy generation and to provide electricity for small villages thinly spread across a large desert (85% of rural households in Botswana do not have electricity). Sustainable energy processes can provide power to rural villages without requiring (a very expensive) connection to a national energy grid.  This program also  provides a unique opportunity for students to combine research on sustainable energy with cultural awareness, to develop a æbig-pictureÆ understanding of sustainable energy in a global context.  The intellectual merit of the program is the research in the area of sustainable energy with a particular focus on sub-Saharan Africa. The research projects included a study of economic and social factors affecting access to electricity in Botswana villages, materials for solar devices using dyes from local plants, harvesting of local plants for biodiesel and ethanol, potential for wind energy in Botswana, and lightweight composite materials composed of fibers from local plants.  The research has led to 5 conference presentations.       Last Modified: 06/21/2015       Submitted by: Daniel J Lacks]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
