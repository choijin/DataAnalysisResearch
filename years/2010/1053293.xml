<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamic behavior of polymers near interfaces is critical to performance in a broad range of high-technology applications. The objective of this CAREER research is to develop an understanding of the parameters controlling the diffusion of polymers nanoconfined between interfaces and to use this information to construct theories that enable predictive capabilities. The dependence of bulk polymer diffusion on fundamental variables, such as chain length and temperature, is well understood and this information will provide a strong foundation for comparison of diffusion at the nanoscale. In this research, the diffusion of polymers nanoconfined between well-controlled planar interfaces will be studied using fluorescence techniques. Living polymerizations will be used to synthesize polymers with low polydispersity indexes containing covalently-bound, thermally-stable fluorophores that do not affect the glass transition of the film. The proposed research program seeks to: 1) Determine how diffusion coefficients of simple polymers composed of chemically identical units (i.e. homopolymers) are affected by the size of the confining dimension and by interactions between the polymer and the confining interfaces. 2) Identify the relationships between chain architecture and the fundamental mechanisms of interfacial diffusion by varying backbone rigidity, chain linearity (branched or star polymers), and by employing model block copolymers that self-assemble in specific ways when confined between interfaces with differing surface chemistry. 3) Develop theories, ascertain scaling relationships and construct predictive models that enhance capabilities for designing high-performance nanostructured materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to perform a study of polymer molecule movement parallel to surfaces when the surfaces are separated by a distance comparable to the size of the polymer molecule. This understanding is important in a variety of technological applications, such as hard drive lubrication and microelectronics manufacturing, and in biological processes within cells. For example, certain properties of polymers can be improved by mixing polymers with clay; this study will help explain how the polymer moves in spaces between individual clay particles during the mixing process. The overall result of this project will be a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that control polymer motion near and in-between surfaces which will improve design rules for new advanced materials and enhance the understanding of polymer physics. To complement the research, the outreach and educational component of this CAREER project is to revive and expand the interest of society and students at all levels in STEM careers, especially targeting those who represent diversity with respect to economic status, ethnicity and gender. The CAREER award will allow the PI to develop a Minority Teaching Fellows program that pairs graduate student colleagues with minority teachers from Title 1 high-schools to conduct cutting-edge research and develop new high-school curricula involving modern issues of polymeric materials. Through active participation, graduate students will also develop new appreciation for current issues of math, science and engineering education and societal viewpoints of careers in these disciplines. Additionally, to more broadly reach K-12 students, the PI and graduate student colleagues will develop Engineering Expeditions modules to be incorporated into Explore UT, an on campus day of performances, exhibits, lectures and hands-on activities. This event is free and involves a broad cross-section of the public and K-12 students from all over the State of Texas with whom the PI and graduate students will interact through hands-on demonstrations highlighting "why plastics do what they do".</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding large-scale polymer dynamics, or mobility of polymers, under nanoconfinement is critical to advance nanotechnology; this knowledge can be exploited for tailoring material properties on the nanometer length scale, such as for lubrication coatings or forming robust gas barrier layers for flexible electric devices, among others.  This project studied how the interfaces between polymer/substrate or polymer/air influenced polymer dynamics when the polymer was confined by walls separated by a distance comparable to the size of the polymer molecule.  We have developed a method to evaluate the self-diffusion coefficient (D) in polymer thin films (20-300 nm thick films, molecular size is ~3 nm in this case) by fluorescent microscopy, which is called fluorescence recovery after patterned photobleaching (FRAPP). The D corresponds to the average distance that the molecule can travel in a certain time and can be regarded as the mobility of the molecule.  We revealed that the self-diffusion is accelerated or restricted depending on the nature of the neighboring interfaces.  The fundamental insights from this study could enable control of the mobility of confined viscous polymer liquids by tailoring the confining interfaces, which is crucial for advancing nanotechnology and nanofabrication.    During an early FRAPP experiment, we serendipitously discovered a method to photochemically harness surface tension driven flow to nano- and micro-pattern thin polymer films or coatings.  The surface tension driven flow, often referred to as Marangoni flow, drives transport of the film materials from low to high surface tension regions, and a well-known example can be seen in the so-called "tears of wine" effect.  We first photochemically define the surface tension patterns via light exposure through a photomask in a solid glassy polymer film.  Upon subsequently heating the polymer to the liquid state, polymer flow generates three-dimensional topographical patterns reflective of the original light exposure pattern.  This patterning method does not involve solvent development, etching protocols, or physical contact with photomasks, suggesting it could be implemented in a high throughput manufacturing environment.  We believe that this concept could be useful to generate topographically patterned films or coatings for controlling adhesion, improving photonic device efficiency, and directing cellular alignment, among other applications.  This project also offered educational opportunities for a diverse science community, including one high school student, more than ten undergraduate students, three graduate students, two postdoctoral scholars, and one high school teacher.  Everyone had ample opportunity to experience hands-on lab activities along with honing his or her presentation skills through group meetings and attending national and international technical meetings.  These experiences enriched their academic careers as well as the community by educating the next generation of scientists and engineers.
