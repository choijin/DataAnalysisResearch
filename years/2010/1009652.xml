<AbstractNarration>This theoretical work investigates hierarchical galaxy formation, using Andromeda (M31) galaxy and its streams and satellite galaxies as a test case. The close-by barred-spiral Andromeda galaxy is the only large galaxy in addition the Milky Way for which detailed measurements of the kinematics and elemental abundance of numerous individual stars can be obtained reasonably well. Here comprehensive modeling of M31's halo is done by constructing simulation-based dynamical models for each of the major halo components. The structure of the galaxy's halo is the result of the hierarchical assembly process of galaxies and the interpretation of the observations can be done by through numerical simulations of the formation process. The importance to know about the M31 halo is that this helps to better understand the building blocks, buildup history, and dark halo properties of spiral galaxies in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major goals here are to constrain the mass profile of Andromeda's halo and the shape of its gravitational potential by using N-body simulations to model the dynamics for the large satellites of Andromeda, including the M31 Giant Stellar Stream (GSS), M33, M32, and NGC 205. The dynamical models are compared to large photometric data sets and velocity measurements to reconstruct the formation of halo streams. Bayesian methods are used to go beyond the construction of plausible individual models to quantified model uncertainties, parameter correlations, and objective comparisons of different models. Once the most prominent components have been modeled, the team plans to generate a description of the remaining, more fully mixed smooth halo component. These results will check the current observational evidence that M31, like the Milky Way, is an apparent outlier in the cosmic stellar mass/halo mass relation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will have impact on a wide range of astrophysical research, as it concerns the structure of ubiquitous dark matter haloes. The model results are distributed in a public database, and a website will provide simulations and visualizations of models from this project. The research provides good projects for graduate and undergraduate students, which helps to train the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The stars within galaxies are moving too quickly for them to be held together just by the matter we can see.  This implies most of the mass in and around a galaxy is provided by invisible dark matter.  By studying very large samples of galaxies, astronomers have gradually come to realize that the total mass is the most important factor in determining most of the properties of a galaxy.  If we focus instead on individual, nearby galaxies like our neighbor M31 (also called the Andromeda galaxy), we can see details that are normally invisible in our samples of many galaxies.  We can observe small satellite galaxies; infer the detailed history of star formation in M31 and its satellites; and see a faint extended halo of stars, extending at least twenty times as far the typical distance of stars in M31's stellar disk.  Unfortunately, the total mass in M31 is uncertain by a factor of three, which means that it is hard to connect our detailed understanding of M31 with that of the general galactic population. The goal of our project was to make this connection, by studying this faint stellar halo and determining the total mass of M31.  In the solar system, the motion of planets around the Sun can tell us the Sun's mass.  Similarly, the motion of objects in M31's halo should tell us M31's total mass, both visible and dark matter.  But rather than having isolated planets orbiting in nearly circular orbits, M31's halo is more like a junkyard.  Many satellite galaxies overlay each other in various degrees of disassembly, from intact to totally shredded.  Our efforts thus went first to disentangling and studying the various entities in the stellar halo; and later, to understanding the orbits and using them to constrain M31's dark matter component.  The broader impacts of this work included research supervision and training of one graduate student and two undergraduates; in addition, several other graduate students and three high school students played crucial roles in our research.  The first outcome of our project was a better understanding of the M31 and MW halos, in work mostly conducted with the international PAndAS and SPLASH collaborations.  This work established newer, more accurate distances to satellite galaxies of M31, found new galaxy candidates, and measured the spatial distribution and elemental mix of stars in satellite galaxies.  We also found that many of the satellites in M31 are not moving randomly as was thought, but instead move coherently on a thin plane, which is challenging to explain in our current picture of galaxy formation.  We measured the velocities of M31's globular clusters, and established that at least some move along with streams of stars produced by ripped-up satellite galaxies.  We measured the mass in stars and motion of several diffuse clouds of stars in the halo.  We studied the component of the halo that is not in recognizable satellites or streams, finding it gets smoother (less lumpy) for stars containing fewer heavy elements, and that it is stretched perpendicular to M31's stellar disk.  We also studied the Milky Way halo stars seen in the direction of M31, finding lumps and streams in our own galaxy as well.  The second outcome of our project was a deeper understanding of the streams of stars produced when satellite galaxies are disrupted by the gravity of their host galaxy.  We formulated a recipe to quickly model stellar streams and avoid the need for time-consuming computer simulations of the entire disrupting galaxy.  While studying this problem, we noticed that chaotic orbits (those where the future behavior is intrinsically unpredictable) have visible effects on stellar streams, and developed methods for understanding this chaotic behavior better.  And we studied what happens when these streams broaden into into shells due to repeated close encounters with their host, finding that we can still get useful information about the shells and the gravity field they move in.  The third outcome of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
