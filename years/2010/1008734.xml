<AbstractNarration>Dr. Szkody and her collaborators will conduct three projects on interacting binary stars.  In the first, they will measure changes in the orbital period of the only known eclipsing binary of the AM CVn type; this will yield the rate of orbital energy lost through the emission of gravitational radiation.  The second project will measure the temperatures and other properties of pulsating white dwarf stars to determine the location of the onset of instability.  Finally, they will investigate certain other systems to measure changes in angular momentum with mass accretion, which may shed light on the formation of Type Ia supernovae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects are expected to have an impact in several areas of binary evolution.  For example, understanding the gravitational wave radiation from binaries will help distinguish signals of individual objects from cosmological signals in future gravitational wave experiments such as LISA (Laser Gravitational Wave Antenna).  This team will also provide research and analysis opportunities for undergraduate students and high school teachers.</AbstractNarration>
