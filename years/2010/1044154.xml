<AbstractNarration>The majority of student enrolling in introductory algebra-based physics courses are life science majors. Yet essential physics topics for biology, such as fluids, often receive little or unsuitable coverage in these classes.  An understanding of fluids is essential to the practice of many of these majors, including those who pursue careers in medicine: organisms live in fluid environments and fluids inside the body carry out many essential functions.  Our current knowledge of student understanding of fluids is sparse and so our pedagogy on this topic is relatively uninformed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research-based curricular interventions and assessment questions enable a more informed pedagogical approach to teaching fluids. The research of this award is examining students' current state of knowledge of fluids through interviews that elucidate student preconceptions about fluids and student resources (both productive and unproductive) for reasoning about fluids.  These findings are then serving to help in the design of guided inquiry labs, tutorials, quantitative questions, as well as formative and summative assessment tools. The research systematically examines assessment questions for validity and reliability with the objective of constructing a fluids concept inventory, while also assessing the curricular interventions for effectiveness in improving student understanding. The broad impact of this award is apparent, as these deliverables enable instructors at any institution with a course for life science majors to offer a tested, research-based curriculum on fluids with topics of high interest to life science students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Abstract: The PIs proposed to augment current pedagogical strategies and tools for teaching fluids to life science students in an introductory physics courses for life science (IPLS) at the University of New England (UNE) and the University of New Hampshire (UNH). The PIs investigated students? current state of knowledge of fluids using 1) individual demonstration/simulation interviews, 2) think aloud interviews and 3) paper and pencil conceptual questions.  Using resource theory as a guide, data analysis focused on identification of common conceptions among students as well as productive and unproductive resources for understanding fluids. Based on students? initial states of understanding and expert advice on how fluids are used by those in life science/medical professions, the PIs developed attainable learning goals, curricular interventions, and assessment questions related to fluids. These assessment questions were used to assess the curricular interventions for effectiveness in improving student understanding.  Finally, they began evaluating the open-ended assessment questions with the eye toward the construction of a fluids concept inventory.  With this NSF-TUES award (#DUE-1044154), May 2010-May 2016, fundamental research on Introductory Physics for Life Science (IPLS) students? understanding of fluids resulted in a much deeper understanding of the difficulties encounter when learning this content, specifically addressing the following concepts: 1) Continuity, 2) Bernoulli principle, 3) Hagen Poiseuille relationship, 4) Resistance in Fluid Flow, 5) Velocity profile of fluid flow, 6) Viscosity, 7) Reynolds number, and 8) Laminar versus turbulent flow.  With an awareness of these difficulties coupled with advice from life science and medical experts, the PIs made several key changes to the IPLS courses offered at UNE and UNH  Adapted the sequence of the IPLS course increased the coverage to the seven-week fluid units by reducing mechanics content without any loss to conceptual understanding as measured by traditional concept inventories to the latter.   Refocused content to allow students to couple their understanding of conservation of linear momentum to introduce the kinetic theory and ideal gas relationship in order to give a deeper understanding of pressure. Development of two kinesthetic models, one on the circulatory system and another on macroscopic diffusion.  These models were incorporated into instructional modules using a modeling-based curriculum to allow students to explore how these systems function together. Developed a research-based intervention for all the fluid dynamics laboratory activities.   In addition, the PIs began developing a research-based survey of students understanding of Fluid Dynamics under the direction of R. Lindell (Purdue University). During this process 1) Delphi surveys of experts from biology, physics and biophysics, 2) Development of the concept domain, 3) Development of initial items for each concept listed in the domain, 4) Generation of potential open-ended items and 5) Field testing of potential open-ended items to generate common student responses.  At this stage of the process, the PIs decided they wanted to focus on developing a two-tier diagnostic concept inventory, rather than just a survey of the items.  It is expected that these results will lead to a future grant on the part of the PIs and R. Lindell.  Based on these results the PIs presented three workshops, five talks/posters and published five peer-review articles.  Undergraduate research students were utilized throughout the project and the undergraduate students were among the authors on three of the presentations/ posters and were lead author on all five publications.
