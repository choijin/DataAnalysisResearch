<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation, Professor Jon D. Rainier of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah will explore the development of synthetic methodology aimed at the generation of quaternary centers with a focus on quaternary substituted indolines. These efforts will target the generation of strained substrates and their use in the synthesis of elaborate organic substrates and could lead to more efficient and more general methods to synthesize highly congested stereocenters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These efforts could have an impact in industries as diverse as the pharmaceutical, biotech, chemical, and environmental industries.  In addition to its impact on synthetic chemistry, this work will play a broad and important role in the training and education of undergraduate and graduate students in the science of chemical synthesis. This group of scientists will help to ensure that the United States continues to remain a leader in the development and application of new technologies.</AbstractNarration>
