<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on Learning Through Service (LTS), a pedagogical method that combines academic learning with service. Engaging investigators from five diverse institutions, the project is invoking a 4D Process (Discover, Distill, Design, Disseminate) to evaluate the impacts on faculty currently engaged in LTS efforts and to empower additional faculty to implement LTS.  Major activities that are being undertaken include surveying and interviewing engaged faculty; convening  a meeting of experts in LTS program/course designs, implementations, and assessments; conducting intensive faculty training workshops on LTS that lead to new LTS efforts at course and program levels; and sustaining faculty engagement via a continued dissemination of efforts.  Assessment research methodologies (development and use) are being integrated throughout these activities. The project engages faculty through systemic implementation and support for LTS in engineering education. The project expands the use of LTS in engineering education and highlight LTS as a viable research endeavor and scholarly activity. The project identifies challenges and facilitators to LTS for different faculty and institution types.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary - Engineering Faculty Engagement in Learning Through Service     Our project had two main goals: (1) Understand the motivations, obstacles, and strategies for university engineering faculty who offer learning through service (LTS) opportunities, and (2) increase the involvement of engineering faculty engaged in LTS     The methodology used by this five-university partnership followed four phases: Discover, Distill, Design, Disseminate (note: a fifth phase, Deliver, was originally proposed, but not funded).  The process started with the Discovery stage - reviewing previous Learning Through Service (LTS) efforts through the examination of LTS engineering faculty leaders/experts, and learning from their experiences in LTS design and implementation. From these interviews, recommended practices were identified - the Distill stage. The wisdom captured in the Distill stage served as the basis of materials created for workshops - the Design stage. The process proceeded to spreading the best practices and expert advice through the designed resources in workshops and conference presentations - the Disseminate stage.  The unfunded Deliver stage was to facilitate LTS agents at universities to drive reform at their institution and beyond. A cost-free approach to the Deliver stage was initiated.      The five partners and the primary contributions included:      Tufts University &mdash; project oversight and workshop facilitation  University of Colorado &mdash; workshop hosting, facilitation, and outcomes  University of Massachusetts-Lowell &mdash; LTS expert ethnographies  James Madison University &mdash; workshop assessment, national LTS assessment  Michigan Tech &mdash; workshop design, hosting, and facilitation         This portion of the collaborative project (Michigan Tech co-PI) focused on two primary tasks:     1.) design and creation of summit and workshop materials (Design phase)  2.) facilitation of summit and workshops (Disseminate phase)     The Michigan Tech co-PI also co-led a revised approach to the Deliver stage, specifically the creation of a scholarly learning community focused on LTS in engineering.     Specific tasks undertaken by the Michigan Tech research team included:   1.) EFELTS Summit &mdash; convened an expert focus groups on existing LTS program/course designs, implementations, and assessments. This event was hosted by the University of Colorado-Boulder, and held September 22-24, 2011.  The summit was structured to better understand the successes, challenges, strategies, and recommendations of a multidisciplinary cadre of well-experienced learning through service faculty leaders. Invitees covered a range of disciplines, positions, and institutions to provide a rich array of experiences and contexts.      2.) EFELTS Workshops &mdash; conducted three intensive faculty training workshops on LTS.  The first workshop was hosted by Michigan Technological University, August 9-10, 2012. Sixteen participants were invited, their attendance was fully supported by the grant. To elevate chances for institutional change, applicants were encouraged to bring a colleague; nearly two-thirds of our participants were so accompanied.  The two-day workshops were designed to foster a more informed faculty practitioner, effectively transferring wisdom from the experts gathered at the Summit. The workshops were also designed to be an opportunity to critically reflect, explore, build, and share current or planned LTS opportunities.      The second workshop was hosted by the University of Colorado - Boulder and held September 14-15, 2012. Nineteen participants were invited.  The Colorado workshop was a refined version of the Michigan Tech workshop (with the above noted decrease in worksheet time and increase in poster session time).     The third workshop was hosted by Purdue University, June 18-20, 2014 immediately following the ASEE Annual Conference in Indianapolis. We were able to invite 71 participants. The Purdue workshop,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
