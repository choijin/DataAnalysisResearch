<AbstractNarration>Network resource allocation deals with efficiently managing the&lt;br/&gt;scarce resources available with the objective of providing us&lt;br/&gt;with practical algorithms to achieve high performance in&lt;br/&gt;wireless networks. On the other hand, network information&lt;br/&gt;theory develops conceptual tools to build new mechanisms to&lt;br/&gt;exploit the full capacity of wireless networks. Currently there&lt;br/&gt;is a significant gap between the information theoretic&lt;br/&gt;capacities of wireless networks and the performances achieved&lt;br/&gt;by existing resource allocation schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to bridge these two separate perspectives to close&lt;br/&gt;this performance gap. To that end, it develops practical network&lt;br/&gt;algorithms over an underlying infrastructure of multiuser channels&lt;br/&gt;along with the appropriate information theoretic mechanisms. To achieve&lt;br/&gt;this task, it proceeds along the following main research thrusts: (1)&lt;br/&gt;network design, which involves the optimal construction and dynamic&lt;br/&gt;update of multiuser channels; (2) network control, based on joint&lt;br/&gt;optimization of physical and the network layers and the development of&lt;br/&gt;the necessary stochastic optimization tools; (3) design of&lt;br/&gt;low-complexity multiuser channel schedulers with a near-optimal&lt;br/&gt;performance; (4) performance evaluation of the developed algorithms&lt;br/&gt;through real link-level measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the research has the potential to give us performance&lt;br/&gt;gains by more than an order of magnitude, which will enable the design&lt;br/&gt;and implementation of faster, more reliable, and more robust wireless&lt;br/&gt;networks operating under a variety of conditions. Dissemination of the&lt;br/&gt;research will be achieved by submitting the results for publication in&lt;br/&gt;refereed scholarly journals, presentation in conferences and symposia,&lt;br/&gt;and lectures and workshops in academic and industrial settings.</AbstractNarration>
