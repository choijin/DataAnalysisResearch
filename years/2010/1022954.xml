<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to create a series of topical and sustainable Faculty Learning Communities. The project will make use of many components developed by the previous Center for Workshops in the Chemical Sciences NSF-CCLI project. Based, in part, on a series of 45 workshops held at 25 consortium institutions, the project is providing faculty members with numerous opportunities to take leadership roles and to develop mentoring partnerships and collaborations. The workshops provide participants with high quality curricular materials to enhance their own teaching and to equip them to become active in extensive post-workshop activities. Participants are engaged as presenters of new workshops, mini-workshops and outreach activities, and as developers/moderators of topical community websites using a common web infrastructure. The project includes mini-grants to support faculty members in curriculum revision and outreach. A multifaceted evaluation program provides formative and summative assessments that extend to the individual student learning level, and allow the overall project to respond to the needs of individual participants within the developing communities in order to ensure the development, sharing and adoption of educational products at a broad set of institutions. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The goal of the project is to provide significant opportunities for faculty development and thereby enhance student learning. While workshops are an effective mechanism for faculty development, their impact is limited if considered in isolation. Accordingly, the project makes use of extensive post-workshop engagement in the formulation of communities of scholars. A series of five-day workshops serves as one entr√©e to these communities, and a series of post-workshop activities insures extended engagement of participants at a variety of different levels. The project provides resources to support new dissemination initiatives through partnerships with other STEM education efforts. The selection of topics and level of workshops presentations are driven by participant needs, established by a comprehensive evaluation program and with input from an Advisory Committee. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. Improvement in education in the chemical sciences is vital to maintaining the scientific foundation of the nation. Faculty development and training are important endeavors in continuous improvement of student learning and classroom experiences. Workshops are presented by faculty at a wide variety of institutions, including research universities, predominantly undergraduate institutions, and, for the first time, community colleges. The project is hosting 900 participants in workshops in 2011-2015, another 900 (or more) in outreach activities, and many others through web-based communities. A mature recruitment process allows the project to attract a diverse set of participants, with specific initiatives to recruit minority faculty members and instructors at community colleges. By the end of the five-year program, the network of instructors who have used workshop materials is expected to have had an impact on more than 180,000 students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Chemistry Collaborations, Workshops and Communities of Scholars program (cCWCS) is the successor of the Center for Workshops in the Chemical Sciences (CWCS).  The Forensic Science workshops were offered and the Forensic Science Scholars Faculty Learning community was developed under this auspices. Overarching goals of the program were to:                   Engage a diverse set of faculty and instructors in curriculum reform through the dissemination, adoption and adaptation of tested high-quality curriculum materials and pedagogies.                   Enhance participants? knowledge and experience in selected areas.                   Expose participants to emerging scientific fields derived from current research activity.                   Facilitate incorporation of workshop materials into the instructional activities of the participants.   The major activity of this project was conducting a series of workshops in Forensic Science. The workshops were presented with very specific objectives - provide the participants with the resources in the field of forensic science to develop any type of instructional unit they desire. This could include the development of an illustrative demonstration in an existing course; a module for the lecture part of an existing course; an experiment as part of the laboratory program in an existing course; the development of a new laboratory program with numerous experiments; the development of a new course in forensic science tailored for non-science majors or science (chemistry) majors; the development of a new program in forensic science.   In general, it is clear that the participants of the forensic science workshops obtained a significant amount of scientific knowledge and new pedagogical approaches that will be invaluable in their future roles as instructors in STEM education.  A significant number of the 112 participants who attended the seven workshops have corresponded with the PI and told him of the educational activities already undertaken at their home institutions.  The Forensic Science workshops had the following format:  Day 0: Arrive at Williams College;  Become Certified as a Criminalist; Welcoming Dinner  Crime Scene &ndash; Process Crime Scene  Day 1: Processing the Crime Scene, Legal Issues with Scientific Evidence  Trace Evidence &ndash; Glass (Refractive Index, Density); Fibers (Differential Staining, Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy); Ink (Thin Layer Chromatography); Fingerprinting (Powder, Wetwop, Ninhydrin, Superglue Fuming, Inkless Fingerprinting)  Day 2: Arson (Purge-Trap, Gas Chromatography); Ballistics (Stereomicroscope, Comparison Microscope, Scanning Electron Microscope, Analysis of Gunshot Residue); Heavy Metal Poison (Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy); Presumptive Analysis of Drugs and Alcohol (On-Site Coupled Enzyme Assay, microLine, Narcotics Identification Kit)  Day 3: Evidentiary Analysis of Drugs and Alcohol &ndash; Analysis of Breath and Saliva for Alcohol (Breathalyzer, Intoxilyzer); Analysis of Urine for Drugs (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry); Analysis of Suspected Drugs (ATR-FTIR)  Day 4: Serology &ndash; Testing for the Presence of Blood, Blood Typing (A, B, AB, O); DNA Profiling (Polymerase Chain Reaction of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA)Banquet with Keynote Speaker Day 5: Finish DNA Profiling (Dot-Blot, Capillary Electrophoresis)Evaluation; Resource Packet; Conclusion of Workshop       Last Modified: 06/25/2018       Submitted by: Lawrence J Kaplan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
