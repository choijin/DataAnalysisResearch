<AbstractNarration>Ranid frogs, comprising 23% of frog species, are declining globally, and their evolutionary relationships remain poorly understood. This project will address conflicts in previous phylogenetic studies of ranid frogs by compiling a dataset of DNA sequences for eleven genes and 400 morphological characters, for 250 species, representing all major lineages. Phylogenetic analysis of complementary morphological and molecular datasets will address contemporary analytical challenges (DNA sequence alignment, algorithm choice, optimization criteria), while re-evaluating legacy data with newly generated data. The analysis will provide a rigorous, independent assessment of recent molecular hypotheses, produce a revised classification of ranid frog families and genera, and test hypotheses of character evolution, life history, ecology, behavior and biogeography concerning ranid frogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A postdoctoral researcher will lead the project and collaborate with colleagues at four participating institutions. One graduate, nine undergraduate, and six high school students will be mentored. An international workshop will be held. Fieldwork will be conducted in Africa and Asia. A project website will host research products, including bibliography, illustrations, photographs, descriptions, identification keys, atlas and glossary of terminology. Data will be archived in open web repositories. These resources will facilitate future studies on ranid frogs and assist biologists, laymen and conservationists to identify them.</AbstractNarration>

The global amphibian extinction crisis highlights the urgency of understanding the relationships between major lineages of frogs, so that informed decisions can be made regarding their conservation planning. This is important for rare, old lineages with few living representatives.   Molecular genomic data and information from morphology (osteology and external morphology of adult frogs, and tadpole data) were gathered from all ranoid lineages, on a global scale.
