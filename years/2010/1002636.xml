<AbstractNarration>The PI will study how combinatorial structure of partially ordered sets (posets) gives information about associated algebraic and topological structures.   Specifically, she seeks ways to use the combinatorics of a face poset or closure poset together with limited topological information (e.g. information about codimension one cell incidences) to determine topological information such as rational homology or even in some cases homeomorphism type.  A main goal is to prove that various stratified spaces whose closure posets are thin and shellable are in fact regular CW complexes.  She also aims to construct boundary maps on important classes of posets such as geometric lattices, motivated by potential applications e.g. in theoretical computer science.  She will also study representations of simple Lie algebras via an analysis of local structure within the poset that indicates which weight space generators appear with nonzero coefficient upon application of a raising or lowering operator to other weight space generators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In computer science, there is a strong interest both in finding effective algorithms when this is possible, and also in understanding when this is not theoretically possible.  It is often difficult to know how to even begin to obtain these impossibility results, but topology combined with combinatorics does have the potential to yield such results, and there have been some striking successes in the past.  One of the proposed projects is somewhat in this vein -- to prove impossibility results for the question of which graphs (i.e. which models for networks of computers) admit data sorting algorithms by greedily swapping pieces of neighboring data that are out of order.  In another direction, geometric structures such as the Schubert varieties of representation theory/algebraic geometry often have combinatorial data associated to them which is organized into what is called a partially ordered set.  Much is known about how properties of the geometric structure force properties on the partially ordered set.  The PI seeks a better understanding of how much can be said in the other direction, perhaps allowing some manageable extra data such as information about how edges are attached to 2-dimensional faces, how 2-dimensional faces are attached to 3-dimensional faces, and so on.  This could have applications to finding new ways of figuring out what very complicated, high-dimensional geometric objects look like.  In addition to continuing to mentor students and run seminars, the PI will also continue organizing conferences designed to foster fruitful new interactions and collaborations between those working in topological combinatorics and in related areas such as combinatorial representation theory and combinatorial commutative algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: This project dealt with the study of geometric  structures such as spaces of matrices or solutions to systems of equations by breaking up these high dimensional spaces into more understandable discrete pieces.  This  involved using coarse combinatorial data to keep track of which pieces are in the  boundary of which other pieces, while also paying attention to finer topological point data to describe the exact nature of how the pieces are attached to each other.  The PI  developed new tools to synthesize the roles of these very different types of data.  Much of the focus was on (1) building blocks  called cells, (2) partially ordered sets called closure posets  describing how the cells fit together into so-called cell complexes, and  (3) developing techniques for reducing a very complex cell complex into another one  that is easier to understand while still sharing key structural elements.  Sometimes that involved realizing the  cell complex of interest as the image of a well-behaved function from  another cell complex called a polytope made of linear, convex pieces. Another key  approach was a method called Morse theory for building a space by attaching pieces sequentially  in such a way that changes in structure are simple enough to be well  understood with each such attachment.   Some highlights among the results of the project include: (1) the  positive solution of a conjecture of Sergey  Fomin and Michael Shapiro regarding the structure of the space of upper  triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal whose minors (i.e. subdeterminants) are all  nonnegative, in other words, the space of totally nonnegative, unipotent  matrices; (2) the solution with Anne Schilling of an old problem of finding a decomposition  into symmetrically placed chains of the quotient of a Boolean algebra  (i.e. on the ordering on subsets of a finite set by containment) by a  cyclic group (i.e. by  the set of rotations in the plane that fix the  origin and send an n-gon centered at the origin to itself); (3) the  development with Alex Engstrom and Bernd Sturmfels of a theoretical foundation for a geometric study of images  of maps on probability spaces aimed at applications where one wants to  determine  the input probabilities to a situation from output data.  A  motivating example for (3) is the question of determining the   likelikhood of the various edges being missing from a graphical network  which is a tree, given data about how likely the entire paths between  the various pairs of extreme nodes are to be present.  Broader impacts: The PI advised two graduate students, one of whom  completed her Ph.D. from Indiana University in spring 2010 and the other  of whom is now in her fourth year of study working towards a Ph.D.  at North Carolina State  University.  The PI organized numerous conferences, most notably the  Triangle Lectures in Combinatorics series of one day conferences held  once a semester in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina for  the particular benefit of graduate students and young faculty members in  the Southeastern United States -- creating a sense of community through  regular meetings and bringing in world experts to visit the region.   She also served on the governing body of the American Mathematical  Society, the AMS council, and in particular served on the AMS committee  on the profession.
