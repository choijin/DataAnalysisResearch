<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In MaoÆs China of the 1960s, small commune workshops across the Chinese countryside began making simple three- and four-wheeled diesel trucks. These "Chinese Rural Vehicles" (CRVs) soon developed into a ubiquitous tool for rural farm activities &ndash; such as applying fertilizer and harvesting crops. In more recent decades, they are being used more and more for freight transport. In both functions they contribute substantially to the rural economy and provide a primary source of income for tens of millions of Chinese households. Today, the registered CRV fleet is more than 21 million; in rural China they are outnumbered only by bikes and motorcycles. At a time when the environmental consequences of ChinaÆs economic ascent have captured the worldÆs attention, international media tends to fixate on the ballooning passenger car market. But CRVs still make up over one-fifth of the Chinese vehicle fleet, and because they rely on simple technology, they account for a disproportionate percentage of ChinaÆs diesel consumption and air pollutant emissions. For policy makers, CRVs are an arena of tension between environmental impacts and fossil fuel constraints versus rural development.  Starting about a decade ago, a series of central government policies began setting minimum technology and environmental standards, and cleaned up CRVs &ndash; but at the cost of significant increase in price. Finally, in 2011 the central government announced the intent to phase out CRV production by 2016. The intent is to replace them with conventional pick-ups, light-duty trucks, and possibly also small electric motor-carts.  In summer 2010, together with two students from Tongji University in Shanghai, I travelled to villages, townships, and counties across three Chinese provinces that make up the æbreadbasketÆ of China and represent the area of greatest CRV usage.  My survey of CRV owners, manufacturers, regulators, and other important players in ChinaÆs rural regions sought to characterize the role these vehicles play in the rural economy. Detailed data on usage, including driving frequencies, distances, cargo types, and economic transactions inform revision of previous academic and official estimates of aggregate fuel consumption and air pollutant emissions. We also sought to characterize their importance in rural freight transport.  We found that many small, low-horsepower vehicles are being operated within the confines of a single village without any registration or license. Other larger vehicles are typically retrofitted to carry far more than their rated payload, and then overloaded with cargo. CRVs were found to be of vital importance to rural families who often times relied upon contracted freight as their primary means of earning money. Moreover, evidence from the recent "Cars to the Countryside" program (a rough analogue to the U.S. "cash-for-clunkers") suggests that conventional pick-ups, trucks, and electric motor-carts are too expensive for most CRV owners, and that the central governmentÆs plan to phase out this vehicle type may force millions of families to find another means of livelihood, and severely hinder rural development. On one hand, the high frequency of unregistered and unlicensed usage, together with overloading, suggest that previous estimates of CRVsÆ fuel consumption and emissions are overly conservative. On the other hand, our research suggests that the central government may be phasing out these vehicles too quickly, with potentially dire consequences for the many rural communities. Though the research aims to provide data toward finding a better balance between rural development and environmental impacts, and even points to policies that might lead to better solutions for both development and the environment, it seems that the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has already decided that energy security/environmental impact trump rural development in the case of Chinese Rural Vehicles.
