<AbstractNarration>The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) was initiated as an LTER project in 1997, designed to understand the controls and interactions of urban ecosystem structure and function. This project will continue that long-term line of research and will expand it to address 3 fundamental issues: 1) The spatial and temporal relationships of socio-economic, ecological, and physical features of an urban area; 2) The fluxes of energy, matter, capital, and population in an urban area, and the development and relationships of these over time; and, 3) The ways in which people develop an understanding of the metropolis and use such understanding to reduce air and water pollution. The research integrates ecological, hydrologic, and social perspectives and research techniques to understand the human ecosystem and provide knowledge of relevance and utility for management of urban ecosystems and their neighboring environments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project contributes to understanding of the structure, function, and dynamics of a metropolitan area, and includes development of techniques for better understanding socio-ecological and urban ecosystems in general. It assembles and integrates valuable long-term data sets from paleoecological, historical, and contemporary time-frames. The project has broad societal value through its contributions to improved management of urban ecosystems and its focus on techniques for reducing environmental pollution and degradation. Its broader values also include extensive research-based training, educational program development, and public outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>

Answering the three fundamental questions of BES III have yielded important findings that have refined the big ideas of urban ecology. These include the findings that urban structures are hybrids of social-biophysical processes; the discovery of unexpected sinks and sources in the flow of materials and contaminants in urban systems; the interaction of regional versus local control of diversity of species and biological traits; the control of diversity by human management; the unexpected fragmentation emerging from regulations intended to reduce the environmental impact of subdivision, and the inadequacy of existing economic models in a shrinking neighborhoods that lack effective property markets.  Integration across the disciplines in urban ecology has resulted from sampling biological, physical, and social data in the same sites that reflect contrasting neighborhoods.

Antibiotic contamination in streams may increase antibiotic resistance in stream bacteria, threatening human health.     High nitrogen retention in Baltimore watersheds has revealed unexpected nitrogen sinks in lawns. Combining social survey and environmental chemistry showed that although fertilizer is a significant input in suburban watersheds, only ~50% of lawns are fertilized. Retention of this added nitrogen is high.  4. BES has contributed to the insight that urban biodiversity is often quite rich and contains important native elements. The contribution of urban biological diversity to material fluxes, particularly of nitrogen and carbon, occur in unexpected habitats.  5. Social survey indicated that variations in tree canopy cover across neighborhoods are positively associated with the desirability, environmental satisfaction, quality of life, and social cohesion experienced by residents. In an underserved urban watershed, green land management interventions were associated with increased neighborhood satisfaction, and increased outdoor recreation relative to the region.  6. An industry standard ecohydrological model has been revised to accommodate within-city green infrastructure, which is an advance beyond its early application in suburban watersheds. This achievement extends the broad utility of these models.  In short, BES helped establish modern American urban ecology as a science, but its Intellectual Merit continues as the project has evolved via new data, new concepts, and applications to the sustainable city transition. The evolution of BES in Phase III have helped guide the continued growth and integration of the broader science of urban ecology worldwide.
