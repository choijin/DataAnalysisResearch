<AbstractNarration>This project is developing three inquiry-based, lab-focused, online Climate Change EarthLabs modules as a context for ongoing research into how high school students grasp change over time in the Earth System on multiple time scales. Climate literacy has emerged as an important domain of education. Yet it presents real challenges in cognition, perception, and pedagogy, especially in understanding Earth as a dynamic system operating at local to global spatial scales over multiple time scales. This research project confronts these issues by examining the challenges to high-school students' understanding of Earth's complex systems, operating over various temporal and spatial scales, and by developing research-based insights into effective educational tools and approaches that support learning about climate change and Earth Systems Science.  The project is a collaborative effort among science educators at TERC, Mississippi State University, and The University of Texas at Austin. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project uses a backward-design methodology to identify an integrated set of science learning goals and research questions to inform module development. Development and review of draft materials will be followed by a pilot implementation and then two rounds of teacher professional development, classroom implementation, and research in Texas and Mississippi. Research findings from the multiple rounds of implementation will allow an iterative process for refining the modules, the professional development materials, and the research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the design, development, and testing of innovative climate change curriculum materials and teacher professional development for Earth Systems science instruction.  The materials will be tested in states with teachers in need of Earth Systems Science training and with significant numbers of low income and minority students who are likely to be hard hit by impending climate change. The research will shed light on the challenges of education for climate literacy.</AbstractNarration>

Students read articles, conduct hands-on lab activities, watch videos, explore online interactives, discuss ideas with their teacher and classmates, and analyze data, maps, and graphs&mdash;to build an understanding of how snow and ice interact influence and reflect Earth's climate conditions.&nbsp;</p> <p>2) The<em> Climate and the Carbon Cycle </em>module includes eight labs that introduce students to the basics of the carbon cycle. Students learn how the carbon cycle, climate, and the abiotic and biotic components of the environment influence each other in many ways. Using case studies, NASA visualizations, current research, and interactives, students explore how living things on land, in soils, and in our oceans regulate the carbon cycle.</p> <p>3) The<em> Climate and the Biosphere </em>module includes seven labs that help students understand the ways in which energy from the Sun interacts with Earth's atmosphere, land, oceans, and biosphere (all living things) to give us weather and climate.

In this module, students read articles, complete hands-on investigations, watch videos and computer animations, use maps and graphics, and engage in class discussions.</p> <p>4) The<em> Climate Detective</em> module includes six labs in which students analyze sediment cores and search for clues about Earth's past climate. Students travel along with a group of scientists who extracted sediment cores from along the south coast of Alaska in the summer of 2013. They conduct hands-on lab activities, watch videos, analyze the actual data from the expedition, consult maps and graphs, explore online interactives, and discuss ideas with their teacher and classmates, to explore when major climate events occurred in the past and how these events connect with changes in climate today and in the future.</p> <p><strong>EarthLabs Climate Project Research Questions</strong></p> <ol> <li>What impact does the Earthlabs curriculum have on students&rsquo; conceptual understanding of climate change and change over time and space?</li> <li>What impact does the Earthlabs curriculum have on students&rsquo; confidence and perceptions about climate change?&nbsp; </li> <li>How do students engage with the Earthlabs on-line curriculum?</li> </ol> <p>We assessed over 500 students in nearly twenty high school classrooms in Mississippi and Texas that have implemented the EarthLabs curriculum and completed the Climate Concept Inventory (CCI).&nbsp;Our findings suggest that the Earthlabs Climate curriculum improves students&rsquo; conceptual understanding of change over time as it relates to climate change.&nbsp; The curriculum had the greatest impacts among 11<sup>th</sup> grade students (pre <em>M</em>=29.04%, post <em>M</em> = 41.04%, p=0.036), students from Mississippi (pre <em>M</em> =30.52%, post <em>M</em>=38.31%, p=0.007), and female students (pre <em>M</em> =30.89%, post <em>M</em>=37.52%, <em>p</em>=0.002). In addition, the implemented curriculum significantly increased students&rsquo; confidence about their own climate change content knowledge (pre-score =46% very confident, post-score =87% very confident) and increased their perceptions about climate change towards greater awareness of the evidence of global climate change (pre-score = 43%, post-score=52%).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2016<br>      Modified by: Tamara&nbsp;S&nbsp;Ledley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1019721/1019721_10050307_1480473842617_EarthLabs2011-02-14at8.31.50PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1019721/1019721_10050307_1480473842617_EarthLabs2011-02-14at8.31.50PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="EarthLabs Bookmark"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1019721/1019721_10050307_1480473842617_EarthLabs2011-02-14at8.31.50PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="EarthLabs Bookmark"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">EarthLabs Bookmarks were used to disseminate the EarthLabs url's to teachers at professional meetings and workshops.</div> <div class="imageCredit">EarthLabs Team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Tamara&nbsp;S&nbsp;Ledley</div> <div class="imageTitle">EarthLabs Bookmark</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1019721/1019721_10050307_1480474079162_2015_07EarthLabsClimateDetetivesworkshopIMG_0141copy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1019721/1019721_10050307_1480474079162_2015_07EarthLabsClimateDetetivesworkshopIMG_0141copy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ocean core studied in the EarthLabs Climate Detectives module"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1019721/1019721_10050307_1480474079162_2015_07EarthLabsClimateDetetivesworkshopIMG_0141copy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ocean core studied in the EarthLabs Climate Detectives module"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Teachers holding the ocean core they studied in the EarthLabs Climate Detectives Module</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tamara Ledley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Tamara&nbsp;S&nbsp;Ledley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Ocean core studied in the EarthLabs Climate Detectives module</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1019721/1019721_10050307_1480474268476_PICT0829copy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1019721/1019721_10050307_1480474268476_PICT0829copy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Albedo lab in EarthLabs Climate and the Cryosphere module"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1019721/1019721_10050307_1480474268476_PICT0829copy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Albedo lab in EarthLabs Climate and the Cryosphere module"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Teachers collecting data on the albedo (reflectivity) of different surface types as part of the EarthLabs Climate and the Cryosphere module.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tamara Ledley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Tamara&nbsp;S&nbsp;Ledley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Albedo lab in EarthLabs Climate and the Cryosphere module</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1019721/1019721_10050307_1480474684093_PICT0964copy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1019721/1019721_10050307_1480474684093_PICT0964copy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Examining the impact of albedo on temperature in the EarthLabs Climate and the Cryosphere module"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1019721/1019721_10050307_1480474684093_PICT0964copy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Examining the impact of albedo on temperature in the EarthLabs Climate and the Cryosphere module"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Teachers collecting data on how the surface albedo (reflectivity) impacts the temperature of the suface as part of the EarthLabs Climate and the Cryosphere Module</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tamara Ledley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Tamara&nbsp;S&nbsp;Ledley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Examining the impact of albedo on temperature in the EarthLabs Climate and the Cryosphere module</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>

EarthLabs Climate Project Goals  The EarthLabs Climate project will transform our ability to help students more deeply understand climate change on multiple time and space scales. Its goals are to design, develop, and test curriculum materials via:  Improving our grasp of the challenges to student understanding of complexity in Earth?s systems over temporal and spatial scales, researching how the Climate Change EarthLabs curriculum supports student learning about climate change concepts during piloting and testing of the EarthLabs Climate materials, and using this information to guide continued curriculum design and development. Filling a gap in geosciences education curriculum by developing inquiry-based online lab investigations of Earth?s climate changes over time that are informed by project research, implementation, and evaluation..  Increasing teachers? ability to deploy climate change curriculum by developing an integrated set of tested online materials and guidelines for in-service professional development to support a broad-based implementation of inquiry-based, lab-focused modules in classrooms and test them in Texas and Mississippi.   EarthLabs Climate Modules   1) The Climate and the Cryosphere module includes six labs that introduce students to many of the complex issues surrounding the cryosphere and its connections to climate. Students read articles, conduct hands-on lab activities, watch videos, explore online interactives, discuss ideas with their teacher and classmates, and analyze data, maps, and graphs&mdash;to build an understanding of how snow and ice interact influence and reflect Earth's climate conditions.   2) The Climate and the Carbon Cycle module includes eight labs that introduce students to the basics of the carbon cycle.

They conduct hands-on lab activities, watch videos, analyze the actual data from the expedition, consult maps and graphs, explore online interactives, and discuss ideas with their teacher and classmates, to explore when major climate events occurred in the past and how these events connect with changes in climate today and in the future.  EarthLabs Climate Project Research Questions  What impact does the Earthlabs curriculum have on students? conceptual understanding of climate change and change over time and space? What impact does the Earthlabs curriculum have on students? confidence and perceptions about climate change?   How do students engage with the Earthlabs on-line curriculum?   We assessed over 500 students in nearly twenty high school classrooms in Mississippi and Texas that have implemented the EarthLabs curriculum and completed the Climate Concept Inventory (CCI). Our findings suggest that the Earthlabs Climate curriculum improves students? conceptual understanding of change over time as it relates to climate change.  The curriculum had the greatest impacts among 11th grade students (pre M=29.04%, post M = 41.04%, p=0.036), students from Mississippi (pre M =30.52%, post M=38.31%, p=0.007), and female students (pre M =30.89%, post M=37.52%, p=0.002). In addition, the implemented curriculum significantly increased students? confidence about their own climate change content knowledge (pre-score =46% very confident, post-score =87% very confident) and increased their perceptions about climate change towards greater awareness of the evidence of global climate change (pre-score = 43%, post-score=52%).
