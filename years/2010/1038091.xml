<AbstractNarration>For the 21st century, our nation must be cyberinfrastructure savvy if it is to be competitive in the international marketplace. Education is no longer PK-20, but rather a lifelong endeavor affecting the general citizenry as well as future and current scientists and engineers. The very nature of what and how we learn is being greatly impacted by cyberinfrastructure (CI) and the emerging computational sciences and engineering(CS &amp; E) fueling much of CI development. We are witnessing the emergence of CI-enabled learning, or cyberlearning, which holds tremendous potential for formal and informal STEM education and other fields. To meet its anticipated workforce demands, the nation must broaden the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM, particularly in CI and CS &amp; E, and utilize CI to help this broadening effort.&lt;br/&gt;A series of workshops, planned by a select group of experts in the field, would greatly advance research and curricular developments for cyberlearning and cyberinfrastructure workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyberlearning and CI workforce pipeline development have the potential to greatly expand the participation of women, persons with disabilities, underrepresented minorities, and minority-serving institutions in the&lt;br/&gt;future of STEM and CI. The NSF?s learning and workforce development goals for cyberinfrastructure envision an expansion of CI knowledge, skills, and opportunities throughout all levels of education and society. Developing an effective approach for community input on achieving those goals would help the nation and the CI community to move effectively in that direction, and thus ultimately realize the full benefits of CI for learning, discovery, innovation, and broader engagement in and the democratization of science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The emerging knowledge-based economy is presenting the nation major educational and workforce development challenges that call for major changes needed to preserve global competitiveness. Much of the new economy is based upon rapidly accelerating significant advancements in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), in large part fueled by the emergence of cyberinfrastructure (CI) and computational and data intensive science and engineering (CDS&amp;E).  The advancements in CDS&amp;E and CI evolve largely from innovation and rapid developments in interdisciplinary and cross-sector thinking and collaborations.  Furthermore, the full nature of the emergent potential of technological advancements is often not immediately recognized, but becomes apparent once implemented on a large scale.  These advancements in turn stimulate further innovations in an ever-accelerating positive feedback cycle.   For the 21st century, our nation must be cyberinfrastructure savvy if it is to be competitive in the international marketplace. Education is no longer PK-20, but rather a lifelong endeavor involving the general citizenry just as much as current and future scientists and engineers. The very nature of what and how we learn is being in large part determined by CI and CDS&amp;E.   Knowledge and information, and their innovative application are creating wealth in the new economy.  Our capacity to exploit the opportunity for wealth creation in the new economy is limited only by the availability of a well trained and highly educated workforce, thereby placing the onus on educational institutions and systems to enhance and update their curricula, responding to the rapid and dramatic shift in workforce knowledge and skill requirements.  Just as important education institutions must also increase their output of well-prepared graduates.  Training and informal education programs must also fill the gaps left by formal education.   Some of the workforce production issues arise from the traditional talent pool being too small for the demand.   Broader participation on the part of underrepresented groups- women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities &ndash; is a necessary part of our global competitiveness solution.  The strategy followed to date of reliance on foreign sources is tenuous at best given the global political and economic environment and increasing global demand for this emerging workforce.     CI and CDS&amp;E are also providing exciting educational and workforce development opportunities and tools in CI-enabled learning, or cyberlearning, and increasing the potential for broadening access to CI resources and capabilities and broadening participation of groups presently underrepresented in STEM.  CI and cyberlearning hold tremendous potential for formal and informal STEM education and workforce development.  A meeting of a select group of national CI experts was convened to provide expert community input needed to set out a framework from which to explore the complex and very broad area of cyberlearning and workforce development, and to help set the direction for future efforts.  The group met with representatives of various related programs at the National Science Foundation (NSF).  Bringing to bear their expertise, knowledge of the various stakeholder communities, and what was learned about NSFÆs programmatic efforts and discussions, the group identified the following five components of a framework, which provides a basis for a follow-on workshop to garner fuller community input:   Cyberinfrastructure Workforce Development and Higher Education: Computational and Data-Intensive Science and Engineering Cyberlearning K-14, Training, Informal Science Education, and Lifelong Learning Campus Bridging and Education Broadening Participation and Cyberinfrastructure              Last Modified: 08/10/2011       Submitted by: Alexander Ramirez]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
