<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This award supports the development of an Arctic Oceanographic Data Discovery and Visualization System that complements those already available for the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Southern oceans. The effort focuses on geological and geophysical information of the Arctic Ocean and its neighboring seas extending south to 60Â°N. A significant component of the effort will be the processing, for the first time, of a  large volume of multibeam echo-soundings acquired by the USCGC 'Healy' into digital elevation models and multiple-resolution tile sets. These data will be supplemented by water column data, sub-bottom reflection profiles, deep-sea sediment drilling results and seabed sediment sampling, as well as geophysical measurements of magnetic and gravity fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Undergraduate students will be integral to the multibeam data processing. The data and information will be efficiently and effectively displayed and delivered via Web services for the benefit of researchers, educators, students and the general public. The established, non-proprietary Web applications, 'GeoMapApp' and 'Virtual Ocean', that are the backbone of the effort do not require expert skills, and, as a result, are appropriate tools for teaching and outreach. The project will develop 'mini-lessons' and outreach materials that exemplify the educational possibilities of 'GeoMapApp' and 'Virtual Ocean'.</AbstractNarration>

The GMRT data are distributed widely and the resulting data can be accessed by researchers, teachers, agencies and the public through a wide range of applications. These include GeoMapApp, a free, java-based mapping and data visualization application (http://www.geomapapp.org/), Virtual Ocean, Earth Explorer, and PolarExplorer (http://thepolarhub.org/project/polar-explorer). In addition to the bathymetry data we included numerous other geological and oceanographic datasets in to GeoMapApp, which allows to investigate these datasets together with any personal data that can be uploaded by the users. GeoMapApp is a popular tool for teaching undergraduate and K-12 settings.
