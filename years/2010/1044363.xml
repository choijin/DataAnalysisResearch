<AbstractNarration>The project is creating modules in sustainable bio-plastics to introduce natural non-petroleum based polymer materials into several engineering and material science curricula.  The modules contain lectures, demonstration experiments, hands-on laboratories, and a design project in an effort to increase student engagement and their interest in sustainable bio-based materials.  The modules present basic principles of polymer science and engineering and new trends in bio-based polymers thus providing students with a better understanding of the theory and applications of sustainable green plastics, improved problem-solving and critical thinking skills; and motivation and tools needed to incorporate sustainable materials in their professional decisions.  The material, which is available on the widely accessed nanohub website, is being used at Northeastern University, Lehigh University, and the Georgia Institute of Technology and is being disseminated through faculty workshops, conference presentations, journal publications, and industrial short-courses. The project is being evaluated by an outside consultant to monitor the impact on students and faculty at each site using student and instructor surveys and focus groups.  Broader impacts include wide dissemination, especially though the faculty workshops, postings on the nanohub website, and the industrial outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through this TUES award (Award Number 1044363), three faculty from the Plastics Engineering deparment at UMass Lowell created new hands-on educational modules that provided undergraduate students with an exposure to the latest developments in sustainable polymers in the context of plastics design and manufacturing.  In particular, it helped to enhance students' knowledge and understanding of renewable biobased (polymers derived from naturally-occurring deedstocks, rather than oil and natural gas) biodegradable polymers, and recycling of plastics.  These modules addressed the educational challenges of the emerging fields of sustainable green polymers, and generated practical ways of introducing sustainability into undergraduate education with a focus on manufacturing biobased and biodegradable (compostable) plastic products.

Adapted laboratory modules were also employed in a freshmen-level undergraduate course.  Evaluation of the laboratory modules showed increased learning in the course topics by both the students and faculty. The modules and its results will be presented at the SPE ANTEC 2015 Conference (Society of Plastics Engineers) and a conference paper will also be published by the 2015 ANTEC Annual Proceedings.  The greening of plastics also enables the promotion of plastics-related occupations and jobs with good salaries.
