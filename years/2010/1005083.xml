<AbstractNarration>This three year REU Site program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst will engage 9 undergraduate students in research projects that involve applications of cellular engineering to challenges in pharmaceutical production, protein design, and bioenergy.  Understanding cellular function and manipulating cells/tissues to perform in a particular manner is the basis of many ventures in biomedical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific objectives of this REU Site program are to: 1) encourage and motivate students to pursue graduate studies in cellular engineering, including women, minority, and deaf and hearing impaired students; (2) train students to transition from dependent to independent researchers; 3) enable students to communicate effectively across disciplines; and 4) provide students with strategies for professional success through a Professional Development Seminar. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the research projects, the REU participants will be involved in research cluster meetings with larger groups of students and faculty; a Professional Development Seminar covering career paths, ethics, diversity in the workplace, identifying mentors, interdisciplinary communication, team-building, and development of collegial relationships; research seminars by faculty and graduate students; and an end of year student poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will target students majoring in chemical engineering, bioengineering, chemistry, biology and biochemistry.  The PI will leverage the NSF-funded Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP) and the Northeast Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP), both led by the University of Massachusetts campus, to enhance the recruitment of underrepresented minority students.  In addition, the Principal Investigator will collaborate with the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) at Rochester Institute of Technology to increase participation of deaf and hearing impaired students in this REU program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Exploring Engineered Cells (ExEC) REU program was designed to provide training in scientific and engineering research and professional skills for undergraduate students.  The program supported thirty-six students, including 21 women (58%), 15 under-represented minorities (42%), 5 disabled students (14%), and one student veteran.  Several participants were from schools with few research opportunities for students.  Students worked on a number of projects with important applications for society and human health, including microbial production of "green" fuels, new materials for improved wound and burn dressings, engineering of plant cell cultures to produce anti-cancer agents, processing of biomoelcules to develop low-cost protein-based therapies, and mechanisms to understand and prevent cancer metastasis.  Students also participated in a weekly professional development seminar to provide them with skills for professional success, which included workshops in research ethics, scientific communication, communicating with the public, working in teams, and maintaining collegial relationships.  Guest speakers from industry visited with students to give them an appreciation for how fundamental research is applied in industrial and clinical settings.   Of the 26 participants who have completed their B.S. degrees to date, 16 have been accepted to graduate or professional degree programs related to cellular engineering.  The program has significantly impacted the opportunities for these students to pursue advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, and has contributed to a more diverse workforce in these fields.
