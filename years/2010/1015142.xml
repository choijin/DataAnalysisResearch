<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The destruction and alteration of mangroves infested by a wood-boring crustacean in a restored mangrove stand in Taiwan  Mangrove forests are important transition zones between terrestrial and marine ecosystems in the tropics and sub-tropics. These saltwater tolerant trees link marine and terrestrial ecosystems together allowing the exchange of nutrients, marine and terrestrial species, and other resources. Mangroves are also important for their ecosystem services such as buffering storm damage, reducing pollution, and providing habitat for ecological and economically important species.  Because mangroves live at the interface of land and sea, many organisms can affect them. Wood-boring species, in particular, can damage trees and reduce the productivity and fitness of mangroves. While previous research has investigated how boring isopod crustaceans alter root growth, studies have not examined how these isopods may affect tree level measurements of health. To investigate the potential effects of a wood-boring isopod crustacean (Sphaeroma terebrans) in a tropical mangrove stand in Taiwan, I conducted a field experiment in collaboration with the laboratory of Hwey-Lian Hsieh (at Academia Sinica).  I sampled thirty eight mangrove trees in the Haomeiliao Nature Preserve (28 Avicennia marina trees, 10 Rhizophora stylosa trees) to characterize how burrowing by isopods is related to root damage, tree morphology, and fitness.  The mangrove trees in Haomeiliao were extensively damaged by the wood-boring isopod (Sphaeroma terebrans; Figure 1); 95% of the Avicennia marina and 100% of Rhizophora stylosa trees examined were infested. In some A. marina trees, damage by isopods could be extensive (Figure 2). Trees that were more heavily burrowed appeared to have many discolored leaves and a lower leaf cover. More heavily burrowed A. marina also had smaller, shorter, and more damaged pneumatophores (pencil-like roots used for gaseous exchange).

The results of this study may also be important for future mangrove restoration efforts. The success of future mangrove restoration projects would be enhanced if restoration managers examined the local mangrove sites for evidence of wood-borers. If large populations of wood-borers were found, perhaps selecting alternative restoration sites would be prudent or placing a protective covering over the mangroves.  Future work:    I am presently working with the laboratory of Professor Hsieh to expand the current study into a longer term multi-year project....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
