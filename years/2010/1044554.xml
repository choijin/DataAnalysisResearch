<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop the Application Security IDE (ASIDE) plug-in for Eclipse that warns programmers of potential vulnerabilities in their code and assists them in addressing these vulnerabilities. The tool serves as an always available reminder and educational opportunity during any coding activities. The tool is designed to address input validation vulnerabilities; output encoding; authentication and authorization; and several race condition vulnerabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are: (a) develop and deploy a usable tool that can serve a wide range of students and courses; (b) improve student awareness and understanding of security vulnerabilities in software; (c) increase utilization of secure programming techniques in assignments; and (d) have minimal impact on other course objectives and instructors. ASIDE is used in a range of programming courses, from CS1 to advanced Web programming, at three universities. The project evaluates how students use the tool, the impact on assignments, students' vulnerability awareness, and the impact on the course instructors. The proposed approach investigates whether integrating educational support into an IDE overcomes some of these challenges and provides effective training throughout a student's education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ASIDE plug-in can be utilized by a wide variety of students throughout their academic and professional careers. The tool is expected to be adopted by a wide audience and has the potential to improve the security knowledge of students at all levels. The project has a direct impact on students at multiple levels at different institutions, including an HBCU and an undergraduate liberal arts university. The ASIDE plug-in is available for download on the project's website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) support the development of computer software.  Among the many features of IDEs, programmers can clearly and easily see certain errors and possible errors made during the creative process of software design and construction.  We have demonstrated that it is possible to build and deploy a plug-in component for IDEs that alert software programmers about potential security risks in their software code and provide guidance on how to address the risks in manners similar to generic risks, errors, and other types of problems encountered in the development process.  Called ASIDE, we have specifically executed multiple studies of ASIDE to assess its efficacy among novice programmers who are not only learning about software programming for the first time, but are also learning about what it means for software to contain security risks and available methods for creating more secure software.  We have also demonstrated that students can begin their learning about security with minimal (or no) interruption of the typical syllabus in a beginner software programming course, allowing for very efficient use of classroom time and other instructor resources.  This allows students to learn about security in two increasingly common contexts: generally unsupervised classes like massive open online courses (MOOCs) or supervised classes in which the instructor has no specific knowledge of security principles.
