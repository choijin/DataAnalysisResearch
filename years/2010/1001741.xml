<AbstractNarration>The project consists in applying model theory to questions in other branches of mathematics. More precisely, the principal investigator will apply model theoretic techniques to problems in representation theory of generalised linear groups, compact complex manifolds, and the algebraic theory of differential equations. Model theory has already made substantial contributions in all three areas, and the principal investigator plans to further extend these contributions, and come up with new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic, which studies sets defined by formulas in a formal language from the point of view of their geometry. As a result, it allows one to treat geometrically concrete situations in which geometry is not apparent otherwise. Conversely, it allows the application of logical and combinatorial tools to geometric questions. The proposed project will apply such techniques to problems in algebra, geometry and differential equations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A group is an algebraic object that encodes symmetry: to each object, it is possible to attach its group of symmetries. The group can be described, and studied, without reference to the original object used to defined it, and as part of its study, it is possible to ask: on what (other) objects does the group act as a group of symmetries? When the objects in question themselves have a particular algebraic structure (namely, they are linear spaces over a field), they are called representations of G.  Representations are important because they are relatively simple to study, but one can ask: how much of the information of the group is contained in its representations? More precisely, it is possible to consider the collection of all representations of a particular group G, and ask: what is the structure of this collection, if we forget about the action of the group?  It is interesting to ask this question about particular classes of groups. An algebraic group is a group whose set of elements (i.e., the collection of symmetries) is the set of solutions of some polynomial equations (and the rest of the structure of the group is also given by polynomial equations). For such groups, a classical result called the Tannakian formalism describes the structure of the collection of all (algebraic) representations.  Instead of asking about algebraic groups, one could ask a similar question about groups given by more general kinds of equations, for example algebraic differential equations. A central part of this project produces a version of the Tannakian formalism not just for such groups, but more generally for groups given by algebraic equations involving operators of a general kind.  Other outcomes of the project deal with similar ideas but in a more general situation, where the collection of representations is replaced by a more abstract structure. Another part contains an application of these ideas to the theory of symmetries of linear differential equations.       Last Modified: 03/03/2014       Submitted by: Moshe Kamensky]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
