<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;This grant funds a programming contest for students in the Database Management Systems (DBMS) area at the ACM SIGMOD 2010 conference. Student teams from degree-granting institutions will compete in a programming task building a query executor on top of an existing main memory index implementation.  The goals of the contest are to:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;a) Stimulate student interest in the DBMS field; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b) Present a research challenge; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;c) Foster the creation of sharable open source code modules; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d) Foster Computer Science education by creating a forum in which students can excel; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;e) Present a forum in which excellent students can get noticed, other than by writing papers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A prize of $5,000, donated by a Microsoft, Inc.,  will be awarded to the winning team. The NSF grant is used to provide equipment for the contest and travel support for the contestants.  The winning system will be made available to the public under the MIT open source code license.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The SIGMOD Programming Contest is an annual competition at SIGMOD, the top conference in computer science focused on problems related to data management.  The contest awards a prize of $5,000 (donated by Microsoft) to a team of graduate or undergraduate students who win the contest.   NSF Money is used to support travel grants for students to / from the conference (which was held in Indianapolis) to present their solutions to the competition.    The primary impact of the contest is that it attracts young, eager, students with enthusiasm for building real systems to the database community, providing a forum in which excellent students can get noticed, other than by writing papers. It will emphasizes that the community values real implementations in addition to academic papers, and leads to open source software that can be used by researchers outside of the community.    The primary intellectual merit of the contest is to stimulate database community to develop robust open source implementations of challenging research software.  Such implementations provide a base upon which other researchers can build tools and students can learn how others have architected large data management systems.  During 2010, student teams were invited to compete to develop an efficient system for querying data distributed across many computers.  This is an important problem in data management as data sizes continue to scale and the best way to handle these growing sizes is the employ multiple computers. Students had several months to work on their implementation, which was judged on their over-all performance on a variety of workloads.

In 2010, the competition was supported by a team from INRIA in France, as well as our group at MIT.
