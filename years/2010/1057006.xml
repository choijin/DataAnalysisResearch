<AbstractNarration>The contents of our minds are not rigidly determined by the stimuli that happen to be impinging on our senses. Instead, we perceivers actively pick and choose a subset of the available information about the outside world for detailed processing, relegating other information to the shadows of consciousness. This active process of perceptual selection is called attention. With the support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Winrich Freiwald and his colleagues at The Rockefeller University are tackling fundamental questions about how the brain implements attention. Brain imaging techniques are being used to find the brain areas controlling attention and to find out how they are connected to form attention networks. The research team will test the hypothesis that attention comes about from the interplay of two networks of brain areas, one network controlling what is being paid attention to and the other one scanning the environment for unexpected events currently outside the focus of attention. By their anatomical location in the brain, these networks are referred to as 'dorsal' and 'ventral,' respectively. The researchers are learning how the ventral attention network scans the environment, and how it interrupts processing in the dorsal brain network in order to change the focus of attention. The research uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans and monkeys to identify the brain areas and connections of the ventral attention network. Neural activity in relevant brain areas is artificially elicited or suppressed to directly prove how the ventral network affects the dorsal attention network and the overall control of attention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a component of the attention system is harmed by a brain injury, severe deficits follow like the attentional neglect of half of the visual environment. Results of the project can lead to new strategies for rehabilitation of brain injuries. Because social stimuli like faces attract attention automatically, the research can also help to understand humans as social beings. With this program, a wide variety of advanced training opportunities in brain imaging techniques for graduate and postgraduate scientists and physicians is offered, and classes are taught on various aspects of vision science. A new laboratory course in sensory neurophysiology is being offered for graduate students. A particular emphasis in this project is placed on introducing high school students and undergraduate students to both results and practice of brain research in order to increase awareness of brain research and interest in scientific practice in general. Because brain imaging of cognitive capabilities like attention quickly captures the imagination of many people, results of these investigations will be disseminated broadly in order to enhance scientific understanding in society. We can control attention voluntarily, yet some external stimuli, 'strange things, moving things, wild animals,' in the words of the psychologist William James, can break through and capture our minds. This project is investigating how the brain allows for such dynamic interactions of attention with the environment. Attention underlies everything we do, whether we just watch the world, walk in it, or think about it. Thus, understanding attention is of fundamental importance to understanding how our minds work.</AbstractNarration>

Instead, we perceivers actively select a subset of the available perceptual information for detailed processing, relegating other information to the shadows of consciousness. This active process of perceptual selection is called attention. What we pay attention to at any one moment in time, then, is the result of an active dynamic interaction between the most conspicuous elements of our sensory world and our internal priorities and goals: sometimes our attention is captured by an external event, sometimes driven by what we are looking for in the outside world. How does the brain then control the focus of attention and re-orient it when necessary? When we started this project, the dominating idea in the field was that a so-called &lsquo;dorsal attention network&rsquo; controls the focus of attention according to internal goals. This network was thought to consist of two areas, called LIP and FEF. &nbsp;The chief discovery of this project forces a revision of this view. We discovered a third region that controls the focus of attention according to internal goals, and it is located in a part of the brain previously not thought to support attentional control functions. We called this area PITd. We discovered this area through the combination of techniques ranging from whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of whole-brain activity to electrophysiological recordings of activity from single cells in the fMRI-identified regions during the performance of an attention-demanding task. We could show that activity in PITd is very strongly modulated by attention, and that it is even possible, by artificially activating this area, to shift the focus of attention to a new location. We then set out to compare the properties of this new area for attentional control to those of LIP, and this required testing of one of the central hypotheses of attentional control, the so-called priority map hypothesis. The idea here is that there is a region in the brain with a map of the visual world that encodes how behaviorally relevant each location in space is. Several brain regions had been proposed to contain such a map. We could show that PITd really contains a pure priority map, while the LIP map represents other cognitive factors, for example, action plans, as well. In many ways, however, PITd and LIP were surprisingly similar. Because of this similarity we postulate that the new attention area PITd is an integral part, despite its exotic location, of the &lsquo;dorsal attention network&rsquo;. First connectivity analyses we have performed, support this idea and suggest that LIP, FEF, and PITd are nodes within a specialized brain network for attentional control. This view is strengthened by another discovery we made very recently, and this gets to the core question raised above: how does the dynamic interplay between conspicuous items in the outside world that capture attention and the internal focus take place. In order to get to this question we used whole-brain fMRI, but this time not during an attention-demanding task, but during a simple task from which subjects could be distracted by conspicuous elements that flashed up outside their current focus of attention. Surprisingly to us, we found the very three areas we had found to control endogenous attention, LIP, FEF, and PITd, to also be the ones most strongly modulated by exogenous attention. Thus this network is controlling attention under fundamentally different behavioral conditions. However, we found in a fourth brain area, TPO, highly complex interactions between visual stimuli, exogenous and endogenous attention in ways that varied greatly from cell to cell and suggest mechanisms that could cause a wide variety of external events to capture attention and shift the focus of attention....]]></DRECONTENT>
