<AbstractNarration>School-based Ecology and Environmental Discoveries (SEEDS) is a collaborative program between two research units at Columbia University - the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) and the Center for Environmental Research and Conservation (CERC) - and four New York City public high schools - The Young Women's Leadership School, The New York Harbor School, Frederick Douglass Academy, and Curtis High School.  The four participating high schools host environmental research projects investigating conditions in local wetlands, water bodies and the atmosphere.  School buildings, grounds and laboratories are the "home base" for the individual projects.  LDEO and CERC provide scientific leadership, technical expertise, mentoring, and access to analytical equipment that cannot be installed in the high schools.  As part of the program, Columbia's Summer Research Program provides collaborative professional development oriented to hands-on, inquiry- and data-based instruction.  One teacher and two students from each school participate full-time over the summer months; two to four classes at each school participate, albeit less intensely, during the school year.  During pilot projects based at LDEO during the past 4 years, teams of research scientists, science teachers and high school students produced novel research-quality datasets.  Emphasis on generating high quality data enhances the pedagogy of the participating teachers, draws NYC public school students into STEM careers, and improves the academic success of participating students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>SEEDS &ndash; School-based Ecology and Environmental Discoveries &ndash; was a 4-year grant to support expansion of the Lamont-Doherty Secondary School Field Research Program (SSFRP).&nbsp; The SSFRP is a project-based instructional program focused on biodiversity and environmental research in wetlands of the New York metropolitan area.&nbsp; We partner primarily with &ldquo;non-exam&rdquo; schools&mdash;high schools that don&rsquo;t filter entrants on academic achievement.&nbsp; The Program currently serves approximately 10 teachers, 10 undergraduates and 40 high school students, mostly from public schools in New York City each year.&nbsp; SEEDS funding supported 4 of those high school teachers and 8 of their students in each of its four years. &nbsp;</p> <p>SEEDS-supported participants have work on:</p> <ul> <li>Sediment accumulation rates and chemical characterization</li> <li>Soil biogeochemistry, bacterial processing and methanogenisis</li> <li>Fish populations, diversity and feeding</li> <li>Remediation of invasive plants</li> <li>Nutrient cycling</li> <li>Carbon sequestration</li> <li>Hydroperiod and hydrography</li> </ul> <p>A central goal of the SEEDS program was to establish a pathway toward careers in science and engineering.&nbsp; Our results were resoundingly positive: 100% of the SSFRP participants have gone to college, about 50% are majoring, or indicate a desire to major, in science or engineering.&nbsp; In addition, SSFRP students receive significantly more funding than their peers who have not participated.&nbsp; During the SEEDS funding period, the SSFRP has become a conduit to STEM careers for students from demographic groups currently under-represented in science.&nbsp;</p> <p>A second question was whether high school students working with a moderate level of supervision from professional scientists, were capable of producing high quality data.&nbsp; The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.&nbsp; The caveat is that there is a two to three year learning curve, and achieving publishable data with this age group requires both close attention and patience.&nbsp; Each time we added a new set of protocols, it took up to three years to achieve a culture of excellence and the institutional memory required for students to process samples and data in a reliable, precise way.&nbsp; In the last year of the program, our students presented 6 of their projects at the GSA to resounding kudos from our colleagues there; 3 of those projects are currently being prepared by their mentors for publication.&nbsp; These successes followed on the heels of two years during which the number of data problems was too high to be considered of professional quality.&nbsp; The lessons learned during &ldquo;spinup&rdquo; have been institutionalized despite the fact that most of the participants are new, leading us to conclude that the problems were not connected to the individual students, but to the organizational culture of the program itself, which requires a maturation period in each of its new activities.&nbsp;</p> <p>A third outcome was a deeper understanding of the role played by the Lamont-Doherty campus in the SSFRP experience.&nbsp; During the first three years of funding, we moved programming closer to the schools: we worked at LaTourette Park on Staten Island, which is near our partner Curtis High School.&nbsp; We worked on the water in lower New York Harbor where our partner The New York Harbor School had recently relocated.&nbsp; And we worked in the East River, near our partner Frederick Douglass Academy I.&nbsp; These projects operated well enough on their own terms, but they were not nearly as successful as bringing students and teachers to the Lamont-Doherty campus for work on projects based here.&nbsp; Teachers and students alike complained that they were not &ldquo;getting the full experience&rdquo; of the SSFRP.&nbsp; They also complained about delays that arose for lack of material or on-the-spot, ad hoc support from Lamont scientists and technicians.&nbsp; By the end of Year 3 the unavoidable conclusion was that supporting projects localized at the schools was both more expensive (in terms of effort and logistical support) and less effective (from a pedagogical perspective) than bringing students and teachers to Lamont.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Perhaps the most lasting outcome of the SEEDS funding has been to institutionalize the work of the SSFRP at Columbia University&rsquo;s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.&nbsp; Lamont is one of the nation&rsquo;s premier research facilities in earth, environmental and ecological sciences.&nbsp; From its inception it has had a strong educational program for graduate students and undergrads.&nbsp; However, at the secondary school level the Observatory&rsquo;s commitment has been less substantial and has been largely limited to curriculum development projects or to broad public events.&nbsp; Over the past three years, in part with SEEDS funding, we have been building the organizational infrastructure required to make teacher and high school student internships an ongoing part of the institution&rsquo;s commitment to education, including: the establishment of a permanent Steering Committee of Lamont researchers to oversee the program, a commitment from the Director to the permanence of the programming, the engagement of an Education and Outreach Coordinator at Lamont, and partnerships between the Observatory and four private foundations in the New York City area who are committed to the ongoing success of this programming.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/02/2015<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;Newton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1035037/1035037_10039466_1449056533090_SEEDSPic4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1035037/1035037_10039466_1449056533090_SEEDSPic4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SEEDS_Picture4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1035037/1035037_10039466_1449056533090_SEEDSPic4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SEEDS_Picture4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SSFRP Students returning to Piermont Marsh in winter to maintain sondes placed in interior ponds.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Robert Newton</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robert&nbsp;Newton</div> <div class="imageTitle">SEEDS_Picture4</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1035037/1035037_10039466_1449056141454_SEEDSPic1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1035037/1035037_10039466_1449056141454_SEEDSPic1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SEEDS_Picture1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1035037/1035037_10039466_1449056141454_SEEDSPic1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SEEDS_Picture1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SSFRP participants collecting minnow samples in a spartina field in Piermont Marsh.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Susan Vincent</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robert&nbsp;Newton</div> <div class="imageTitle">SEEDS_Picture1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1035037/1035037_10039466_1449056248823_SEEDSPic2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1035037/1035037_10039466_1449056248823_SEEDSPic2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SEEDS_Picture2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1035037/1035037_10039466_1449056248823_SEEDSPic2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SEEDS_Picture2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SSFRP participants working in Sparkill Creek at Piermont Marsh.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Susan Vincent</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robert&nbsp;Newton</div> <div class="imageTitle">SEEDS_Picture2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1035037/1035037_10039466_1449056413760_SEEDSPic3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1035037/1035037_10039466_1449056413760_SEEDSPic3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SEEDS_Picture3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1035037/1035037_10039466_1449056413760_SEEDSPic3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SEEDS_Picture3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SSFRP students working with Dr. Ajit Subramaniam in Lamont Doherty's marine biology laboratory.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Shane Riordan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Robert&nbsp;Newton</div> <div class="imageTitle">SEEDS_Picture3</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
