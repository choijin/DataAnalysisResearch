<AbstractNarration>This NSF RAPID project will investigate the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico on the microbial, plankton and oyster systems of the region. The scientists will focus on investigating changes to the abundance and virulence of Vibrio bacteria in response to stress associated with exposure to the oil and/or indirect effects associated with biological interactions within biological communities impacted by the oil. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will evaluate whether there will be an increase in the abundance of Vibrio and prevalence of Type III Secretion System 2 (TTSS2) in the location of the oil spill. TTSS2 on Vibrio is carried on a pathogenic island (PAI) that includes numerous genes. Since some of these genes are necessary for environmental adaptation, and this PAI is mobile and transferable among Vibrio, the team hypothesizes there will be an increase in the abundance of Vibrio carrying genes associated with type III secretion systems. Bulk bacterial communities and plankton composition will also be evaluated in size-fractionated water column samples across salinity and oil gradients to understand how these communities will be affected by the oil spill and how these changes will affect Vibrio abundance. The team will quantify if there is an increase in concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons in oysters and whether this increase will affect Vibrio abundance in oysters. Additionally, the team will study excretions from phytoplankton species that may be able to inhibit growth of Vibrio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of this proposal include participation of one postdoctoral researcher and one PhD student. The results from this study will be useful for understanding the environmental consequences of future similar disasters.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Gulf Oil Spill: Phytoplankton and environmental stressors as determinants of Vibrio ecology     On April 20, 2010 an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon (DH) oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in the release of crude oil that eventually washed up on the Louisiana shore several days to weeks later.   The crude oil has impacted Louisiana's coastal ecology, and it was hypothesized that there would be increased densities of potential pathogens in response to the oil spill.  We sought to assess the impact of the DH oil spill on the ecology of the human pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus by combining field studies with laboratory studies.     Vibrios are Gram-negative bacteria that occur naturally all over the world in water, usually in salt water environments such as estuaries, bays, and the ocean.  The vast majority of these naturally occurring bacteria are completely harmless to humans, and most of them are beneficial because they help recycle carbon in the ocean.  Unfortunately, there is a small subpopulation of these bacteria that have the ability to cause a great deal of illness in humans and in other animals.  Some of these bacteria can even cause global pandemics.     The three top species of vibrios that are harmful for humans are Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus.  These are harmful to humans because they carry genes that code for virulence factors, such as the ability to attach to human intestines and cause diarrhea or the ability to break open red blood cells to obtain the iron and other nutrients contained inside those cells.  These genes are often carried on mobile genetic elements called pathogenicity islands.  Many of the pathogenicity islands that bacteria carry around in their cells also carry additional genes, some of which allow the bacteria to resist unfavorable conditions like low pH, high salinity, and antibiotics.  Some of these additional genes have not been discovered yet, and they fall under categories like "hypothetical" or "uncharacterized".     We hypothesized that these undiscovered genes may include genes that allow Vibrio parahaemolyticus to adapt to other stressors in their environment, such as exposure to oil.  The connection between these undiscovered genes and confirmed virulence genes on the same pathogenicity island led us to suspect that if Vibrio parahaemolyticus populations carrying extra environmental fitness genes are selected for (i.e., outcompete other Vibrio parahaemolyticus that don't carry pathogenicity islands), then this might lead to an increase in Vibrio parahaemolyticus populations that are also potentially harmful to humans.     Our results have thus far indicated that not only was this hypothesis false, but there may have even been a decrease in the Vibrio parahaemolyticus populations carrying virulence genes following the oil spill.  We conducted experiments in laboratories and also monitored water and oyster samples, and thus far, all signs are indicating that there was no "bloom" of potentially harmful Vibrio parahaemolyticus following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  This is good news for susceptible individuals, such as those who are immunocompromised or have liver disease.       Last Modified: 09/27/2012       Submitted by: Crystal N Johnson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
