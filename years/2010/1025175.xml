<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project investigates faculty beliefs about communication and teamwork, and compares these beliefs to students' beliefs.  The research focuses on first elucidating what faculty and students believe about communication and teamwork, then investigating the alignment of faculty and students beliefs, and finally studying interventions that transform faculty beliefs.  The study will look at these beliefs in three engineering fields (civil, mechanical, and industrial) in order to maximize the impact on student learning.  The research will occur at five partner schools, making research results more transferable.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project can have broad impact on how teamwork and communication are taught since it bridges research on epistemology (the theory of what is knowledge and knowing) to practice.  A very important outcome of this project, if successful, is changing how faculty teach and students learn the key professional skills of teamwork and communication.  The project has targeted research sites to represent diverse populations of students to help ensure that the results can be used across a broad spectrum of universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Communication and teamwork skills remain top-priority outcomes for engineering graduates: they are identified by ABET as key student learning outcomes for accreditation; in national reports they are included in the characteristics desired of future engineers; and they remain high on employersÆ requirement lists. The recent emphasis on integrating professional practice across the curriculum has further increased both the need and the opportunity to insure that students develop these core skills. Yet even as the number of team projects and communication assignments in engineering courses grows, researchers and educators alike know comparatively little about the epistemologies of engineering faculty within this learning system, or about how faculty epistemologies affect the learning mechanisms of engineering students.

What are faculty beliefs regarding both effective practice and transferable learning outcomes with respect to communication and teamwork?  What, if any, gaps exist between facultyÆs explicit and implicit beliefs? Between their beliefs and current research in these areas?   RQ2. What are studentsÆ beliefs regarding their practice and learning in these areas?  How do studentsÆ beliefs align with faculty beliefs and with desired outcomes?   RQ3. What interventions can help faculty better align both their beliefs and their teaching practices with robust, research-based learning outcomes for communication and teamwork?  How do these interventions affect the teaching and learning of these skills in engineering?   As these questions suggest, the overarching goals of this study were to: 1) first understand what faculty and students believe, and hence what they teach and learn, respectively, about communication and teamwork; 2) to articulate how well faculty and students beliefs are aligned; and finally 3) to enhance teaching by studying interventions that provide educators with both necessary knowledge and viable strategies for enacting that knowledge in the classroom.

This leads us to believe that developing faculty ability and agency with regard to teaching these skills could contribute to greater engagement in teaching teamwork and communication skills. Faculty struggled to articulate how to teach teamwork and many actually said that it could not be taught and that it is just something one must learn by doing.  In order to encourage faculty to teach teamwork, we believe an intervention would have to first overcome the belief that it cannot be taught. This would have to be addressed as part of developing ability and agency. When asked about ability to teach team...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
