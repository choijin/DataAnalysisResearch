<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER proposal aims to investigate breakthrough concepts on a new format of thin-film nanofibrous composite (TFNC) polymeric membranes containing directed water channels for high-flux water purification (e.g. nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO)). Such nanofibrous membranes, radically different from conventional polymer membranes, are untested but represent a potentially transformative technology for significant energy-saving and cost-effective water purification applications. The two new concepts for the radically different membrane design involve (1) the replacement of the conventional flux-limited porous substrate layer with a high-flux functional nanofibrous scaffold containing an asymmetric structure with inter-connected void morphology, and (2) the creation of a thinner, stronger and functional nanocomposite barrier layer, imbedded with interconnected and directed water channels. Although the new membrane format is applicable to all liquid filtration, the proposed research will focus on water purification involving NF and RO. Preliminary experiments on the hierarchical design and assembly of this unique nanofibrous membrane for ultrafiltration (UF) application have already revealed very promising potentials. For example, by using a hydrophilic nanocomposite barrier layer, an asymmetric electrospun nanofibrous mid-layer scaffold and a non-woven microfibrous support, the flux rate of this not yet optimized membrane system is already 3-10 times better than that of the best among all known conventional UF media without losing the high rejection and low fouling criteria. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER proposal aims to investigate breakthrough concepts on a new format of polymeric membranes, containing nanofibrous scaffolds and nanocomposite coatings, for very high-flux water purification (e.g. nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO)). The research shall allow us to verify this revolutionary and "high risk-high payoff" concept, as well as to gain new insights into the transportation of dynamic molecular water clusters in confined channels. The success of the proposed research can bring significant benefits to society by providing practical means for high-flux liquid filtration applications in the chemical, materials, energy and biomedical industries. The proposed high-flux technology on water purification can immediately reap benefits on the quality-of-life and health concerns as well as energy savings. For example, there are increasing concerns on the presence of emerging contaminants in drinking water sources all over the world. These challenges offer us new opportunities to develop novel and innovative energy saving membrane products as well as improved water processing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
