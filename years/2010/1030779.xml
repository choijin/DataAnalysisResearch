<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop an ultra-sensitive infrasound motion sensor with nonlinear adaptive gain, which has potential applications in detecting early warning signals of imminent geo-hazardous events such as landslides. The sensing principle of this infrasound sensor gains inspiration from the ultra-sensitivity of the auditory system of certain fish species in detecting infrasound signals. The core sensing element of this infrasound sensor is a micro-electro-mechanical-system based artificial hair cell, which implements the active amplification and adaptation mechanisms of biological hair cells. Sensor design will be guided with insights made from quantitative modeling and simulation of a fish's hearing sensitivity and selectivity in infrasonic range. A fundamental understanding of how fish sense and process infrasound signals in its auditory system will be achieved through synergistic efforts among this cross-disciplinary project team and strong interactions between the multiple disciplines ranging from fish neuro-anatomy and imaging, nonlinear dynamics modeling, to microelectronics device fabrication and characterization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this inter-disciplinary research will lead to new advancements in smart sensor, marine bio-acoustics and geo-hazard mitigation technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aims to develop a novel infrasound sensor or low-frequency vibration sensor with high sensitivity and broad dynamic range by mimicking the negative stiffness and adaptation mechanism of fish inner ear hair cells.  Many applications need vibration sensors with both high sensitivity and broad dynamic range.  However, there is always a tradeoff between these two parameters.  One approach to optimize both sensitivity and dynamic range is to take advantage of the bio-inspired adaptive sensitivity.  As studied by biologists, the auditory receptor cells of ears selectively amplify the weak sounds by importing additional power using biomechanical actuators in the hair cell.  Consequently the sensitivity is significantly increased for weak sounds. These actuators do not operate for loud sounds so as to protect hair cells. Therefore, high sensitivity and large dynamic range are achieved simultaneously. Meanwhile, the inner ear cells also exhibit an "adaptation mechanism" to stabilize the signals.     To demonstrate the bio-inspired mechanisms, a capacitive accelerometer with both positive and negative feedbacks has been designed, microfabricated and characterized. The bio-inspired active amplification and adaptation mechanism have been successfully demonstrated by electro-static feedback actuators.  The positive feedback selectively amplifies small inputs but stops functioning for large inputs, realizing the bio-inspired adaptive sensitivity.  Simultaneously, negative feedback is implemented to reduce the DC drift, which also helps to achieve a high sensitivity by maintaining the operating point at the origin.  Furthermore, high-performance infrasound or low-frequency vibration sensors based on a novel cascaded gapped cantilever structure have been developed as well.  Such a cascaded structure optimizes the sensor performance by increasing the sensitivity and energy efficiency.  A prototype sensor with nano-g resolution has been developed and successfully detected ballistocardiograph (BCG), which contains valuable information of cardiac conditions.  A feedback circuit that realizes adaptive sensitivity for piezoelectric sensors has also been demonstrated, enabling high sensitivity for small inputs and large dynamic range.      This project has trained three graduate students and two undergraduate students on microfabrication, sensor development, instrumentation, and various research skills.  These trainings help them to become qualified workforce in advanced science and engineering areas.  This research has been incorporated into an interdisciplinary Micro/Nano-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS/NEMS) course (ECE 5575) that the PI developed at Wayne State University.  The research results have been presented in various conferences, such as IEEE Sensors conference, NSF CMMI Research and Innovation Conference, and American Geophysical Union.  Two journal papers have been submitted.  The developed sensors will benefits several engineering fields including infrastructure monitoring and natural hazard mitigation.  For example, the sensors can be used for structural health monitoring of long-span bridges and super-tall buildings.  In addition, hazard assessment and even early detection of imminent landslides is achievable through micro-seismic monitoring using ultra-sensitive infrasound motion sensor.  These sensors can also be used for the measurement of ballistocardiograph (BCG), offering an effective and unobtrusive method of evaluating cardiovascular function.  Furthermore, these sensors can serve as educational tools for undergraduate students or high school students.        Last Modified: 12/01/2013       Submitted by: Yong Xu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
