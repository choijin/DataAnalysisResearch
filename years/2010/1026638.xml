<AbstractNarration>The New York City Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation  will begin its 8th Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program consisting of 12 students matriculating in postbaccalaureate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) studies at the City University of New York (CUNY) during the 2010-2012 academic year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bridge students will be beneficiaries of a proactive retention and professional enrichment program that will include academic and research mentoring, GRE workshops, roundtable discussions with advanced doctoral students, faculty and administrators, and attendance and participation at local and national professional conferences. The at-large faculty pool associated with the CUNY Graduate Center, and CUNY Institute/Center Directors will serve as Bridge faculty/research advisors. The Alliance will continue to partner with Brookhaven National Labs to provide cutting-edge research training during the academic year and summer terms. International research experiences will also be integrated into the training of all selected&lt;br/&gt;BD scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A critical infrastructure component for research and education is the availability of competent and committed students. The Bridge program will continue to serve as a catalyst for raising financial support for graduate students to a level that would attract US citizens into the STEM research pipeline in numbers sufficient to sustain the national&lt;br/&gt;STEM enterprise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress and results of the Bridge to the Doctorate program will be disseminated at the NYC LSAMP Urban University Conference Series, and through its Virtual Community (http://www.projectstem.net), and Newsletter. The BD scholars represent a resource of STEM trainees that are poised to be involved in Informal Science and Math Education</AbstractNarration>
