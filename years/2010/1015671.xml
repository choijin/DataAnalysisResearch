<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for participants in the conference "Mathematical and Numerical Challenges in Molecular Simulation and Control," held 15-18 December 2010 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.  The meeting focuses on chemical physics, nonlinear analysis, and control theory, with emphasis on molecular simulation and control.  Topics to be addressed include new computational methods in chemical physics, simulation of chemical reactions and quantum control, quantum dynamics and nonlinear analysis, and control of linear and nonlinear quantum dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting features a one-day pre-conference tutorial for participants on molecular simulation and control.  The conference will include invited presentations by leading researchers, as well as contributed talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will foster collaborations among junior and senior researchers.  Invited lectures and contributed talks will be posted on the conference web site.  The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, junior researchers, and members of under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  http://sciences.unlv.edu/Mathematics/MSCC.html</AbstractNarration>
