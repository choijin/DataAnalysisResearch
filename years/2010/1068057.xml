<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this award was to provide support for maintaining the Virtual Solar Terrestrial Observatory interface to the Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) data base at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), during the transitional period to the Madrigal interface at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack Observatory (MIT/Haystack).  Also, the award supported corrections and updates to existing data sets during the transition, and completing the addition of selected data sets that were in progress at the initiation of the award period.  These activities have been completed, and MIT/Haystack is now the primary organization with responsibility for serving CEDAR data to the community, and for archiving all data sets.  It is anticipated that access to CEDAR data through the web interface formerly provided by the Virtual Solar Terrestrial Observatory at NCAR will now be phased out.  The intellectual merit of this activity was that continued access to current and archival data sets was provided to the upper atmosphere community, supporting the scientific goals of the CEDAR program.  The broader impacts are that student and postdoctoral scientists were able to use diverse upper atmosphere data sets, and that the open distribution and sharing of scientific information was encouraged.
