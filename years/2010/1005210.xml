<AbstractNarration>An award was made to the University of Alaska Anchorage to provide research training for 10 weeks for 8 students, for the summers of 2010-2012. This program actively engages students in faculty-mentored research in the areas of Ecology and Physiological Ecology in Alaska. It is intended to encourage undergraduates toward postgraduate education and careers in the sciences. It is guided by four main objectives: 1) to help students develop critical thinking skills, 2) to increase student interest in pursuing careers in sciences and to engage students directly in discussions surrounding graduate school and career options, 3) to increase student independence as researchers, and 4) to attract a diverse range of students into the program. The program is structured to involve students in all aspects of scientific investigation and to inspire them through direct exposure to ecological and physiological phenomena in Alaska. Students are mentored toward increased independence as the program progresses. Weekly research seminars, a series of career development workshops, and a variety of fieldtrips and group activities facilitate student learning and development. Focused discussions and training in ethics and responsible conduct of research are included in the program's format. The program concludes with a student research symposium in which students are expected to present the results of their projects to student peers, colleagues, and mentors. Students from underrepresented minority groups and from institutions with limited opportunities for research are targeted during recruiting efforts. A combination of assessment tools, including exit surveys, mentor evaluations, student tracking, and program tracking, are used to measure the effectiveness of this program. For more information, please contact Dr. David Pfeiffer at (907) 786-7762 or afdcp@uaa.alaska.edu or visit http://www.uaa.alaska.edu/reu.</AbstractNarration>
