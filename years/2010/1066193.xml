<AbstractNarration>1066193 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Koch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Common bacterial species such as E. coli and B. subtilis swim through fluids at low Reynolds numbers propelled from behind by a flagella bundle.  The flagella bundle unravels at times leading to cell tumbling.  This run and tumble motion becomes biased in the presence of a chemical attractant gradient such as a nutrient or a chemical signal released by other cells.  The cells tumble less frequently when swimming up the chemical gradient leading to a mean chemotactic cell velocity.  This biased motion also leads to a net orientation of the cells and an anisotropy of the active stresses the cells exert on the fluid as they swim.  Thus, a bacterial suspension viewed as a continuum living fluid has the unusual feature of developing anisotropic stresses due to chemical gradients.  This project explores the ways in which these chemically induced hydrodynamic stresses and the resulting hydrodynamic flows aid or hinder suspensions of bacteria as they use chemotaxis to seek nutrients or respond to cell-cell chemical signaling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Linear stability analyses and computational solutions of the nonlinear behavior of ensemble averaged equations of motion for bacteria suspensions are used to predict the macroscopic hydrodynamic flows induced by chemotactic bacteria.  Complementary experiments include visualization of the motion of fluorescent bacterial cells and tracer colloidal beads and measurement of the bacteria cell concentration.  A bacteria suspension in a microfluidic well subjected to a linear chemo-attractant gradient provides a simple case with a time-independent base state.  In this system a dilute bacteria suspension develops a steady concentration that is an exponential function of position in the chemo-gradient direction due to the competition of the chemotactic velocity and the diffusion due to their run-and-tumble motion.  However, the chemical-gradient induced active stresses are expected to induce convection above a critical bacteria concentration.  Experimental measurements will test the critical concentration predicted by linear stability analysis and the convective patterns obtained from numerical solutions.&lt;br/&gt; The dispersal of bacteria into a chemical attractant is studied for two parallel fluid streams which carry bacteria and attractant in a microchannel. A quasi-steady stability analysis and a dynamic solution of the equations of motion will be used to predict the conditions leading to formation of waves at the bacteria-attractant interface in both the presence and absence of an imposed pressure-driven flow.&lt;br/&gt; When bacteria release chemical signals that attract other bacteria, they form patterns including rings and spherical clusters with high cell concentrations.  Similarity solutions have been developed based on chemotaxis and diffusion that predict the development of singularities in the concentration field.  This project considers the role of active hydrodynamic stresses in this clustering phenomenon.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The possibility that collective hydrodynamic motions alter important bacteria behaviors involving search for nutrients and assembly due to chemical signals could have a broad impact in the field of microbiology.  This topic also provides a good setting in which to introduce students to the nonlinear dynamics of coupled reaction-convection-diffusion in an interesting biological setting.  A web site and summer research opportunity targeted toward high school students will be developed to explore pattern formation due to chemical signaling among bacteria.</AbstractNarration>

In a uniform environment, cells swim randomly through a sequence of straight runs punctuated by tumbling events when the bundle of flagella unravels.  When a cell detects variations in its environment such as spatial changes in nutrient or oxygen concentration or the presence of chemical signals released by neighboring cells, it biases its motion swimming more persistently in directions where the desired chemical or nutrient is becoming more abundant. This project examined through theoretical calculations and direct observations of swimming cells situations in which the response of a community of cells to their chemical environment led to coordinated fluid motions that helped to disperse or concentrate the cells and the chemical species.  One example is illustrated in the first image.  Many bacteria are contained in a thin channel which contains a chemical species that is more concentrated at the lower edge than the upper edge of the channel.  The biased swimming of the bacteria causes them to collect near the bottom of the channel.  Rather than forming a uniform concentrated layer, however, the theoretical calculations show that the fluid motions the cells produce will form clusters of cells (bright regions in the image) horizontally arranged with spacing comparable with the channel thickness.  This theory was used to predict the fluid convection and cell clustering in an experiment in which cells which are attracted to oxygen were contained in a thin liquid film.  The cells consumed oxygen created an oxygen-rich environment near the air-water interface where the cells accumulated.  The theory was able to explain the minimum film thickness required to observe fluid motion and clustering and the spacing of the observed clusters. Bacteria often proliferate in thin films of water on solid surfaces where moisture, oxygen and dissolved organic nutrients provide all the conditions needed for growth.  A salient feature of thin films is the rapid drying of the film due to the high air-water surface area.  A drop on a surface dries fastest at the edges due to its smaller thickness and the closer proximity of non-humid air.  As a result, fluid in the drop flows from the center toward the outside and particles or bacteria in the drop are deposited near the edge.   For passive particles, this process leads to the formation of a uniform ring, known as a coffee ring, because coffee stains are a prime example of this phenomenon.  Experimental observations in this project, illustrated in image 2, showed that the ring formed by bacteria at the edge of a drop is non-uniform.  When the cells become concentrated their swimming motion creates jets of bacteria that flow away from the drop edge periodically spaced around the drop edge.  Unlike the motions described above, this collective motion was caused solely by the way bacteria swim in an evaporation driven fluid flow and not by their response to chemical queues as was confirmed by performing the experiments with cells genetically engineered to be unable to respond to chemical queues. When under stressful conditions, bacteria produce chemicals that attract other bacteria to undertake collective self-protective actions such as the formation of films of cells with protective coatings.  In one commonly studied example, cells have been observed to form long cylindrical clusters whose radii then decrease with time as the cells attract one another.  Previous theoretical studies accounted for cell migration due to the chemical signal but did not consider fluid motion suggested that the cells in such a cluster could cont...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
