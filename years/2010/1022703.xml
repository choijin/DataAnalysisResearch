<AbstractNarration>Support is provided to allow the PIs to understand and model, through an improved understanding of grain boundary migration processes in deforming ice, the following phenomena:&lt;br/&gt;1. The survival of extensive deformation and domination of the microstructure at depth of favorably-oriented grains,                &lt;br/&gt;2. The growth of slipping grains in the direction of shear, and whether this is a function of the relative orientations of neighboring grains or a fundamental characteristic of slipping grains, and&lt;br/&gt;3. The effects of pressure on the rate and/or balance of the processes responsible for fabric development at depth.&lt;br/&gt;Their working hypothesis is that slipping grains can propagate without requiring recrystallization, and that this process is closely associated with anisotropy in grain boundary mobility during deformation. To seek evidence of these mechanisms, they propose the following series of laboratory observations on granular freshwater ice:&lt;br/&gt;1. Conduct confined compression experiments at low deviatoric stresses and a range of pressure and temperature to develop a preferred c-axis orientation and cause growth.&lt;br/&gt;2. Use standard techniques to document c-axis orientations, grain size and shape of the deformed microstructures for several temperatures and shear stress levels.&lt;br/&gt;3. Employ electron backscatter pattern (EBSP) analysis to document a- and c-axis orientations of slipping and abutting grains in the deformed material.&lt;br/&gt;4. Use surface etching to identify slip line arrays in the deforming grains, and couple these observations with the grain boundary structures observed in the EBSP results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental understanding derived from this study is anticipated to foster improved understanding of paleoclimate as derived from the interpretation of ice cores, as well as improved models of glacier and ice sheet mechanics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Intellectual Merit of the Activity  Understanding the flow rate of ice is critically important for climate reconstruction and for predicting the fate of the earthÃ†s large ice sheets under climate change scenarios. Numerous studies have shown that the orientations of the ice crystals in these ice sheets play a crucial role in determining their flow rate, and the importance of understanding the processes that underlie microstructural development is generally recognized. Prompted by the need for a more complete understanding of this complex phenomenon, studies continue apace &ndash; primarily examining microstructural evolution as a function of strain at atmospheric pressure.  The Intellectual Merit of the present work was motivated by the need to better understand microstructural development in ice as a function of strain history, not simply at atmospheric pressure but under a range of pressures commensurate with that found in large ice sheets. To that end, we conducted confined compression experiments at low applied stresses and a range of pressure (up to 20 MPa) and temperature on granular freshwater ice produced in the laboratory.  We used both standard optical techniques to document c-axis orientations, grain size and shape of the deformed microstructures for several temperatures and shear stress levels, and employed electron backscatter pattern analysis to document the a- and c-axis orientations of crystals.  Broadly our Microstructural observations of creep-deformed ice specimens revealed smaller median grain sizes, less regular, and more interlocked grain shapes in specimens deformed at higher pressure compared with those deformed at atmospheric pressure. Testing over a range of pressures reveals little change in strain rate for pressures less than ~15 MPa, leading to our hypothesis that the widely dissociated basal dislocations in ice begin to constrict once the confining pressure reaches a critical value. This critical pressure depends strongly on the (currently unknown) lattice dilatation induced in ice by the presence of stacking faults.     The Broader Impacts of the Activity  Knowledge of the microstructural evolution of ice undergoing continuous deformation will allow paleoclimatologists to better interpret ice core data and scientists developing predictive models to better address the flow of ice sheets under various climate change scenarios. A key observation is that in order to simulate the microstructural evolution of ice located at the bottom of ice sheets during laboratory compression testing, testing has to be performed at the appropriate hydrostatic pressure and not at atmospheric pressure.              The work also led to the training of two post-doctoral fellows in ice specimen preparation, mechanical testing and microstructural analysis of ice.
