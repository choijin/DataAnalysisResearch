<AbstractNarration>This conference addresses questions that are fundamental to our understanding of biological function. It will bring together experimentalists and theorists from the fields of biology, applied mathematics and physics to focus on the role that is played by noise, dynamic fluctuations, and heterogeneity in determining the biology of cells and organisms. It will explore the intersection of several fields, including experimentation at the single-molecule and single-cell levels, stochastic physical theory, networks of biochemical and genetic interactions, and the evolution of cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The conference will promote the development of biology at its interface with physics, by bringing together leaders in the field with young investigators to enhance communication, seed new research ideas, and develop new leadership. The Conference will broaden participation in this field by addressing diversity (particularly with respect to underrepresented groups and women) in participants, speakers and session chairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended for award by the Cellular Systems and Biomolecular Systems Clusters</AbstractNarration>

The attendees represented the spectrum of endeavor in this field coming from academia, industry, and government laboratories, both U.S. and foreign scientists, senior researchers, young investigators, and students. Of the 164 attendees, 63 voluntarily responded to a general inquiry regarding ethnicity which appears on our registration forms.

In designing the formal speakers program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field. There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.  Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
