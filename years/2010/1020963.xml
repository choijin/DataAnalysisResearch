<AbstractNarration>Phenology - the seasonal timing of biological events - is one of the most important organismal responses to climate change. For annual plant species, the seasonal timing of seed germination and flowering is crucial. Germination and flowering time interact to determine patterns of growth, flowering and seed set. Thus, an integrated life-cycle model that includes these events and their interactions is necessary for predicting under natural conditions each phenological transition, the overall life cycle, and the persistence of effects of environmental perturbations. Using the abundant genetic information on the molecular-genetic basis of flowering and germination in Arabidopsis thaliana, this project will develop integrated life-history models to predict genotype-specific performance across a geographic range with different climatic scenarios. These predictions will be tested using unique genetic material of different combinations of germination and flowering alleles in seasonally contrasting field sites.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work directly pertains to predicting plant responses to climate change. It aims to predict germination timing and synchrony under various climatic conditions, which is of direct interest in agricultural settings. The model will also predict how changes in germination timing affect reproductive timing and yield, which is important for predicting responses of crop species as well as the weeds that grow with them. Finally, it uses genotypes containing candidate genetic loci for dormancy manipulations to assess how those genes will respond to altered climates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Phenology&mdash;the seasonal timing of biological events&mdash;is one of the most important organismal responses to climate change.  For annual plant species, the seasonal timing of seed germination and flowering is crucial. Germination timing influences the expression of critical life history traits, including flowering time. In turn, flowering time, by determining the season of seed maturation and dispersal, influences germination timing. Because of these interactions between germination and flowering, it is not possible to predict one of these phenological transitions without knowledge of the other, and perturbations in one generation can ramify within and across generations.  An integrated life-cycle model that includes these interactions is necessary for predicting each phenological transition, the overall life cycle, and the persistence of environmental perturbations under natural conditions.  Using the model system Arabidopsis thaliana, the first goal was to measure the germination responses of different alleles at germination loci under a range of experimental and field conditions.  These measurements were then used to develop integrated life-cycle models to predict genotype-specific performance across a geographic range with different climatic scenarios.   The laboratory studies of germination documented that naturally occurring alleles at candidate loci differed in primary dormancy and the rate at which it was lost, and differed in the rate and degree of secondary dormancy induction by cold temperatures, hot temperatures, and low water potential.  Maternal effects, specifically the temperature of seed maturation and the timing of seed dispersal, influenced germination responses to these environmental factors. Different combinations of genotype, seed-maturation temperature, and after-ripening produced similar germination behavior, and germination responses to seed-maturation temperature operate in a direction that could compensate for differences in dispersal timing.  Therefore, when different genotypes inhabit different environments or are matured and dispersed at different times, genotype-specific responses to environmental stimuli can promote more constant germination proportions.   Dormancy cycling under field conditions revealed genotypic differences and maternal effects during the loss of primary dormancy, but genotypes and seeds exposed to different maternal treatments synchronized after a cycle of secondary dormancy induction.  Seeds also displayed an unusual pattern of conditional dormancy, reversing their temperature-dependent germination before versus after secondary dormancy induction, providing a potential mechanism to prevent germination too late in the autumn.  Genotypes differed in their germination proportions and germination timing in the field, but maternal effects influenced the expression of differences among genotypes, especially during the period of initial dormancy loss.  This experiment also documented that different dormancy genotypes germinated under different environmental conditions, showing that the environments experienced after germination have a genetic basis; thus germination cuing acts as habitat selection, and genetic variation in habitat selection is in the form of genetic variation for dormancy.   Using parameters estimated in the lab, the integrated life-cycle model projected life cycles expressed across the range of A. thaliana and found that they qualitatively matched natural phenology observed in those locations.  The model predicted that genetic variation in dormancy would have stronger effects on the life cycle than would variation in flowering regulation.  The model also predicted that known clinal variation in dormancy is predicted to interact with climatic variation to produce a consistent annual life-history across the geographic range of this species.  This consistency in life-cycle expression across a geographic range produced a consistency in the time available for reproduction&mdash;a critical component of fitness.  Therefore, while one might predict that genetic variation contributes to geographic variation in phenotypes, when this variation interacts with climatic variation, it actually canalizes life-history expression and stabilizes fitness across a geographic range.  Combined, these studies revealed novel dormancy cycling and germination behavior, showed both empirically and through modeling that dormancy can have ramifying effects of life cycles and fitness, and showed that genetic differences among natural population can interact with local environmental factors to stablilize life-history expression and fitness components under complex, dynamically changing environments.   Broader Impacts:   The work directly pertains to predicting plant responses to climate change, an identifies key life-history properties that influence life-cycles and fitness under contrasting climatic conditions.  The integrated life-history model has been made available to the scientific community and the public.  The results of this work have been widely disseminated in peer reviewed publications, through invited lectures and through conference presentations, including interactions with seed biologists and plant breeders at international conferences.  Lab members, including the PI, participated in outreach by participating in "Seeds of Success," a training program at the Botanical Garden for restoration ecologists who are actively collecting, curating, and using seeds for restoration and seed bank efforts.  Minority high-school students were recruited from underserved schools and trained in research.  A graduate student, a postdoc, and two "postbac" researchers were also trained in the project (three women, one minority man), interacting with PIs and labs from both participating institutions.  Fifteen undergraduate students (12 women, 4 minorities) were trained on this project.             Last Modified: 10/29/2016       Submitted by: Kathleen Donohue]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
