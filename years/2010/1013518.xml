<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to investigate the feasibility of an innovative, super-homodyne interferometer for high-precision distance measurement with long dynamic range (more than two orders larger than the fundamental wavelength) and high resolution (less than one half-wavelength).  If successful, this would represent the longest working distance of any reported homodyne-based interferometer design.  The new device is referred to as a super-homodyne interferometer (SHI).  The innovation represents a fundamental yet simple modification of existing systems, with the same basic structure as a homodyne interferometer, but exhibiting the superior performance of heterodyne interferometers.  In Phase 1, we will focus on the design, prototyping, testing, and measurement of the super-homodyne interferometer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of markets and applications.  The interferometer is one of the most fundamental tools in measurement science and nanotechnology.  Interferometers set the standard for precise distance measurement and are extensively used in the areas of semiconductor fabrication, robotics, precision sensing, machine tools, vibrometry, laser-Doppler velocimetry, and laser microscopy.  The successful introduction of SHI products will represent a major engineering advance with a huge impact on measurement science and basic and applied research and development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF SBIR Project Outcomes Report (POR)  NSF SBIR Phase I Project Title: Nanometrology using Low-Cost, High Performance and Long Working Range Super-Homodyne Interferometer     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to investigate the feasibility of an innovative, super-homodyne interferometer (SHI) for high-precision distance measurement with long dynamic range (more than two orders larger than the fundamental wavelength) and high resolution (less than one half-wavelength).     During the Phase I, we successfully designed, tested and experimentally validated that our new super-homodyne interferometer was able to generate a dynamic range 166 times longer compared with standard homodyne interferometer using a proof-of-concept experimental set-up.  It represents the longest working distance of any reported homodyne-based interferometer design.  The innovation represents a fundamental yet simple modification of existing systems, with the same basic structure as a homodyne interferometer, but exhibiting the superior performance of heterodyne interferometers.     Furthermore, we designed a compact and modular version of the proof-of-concept experimental set-up in which we were able to reduce the original size by 1/5.  The experimental result also validated the design with a dynamic range which is 80 times compared with standard homodyne-based interferometer design.     The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of markets and applications.  The interferometer is one of the most fundamental tools in measurement science and nanotechnology.
