<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a toolbox that is used to pretreat complex protein samples. Protein samples derived from serum, tissues, or cell lysates are enormously complex. They can contain hundreds of thousands of unique protein species that can vary in concentration by 10 orders of magnitude. The toolbox, comprising a general-purpose instrument, a cartridge and allied reagents, is intended to perform the majority of the sample pretreatment steps that are necessary to prepare it for separation and analysis. The toolbox operates on a novel physical principle that allows the sequential manipulation of the initial sample without labor intervention or the physical transfer of the protein solution from one operation to the next. Consequently, the protein sample that has been manipulated with the toolbox can be produced more reliably, with fewer losses, and with less likelihood of sample contamination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to standardize reliable and rapid protein sample pretreatment. Proteomics is assuming a larger role in a variety of health-related fields, including drug discovery, lead optimization and toxicity testing, elucidating the mechanism of disease progression, and identification of diagnostic markers. In most of these pursuits, the potential power of proteomics is diluted by the complexity of protein samples. If proper pretreatment methods are used, the "unseen" proteome can be brought to light. This has the potential to increase the quality of proteomics data upon which these areas rely, and thereby offers the possibility to create new and improved therapeutics, diagnostics and understanding of disease. The business case is sufficiently compelling that, if the technology is demonstrated successfully, then a large and potentially lucrative market is available. In addition, there are other potential applications beyond proteomics that the underlying technology can address, which potentially opens the door to additional revenue streams.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     At the end of the day, proteins, not genes, are the business end of biology.  This is because a primary function of genes is to produce proteins, such as antibodies and enzymes.  The state of a cell, tissue, or organism then can be determined by measuring its protein complement.  This information is useful for determining markers for disease, or the effect of therapeutics on disease, among other potential applications.  Unfortunately protein analysis is very difficult.  It is common for a cell or serum to contain hundreds of thousands of different proteins with concentrations that can range over ten orders of magnitude.   The mixture exceeds the ability of current analytical methods to resolve mixture components (on the order of 5,000 proteins with a restricted dynamic range).  Many high-abundance proteins are of little interest, and they mask those of low abundance, which in turn cannot be amplified by methods akin to the polymerase chain reaction used with DNA.  Those who study proteins therefore use extensive purification methods to reduce sample complexity before proteins are measured.  The traditional methods largely accomplish this goal but suffer from a loss of interesting low-abundance proteins and lack of reproducibility -- both in the same lab and across locations &ndash; that has hampered the more wide-spread adoption of proteomics methods.  They also require a great deal of labor, do not lend themselves to parallel workflows that would permit large-scale proteomics studies, and are prone to sample contamination that can confound the ultimate results.  As an alternative we sought to develop a method known in the analytical chemistry community but which has not been explored for any real-world applications.  When modified suitably, its chief strength is that it would allow for a range of protein sample manipulations to be performed in a single instrument without labor intervention.  This would presage scaling to higher sample throughputs, reduce sample contamination and aid considerably the reproducibility of such protein sample pretreatments.  The work provided many surprises.  It was based on physical understanding derived from results published by leading practitioners in the field.   Instead, we have found that the underlying physical principles are very different, and devoted the grant period to understanding the fundamentals of how the process works mechanistically, measuring many of these for the first time.  While few of the applied goals listed in the proposal were achieved, the results give us confidence that the underlying idea is sound once the new physical principles we found are incorporated.
