<AbstractNarration>Images of the Earth?s interior are primarily produced by two types of techniques providing snapshots of the Earth at two end-members of resolution. (1) Tomographic imaging provides a whole-mantle view of Earth?s large-scale (&gt; 2000-5000 km) seismic velocity anomalies; (2) Waveform modeling provides a small-scale (~100-500 km) view for specific geographic locations.  Because the scale length of features resolved in these imaging techniques varies by an order of magnitude it remains challenging to reconcile these different pictures into one single model of the Earth?s interior.  This project aims to reconcile the disparities observed in these images by: (1) Analyzing new seismic data recorded in North America from Earthscope?s Transportable Array (TA) and FlexArray deployments, ANSS Backbone stations, Canadian National Seismic Network Stations, and recent PASSCAL deployments; (2) Analyzing global- and regional-scale models previously introduced to the community by full waveform modeling techniques using the PSVaxi software.  The primary goals are to assess the accuracy of the global and regional scale seismic models, and to decipher how complex structures in the deep mantle at all spatial scales affect broadband seismic waveforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seismological modeling of deep mantle structure is crucial in understanding the dynamic processes taking place within the Earth.  This project will further develop software that is capable of simulating earthquake motions on the global scale.  Ultimately this will aid in elucidating the Earth?s interior structure by comparing the simulated waveforms with the newly recorded data.  They will test the validity of previously derived Earth models, assessing how structural features in the deep mantle affect the seismic waveforms.  Ultimately, this will provide valuable waveform propagation tools and a rigorous assessment of the accuracy of seismic models and images to the community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The EarthÆs lower mantle has been imaged over the past few decades using an approach referred to as seismic tomography.  The images from seismic tomography have revealed several large-scale features (greater than 1,000Æs of km in lateral dimensions) such as Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) beneath the central Pacific Ocean and Africa.  These regions are vast areas in which seismic waves travel at a reduced rate.  Similarly, large scale regions where seismic waves are sped up have also been imaged, for example, in the circum-Pacific region.  However, fine-scale modeling of seismic recordings has also revealed several features that are smaller-scale (for example on the order of 100Æs of km in lateral dimensions) that are not necessarily imaged in the seismic tomography approach.  For example, ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs) are thin zones sitting on top of EarthÆs core-mantle boundary (the very base of EarthÆs mantle) in which seismic waves are slowed down by even greater amounts than in the LLSVPs.  Another feature, known as the D" discontinuity, represents a sharp change in seismic S-wave velocities that occurs several hundred kilometers above the core-mantle boundary. The nature of both the large- and small-scale features in the EarthÆs mantle is investigated in this work with particular emphasis on the relationship between them.  In this work we demonstrate the necessity of modeling seismic waveforms using a hybrid approach that involves starting with the large-scale features imaged through seismic tomography and embedding the smaller-scale features within the larger framework.  In this approach we are better able to predict seismic waveforms than in solely using a tomography or fine-scale waveform modeling approach.  Work done in this study has focused on two key features observed in the lower-most mantle, namely: the D" discontinuity and ULVZs.  Our work on the D" discontinuity was focused in two regions of the lower mantle: (1) beneath the north Atlantic Ocean, and (2) beneath Central America.  Here, we have demonstrated that the discontinuity exists in both regions, however the discontinuity is not likely ubiquitous.  That is, we have found evidence that the discontinuity may abruptly terminate.  The locations where the discontinuity is most strongly evident coincides with regions of the fastest seismic wave speeds revealed through the tomographic approach and appear to be directly linked to subducting slabs.   Our work on ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs) was carried out in three regions (1) beneath the Philippine Sea, (2) beneath the Coral Sea, and (3) beneath the central Pacific Ocean, primarily beneath Samoa.  Here we have demonstrated the existence of ULVZs in all three locations, including one of the largest ULVZÆs ever imaged beneath Samoa.  In addition to demonstrating the existence of ULVZÆs in these regions we have also put constraints on the physical nature of ULVZÆs.  In particular, we showed that the ULVZ beneath the Coral Sea region, is most consistent with an origin that is compositional in nature.  Both ULVZÆs beneath the Coral Sea and the Philippine Sea region are located near the boundaries of LLSVPÆs as imaged through tomography.  Yet, the ULVZ imaged beneath Samoa, is within the general boundaries of the Pacific LLSVP.  As tomographic imaging reveals a low wave speed conduit from the core-mantle boundary to near the surface at Samoa, we have provided additional evidence that ULVZÆs may in some cases represent the root location of whole mantle plumes that give rise to hot spot volcanism.
