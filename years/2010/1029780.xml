<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop understanding of the effect of grain refinement on the overall magnetic performance of composite permanent magnets. The research approach is to systematically add immiscible atoms in the composites and concomitantly evaluating the structural-magnetic property relationship in the magnets. The research will result in developing next generation high strength and high operating temperature magnets. Deliverables include identifying type of additives and understanding the fundamental mechanism governing the magnetic behavior of the magnets, evaluating synthesis process which can be adapted in the synthesis of other composite magnets, setting up synthesis and characterization instrumentation, modeling and analysis tools, documentation and dissemination of results, materials science education, and research experience to range of students including minority and underprivileged students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the understanding derived from this project will help create cost effective, light weight, high strength, and high operating temperature permanent magnets. Example applications of such magnets include light weight motors and generators for air and space vehicles and ground transpiration including cars and rails. This will also mitigate some of the ever-escalating power needs in both current and future technologies needing light weight and energy efficient devices. Unequivocally the power dense magnets will aid in minimizing carbon footprint as well. The results will be disseminated to allow research community to develop novel high performance magnets. The active collaboration with other institutions will broaden understanding and appreciation for the research subject. Graduate, undergraduate, minority, and REU students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research. Students from local colleges will have an opportunity to participate in high-end research activity.</AbstractNarration>
