<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded an international work project in Chiba, Japan.  There, I worked in the lab of the eminent Japanese  ichthyologist, Dr. Masaki Miya.   From this work, we produced several new mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of fish, and used them to construct a hypothesis of evolutionary relationships among many fish lineages.  We focused on the relationships between pikes (including mudminnows, blackfish, and pickerels) and salmons (whitefish, sheefish, trouts, salmons, charrs, taimens).  Our targeted sequences are from areas that are unresolved with regards to relationships .  The results of sequencing support non-traditional relationships between pikes and salmons, and within the pikes.  During the same time, I further refined methods to quantify base composition evolution.  That is how to measure the changes in the composition of DNA between different organisms.  DNA is composed of four nucleotides Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine (A, G, C, and T). While often considered a neutral evolutionary process, that is not likely.  How the changes in DNA composition affect phylogenetic (evolutionary relationships between organisms) studies remains poorly understood.  Understanding the effects of base composition evolution on phylogenetic studies has wide ranging utility.  I personally benefited from the experience from developing lab skills to data analysis and forming connections that will be useful in the future.  However, of significant value is that I work in the US with many other scientists.  In the research lab at my university, I am passing on laboratory skills to both undergraduate and graduate students that I picked up in Japan.  The types and methods of analysis I learned in Japan will also be disseminated around my university.             Last Modified: 11/30/2010       Submitted by: Matthew A Campbell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
