<AbstractNarration>This proposal calls to continue our research training program in geometry, topology and dynamics at the University of Michigan.  Recent Ph.D.'s and advanced graduate students will be the main beneficiaries.  The Mathematics Department at UM has one of the largest and most vigorous post-doctoral and graduate programs in the country, with an excellent record of producing high-quality researchers in geometry, topology and dynamics.  We will bolster the  training of post-docs and graduate students in these areas by deepening and broadening their education and providing the trainees with  ample opportunities to excel in their research.  Five senior faculty members (Richard Canary, John Erik Fornaess, Gopal Prasad, Yongbin Ruan and Ralf Spatzier) will lead this project in collaboration with other senior faculty.  We introduced various innovations into our current training program, and will continue them and expand on them:  We will provide intensive exploratory seminars, lecture series and workshops.  All trainees will develop lecturing skills, and will benefit from intensive mentoring.  Some trainees will deepen their scientific training by traveling to other institutions at the forefront of research.  Finally, we will expose undergraduates to research in the these areas via REU's.  We involve postdocs in REU activities, thus training them to supervise research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometry, topology and dynamical systems are core areas of mathematics. Geometry investigates the shape of spaces, through invariants such as curvature.  Topology explores the properties of spaces which remain invariant under continuous deformations.  One basic such invariant, the genus, is the number of "holes" in a surface.  Dynamical systems concern the evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time.  Especially in recent years, geometry and dynamics have developed in mutually beneficial interaction.  Case in point are topology, geometry  and complex dynamics in low dimension which in many aspects mirror each other.  Many of the most exciting developments in these areas are truly interrelated, and benefit from each other either by idea, analogy or actual tool.  At the same time, connections with other fields such as group theory, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics have strengthened dramatically.   These developments have been amazing in their breadth and depth, and demonstrate the vitality of these areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This RTG grant concentrated on  the training of junior researchers in topology, geometry and dynamics, primarily graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  The training concetrated on research, but included substantial preparation in teaching and general professional advice.  The Department of Mathematics at University of Michigan is a highly recognized research department with a stimulating atmosphere of that also hgihly values teaching and service.   This RTG continues an older RTG grant with the same name.  The project was administered  by five senior faculty (Richard Canary, John-Erik Fornaess, Gopal Prasad, Yongbin Ruan and Ralf Spatzier) with the help of other faculty in nearby areas, in particular algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, complex analysis, complex dynamics, micro local analysis and geometric partial differential equations.    31 undergraduate students worked on research projects during the summers, under the supervision of faculty aqnd postdocctoral felllows.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows shared in weekly  RTG training  seminars on topics of current interest. This was complemented  by 7 lecture series by some of the world's top experts and 10 weekend workshops.  Inaddition, they travelled to conferences and learned from experts elsewhere.   Out of 23 graduate students supported under this RTG, 18 received their Ph.D..  Another five are expected to finish by 2020.  14 found academic employment  right after their doctorate, 4 in industry.   Of 20 postdoctoral fellows supported, 11 obtained tenure track positions, 3 moved to industry and 1 is in a teaching position at Harvard. The remaining are either still here or on second postdoctoral positions.  A total of 108 publications were written by the trainees on  topology, algebraic topology, geometry, geometric group theory, dynamical systems, complex and geometric analysis.  Over 80 have been accepted to strong journals with the others submitted.  We fully excpect that they will all be accepted in due time.  Grant support provided release time from teaching duties for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to provide them with adequate time for their research.  We do however realize the importance of teaching in the careers of most of our young researchers, and  provided extensive teaching training, both during the semesters and in a weeklong training program before they start to teach here.   Many  then taught one of our  effective and well-known calculus classes in our first year program.  Some were offered the opportunity to teach  inquiry based learning classes.  This allowed them  to expand their horizons  on their teaching techniques beyond the ordinary, and made them especially attractive candidates for faculty positions.  The grant also offered professional training opportunities, in particular about applying for grants and jobs.  In addition,they also took a class about ethics in the research environment.               Last Modified: 10/29/2018       Submitted by: Ralf Spatzier]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
