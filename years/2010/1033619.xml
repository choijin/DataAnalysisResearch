<AbstractNarration>This project will develop and use an experimental technique to dynamically measure the microscale whole-field velocity, interfacial geometry and transport processes near the tip of a semi-infinite bubble propagating unsteadily through a surfactant-doped fluid-occluded tube. This experimental model of pulmonary airway reopening is relevant to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by pulmonary airway collapse and fluid occlusion. Subsequent airway reopening, driven by mechanical ventilation, generates damaging mechanical stresses on the airway walls that can result in ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). We hypothesize that unsteady flows accompanied by dynamic surfactant transport may reduce wall stress and therefore the incidence of VILI. The microscale observations conducted in this study will provide us with a significant understanding of dynamic physicochemical interactions that can be manipulated to reduce the magnitudes of this damaging stimulus. The novelty of our proposed experimental approach stems from the use of a two-color fluorescent technique that simultaneous couples micro-particle image velocimetry (ì-PIV) and pulsed laser induced fluorescence (PLIV) to non-invasively measure convection fields, interfacial geometry and transport processes in time-dependent two-phase flows. Our technique will allow quantification of the flow field with 12.5ìm x 12.5ìm resolution ? this extraordinary detail will allow us to determine, for the first time, the dynamic stress field in the fluid phase in pulsatile flows. To do so, we will fluorescently label Infasurf (ONY, Inc), a pulmonary surfactant replacement used clinically, with â-BODIPY. The PLIV technology will allow us to simultaneously track the transport and deposition of the tagged surfactant in a time-dependent manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential impact for this technology is widespread and significant. First, these capabilities will allow us to validate and expand upon our computational models of the lung in order to develop predictive models of airway reopening. Most importantly, these results will allow us to identify the relationship between the dynamic surface tension and surfactant transport interactions (including multi-layer creation and collapse) that can be exploited during mechanical ventilation to reduce deleterious mechanical stresses that can damage the lung. The technological advances afforded by the proposed research are important to engineering science because they allow for the quantification of micro-scale phenomena that have heretofore been inaccessible. In addition, the techniques have multi-disciplinary implications ? in addition to enhancing our understanding of pulmonary airway reopening, these new methodologies may be readily applied to gain fundamental insight into micro-fluidic devices in single or multi-phase flows, and therefore may find translation to lab-on-chip technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide expanded opportunities to a wide variety of students (undergraduates, graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher). Additionally, we will seek to recruit graduate students from historically underrepresented groups through associations with LS-LAMP and GAELA programs at Tulane University. We will partially support one post-doctoral researcher who will enhance his professional development through the mentoring of graduate students and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we developed new experimental techniques to understand the reinflation of pulmonary airways in cases of disease. This is relevant to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS has a mortality of 30-40% (~75k US deaths annually) and can potentially strike anyone in their prime, yet those who survive often go on to lead normal lives. Improving ARDS survival thus translates to the difference between a long life vs. an early death. There are currently no medical treatments for ALI/ARDS other than supportive care revolving around mechanical ventilation.  Unfortunately, mechanical ventilation can be highly damaging because the stresses and strains it imposes on the tissues may result in potentially fatal ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Mechanisms responsible for this damage are shown graphically in Figure 1. We hypothesize that unsteady flows accompanied by dynamic surfactant transport may reduce wall stress and therefore the incidence of VILI. Macroscale studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of this approach, and the studies provide in this project provide us with the understanding of dynamic physicochemical interactions that can be used to reduce the damage from ARDS.  Our specific aims are as follows:  Specific Aim #1 (SA1): Establish a technique to allow simultaneous measurement of the flow-field and bubble geometry in interfacial flows.  Our laser-based system for the simultaneous measurement of the flow field and the bubble geometry has been successfully developed, and is shown in Figure 2).  Specific Aim #2 (SA2): Perform simultaneous &mu;-PIV/PLIF measurements of unsteady bubble motion in the presence of pulmonary surfactant.  We have completed simultaneous measurement of the propagation of an air-liquid interface as it bifurcates in a microfluidic model of a pulmonary bifurcation. Figure 3 demonstrates the dual-measuring technique that allows us to simultaneous measurement of the flow-field and interface shape.   Specific Aim #3 (SA3): Conduct simultaneous &mu;-PIV/PLIF measurements of the flow-field and dynamic surfactant transport during bubble propagation.  We have been able to simultaneously visualize particle intensity and flow-fields, providing a unprecedented capacity to relate surfactant transport to flow and stress-fields. This is show in Figure 4.   In addition, this project has provided expanded opportunities to a wide variety of students (undergraduates, MS and PhD graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and a research professor). We have recruited a graduate student from a historically underrepresented group through associations with LS-LAMP and GAELA programs at Tulane University.
