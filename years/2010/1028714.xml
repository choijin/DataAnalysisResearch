<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to investigate a new class of aperiodic volume optical devices aimed at creating optical functionality within a three-dimensional (3D) device (or system) rather than from plane-to-plane or along waveguides as in traditional optical and photonics design. These multifunctional volume optical devices are numerically-generated and present aperiodic 3D structures that control light in multiple dimensions including wavelength, time, 3D space, polarization, and coherence function.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit - This project sets out to explore the functionality that can be achieved within a given volume by spatially shaping optical properties, such as refractive index, according to a predefined computer generated design.  The strategy takes into account fundamental and practical limitations such as current fabrication limits and achievable index contrasts. Accordingly, aperiodic volume optics operate on different phenomena depending on the index contrast, spatial gradient, and critical dimensions. Different fabrication approaches will be implemented including 3D direct femtosecond laser writing in glasses and photoresists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts - Volume optics opens up the possibility of exploring novel optical phenomena and applications in integrated and free space photonics. The proposed class of devices will enable significant advances in many biomedical, sensing, communications, and security applications. The project will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for a diverse cadre of young scientists and engineers. It will also seek new synergistic relationships with industrial partners to transfer new discoveries into industrial applications. The results of the investigation will be disseminated through conference presentations, publications, a specialized website, courses, and an outreach traveling exhibit.</AbstractNarration>
