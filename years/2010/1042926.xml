<AbstractNarration>On April 20, 2010 the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig owned by Transocean Ltd. and contracted to British Petroleum (BP) exploded and started burning in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Located 50 miles off-shore, the rig sank leaving a breached wellhead gushing an estimated 20,000 barrels of oil per day. Initial attempts to stop the spill have been unsuccessful and experts estimate it could take up to three months or more to stop the flow of crude oil. The spill threatens several "at-risk" industries along the Northern Gulf including commercial and recreational fishing, tourism, and other enterprises tied to natural resources. Initial social impacts are already unfolding and are likely to continue and evolve over time. This RAPID research project will focus on how the BP oil spill affects renewable resource communities and groups. This unfolding disaster draws comparisons to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) in terms of ecological, cultural, social, and economic damage and disruption, as well as potential long-term impacts. Over the past 21 years, this research team has documented human impacts of the EVOS with a focus on the community of Cordova, AK and this project builds upon and extends this research to the current BP spill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of the study is to capture highly perishable, time sensitive data regarding ways in which stakeholders in renewable resource communities along the northern Gulf of Mexico are reacting to this oil spill disaster. Specifically, the research team will focus thier data gathering activities on the community of Bayou La Batre, Alabama in order to make social scientific comparisons to Cordova.  The research team will collect qualitative and quantitative data on how the disaster impacts not only the ecology of the region but the social and cultural systems of the residents. They will draw on research designs and instruments used in their previous EVOS studies to develop and conduct structured face-to-face interviews with purposive sample of individuals from key stakeholder groups and self-administered surveys to a random sample of community households. Primary data will be collected at two points in time with interviews occurring first, followed by the survey. They will begin by initiating a community case study of Bayou La Batre. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will not only assist the research team in assessing the wider application of the theories and methodologies they have developed over the last 20 years researching the social, cultural, and psychological impacts of the EVOS, but has the potential to inform policy makers about effects outside of environmental and economic that can have a major impact on local community sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On April 20, 2010 the BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico leaving a breached wellhead gushing an estimated 50,000 barrels of oil per day. The resulting oil spill threatened several æat-riskÆ industries along the Northern Gulf including commercial and recreational fishing, tourism, and other enterprises tied to natural resources. This study examined how the oil spill affected communities and groups by drawing comparisons to the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) in terms of ecological, cultural, social, and economic damage and disruption, as well as potential long-term impacts.   The research was a collaborative effort among Duane A. Gill of Oklahoma State University, J. Steven Picou of the University of South Alabama, and Liesel A. Ritchie of the University of Colorado, each of whom did similar work in Cordova, Alaska after the EVOS. The studyÆs results have been accepted for publication in two peer-reviewed journals: the American Behavioral Scientist and Contexts.   The study focused on the residents of south Mobile County, Ala. The area along the Gulf includes the towns of Bayou la Batre and Dauphin Island, and numerous unincorporated communities. Using a random telephone survey modeled after previous work on the Exxon Valdez spill, the University of South Alabama Polling Group in September 2010 received responses from 412 residents or 46 percent of those contacted. All responders were age 18 or older and had lived in the area for at least a year.   The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill caused social disruption and psychological stress among Gulf residents that is similar to the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez spill and the impacts are likely to persist for years. Other major findings include the following:  Psychological stress among residents of south Mobile County, five months after the BP oil spill, was similar to that of residents of Cordova five months after the Exxon Valdez. One-fifth of south Mobile County respondents were in the severe stress category and another one-fourth were in the moderate range. The finding was similar to the sample from Cordova in which more than one-half were classified as either severe or moderate.  Higher levels of psychological stress among south Mobile County residents were consistently related to family health concerns, economic loss, concern for future economic loss, ties to ecosystem resources, and exposure to oil.       Four out of 10 respondents (43 percent) reported a commercial connection to coastal resources, and those with connections to damaged/threatened resources were more likely to experience higher levels of stress. People in lower income categories and lower levels of education were more likely to experience high levels of stress. Approximately one out of three respondents experienced some type of exposure to oil, and such exposure was significantly related to higher levels of stress. Sixty-six percent of respondents reported negative spill-related economic impacts on their households. Fifty-six percent of respondents indicated concern about the threat of economic loss.    If the trends observed in Cordova hold true for Alabama, significant spill-related psychological stress can be expected to continue in south Mobile County over the next decade.
