<AbstractNarration>Changes in temperature and precipitation extremes could be especially large in the Arctic, which is projected to have some of the greatest anthropogenic warming.  Consistency of physical causes of extreme temperature and precipitation in observations and in simulations of past and future scenarios can indicate the robustness of projected changes. Consistent simulations of extremes by several models can provide much greater sampling of extreme events, leading to more confident assessment of the changing risk of extreme events.  The PI's will investigate possible changes in extreme temperature and precipitation events in the Arctic using observational records and output from the CORDEX (regional) and CMIP5 (global) climate modeling programs.  The project aims to detect, attribute, and understand changes in extreme temperature or precipitation through an analytical framework that focuses on both the extreme temperature or precipitation events and the physical processes which support them.  The PI's will assess observed and simulated changes in extreme precipitation processes using a pattern-recognition tool, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), that allows construction of a coherent, multivariate view of collections of extreme events.  The methods developed will also have application to studies of extremes in other regions of the planet, extending capacity for assessing changes in extremes and their underlying physical causes.  The project will train a new generation of scientists equipped to perform ensemble analysis of the changes in extremes and the uncertainties in their projection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, heat waves and cold spells, can have detrimental and serious impacts on society such as loss of life and property. One of the expected impacts of a changing climate is an increase in warm temperature extreme events such as heat waves and warm nights and a decrease in cold extremes such as frost days.  Changing climate also promote increased precipitation extremes, as a warmer atmosphere can contain more moisture.  The goal of this project was to identify the broad-scale atmospheric weather patterns associated with temperature and precipitation extremes in the Arctic regions of North America. The climate of the Arctic has changed dramatically in the past several decades with the largest warming on the planet occurring in this region. The large climate change occurring in the Arctic motivated our focus on this region.  Through our analysis of extreme events we identified certain common features associated with temperature and precipitation extremes. Temperature extremes were most likely when the broad-scale atmospheric circulation favored the transport of either warm or cold air into a region. This transport of anomalously warm or cold air was strongest above the surface of the Earth. Anomalous cloud cover altered the amount of radiant energy reaching the surface. Clear skies favored radiation loss from the ground during the Arctic winter and contributed to the occurrence of cold temperature extremes. Conversely, anomalously cloudy skies during the Arctic winter led to reduce radiation loss from the ground, and additional downward radiation from the clouds, that created warmer than normal conditions.  Precipitation extremes were most likely when there was a strong low-pressure system in the Gulf of Alaska.  The low center caused substantial moisture flow from the ocean into Alaska.  When the moisture flow encountered Alaskan mountains, the uplift of air over the mountains cause moisture condensation and substantial precipitation.  In addition, the northward movement of warm air ahead of the low center promoted large moisture transport.  Our focus on the broad-scale atmospheric weather patterns associated with extreme events is motivated by the fact that weather and climate models are most accurate at these larger scales. By identifying the large-scale atmospheric patterns that are conducive to extreme events we can then look at climate change projections to see if the frequency of occurrence of the large-scale patterns conducive to extreme events will change in the future. Knowing this provides guidance to whether or not certain types of extreme events are more or less likely in the future while not needing to rely on climate models to accurately predict the small-scale features associated with extreme events, which are much less reliably forecast. Future work will use the knowledge gained from this project to assess expected changes in extreme events over the next century.
