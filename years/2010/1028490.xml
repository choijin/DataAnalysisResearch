<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this research program is to perform comprehensive studies on the challenges and solutions to achieve high-efficiency and high-power III-Nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) applicable for energy-efficient solid state lighting technologies. The approach pursued in this program to suppress the efficiency-droop in InGaN quantum well (QW) LEDs is by employing novel InGaN-AlInN QW design. Simulation studies, epitaxy, device fabrication, and device physics analysis of InGaN-AlInN QW LEDs will be carried out with the goal for realizing droop-free LEDs operating at high current density. These objectives will result in transformational advances in high-power nitride LEDs emitting in 450-550 nm spectral range. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits &lt;br/&gt;     The research program will advance the device physics and MOCVD epitaxy of novel droop-free InGaN-based quantum well LEDs for solid state lighting. The research program will lead to the identification of dominant mechanisms in efficiency-droop phenomenon in nitride LEDs, as well as the solution by using novel active region for suppressing the droop phenomenon. The transformational research will lead to realization low-cost high-power III-Nitride LEDs capable of operating up to very high current density. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;     The research programs have strong impacts in the fields of solid state lighting and energy-efficient technologies. The availability of droop-free devices will lead to low-cost solid state lighting technologies. The research program allows graduate and undergraduate students training in multidisciplinary research areas, encompassing photonics and nanostructure devices, epitaxy, and device technologies. In addition, high school outreach program with emphasis on female and underrepresented minority students will be conducted to stimulate their interest to pursue career in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
