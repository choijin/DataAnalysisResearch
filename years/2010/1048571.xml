<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in a 2-day workshop on analysis and geometry at Louisiana State University from January 4-5, 2011. This workshop precedes the annual Joint Mathematics Meeting in New Orleans and takes the opportunity of this close-by event to gather well-known experts, young researchers, and graduate students for additional discussion and interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop would bring together people working in different parts of harmonic and geometric analysis. This meeting will provide a stimulating forum to cross over the narrow imaginary boundaries between research groups with the aim that techniques, tools and ideas from different specialties will create new collaboration. The workshop will also create a forum where young emerging researchers have an opportunity to meet and interact with established experts in a small group. It will also give graduate students an opportunity to present their work and get new ideas and perspectives.</AbstractNarration>

The conference was supported by NSF, the Council on Research and Economic Development, LSU, and the Department of Mathematics, LSU. The workshop took place at LSU, Baton Rouge, starting in the morning January 4, 2011 and ending in the afternoon, January 5. 2011. Most of the participants arrived on January 3. There were about seventy five participants. Twenty nine students, both graduate and undergraduate students, participated. Several of the students presented their work.     The main topics of the workshop were pure and applied aspects of  1)      Harmonic Analysis, Convex Geometry, and Geometric Analysis on Homogeneous Spaces,  2)      Mathematical Aspects of and new trends in Tomography and its Applications,  3)      New Trends in Mathematical Aspects and Applications of Wavelets, Frames, Tilings and Dynamical System.  The two morning sessions consisted of twelve plenary talks given by leading experts in the topics of the workshop as well as some young researchers.  The afternoons were filled with three parallel sessions organized according to the three main topics of the workshop. Special effort was made to allow for time for students and young researchers to present their work.     The workshop was a great success that would not have been possible without generous support from NSF and Louisiana State University.
