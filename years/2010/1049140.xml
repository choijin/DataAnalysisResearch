<AbstractNarration>This project, supported by the joint NSF-DOE-USDA Climate Research Investment on "Decadal and Regional Climate Prediction using Earth System Models", and funded by the Division of Chemistry Special Projects Program, will develop an integrated inter-disciplinary program to focus on Asia, its climate, air quality, and impact on humans that will include connections with hydrology, ecosystems, extreme weather events, and human health.  The approach is to create a team that will identify key scientific questions and develop a plan for future studies and to establish the research facilities to address chemistry and climate issues facing Asia, including the impact on humans.  Analyses of the model results and satellite data will give fine-scale (10-50 km) information on connecting climate change with air quality.  In turn, the air quality and climate change information will be used to estimate the vulnerability of humans to these changes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include providing to the science community present-day and future anthropogenic and biogenic emissions over Asia at less than 10 km resolution, a model system framework for investigating science questions addressing chemistry and climate over Asia, and a plan for future science studies as well as the training of students and postdoctoral researchers and dissemination of the research results through publications and conference presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will advance our knowledge on the interactions of chemistry, including particles, with climate and the vulnerability of humans to these changes in Asia.  The project, which is focused on one of the most highly populated and economically dynamic regions in the world, will provide a framework for detailed studies of interactions between the earth system and humans.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through this collaborative research Type-1 project a team of scientists was assembled to identify key scientific questions regarding development of a better understanding of the impact of changing climate and emissions on atmospheric composition in Asia.  A network of scientists was established to create plans to address these key questions.  One of the major outcomes was the networking activities connecting public health and socio-economic communities, accomplished through two workshops.  A 2012 workshop held in Guangzhou on "Health Impacts and Climate in Asia", and a 2013 Boulder workshop on "Health, Agriculture and Water Risks Associated with Air Quality and Climate in Asia" produced a paper summarizing tools from different communities that can be used together to advance the analysis done in cross-disciplinary projects.  A second major outcome was the advancement of a framework for investigating chemistry and climate over Asia using high resolution Earth System Model simulations built upon the community WRF-Chem model.  This modeling system was further developed in this project to better account for the Asia environment, to account for rapid changes in emissions, urbanization, and impact of the high ambient particle loadings on the chemistry of the atmospherre.  These model improvements were evaluated by comparing model simulation results with observations in Asia.  The improved tools were used in several different experiments to better understand the contribution of different types of sources on air pollution levels in Asia and their contribution to radiative climate forcing.  Studies were performed for South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia regions.  These studies found that emissions from transportaion and domestic sectors were important contributors to PM2.5 air pollution levels and to aerosols radiative forcing.  Black carbon was shown to make a significant contribution to atmospheric radiative warming.  The studies also quantified the large impact that urbanization has on the environment.  As a result of the urban landscape and the associated increasing in heat fluxes due to intense human activities, air pollution is intensified by the decrease in mixing within the urban areas.  The modeling tools were used to explore future scenarios of emissions.  Simulations for a reference 2030 simulation based on current committed abatement policies show that PM2.5 concentrations will continue to grow.  This suggests that both the health impacts and the climate warming associated with these particles may increase over the next decades unless additional control measures are taken.
