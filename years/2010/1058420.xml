<AbstractNarration>T. Daniel Crawford of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in Chemistry and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure to develop methods that provide accurate predictions of the optical properties of chiral molecules in solution. The methods are based on coupled cluster linear response theory extended to incorporate solvent perturbations via both explicit and implicit models. This approach is systematically testable and convergent, benefitting from reduced-scaling implementations under development in the Crawford group that allow calculations involving many dozens of atoms. Applications include calculations of solution-phase optical rotation and circular dichroism spectra, and direct comparison with experiment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this research include new chemical models that are embodied in sustainable software made freely available through the open-source PSI program package. The research provides valuable insight into the assignment of the absolute stereochemistry of natural products, as well as into the fundamental connections between molecular structure and the optical properties of chiral molecules.  Educational efforts are directed towards training the next generation of computational scientists and the continued development of undergraduate computational laboratory experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chiral molecules are characterized by a three-dimensional handedness, and the resulting pairs of enantiomers can exhibit distinct chemical behavior when reacting within a dissymmetric environment such as the human metabolic system.  A key means of distinguishing between enantiomers is through measurement of their complementary responses to polarized light &ndash; in absorption, refraction, scattering, or emission.  The connection between such responses and absolute stereochemical configuration requires a reference, and the theoretical methods developed by this project seek to fill this need.  However, the accurate prediction of the optical properties of solvated chiral molecules is a daunting task for computational chemistry. While quantum chemical models of simple molecular properties are well established, chiroptical properties in the condensed phase such as optical rotation (OR) and circular dichroism (CD) present unique challenges even for state-of-the-art methods.  This NSF-supposed research program sought to develop reliable and robust models or OR and CD for liquid phase species using both implicit and explicit solvation models.   Key outcomes of the work include the identification of shortcomings of existing solvation models, especially implicit techniques in which the liquid environment is treated as a continuum.  Such methods fail to incorporate the response of the environment itself to the external polarized field, and this is vital for an accurate description of the relevant physics.  While explicit solvent approaches, which incorporate solvent molecules directly in the computation, can describe such responses correctly, they require much greater computational investment.  Thus, a second component of this project focused on the development of reduced scaling quantum chemical methods for molecular response properties.  In addition, we have developed the most advanced quantum chemical simulations to date of circularl polarized luminescence spectra, thus adding to the available tools for the identification of absolute configurations.  The broader impacts of this work include the development and public release of the PSI4 quantum chemistry program (www.psicode.org), the development of a series of software-development training projects for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students (http://bit.ly/1E48Fr6), and the training of graduate students and postdoctoral research associates.  The PSI4 package has been downloaded by thousands of researchers worldwide, and the programming projects are now used by dozens of universities globally for training new graduate students in theoretical chemistry.
