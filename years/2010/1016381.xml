<AbstractNarration>This research project will develop new numerical techniques for the optimization/design and simulation of multi-phase/multi-fluid flow in microfluidic devices. Novel techniques will be developed for modeling the effect of surface tension and surfactants which will significantly reduce the simulation time in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. Novel, non-intrusive/derivative-free optimization techniques shall be developed for controlling the creation of droplets and minimizing droplet re-coalescence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Lab on a chip" devices hold great promise for advancing research in proteomics and diagnostics and drug discovery.  One of the most frequently used microfluidic operations is the separation of aqueous reagents into droplets.  For example, these droplets can be stored in a droplet trap array and then released/processed at a later time.  Another operation of microfluidic devices is the creation of emulsions.  A better understanding of how surfactants and microfluidic device geometries affect droplet rupture and re-coalescence is fundamental in understanding the emulsification process.  Besides being an enabling technology for the design of microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices, numerical methods that aid in the design process associated with multi-phase flow and/or surfactants have applications in ship hull design, ink-jet devices, design of off-shore structures, design of beach erosion prevention devices, and the design and application of dispersants in order to break up oil emulsions (oil slicks) at air/water interfaces.</AbstractNarration>
