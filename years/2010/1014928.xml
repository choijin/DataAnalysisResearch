<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research  Through the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes (EAPSI) program I had the opportunity to conduct a research project with Dr. Arvind Varsani at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand.

The feeding behavior of these insects may result in the exchange of virus strains between cultivated and unmanaged areas which can potentially lead to the emergence of new recombinant virulent strains. This study aimed to investigate the diversity of viruses found in insects capitalizing upon their ability to "sample" viruses from many plants over space and time.                      The viral community in insects was explored by purifying viral particles from insect homogenates and sequencing the DNA extracted from purified viruses. Viruses found in different archived insect samples, including aphids, whiteflies and dragonflies, were analyzed while working in Dr. VarsaniÃ†s lab. Although dragonflies do not transmit plant viruses as they only feed on other insects, they are top predators in the insect world and, thus, may provide insights into viruses that affect and/or thrive in insect populations.

Education and outreach  As part of the EAPSI research project we visited the South Pacific Islands of Tonga and interacted with officials from the Tonga Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF).

During our field trip, we also had the opportunity to visit VavaÃ†u High School and talk to students from intermediate and high school levels about plant pathology and college education. Our interaction with MAFF, teachers, students, and the community resulted in a successful field trip and the interest of Tongans in our work.     Dr. Varsani, together with the Tonga Ministry of Education, developed the Tonga Science Network website (http://www.scienceisland.net/). This website provides a scientific forum for scientists, schools, and the community to discuss issues related to Tongan agriculture.  As part of the EAPSI project, I contributed a section to the network regarding the different virus infections we encountered during our field trip and the insect vectors that transmit these diseases.
