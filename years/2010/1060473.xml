<AbstractNarration>Western Washington University's S-STEM scholarship program increases the number of women earning BS or BA degrees in Computer Science or Mathematics and prepares them for employment or further academic study.  Enrichment activities include two freshman year seminar courses designed to encourage experimentation and collaboration. The seminar courses provide a broad view of mathematics and computer science and their connections with other disciplines, as well as helping students enhance their academic skills.  Intensive advising is available.  Monthly meetings for scholarship recipients provide exposure to topics of current interest and allow for unofficial peer mentoring.  A student chapter of the Association for Women in Computing offers an opportunity for both social and professional development.  Free math and computer science tutoring is available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholarship recipients develop a learning community of scholars via their freshman seminar courses which foster students' abilities to engage in inquiry, develop strategies to solve problems, complete projects, collaborate with peers, and effectively communicate orally and in writing.  The program broadens participation by encouraging talented and interested women to consider the study of mathematics and computer science.  Scholarship recipients are selected for their leadership qualities and academic potential.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF S-STEM grant funded the Computer Science and Math (CS/M) Scholars Program at Western Washington University (WWU).  This program incorporated many recognized best practices for the recruitment and retention of low-income female students in STEM. These best practices included: recruiting a diverse applicant pool, active advising, the development of a learning community among the students, first-year seminars focusing on the development of problem solving and communication skills, and monthly events which exposed students to career opportunities and provided professional development.  Intellectual Merit: In short, the program was successful; excellent low-income students were recruited and retained at a higher rate than projected.  Further, students have graduated with bachelor?s degrees in Computer Science or Math at a pace faster than projected.  Supported students excelled academically with an average GPA of 3.4, they received prestigious national fellowships and state-wide scholarships, earned lucrative internships, and almost all of the graduates are employed in jobs related to their field of study.   This project resulted in a publication in the Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education and four  presentations at meetings of the American Mathematical Society, the Mathematical Association of America, the Association of Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education and the American Society of Engineering Education.    Broader Impacts: There were several notable impacts beyond the students in the CS/M Scholars Program.  (1)  This grant supported 50 women in their pursuit of a BS in CS/M with graduates working in their field, thus further enhancing the diversity and the strength of the scientific and technical workforce.  (2) The program contributed to the increased participation of women in Computer Science and Math at WWU.  In CS at WWU, the percentage of female undergraduate majors doubled from 10% in 2011 to 20% in 2017.  In Math at WWU, the percentage of female undergraduate majors increased from 37% in 2011 to 49% in 2017.  (3) Thirty events were offered over the past six years featuring guest speakers from academia and industry which were attended by hundreds of WWU students enhancing their knowledge of career paths and opportunities.  (4)  Enhancements to WWU's math and CS tutoring programs were funded.  These programs serve all WWU CS/M students and the success of these programs has led to WWU permanently increasing funding for these heavily-utilized tutoring programs thereby sustaining their impact for years to come (5) First-quarter seminars required for CS/M Scholars were also taken by 57 additional WWU students of whom many are majoring in CS/M.  (6) Conference attendance by CS/M Scholars made a dramatic impact on the students and, in turn, the departments.          Last Modified: 04/07/2017       Submitted by: Perry Fizzano]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
