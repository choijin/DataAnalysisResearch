<AbstractNarration>Travel support is requested for about twenty U.S. participants (recent Ph.D.s, women, and members of underrepresented minority groups) to attend the 35th Conference on Stochastic Processes and Their Applications, to be held in Oaxaca, Mexico from 19th to 24th of June, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual ``Stochastic Processes and Their Applications'' meeting is one of the main international forum for researchers studying applied and theoretical problems in the field of stochastic processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important part of the intellectual development of researchers at the beginning of their career is to attend international conferences where they have an opportunity to interacts with people working in a wide range of topics. The 35th Conference on Stochastic Processes and Their Applications will feature twenty Plenary Lectures, sixteen Invited Sessions as well as numerous Contributed and Poster Sessions, covering many aspects of applied and theoretical probability.</AbstractNarration>
