<AbstractNarration>In the mid-1980s a flurry of ground-breaking papers introduced polynomial-time elliptic-curve point counting, the elliptic-curve method of factoring integers (ECM), primality proving using elliptic curves (ECPP), and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). The original papers triggered thousands of followup papers, demonstrating a spectacular series of interactions between mathematics, computer science, and engineering, with a profound impact on applications: for example, the government's current "Suite B" security standards recommend switching from RSA to ECC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "Workshop on Elliptic Curves and Computation" will celebrate the 25th anniversary of these papers and the subsequent 25 years of theory and practice of elliptic-curve computations. This workshop will include the 14th annual ECC workshop. The workshop will take place 18-22 October 2010 at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington, with a full week of carefully selected invited lectures, including lectures on the most exciting recent research in the area.</AbstractNarration>
