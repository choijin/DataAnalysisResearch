<AbstractNarration>The Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) is an array of 23 radio telescopes located at Cedar Flat, in the Inyo Mountains of California.  The array is heterogeneous, consisting of six 10-m telescopes belonging to Caltech, nine 6-m telescopes from the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association, and eight 3.5-m telescopes of The University of Chicago.  Not all telescopes currently have the capability to observe at the same wavelength or frequency bandpasses simultaneously.  The goal of being able to outfit all telescopes with receivers capable of observing at the same bandpass at the same time will soon be realized.  A collaboration between Dr. John Carpenter of  the California Institute of Technology and Dr. John Carlstrom of The University of Chicago will develop the digital correlators and receivers to fully integrate the CARMA telescopes into a single array that cross-correlates the signals from all 23 antennas simultaneously over the full 8 GHz IF bandwidth of the CARMA receivers.  This will provide significantly enhanced observing capability and will enable new discoveries in cosmology (especially the study of galaxy clusters and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect) and star formation (through the study of the chemistry and kinematics of molecular gas in star-forming regions).  This work is being funded by NSF's Major Research Instrumentation program though the Division of Astronomical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project had two major aims. The first was to outfit an interferometric array of 23 radio telescopes operated by a consortium - the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) near the Owens Valley Radio Observatory in California - with receivers operating at a wavelength of 1 cm to enable them to carry out extremely sensitive astronomical observations, as described below; and the second was to design a very broad bandwidth digital processor that would increase the sensitivity of the 23-telescope array.  The main scientific aims of the 1-cm receivers were twofold: (i) to make observations of the continuum (broadband) radio emission from clusters of galaxies, and (ii) to search for carbon monoxide (CO) emission from distant clusters of galaxies.  The first of the major aims was accomplished - the 1 cm receivers were installed - and two series of very sensitive observations that were scheduled to cover the two major scientific aims were successfully completed each of which provided the key data for a graduate student?s PhD thesis.  In the first a very distant cluster of galaxies was detected using a kind of "shadowing" effect in which very distant radio emission, called the cosmic microwave background radiation, is scattered by the hot electrons in an intervening cluster of galaxies.  In the second the aggregate carbon monoxide emission from clusters of galaxies was detected. This latter result must still be confirmed by other experiments, but if it is confirmed then it will open up a new way of studying cosmology - i.e. the evolution of the universe. The second of the major aims had been only partially accomplished when the CARMA National Science Foundation continuation proposal was declined, ending the operation of the interferometer, but with the permission of the National Science Foundation the aim was slightly modified to make the broadband digital backend for single antenna operation rather than for an interferometric array.  This has been successfully accomplished.  The digital work established how to run high-speed digitizers, how to transfer the data to fully programmable gate arrays, and how to program these arrays to make spectra.  A third graduate student?s PhD thesis was based partially on this work.  This digital work is being released to the public and it is expected that it will be found to have useful scientific and engineering applications in other fields. In addition to these direct scientific outcomes this program undertook a number of other activities aimed at bringing the work to the attention of he public and having a broader impact.  With this aim in mind the activities below were undertaken. A small column entitled "Astronomy Watch" was written for each issue of the local newspaper, The Inyo Register, which comes out 3 times per week. The articles highlight recent astronomical discoveries and also current events happening in the nighttime sky. In most years a tour was arranged for the United American Indian Involvement schoolchildren and their parents. These are mostly Los Angeles inner city Native American schoolchildren and Alaskan Native schoolchildren of ages 8 to 18.  The group comes to the Owens Valley every year for a summer camp and we anticipate that these tours will continue in the future.  On the first Monday of every month, there is a public tour of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. The tours last about an hour and typically consist of a talk about radio astronomy and history of the observatory. We include the current research projects at the observatory.  Fall Lecture Series: Caltech's Owens Valley Radio Observatory, in conjunction with Cerro Coso Community College, organizes a Fall Lecture Series, which started in 2011. This series of astronomy-related lectures is very popular -  between 60 to 120 people attend each talk. Past lecturers have all been high quality professionals who have spoken on topics ranging from planetary exploration to supermassive black holes to dark energy. The goal is for people to learn something  fundamental about the Universe each time they come to one of these lectures.            Last Modified: 12/30/2016       Submitted by: Anthony C.
