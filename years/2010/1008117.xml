<AbstractNarration>The UMCP ADVANCE IT project has four primary goals that are aimed at creating an academic environment that supports professional growth and values the contributions of women STEM faculty.  These goals include: enhancing faculty development opportunities that provide opportunities for national visibility and recognition; creating a sense of agency for women STEM faculty; promoting faculty relationships and networks; and encouragement of achievement of professional goals and contributions of women STEM faculty.  To this end, the UMCP ADVANCE project proposes several activities that are expected to transform the academic environment at the institution.  The project also proposes an emphasis on the underrepresentation of women of color at the institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  The UMCP ADVANCE IT project is unique in that it uses a basis of professional growth for women faculty to promote institutional change, particularly in the STEM disciplines.  Specifically, this project not only advances STEM women faculty, but also works toward changing cultures, addresses work life balance and utilizes evaluation and social science to transform the institution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.  The UMCP ADVANCE IT project addresses the professional growth concerns of STEM women faculty with particular attention to women of color.  To that end, this project has the potential to serve as a model for other institutions that endeavor to address similar challenges.  Dissemination of research findings and project activity accomplishments are expected to occur through the traditional means of peer reviewed journal articles, a project website and national presentations and outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>
