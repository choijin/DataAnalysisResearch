<AbstractNarration>Title:  Undocumented Shorelines of Lake Bonneville: New Paleoclimatic and Hydrodynamic Interpretations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigators:  Paul W. Jewell, Associate Professor of Geology and Geophysics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; Kathleen Nicoll, Assistant Professor of Geography, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; Charles G. Oviatt, Professor of Geology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Earth scientists at the University of Utah and Kansas State University will undertake fundamental research regarding Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, which was the largest lake in the western United States during the last glacial period, and the precursor to the modern Great Salt Lake.  While the Lake Bonneville record for the past 18,000 years is reasonably well documented, the earlier period (18,000-30,000 years ago) is poorly understood because those deposits have been destroyed or overprinted by younger, rising lake waters, or subsequent erosion.  This NSF-funded project will apply a variety of analytical tools including ground penetrating radar, 3-dimensional digital photography, hydrodynamic modeling, and radiocarbon dating of extremely small amounts of organic material to inform our understanding of landscape dynamics that have long puzzled researchers in this poorly documented period of the Lake Bonneville record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Lake Bonneville and its associated sediments are culturally and economically important landforms of the Intermountain Western United States.  Sands and gravels deposited by the lake form important groundwater aquifers, and provide aggregate resources to much of the region.  The time period of Lake Bonneville being studied is a critical period in Earth's climate history as it marked the transition from a very cold, dry global climate during glacial times to the warmer, interglacial climate of the modern era.  The records of landscape change at Lake Bonneville are vital for studying this climatic transition in the Great Basin province, and will provide details about rates of long-term hydrologic change within North America?s largest desert.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Undocumented Shorelines of Lake Bonneville: New Paleoclimatic and Hydroclimatic Interpretations  Lake Bonneville existed in the eastern portion of the Great Basin of the United States from approximately 30,000 to 13,000 years ago.  This corresponds to the time of the last ice age on Earth.  For reasons that are still not completely understood the climate of the Great Basin was much wetter and colder than the modern desert regime of this area.  Understanding the shorelines of Lake Bonneville is important because well-dated shorelines give scientists a way to calculate the precise amount of water in the lake at a given time.  The elevations of the lake shorelines with can be graphed with their ages (based primarily on radiocarbon dating) to show us whether the lake was gaining volume (meaning the climate was very wet) or losing volume (the climate was dry).  The major shorelines (from highest to lowest, named Bonneville, Provo, and Stansbury) of Lake Bonneville have been recognized and studied for nearly 150 years.  However, there are a number more poorly exposed and studied shorelines that have remained a mystery, mostly because they have not been correlated from one side of the basin to the other.  Over the past two decades, an important new technology called LiDAR (an acronym for Light Detection and Ranging) has come into widespread use in the earth sciences.  Using LiDAR, scientists are can determine elevations of features on the surface of the Earth at very fine resolution.  By applying LiDAR to the very subtle shorelines of Lake Bonneville, it is now possible to correlate these features across the basin and possibly relate them to ancient climate fluctuations that occurred during the last ice age.  Another technique, ground penetrating radar (GPR), has been applied to both the well-studied and undocumented shorelines of Lake Bonneville.   Radio waves are pulsed through the subsurface to reveal sedimentary features not visible at the surface of the ground.  Interpretations of GPR imaging allows scientists to determine whether the lake was continually rising or whether its move upward had an oscillatory component.  Shoreline features of a lake are strongly influenced by waves formed during large storms.  Numerical models of wave dynamics allow researchers to understand the nature and magnitude of storms that were present during the last ice age and thus address one more piece of the climate puzzle associated with Lake Bonneville.  Results of this study appear to indicate that the predominant direction of winds during the time of Lake Bonneville was from the north, unlike the modern climate of the eastern Great Basin in which strong winds are dominantly from the south.  By piecing together evidence and data from all of these techniques, the geological history of Lake Bonneville and its relation to major climate changes over the past 30,000 years is now coming more into focus.
