<AbstractNarration>This project provides support to Dr. Aly Fathy, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Tennessee Knoxville to organize and host a workshop with Dr. Hadia El-Hennawy, Dean of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt on emerging microwave technologies in Cairo Egypt from 20-21 October 2010.  The workshop will assess the current status of the science and identify future directions in which to stimulate new research directions for microwave technology including design, material characterization, various engineering aspects and applications. Participation is expected by scientists from the US, Egypt, as well as other countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region including Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and Lebanon.  To further ensure wide participation, this workshop will be held after the IEEE-Microwave Theory and Technology Administrative Committee?s meeting in Cairo, Egypt 16-17 October 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The workshop addresses important technical areas i.e. microwave devices, materials, and related technologies. This is an important area in terms of research that addresses energy harvesting (e.g. solar) as well as many other issues such as wireless communications including ultra-wide band (UWB) communication.  The main objective of this workshop is to have in-depth discussions on new technological, experimental, computational, and theoretical advances in processing, characterization, multi-scale modeling in microwave engineering. The workshop will also provide a venue for better understanding the fundamental science underlying new processes and device applications of new semiconductor materials like Gallium Nitride GaN.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed workshop targets areas of global interest namely communications and energy harvesting. The workshop will allow scientists from the U. S. and the MENA region countries to exchange their experiences, ideas, and information about the recent advancement of microwave technologies. The workshop will provide a forum to identify and foster potential collaborations among the workshop participants, which will stimulate new research directions of microwave communications, devices, and energy technology including design, material characterization, various engineering aspects and applications for the benefit of the public and private sectors.  This workshop has great potential for developing additional, new collaborations between the participants and the cooperative research derived from this workshop will likely lead to several new and far reaching research and educational activities, as well as economic developments involving the private sectors in the United States and the MENA region countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         US-Egypt Regional Workshop on Microwave Emerging Technologies  Summary  This workshop has high lightened the current research activities in both the USA and the Middle East.  It has provided a forum for a multidisciplinary discussion on microwave engineering and antennas, and promoted interactions between senior researchers in these fields; also has identified potential collaborations among the participants. The workshop focused on key issues related to security, energy harvesting, UWB, and wireless infrastructure. These issues are of great interest to both USA and international participants. The exchange of ideas among the participants is intended to stimulate further collaboration and progress in these fields and will provide guidance to all of the participants. Intellectual Merit  The workshop has highlighted the new technological, experimental, computational, and theoretical advances in processing, characterization, multi-scale modeling, and device applications of new semiconductor materials in order to develop an improved understanding of the underlying processes and mechanisms.  In addition, the workshop has also highlighted and covered interdisciplinary research on the boundaries of science and engineering. U.S. scholars had the opportunity to work with Egyptian counterparts on developing a strategy and methodology, and had investigated techniques to addressing global challenging problems.  The exchange of ideas among the participants intended to stimulate further collaboration and progress in these fields and provided guidance to the junior participants in their future research and endeavors.  US participants had the opportunity to make site visits to Egyptian universities and to the national research Center with the goal of seeding collaborations with Egyptian researchers. Particular attention was given to developing new collaborative approaches, which worked to improve mutual understanding and cooperation.  The techniques that were learned can be transferred to the US. Each of the participants brings a significant area of expertise. The project has the potential of having a large impact on Egypt, by creating collaborations between US and the Egyptian scientists that can directly impact Egyptian research, and by encouraging Egyptian students and postdocs to study in US universities. The expected outcomes of this workshop included a set of recommendations that identify necessary building blocks for facilitating the collaboration between the two countries. Furthermore, it is expected that the interactions and discussions at the workshop will lead to the identification of opportunities for collaborative research among diverse stakeholder groups both in the region and in the United States.  Broader Impact The proposed effort is aimed at developing a microwave engineering curriculum to promote teaching as well as collaborative research and education in microwave and antennas engineering.  US scientists were invited to participate and had the opportunity to seek an international research and culturally rich experience. The activity is expected to contribute to enhancing microwave technology and practice, instrumentation development, and new methodologies for energy harvesting. The workshop was to bring the microwave research community together to share the recent developments in the field, evolving topics, and opportunities to enhance research and education infrastructure. More importantly, the workshop aims at creating a vivid discussion forum to analyze what the research community can/should do in the scientific fundamentals to bring about the next revolution in microwave systems for their accelerated insertion into existing and new fields of applications. Benefits to society To maintain leadership in microwave technology, the workshop is timely and relevant to the NSF mission.  The workshop intended to provide cultural training, international experience, and perspectives for US scientists. It stimulated US scien...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
