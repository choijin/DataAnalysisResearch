<AbstractNarration>This project funds student travel for the ACM SIGMETRICS 2010 conference to be held at Columbia University in New York, on June 14-18, 2010. SIGMETRICS is the key conference in the performance modeling area and it is critical that students attend this conference so that they are inspired to look into formal modeling techniques.  The the total amount of $10K will be used to support 20 student travel grants. Each supported student will receive $500 USD to cover travel cost and lodging expenses and will receive free conference registration. The support requested in this proposal will make possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend. Particular attention will be paid to directing support towards under-represented minorities including women.</AbstractNarration>
