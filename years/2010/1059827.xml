<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests   NSF support to broaden participation in the Sixteenth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS?10), to be held in Newport Beach, California on March 5?11, 2011. ASPLOS is the premiere forum for research involving the interaction of computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems. It brings together leading researchers from these diverse communities to one conference offering opportunities to interact across traditional disciplinary boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to increase the impact of this conference by enabling participation by additional students and faculty for whom travel support would otherwise preclude their attendance, priority for these funds will be given to defray the travel expenses of under-represented minorities and faculty from non-Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;granting institutions.</AbstractNarration>

The ACM SIGs preferred to fund students who were already members or students whose research closely aligned with the interest of the SIGs (e.g., SIGPLAN preferred to fund students whose research focuses on programming languages, as opposed to SIGOPS which has a focus on operating systems. Travel grant awardees were allowed to purchase membership in the SIG that provided the funding as a pre-condition to receiving those travel grant awards.
