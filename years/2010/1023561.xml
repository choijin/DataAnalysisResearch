<AbstractNarration>The Barrow Area Information Database (BAID, http://baid.utep.edu) is a regional cyberinfrastructure that offers users access to geospatial information about more than 9,600 research sites in the area. The BAID is an online geospatial information tool used by scientists, land managers, educators, students, subsistence hunters and the general public. The services provide information about scientific research in the region from Barrow to Atqasuk with a suite of online, interative maps and services, including searchable fields and more than 150 data layers describing vegetation, topography, land ownership, ground control points and infrastructure. This proposal will update and upgrade the current services offered via web servers. In addition, a wireless sensor network will provide near real-time meteorological data for the region. Data available through BAID will be made more interoperable and will link to the data archives at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Detailed climate data with spatial coverage for the region will benefit a broad group of researchers. The project will also develop students who can program, develop, and maintain cyberinfrastructure tools and infrastructure for basic researcher, land managers and land users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Barrow Area Information Database (BAID) is a cyberinfrastructure managing project site information (e.g., instrument locations) in the Barrow, Alaska area. Ideally, project managers at NSF should be able to view information about a project site in the BAID interface, see which funded awards utilized that project site, and access the data collected at that location. Currently, this pathway does not exist. This goals of this component of the Development and Innovation of the Barrow Area Information Database (BAID) project were to:  Identify barriers affecting the flow of information between funders, logistics managers, principal investigators and the archives ultimately holding data sets generated as an outcome of funded projects, and Prototype solutions for reducing these barriers and enabling information flow between all stakeholders in the project lifecycle.   Activities in support of this project included:  In-person and remote meetings to describe and understand existing workflows. A field trip to Barrow to observe typical data collection activities and the initial data curation workflow. Review of existing metadata holdings and web service endpoints for the logistical information in BAID. Review of existing metadata holdings, web service endpoints, and data storage strategies for the research data managed by data archives. Creation of examples of enriched ISO 19115 metadata that more completely describe data sources (field sites) and links to the data generated as a result of research activites at that site. Development of a prototype data server to demonstrate how data values might be usefully exported from a data archive to BAID. Presentation of two posters at Research Data Alliance Plenary meetings.   Given its focus on instrument locations and in-situ measurement sites, BAID has a very different point of view than that described by a research data set representing the aggregation of data collected at multiple field sites. Research data archives typically focus on describing the aggregation of information collected, not the slices of individual measurements corresponding to one of the BAID entries.
