<AbstractNarration>Several modern data mining applications involve predictive modeling on large &lt;br/&gt;amounts of multi-relational data with added structures such as product &lt;br/&gt;hierarchies or social networks among customers. The broad goal of this proposal &lt;br/&gt;is to develop a comprehensive framework for predictive modeling on large, &lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous, multi-relational data based on  "Simultaneous Decomposition and &lt;br/&gt;Prediction" (SDaP) approaches that iteratively partition the problem into more &lt;br/&gt;homogeneous and manageable pieces while concurrently building multiple  &lt;br/&gt;predictive models, one for each piece. Such approaches lead to simpler and more &lt;br/&gt;accurate solutions. The proposed algorithmic strategies that determine how many &lt;br/&gt;models to learn and where they should apply, which data to discard and which to &lt;br/&gt;keep, how to learn multiple related tasks defined on  multi-modal data, and how &lt;br/&gt;to scalably implement the solutions on distributed computers,  provide practical &lt;br/&gt;solutions to certain real-world problems  for which current learning and data &lt;br/&gt;mining techniques are  severely lacking. Application domains of ecology, bio-&lt;br/&gt;informatics, market research and web mining are specifically identified and &lt;br/&gt;targeted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two broad research impacts of the proposed project: (a) it further &lt;br/&gt;vitalizes the research in data mining towards better algorithms for predictive &lt;br/&gt;modeling on rich and heterogeneous multi-modal data, and (b) provides and &lt;br/&gt;promotes the SDaP approach as a fundamental data analysis tool across multiple &lt;br/&gt;disciplines. The PI will organize a workshop and offer a tutorial at major data &lt;br/&gt;mining conferences to foster and promote research on various aspects of SDaP &lt;br/&gt;analysis. Moreover, the curated complex datasets and software developed under &lt;br/&gt;this project will be shared with the scientific community via a public web site &lt;br/&gt;as part of the proposed one-of-a-kind multi-relational data benchmarking &lt;br/&gt;facility. The PI will further develop a novel graduate course on Modeling and &lt;br/&gt;Analysis of Complex Data. Outreach modules that illustrate data analysis &lt;br/&gt;concepts and capabilities at levels appropriate for pre-college students will &lt;br/&gt;also be developed.
