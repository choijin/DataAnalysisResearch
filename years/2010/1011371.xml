<AbstractNarration>Understanding the importance of biological diversity is critical in the face of unprecedented, anthropogenic global change such as increased introduction of invasive species and land-use change. This research consists of two greenhouse experiments that will provide insight into how diversity is maintained in grasslands, and why this diversity could be important to ecosystem functions such as productivity and invasion resistance. The first experiment will establish competition among genetically distinct individuals to understand how diversity is maintained within a dominant native grass. The second experiment will examine how this genetic diversity prevents establishment of different native and invasive seedlings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project will inform the preservation of biodiversity, prevention of species invasions, and the enhancement of carbon sequestration in grasslands, an economically and ecologically valuable ecosystem. Results will also be integrated into local environmental education programs to emphasize the importance of preserving biodiversity in native ecosystems. The project will give undergraduate and underrepresented high school students access to hands-on learning about the research process, allowing them to connect scientific research on a growing environmental problem. Finally, funding this project will train a young female scientist.</AbstractNarration>
