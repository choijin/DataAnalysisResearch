<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is the design of innovative routing,&lt;br/&gt;planning and coordination strategies for robot networks, and their&lt;br/&gt;application to oceanography.  The approach is organized in three&lt;br/&gt;synergistic thrusts: (1) the application of queueing theory and&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial techniques to networked robots performing sequential tasks,&lt;br/&gt;(2) the design of novel distributed optimization and coordination schemes&lt;br/&gt;relying only on asynchronous and asymmetric communication, (3) the design&lt;br/&gt;of practical routing and coordination algorithms for the USC Networked&lt;br/&gt;Aquatic Platforms.  In collaboration with oceanographers and marine&lt;br/&gt;biologists, the project aims to design motion, communication and&lt;br/&gt;interaction protocols that maximize the amount of scientific information&lt;br/&gt;collected by the platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses multi-dimensional problems of relevance in&lt;br/&gt;Engineering and Computer Science by unifying fundamental concepts from&lt;br/&gt;multiple cyberphysical domains (robotics, autonomy, combinatorics, and&lt;br/&gt;network science).  Our team has expertise in a broad range of scientific&lt;br/&gt;disciplines, including control theory and theoretical computer science and&lt;br/&gt;their applications to multi-agent systems, robotics and sensor networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will have a positive impact on the emerging&lt;br/&gt;technology of autonomous and reliable robotic networks, performing a broad&lt;br/&gt;range of environmental monitoring and logistic tasks.  Our educational and&lt;br/&gt;outreach objectives are manifold and focus on (1) integrating the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research themes into undergraduate education and research, e.g., via the&lt;br/&gt;existing NSF REU site at the USC Computer Science Department, and (2)&lt;br/&gt;mounting a vigorous program of outreach activities, e.g., via a&lt;br/&gt;well-developed collaboration with the UCSB Center for Science and&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Partnerships.</AbstractNarration>
