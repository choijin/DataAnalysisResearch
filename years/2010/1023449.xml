<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative project involving four institutions. The proposed research addresses two major questions related to climate in the eastern Alaskan Arctic: 1) How has climate, terrestrial ecology, and pollutant transport changed over the past 250 years in this region, based on ice core reconstructions from McCall Glacier? and 2) How well can we overcome the challenges of core proxy interpretations from ice cores taken from small polythermal valley glaciers through modern-process studies? To answer these questions the investigators conduct an inter-disciplinary analysis of ice core proxies, atmospheric dynamics, modern processes, and numerical ice flow modeling. A 152-meter long core has already been drilled through McCall Glacier and analyzed for 35 chemical proxies. The proposed work will focus on 1) interpretation of these proxies, 2) analysis of pollen in the core, 3) process studies to identify sources of pollen to McCall Glacier, 4) tying the weather and climate record of the past 50 years to the upper section of the core, 5) continuing 3D flow modeling of the glacier and local weather observations, 6) conducting modern process investigations of the effects of seasonal melt on the generation of the core proxy record. The project will support two graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Glaciers and ice caps across the globe are some of our best-known archives for information about past our climates.  Cores from these glaciers can be retrieved, and various chemical and physical constituents that have been trapped in the ice can be analyzed.  Pollen is often one of these constituents, and can be analyzed and used to reconstruct the past vegetation of the region surrounding the glacier.  Though these ice-core pollen studies are still relatively few, results have shown that can be very valuable in reconstructing past climate.  At the beginning of this project, no one had attempted to conduct a pollen study on an ice core recovered from a polythermal valley glacier.   Polythermal glaciers have a mixture of "warm" and "cold" ice.   The temperature of warm ice is typically right at the pressure melting point, while the temperature of cold ice is below (and considered hard and dry).      This project took place on the McCall glacier in northern Alaska.  Over the course of the study, a 152-m core taken from the upper cirque at McCall was analyzed for pollen at 4 m intervals.  Unfortunately, the pollen concentration in the core was much lower than expected.  Aside from the uppermost sample (first 4 meters), most samples are based on a total pollen count of less than 50, which is marginal for a reliable pollen record. These results lead us to believe that pollen is being lost (in great quantities) somewhere between deposition and entrainment in glacial ice, or that meltwater on the glacier is washing the pollen away.     The analysis of the core shows a fairly homogeneous assemblage of pollen throughout the record, with all pollen potentially coming from local/regional sources.  A few noticeable trends are the marked increase in fern spore around the turn of the 20th century, and the slight decrease in tree species like Alnus and Salix during the late-Little Ice Age.  This decline is roughly associated with increases in grasses and sedges, possibly signaling a colder and wetter period of the Little Ice Age.  Again though, pollen concentrations are so low that a meaningful interpretation of the pollen record is questionable at best.     In addition to analyzing this ice core, we ran a series of experiments (run in laboratory conditions to mimic the ice on the glacier) to test if meltwater could effectively remove pollen from the ice.  Results show that during our experiment, pollen was effectively transported downward, into lower layers of the ice and/or washed out completely by the meltwater.  Our study clearly shows that pollen is transported via meltwater, which would explain the low pollen concentrations within the McCall ice core.  These results should also help advise the scientific community that potential ice core pollen studies are risky in glaciers with "soft" ice, like McCall.
