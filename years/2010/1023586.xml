<AbstractNarration>Movement of glaciers and ice sheets affects their stability and attendant sea-level rise as the climate warms. In addition, ice-sheet movement during the Pleistocene left a spectacular imprint on landscapes. Glaciers that move fastest and modify landscapes most severely move primarily by slip over their rock (hard) or sediment (soft) beds. Increasingly sophisticated theories of this slip have been advanced over the last half-century, but these theories are largely untested, owing to the inaccessibility of glacier beds and the spatial and temporal variability of conditions there. The objective of this project is to use a newly constructed laboratory device to study relationships among glacier slip velocity, basal drag (slip resistance) and effective pressure (ice pressure minus water pressure at the bed). The device drags a ring of melting ice (0.9 m outside diameter, 0.2 m wide, 0.15 m thick) across a hard or soft bed. Features of the device include unlimited slip displacement, temperature control to a few hundredths of degree, and continuous observation of ice sliding and flow separation at the bed. One set of experiments will test the theory that as slip velocity increases, steady drag on a rough, hard bed attains a maximum value and then either remains constant or decreases, depending upon the bed geometry. Basal drag, slip velocity, and effective pressure will be individually varied during slip of ice at its melting temperature over stepped and sinusoidal bed surfaces. Numerical modeling of ice flow under the geometric constraints of the experiment will allow theoretical results to be compared directly with experimental data. A second set of experiments will provide relationships among slip velocity, drag, and effective pressure for soft beds. These experiments will also reveal both the extent to which ice invades the pore spaces of soft beds by melting and refreezing and the degree to which soft beds deform to accommodate slip?problems central to evaluating sediment transport by glaciers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robust quantitative models of glacier slip are needed to forecast the speeds of glaciers and ice sheets. Glaciers have been observed surging, i.e. moving forward at unusually high velocities, and retreating at various rates, apparently in response to changing climate. The experimental studies of this project will examine glacier movement in a a way that can not be determined from field observations.  A more complete analysis of the sliding process will allow glacier slip to be treated more accurately and less arbitrarily in computer models of glacier and ice-sheet motion. This will permit better characterizations of environmental change in the near future and of landscape evolution in the distant past.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  Many glaciers and parts of ice sheets move primarily by sliding over their beds, which can consist of rigid, rough rock (hard beds) or weak, deformable sediment (soft beds).  The sliding speed of glaciers helps control how they modify landscapes and the speed at which they convey ice to the oceans and thereby affect rates of sea-level rise. We used a custom laboratory device (Figure 1) to study slip of ice at its melting temperature over hard and soft beds.  We learned the following.  1)  Regardless of whether ice slips over a stepped hard bed (Figure 1) or a hard bed with periodic, wavy undulations, the bed becomes slipperier the faster the ice slides.  The reason for this behavior is that as sliding speed increases, cavities become progressively larger down-glacier from bumps where ice separates from the bed, so ice is in contact with only the tops of bumps. The result, measured for the first time in this study, is that the drag on the base of the glacier can be smaller at higher sliding speeds. This effect, if it occurs beneath real glaciers, would be important because weather or climate variability that causes glaciers to speed up would result in a feedback that makes them move even faster. Although decreasing drag with increasing sliding speed has been justified theoretically, computer models of glacier flow used to study glacial landscape evolution and predict the future contribution of glaciers to sea-level rise do not include this effect. Experimenting with this effect in computer models would be a valuable exercise.  2)  When ice slips over a soft bed, the drag the bed exerts on the ice depends on the shearing resistance (i.e., frictional strength) of the bed sediment. That resistance is generally independent of the sliding speed. Most deformation of the soft bed occurs very near the base of the ice, so that the volume of sediment moved by the ice is small.  These results support some computer models of glacier flow but at are odds with most such models, which either explicitly or implicitly consider soft beds to be viscous fluids that strengthen with increasing sliding speed or that shear over large fractions of the bed thickness.   3)  When ice is in stationary contact with glacial sediment after a period of slip, the stress required to initiate slip increases with the duration of the period the surfaces are in contact.  The effect with ice is more pronounced than when sediment alone is sheared after a stationary period. The more pronounced behavior with ice indicates that after cavities form at the bed surface during slip of ice over a soft bed, downward flow of ice causes cavities to close, increasing the contact area of ice with the bed and adding strength to it that increases with time.  These observations help explain why some fast moving glaciers can build up strain like a coiled spring and then release it suddenly in a burst of rapid motion and do so repeatedly in a process called "stick-slip."  This behavior is a hallmark of some rapidly moving parts of ice sheets and is responsible for earthquakes derived from the beds of some glaciers.   Overall this project has helped demonstrate physics germane to the sliding dynamics of glaciers, which can improve efforts to accurately model their flow and associated influences on landscapes.  Broader impacts  By demonstrating effects not currently included in models of ice-sheet dynamics, this work may contribute to efforts by the broad community of scientists attempting to assess future sea-level rise.  The project was also responsible for helping to launch the careers of three young scientists.  It provided three years of training in research, teaching, and advising for a postdoc, which helped him compete successfully for a tenure-track faculty positon at a major university. The project provided the thesis subject and stipend for a graduate student, who upon completion of his degree began a career with a geophysical consulting firm.  The project supported the involvement of an undergraduate research assistant, who was drawn to glaciology as a result, and last year began graduate studies in glaciology and geophysics.
