<AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial support for the 2010/11 to 2011/12 core budget of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research. The proposal has two objectives: 1) to maintain and strengthen the IAI?s operations which have been severely curtailed as a result of unpaid core-budget contributions, including significant shortfalls in the US, Mexican and Venezuelan contributions; and 2) to increase the policy relevance of ongoing IAI research networks by developing a scientific synthesis across these networks, and by using the synthesis process to develop a reliable science-policy interface that provides a lasting structure for a better integration of science with decision making across IAI member countries. The synthesis is conducted in collaboration between the IAI Directorate, investigators in the science networks and stakeholders in IAI global change science in the member countries. The process is accompanied with an assessment of these activities to identify best practices for future science initiatives. &lt;br/&gt;Expected outcomes are: 1) an improved integration of science output into policy and decision processes, including lasting organizational structures for the governance of global change science; 2) documentation of best practices to guide science programs to be initiated in 2011/12 with improved provisions for synthesis and policy integration from the proposal stage onwards; and 3) cross-project synthesis of science results and exchanges of technologies and methods between projects and regions to enhance the value of ongoing networks. As output we expect science digests for policy making, scientific papers that provide knowledge and insight into lessons emerging from across programs, regions and disciplines, and publications that describe and analyze approaches to the integration process and identify best practices. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the critical review and synthesis of scientific research carried out in current IAI networks since 2007: in the collaborative research networks, human dimensions projects, IDRC/Canada-funded La Plata Basin development research project, and the McArthur-funded assessment of biodiversity and climate change in the tropical Andes. The interdisciplinary analysis provides new insights into natural and coupled human-environmental processes that improve knowledge through inter-regional comparisons. It also makes science available for policy and decision making by involving the IAI political representations and civil society partners in the science synthesis. The evolving integration across the science-policy interface itself will be assessed by a research component that analyzes the processes. The assessment will be documented in publications on science governance for different policy sectors and decision makers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: By managing the science-policy engagement, a permanent partnership for science-policy interface is established that fulfils the IAI's mandate to manage research for informed decision making. This strengthens the IAI's role in global change research on the American continent, and involves the political bodies of the IAI by providing a broader, intensified science-policy dialogue with different sectors of society that should lead to improved policy-making on global change issues.</AbstractNarration>

The Directorate's capacity building activities aim at the integration of research and training in global change sciences and applications. Besides providing lectures and instruction, IAI researchers are also students at IAI training events. This double role is possible because of the unique space the IAI explores at the interface between different sciences and policy and decision making - where everyone has something to learn. The international character of those activities provides "take home" capacity building that enriches research groups and networks.  Capacity building is not limited to human resources or to global change knowledge, but also aims at institutions. When signing the contracts and implementing international projects involving different institutions and management procedures, the Assistant Director for Finance and Administration provides advice and cooperates with the administration of research institutions, so that they can meet international management and accounting standards. Hundreds of research institutions in the Americas have improved capacities and knowledge on international grant management, accountability and interactions with other institutions in the Americas.  In the past year, one of the central activities of the Directorate has been the synthesis of results of the Collaborative Research Network program (CRN) and its complement, the Small Grants Program for Human Dimensions (SGP-HD).

The IAI directorate participates in the technical advisory body of the UN climate change convention (UNFCCC), highlighting global change research findings of relevance to policy making and promoting the participation of IAI scientists in such fora to communicate in first person the relevance of their findings for policy decisions on global change.  The relevance and excellence of IAI-funded research is shown in that one third of the South and Central American Regional panel for the Fifth IPCC Assessment Report are IAI scientists. The IPCC assessment is an effective means for disseminating IAI science findings.  Two collaborative research projects have contributed to legislative and legal processes providing expertise on biodiversity and ecosystem services to the Province of Cordoba, Argentina, and to the federal Court of Brazil.
