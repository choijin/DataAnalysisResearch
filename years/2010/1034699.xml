<AbstractNarration>Michigan Technological University (MTU) proposes to join the existing Center for Bioenergy Research and Development that is currently comprised of the South Dakota School of Mines (lead), North Carolina State University (NCSU), the University of Hawaii, Kansas State University (KSU) and the State University of New York at Stony Brook (SBU).    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal request from Michigan Tech seeks funding to join the multi-university IUCRC for Bioenergy Research and Development (CBeRD). Research in CBeRD is highly interactive and multi-institutional. Universities participating in the center have identified six research foci: Feedstock agronomy and supply, feedstock breeding and genomics, bioprocessing microbes and enzymes, biomass processing, new platform technologies, and modeling and process lifecycle analysis.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the proposed planning grant workshop, the specific research foci of Michigan Tech's contribution to CBERD in the above areas will be crystallized. Michigan Tech has researchers contributing to create a multidisciplinary approach spanning the entire transportation biofuels value chain with a focus on forest resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CBERD is positioned to make transformative discoveries that enable the ligocellulosic and oil and fats based bio-industries to meet the challenge of declining petroleum supply. The proposed site will serve as an educational environment to fill the workforce pipeleine with engineers and scientists needed, will extend the reach of CBERD, and will continue to strive to not only bring minorities into this growing industry, but will help create an innovative base in economically deprived areas. The proposed site will also work on improving gender equality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dr. David Shonnard, Director of the Sustainable Futures Institute (SFI) and Robbins Chair of the Chemical Engineering Department at Michigan Technological University was awarded a Planning Grant to investigate the feasibility of joining the Center for Bioenergy Research and Development (CBERD) headquartered at the South Dakota School of Mines.  Over an 18 month period Dr. Shonnard and the staff at SFI attended advisory board meetings of CBERD (UNY-Stony Brook and the University of Hawaii), participated in NSF I/UCRC meetings, participated in weekly CBERD management conference calls and hosted a planning meeting on the campus of Michigan Technological University.  The planning meeting was attended by representatives from eight companies and the program engaged nine faculty members from six departments on campus to discuss projects that included: Lignocellulosic Biomass Conversion, Process Systems Engineering of Biorefineries, Microbial Electrolysis Cells for Hydrogen Reclamation, Experimental Study and Modeling of Wood-Chipping Mechanics, Building a Multimodal Model for Biomass Transportation, Forecasting Poplar Biomass Crop Management from Fields to Forest Scales, Characterization and Determination of Green Diesel Sooting Propensity towards Development of an Optimum Formulation for Advanced Diesels, Algae Interactions with Nanoscale Magnetite.  The goal of the planning process was to align elements of the SFI Wood-to-Wheels (W2W) research agenda with the goals and focus of CBERD in anticipation of joining the CBERD I/UCRC in 2012.  After close consultation with potential industry sponsors and participating researchers at Michigan Technological University it was determined that CBERD is not the best fit for the W2W research agenda.  Based upon this assessment it was decided that Michigan Technological University would not pursue full membership in CBERD.
