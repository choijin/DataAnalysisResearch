<AbstractNarration>The project enables a group of U.S. researchers to collaborate with the planning for, and to attend, a workshop that the German Research Foundation (DFG) is holding on their priority program, "Science and the General Public: Understanding Fragile and Conflicting Scientific Evidence." The goal of the conference is to share theoretical approaches, emthods, and findings, leading ultimately to a research agenda on the public understanding of science and a set of empirically-tested design principles for communicating science-related information to the lay public. The meeting will be held in the U.S.</AbstractNarration>
