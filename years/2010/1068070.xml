<AbstractNarration>1068070 Boston University; Thomas Bifano &lt;br/&gt;1068109 University of California-Davis; Dennis L. Matthews &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center for Biophotonic Sensors and Systems (CBSS) will advance photonics technology as the enabler for major advances in disease diagnostics and drug discovery. The research efforts will be anchored by Boston University's Photonic Center as the lead institution, partnered with the University of California-Davis Center for Biophotonic Science and Technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center, comprised of Boston University (BU) and the University of California-Davis (UCD), plans to establish a natural resource for Biophotonic Sensors and Systems (CBSS) where photonics provide the enabling technologies for advances in methods to detect/sense and identify biological properties, conditions, or changes at the molecular and cellular/sub-cellular level. The potential target applications of disease diagnosis, drug efficacy testing, patient monitoring, and food and water safety represent a balanced mixture of highly-relevant topics well suited to the I/UCRC model. Both BU and UCD have mature photonics research Centers and a track record of achievement in managing translational research activities. The proposed CBBS will build on the respective University's research talent and technology transfer skills to attract industrial partners who will subsequently play a significant role in planning, selecting, and implementing the output of the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus on global health initiatives and numerous planned educational programs provides a platform for significant broader impact of this center. Technology transfer plans are appropriate and both universities have a good history of translational research. The industry participation will enhance the students educational experience by providing a pipeline for talented engineers and scientist to industry. BU and UCD are committed to developing the academic potential of under-represented groups in STEM fields. The success of the proposed Center will enable new photonics sensor technologies that can improve public healthcare, food and water safety, and homeland security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Center for Biophotonic Sensors and Systems (CBSS) focuses on precompetitive research and provides the enabling technologies for advanced methods to detect or sense and identify biological properties, conditions, or changes at the molecular, cellular and subcellular levels. These advancements will lead to an understanding of disease mechanisms; and development of diagnostic tools, tools to be used in the drug discovery process and tools for food and water safety.     The Center is led by Boston University and has a second university site at the University of California, Davis campus.  The Center Director and Site Director, along with the Industry Advisory Board set the direction for the Center and select the projects to be funded.  The Center has the support of a diversified faculty with broad engineering and science expertise.  CBSS currently involves the Medical, Engineering and Science schools of both BU and UC Davis with faculty representing Neurological Surgery, Internal Medicine, Microbiology, Physiology and Psychiatry departments, as well as the more traditional photonic and engineering departments such as Biomedical Engineering, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, Chemistry, Physics and Mechanical Engineering.  Faculty have encouraged graduate students and post-docs to spin-out promising technologies and these efforts are supported by the Business Innovation Center (BIC) at BU.  One such spinout is nanoView Diagnostics whose core technology was developed under a CBSS funded project.  The Center has done well at recruiting members and seventeen (17) different companies have been center members during Phase I.  However, retention is a challenge with only two companies (BD and Thorlabs) staying as members for the full duration.  Interestingly, this 13% retention rate is in line with overall I/UCRC retention rates.  The current membership includes:  BD, Thorlabs, Scienion, Bioventus, Iris AO, Nikon, Moxtek and Crossroads Photonics.      Intellectual Merit: Each year of Phase I, the center conducted a program formulation process, where faculty submitted proposals in response to a Solicitation that outlined the members technology needs.  In aggregate the research faculty generated 145 proposals, which were reviewed by the IAB.  Each year, the IAB rank ordered projects and selected those to be funded.   Over the 6 years of Phase I, twenty-eight projects were funded and completed, some with commercial potential.  Each project had an industry mentor and was reviewed twice during the year with written reports quarterly.  The goal of the I/UCRC is to have at least one platform per year be adopted by an industry member and further developed for commercialization.  We believe that this goal has been met with at least six projects now in various stages of commercialization at member companies.     The members have the opportunity to take a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to inventions related to work on IAB funded projects.  During Phase I, the Center filed two provisional patents for inventions related to IAB funded work.  Prof. Bifano was the inventor on one of these provisional patents that is entitled: "Variable conjugate adaptive optics for scanned microscopes" and filed with BU Office of Technology Development April 2014. The other provisional patent application was filed by UC Davis and is entitled: "Flexible and Tunable Plasmonic Nanostructures Technology" (UC Davis case 2013-759).  The inventors are Sebastian Wachsmann-Hogiu and Mehmet Kahraman.  The IAB members have chosen not to exercise their rights with respect to these inventions.  There were forty-two publications related to Phase I member funded projects, with several of these papers being co-authored with Industry members.     CBSS had several supplemental awards during Phase I to include: two Fundamental Research Program awards, a Partnership for Innovation: Accelerating Innovative Research award, an International Fellowship award and twelve supplemental awards for the RET/REV/REU and VRS research experience programs.  These supplemental awards totaled nearly $1.4 million.  These awards provided an expanded research scope that addressed forward looking topics in areas such as neurophotonics and embedded sensors while enabling the participation of under-represented groups in the engineering and science disciplines thus feeding the pipeline of talented individuals for the future workforce.     Broadening Participation:  The Center has run several activities to promote student career development to include networking sessions between students and IAB members, mock-interview sessions where students were cycled through interviews with IAB members in a "speed dating" format, poster sessions held in conjunction with IAB meetings and providing opportunities for students to present research to the IAB.  In total, there were seventy-three (73) graduate level students or post-doctoral students trained in such diverse fields as electrical &amp; computer engineering, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, chemistry, physics and microbiology on projects requiring a diverse and integrative skill set during Phase I of CBSS..  In addition to working in a multi-disciplinary environment, these students also had an opportunity to engage industry and work under the demands of set budgets, milestones and timelines.  There were 10 Ph.D. graduates and 2 Masters level graduates among the students participating in Phase I projects.       Last Modified: 06/14/2017       Submitted by: Thomas G Bifano]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
