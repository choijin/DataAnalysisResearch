<AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of this research aims to systematically trailblaze a novel geometric manifold theory founded upon continuous polynomial representations, and to apply this mathematically-rigorous theory to both shape geometry and higher-dimensional, multi-attribute data modeling, analysis and visualization, with a special emphasis on visual computing applications. The research team is exploring new geometric manifold theory at the interface of differential geometry, numerical approximation theory, computational topology, and linear algebra. The study of new and important geometric manifold theory enables the accurate and effective modeling of higher-dimensional, multi-attribute volumetric datasets which are of complicated geometry, arbitrary topology, and with rich geometric features. This theory-centered research provides a sound theoretical foundation for rapid data modeling and data analysis. It has a potential to streamline the entire virtual prototyping processes for digital engineering in the future with longer-term research efforts by expediting data transformation from discrete samples to continuous manifold and spline-centric visual data representations.</AbstractNarration>

Project PI: Hong Qin, SUNY at Stony Brook (Stony Brook University) The long-term goal of this research aims to systematically trailblaze a novel geometric manifold theory founded upon continuous polynomial representations, and to apply this mathematically-rigorous theory to both shape geometry and higher-dimensional, multi-attribute data modeling, analysis and visualization, with a special emphasis on visual computing applications. In order to achieve this ambitious, longer-term objective, the concrete and specific goal is to explore new geometric manifold theory at the interface of differential geometry, numerical approximation theory, computational topology, and linear algebra. At present, continuous representations such as spline functions are becoming ubiquitous, with widespread and deep penetration into many scientific and engineering fields including functional data analysis, reverse engineering, medical image processing, numerical solutions of partial differential equations, data representation and visualization, data matching and registration from abstract space to geometric space, data parameterization over geometric domain, etc. This project is a small-scale, exploratory, and high-risk/high-payoff initiative on novel geometric manifold theory for higher-dimensional,multi-attribute data of arbitrary topology, which has not yet been seriously explored.   Broader Impacts: This theory-centered research is expected to significantly improve the current theory and practice of information integration by potentially enabling a more accurate, more efficient, and easier-to-use data representation and structure in the future for processing geometric and higher-dimensional scientific datasets. It will provide a sound theoretical foundation for rapid data modeling and data analysis. It has a potential to streamline the entire virtual prototyping processes for digital engineering in the future with longer-term research efforts by expediting data transformation from discrete samples to continuous manifold and spline-centric visual data representations through a much longer-term research endeavor.
