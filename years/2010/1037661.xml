<AbstractNarration>Oglala Lakota College (OLC) proposes to extend and enhance its capability to &lt;br/&gt;deliver the first two years of a Bachelor of Science degree program in engineering.  This &lt;br/&gt;capability will be developed through a Pre-Engineering Education Collaborative (PEEC) &lt;br/&gt;established with the College of Engineering at the South Dakota State University (SDSU) and the &lt;br/&gt;South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT), and is referred to as the &lt;br/&gt;OLC/SDSU/SDSMT PEEC (OSSPEEC).  The project will establish collaborative offerings of &lt;br/&gt;gateway and bottleneck courses that occur in the first two years of engineering curricula coupled &lt;br/&gt;with on-reservation hands-on laboratory and service learning experiences on the PRR that will &lt;br/&gt;increase Native American student retention in pre-engineering and engineering programs across &lt;br/&gt;South Dakota.  A major result of this project will be the establishment of a complete two-year pre- &lt;br/&gt;engineering curriculum at OLC, which will enable our students to enter any four-year &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate engineering program at the junior level. Further, this project will make an &lt;br/&gt;additional unique or radical step in the transformation of classical engineering education at the &lt;br/&gt;state colleges participating in the collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;We propose to collaborate to develop and offer the courses required for an integrated two-year &lt;br/&gt;pre-engineering program at OLC and to increase the success of OLC transfer and other Native &lt;br/&gt;American students at SDSU and SDSMT through shared research, internship experiences, and &lt;br/&gt;community building in the third and fourth years of an engineering program. The project will be &lt;br/&gt;unique in the United States in that during the collaborative process of building OLCs pre- &lt;br/&gt;engineering capacity, OLCs faculty and students will be helping to transform the concept of the &lt;br/&gt;first two years of the engineering curriculum at SDSU and SDSMT.  This will occur through the &lt;br/&gt;integration of project based service learning and undergraduate research projects on the Pine &lt;br/&gt;Ridge Reservation, which will involve professors and cohorts of students from SDSU and &lt;br/&gt;SDSMT. Also, these projects will cultivate closer ties among our institutions and OST Tribal &lt;br/&gt;Agencies through collaborative summer research and internship opportunities on the Pine Ridge &lt;br/&gt;Reservation that will lead to the development of future collaborative NSF research proposals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Encouragement and support for enrollment and retention of qualified US citizens in STEM fields is critical to the long-term success of the US economy.  Substantial gaps exist in the need for and the availability of a qualified engineering workforce, particularly on Indian Reservations.  Native Americans are 1% of the US population and represent 0.5% of Nationwide engineering program enrollment. Native Americans in South Dakota are 10% of the population and represent less than 2% of engineering program enrollment.   Oglala Lakota College (OLC), a decentralized Tribal College serving 1,500 mostly Native American students on the Pine Ridge and Cheyenne River reservations and Rapid City, South Dakota, partnered with South Dakota School of Mines &amp; Technology (SDSMT) and South Dakota State University (SDSU) to deliver the first two years of Bachelor of Science engineering programs at OLC through a Pre-Engineering Educational Collaborative.  We collaboratively established a two-year civil and geological engineering degree program coupled with project-based learning, engineering research experiences for students, and increased the matriculation, retention, and graduation rate of Native American students at South Dakota engineering universities through our collaborative efforts.  We developed an associate?s degree program at OLC with coursework in calculus, physics, chemistry, civil and geological engineering that transfers to all South Dakota Universities through a formal articulation agreement.

The engineering students worked on projects related to: wind and solar power generation, geology, surface and ground water resources, native plants, and sustainable food production.  We achieved our overall goal to increase Native American student success in engineering programs.  Year-to-year retention rates for Native American engineering students at OLC, SDSU, and SDSMT are the same or better than the year-to-year retention rates of the overall student body.  Native American engineering student enrollments across partner institutions have increased by 25%.  Many of our graduates are enrolled in MS and PhD engineering and science programs.  Furthermore, of our students have received national recognition as participants in NSF-sponsored research experiences at Harvard and MIT, and as recipients of the Udall Fellowship, and the Truman Fellowship.
