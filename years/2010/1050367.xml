<AbstractNarration>Steroid hormones exert dramatic effects on fundamental processes of neural development, particularly the development of sex differences in brain function and behavior. Rodent models suggest that regions of the male brain may be more sensitive to progesterone (i.e., express higher levels of progesterone receptor (PR)) during critical periods of neural development compared to females, suggesting that progesterone and PR may play an important role in the differential development of brain and behavior in males and females. Using traditional rat models in tandem with transgenic mice that lack expression of functional PR, the current proposal tests the hypothesis that sex differences in PR during perinatal life are required for the sexual differentiation of the brain, specifically the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) which mediates sexually differentiated reproductive and aggressive behaviors in adulthood. The Aims combine genetic and pharmacological approaches to examine changes in cellular and behavioral endpoints. Results from these studies will vastly increase our understanding of the processes underlying sexual differentiation of neural development and the developmental mechanisms involved in male- and female-typical behavioral phenotypes in adulthood. This research project will lend itself well to the integration of research and education with a highly diverse student population who will participate in all aspects of these studies. In addition, the development of an interactive web-based resource will be developed, in which published literature on the role of nuclear hormone receptors in developing tissues will be compiled and organized, and investigators studying a variety of receptors and tissues can share information and establish otherwise unlikely collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Steroid hormones alter brain development in dramatic and permanent ways, particularly in regions of the brain controlling reproduction and neuroendocrine function. Testosterone and its metabolite, estradiol, are considered to be the key factors in altering neural development and this is best demonstrated in the process of sexual differentiation of brain and behavior. However, evidence from our lab reveals that testosterone and estradiol are not the exclusive steroid hormones important in the development of sex differences in the brain. Progesterone receptor (PR) is expressed in several regions of the hypothalamus and preoptic area. Dramatic sex differences in PR expression exist, such that PR levels are significantly higher in males than females during perinatal life. Results from our project suggest that PR plays an important role in the development of sex differences in the preoptic area and sex differences in behaviors in adulthood that are dependent on the preoptic area.&nbsp; Most recently we have demonstrated that mice that have a mutation in the PR gene and do not express PR display reduced levels of intermale aggression in adulthood (Figure 1). In addition, administration of testosterone to female mice during development increased adult aggressive behavior in normal mice but failed to increase aggression in female mice with the mutation in the PR gene. This suggests that the expression of PR may be critical for the normal development of the male brain and for adult behaviors that differ between males and females. In addition, we have examined the effects of developmental exposure to the environmental contaminant, bisphenol A (BPA) which is found in some plastics and can have endocrine effects in animals including humans. BPA given to pregnant rats increased the expression of PR in the preoptic area of her female fetuses, suggesting that BPA ingested by the mother can affect the brain of the offspring and that BPA can exert direct estrogenic effects in developing brain. Taken together the results of this project implicate progesterone and the progesterone receptor in the formation of sex differences in brain and behavior and contribute novel information regarding the role of progesterone in normal neural development. Results from these studies have been presented at the Society for Neuroscience, the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology and the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/16/2015<br>      Modified by: Christine&nbsp;K&nbsp;Wagner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1050367/1050367_10086649_1437068967065_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1050367/1050367_10086649_1437068967065_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1.
