<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program project is to define the tropical cyclone surface wind field, wind-driven rain characteristics and wind loading in the built environment. The goal is to determine how localized, coherent features occurring in the rough-wall turbulent boundary layer and larger-scale convective features (such as meso-vortices, rainband core downdrafts) influence the surface wind field characteristics and loading on low-rise structures. The project will utilize the instrumented towers managed by Florida Coastal Monitoring Program.  The towers will be retrofitted to collect turbulence and wind-driven profile measurements and will be deployed in coastal suburban communities where the most damaging winds are expected to occur. These observational towers will be located inside mobile Doppler radar networks that are deployed by the Digital Hurricane Consortium to determine if convective features aloft modulate the ground level wind structure. The wind field data will be coupled with pressure measurements on single-family homes to directly relate the peak load conditions to the full spectrum of the wind effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the important issue of the interaction of hurricane induced winds with engineered structures. The project will provide important data for wind tunnel and computational modeling, evaluation of the existing provisions in building codes and standards, cost effective damage mitigation measures, and resilient design of structures. The project will also strengthen interactions between the wind engineering and atmospheric science disciplines. The project will provide advanced training to graduate and undergraduate students through their direct involvement in the project work. Middle school teachers from under-resourced schools located in hurricane-prone areas will participate in a pilot initiative called the Hurricane Hazard Immersion Program. This program is expected to enhance the 6-8th grade curriculum of over 7500 students living along the hurricane prone coast through annual training and active participation of 25 middle school teachers in the project research. The program is designed to be sustainable beyond the project duration; it will target underrepresented groups and foster a culture of hazard preparedness and proactive mitigation among the next generation of homeowners.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Every year Americans living on the Atlantic Seaboard and Gulf Coast experience the threat of a hurricane strike. Recovery and restoration costs from these events continue to rise, with the last hurricane season currently projected to be the costliest season on record. Many factors continue to perpetuate our societal vulnerability to hurricanes, but foremost among them is damage to and loss of function in residential buildings. Currently the residential inventory dominates the infrastructure footprint, yet remains per-unit the most prone to damage from hurricane winds and wind driven rain ingress. Thus, this project was initiated to better understand the behavior of severe weather within &lsquo;built-up&rsquo; areas, i.e. regions populated with buildings, trees and other obstructions to the flow that affect the production of turbulence near the ground.</p> <p>The project supported field research in Atlantic tropical cyclones Irene (2011), Isaac (2012), Sandy (2012), Arthur (2015), Hermine (2016), Matthew (2016), Harvey (2017), and Irma (2017) to study the wind field in the lowest portion of the atmosphere. Portable weather stations designed to withstand extreme gusts were deployed in coastal communities where the most damaging winds were expected to occur. If possible, the weather stations were positioned inside mobile Doppler radar networks deployed by the Center for Severe Weather Research and the University of Oklahoma to determine if convective features aloft modulate the ground level wind structure. The field activities yielded an abundance of high-fidelity, three-dimensional velocity data that were previously scarce for the specific case of hurricane winds in suburban and built up terrain. Further, the field research captured some of the most intense wind speed observations ever recorded (and in notable hurricanes). These records provide critical &lsquo;ground truth&rsquo; to validate the current scientific understanding of how strong winds induce extreme loads on low-rise buildings. This knowledge is critical to ensuring that boundary layer wind tunnel modeling and wind load provisioning accurately reflect reality.</p> <p>Multiple research objectives were accomplished. The first outcome was the development of a methodology to convert Doppler velocity measurements recorded from a mobile X-band radar to an equivalent surface wind speed record. This work produced important proof of concept that remote sensing can eventually replace surface observations, which are sparsely distributed, suffer from outages, and only provide a point measurement. The second outcome was a multi-storm experimental validation of the raindrop size distribution used in computational wind engineering. These models are critical for characterizing the rain deposition on structures, and ultimately water ingress through the building envelope. The third outcome was a comprehensive study that successfully challenged a 50+ year assumption that surface winds exhibit Gaussian behavior (the so-called bell curve) over all terrain types. Data collected in the field and in a boundary layer wind tunnel found that wind field deviates from Gaussian as the roughness of the upwind terrain increases. This corresponds to an increase in wind loading on suburban low-rise structures of ~14%. The fourth research outcome resulted from a study on the variation of surface pressures on low-rise buildings as a function of the terrain roughness. The study confirmed that a large degree of universality exists between the peak load profiles if the flow distortion caused by the building blocking the wind and approach flow conditions are properly factored into the analysis.</p> <p>The project also produced two graduates from underrepresented groups in STEM and the support of numerous undergraduate students.
