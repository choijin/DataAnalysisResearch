<AbstractNarration>This project increases recruitment and professional development of mathematics graduate students by focusing chiefly on the early stages of graduate education. There are three main goals; (a) to increase the number of Master's students who successfully transition to Ph.D. studies, (b) to provide advanced mathematical training for students to enter the workforce in Education or Industry upon completion of their Master's degrees, and (c) to increase success, and decrease the time to completion, of Ph.D. students. There are several factors that contribute to high retention and completion and, ultimately, to the success of the project.  These include the diversified collection of high quality Master's degrees, newly created transitional and Ph.D. preparatory courses, close mentoring, and strong administrative support. Sixteen fellowships are awarded per year: 8 for students seeking a Master's degree and 8 for Ph.D. students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project emphasizes recruitment of students from colleges in the Atlanta area, paying special attention to students from underrepresented groups. Joint seminars and exchange programs with area colleges and Research Experiences for Undergraduates projects are used as vehicles to attract qualified students to graduate studies in mathematics at Georgia Tech.</AbstractNarration>

[Note:Titles and affiliations as of July 2010]  *Summary and Outcome*  In response to a recognized national shortage, the stated goal of this Grant was to increase the number of professional US mathematicians for work in Academia, Education, or Industry.  As such, the Grant was designed to provide Fellowships to entering graduate students.  Upon satisfactory progress, Fellows were renewed their support for the first two years of graduate studies. We put in place several measure of *monitoring and mentorship*. We supported in essential equal measure students in Masters and PhD degrees.  Our goal to provide advanced training in Mathematics had several scopes.  a) For *Masters* students, our *goals* have been: i) increasing the number of students who will eventually successfully transition to PhD studies, ii) providing advanced mathematical training for students who will want to enter the workforce in education or industry upon completion of their degrees.  *Outcome* Of the 22 Masters Fellows we supported, all (except 2 who are still in the Masters program) completed the degree.  Additionally, 3 transitioned to PhD program, 13 entered the workforce, and 4 we don't know.  b) For *PhD* students, our main goal was to reduce attrition and provide Fellows with the support needed for a timely completion of the comprehensive exams, and quick transition to thesis work. *Outcome* Of the 22 Fellows supported, 1 failed at completing the comprehensive exams (another one did not even try).  Additionally, 4 have completed their PhDs, 4 have left the PhD program with a Masters degree and entered the workforce, and 2 have won NSF Graduate Fellowships.  *Demographics* We supported a total of 39 different Fellows.  Of these, 16 were Female, 5 African American, and 2 Hispanics. </pre><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/18/2017<br>      Modified by: Luca&nbsp;Dieci</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
