<AbstractNarration>This project will advance systems modeling approaches by developing a suite of stochastic modeling approaches, coupled with geostatistical and machine learning techniques.  The new system modeling approach will utilize both in situ and satellite remotely sensed data to improve system model parameters and model structure.  These novel developments, together with observed data, will advance ecosystem and environmental sciences through computational thinking.  The proposed approach will be used to develop a cyber-enabled stochastic carbon-weather system to provide more adequate quantification of regional carbon exchanges, which is critical to better understanding carbon-climate-atmosphere feedbacks and facilitating climate-policy making.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach will transform the current system modeling approach by (1) developing a stochastic version of the deterministic differential equation models of ecosystems and environmental systems; (2) developing geospatial statistical techniques to fully exploit multifaceted observational data to improve model parameterization; (3) developing advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to further utilize observational data to improve model structure; and (4) applying the improved model to examine the societal and biogeochemical impacts of land use change.  Advantages of the proposed cyber-enabled terrestrial ecosystem model will include: (1) Efficiently quantifying regional net carbon exchanges and associated uncertainty and (2) Improving system model parameters and structure using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques and spatiotemporal data acquired over the U.S.   Project deliverables include: (1) An innovative, cyber-enabled carbon-weather system that can quantify net carbon exchanges and associated probabilistic information at high spatial and temporal resolution for the continental U.S. and (2) a suite of transformative advanced mathematical, statistical and system modeling techniques that could be applied to other complex modeling fields (e.g., hydrological modeling).  This project will significantly advance ecosystem sciences with computational thinking and will provide a unique opportunity to train a new generation of scientists in a highly interdisciplinary research environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is a collaborative project among scientists from Purdue University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL).  The overall goal of this NSF project is to develop a cyber-enabled carbon-weather system to quantify net carbon exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere, with associated probabilistic information at regional scales.  With this enhanced system, we are evaluating the societal impacts by coupling the new quantification of net carbon exchanges with a global economic model. Through this work, we have made fundamental progress in including critical terrestrial biogeochemical processes in advanced, computationally efficient ecosystem and environmental modeling tools.  In support of the overall research goal of the project, the MBL research team has refined an innovative approach for tracking land-use history of individual grid cells (of variable sizes) across the land surface of the globe, which allows us to quantitatively track the effects of historical land use on current (and projected future) carbon cycle dynamics including carbon sequestration in plants and soils.  We have also refined and adapted important driving datasets including dynamic, georeferenced representations of nitrogen deposition, tropospheric ozone levels, and secondary forest age structure for use in the improved modeling tools.  Finally, we have improved the coupling of our advanced biogeochemistry model with MITÆs model of the global economy.  In one application of the evolving modeling system, we have explored a range of options for climate mitigation.  Land can be used in several ways to mitigate climate change, including preserving or expanding forest areas to accumulate carbon and growing biomass to produce biofuels while promoting net carbon storage on land. We examined the roles that these two land-use options can play in a global mitigation strategy to stabilize EarthÆs average temperature within 2oC of the pre-industrial level. We show that an ambitious global energy policy that includes biofuels would likely not achieve the 2&deg;C target. A thought-experiment where the world ideally prices land carbon fluxes combined with biofuels gets the world much closer. Land could become a large net carbon sink of carbon over the 21st century with price incentives. Absent such incentives land is either only a small net carbon sink or a large net source. The significant tradeoff with this integrated land-use approach is that prices for agricultural products rise substantially. The share of income spent on food for wealthier regions continues to fall, but for the poorest regions, higher food prices lead to a rising share of income spent on food.
