<AbstractNarration>The 19th ACM International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC 2010). HPDC 2010 will be held, along with nine workshops and a meeting of the Open Grid Forum (OGF) standards body, in downtown Chicago, Illinois on June 20 through June 25, 2010. &lt;br/&gt;HPDC is the premier forum for presenting the latest research findings on the design and use of parallel and distributed systems for high end computing, collaboration, data analysis, and other innovative applications.&lt;br/&gt;HPDC seeks to increase student participation in symposium and the field. The proposed funding would support the travel of eligible US students to the symposium. Recipients would be able to attend the main conference, workshops, the OGF meeting, and would also participate in a birds-of-a-feather session to discuss their experiences. Travel grants will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort will be made to reach out to women and under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The sole purpose of this project was to facilitate attendance of graduate students and undergraduates from U.S. schools at the 19th ACM Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC) in Chicago on June 20-25, 2010, of which I was the program chair.  HPDC is a premier venue for presenting the latest research on the design, implementation, evaluation, and use of parallel and distributed systems for high performance and high end computing.   Training graduate students in these areas is important, as they are critical for the advancement of many areas of science.   Furthermore, they underly the "cloud computing" paradigm that Americans from all walks of life increasinly rely upon.  The project funds were used exclusively to provide travel awards that would partially cover the expenses of attending HPDC.   These awards were made on a competitive basis and with an eye to regional diversity.    Students applied by May 1, 2010.  Applications were then reviewed by the symposium's student activities chairs, under my guidance.   Ultimately 16 students from institutions in 12 different states were given awards.   These awards enabled them to travel to Chicago, and gave them access to the entire symposium, which comprised the main conference, 8 co-located workshops, and a meeting of the Open Grid Forum standards body.   More information about the HPDC 2010 symposium can be found at its web site: http://hpdc2010.eecs.northwestern.edu.   The web site for the HPDC series is http://hpdc.org.
