<AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by Professor Yi Lu at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to carry out fundamental studies on metalloproteins involved in long-range electron transfers. The long-range electron transfer is a fundamental process in chemistry and biology allowing for respiration, photosynthesis and nearly every other chemical and biological functions; metalloproteins play critical roles in these processes. Using novel biosynthetic approaches, the project elucidates in unprecedented detail the roles of residues responsible for the formation of the electron transfer blue and purple CuA centers, as well as their surrounding environments for fine-tuning the functional properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results advance our understanding of synthesis, coordination and electronic properties of electron transfer centers.  The insights gained from this study will allow the design of novel water-soluble and -stable redox agents with tunable redox potentials and ET properties for applications such as more efficient solar energy conversion and fuel cell generation.  The broader impacts of the proposal include the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the field of bioinorganic chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
