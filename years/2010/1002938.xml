<AbstractNarration>RUI: Triangulations, Set Intersections, Fair Division, and Voting (DMS - 1002938)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator's prior work has introduced methods from combinatorial topology and discrete geometry to the study of fair division questions and voting problems. The current project will support the the development of the mathematics behinds these tools and the solution of several combinatorial questions that have been motivated by his prior work, including: (1) the study of triangulations of cubes and simplotopes, (2) the further development of combinatorial fixed point theorems and constructive solutions, and (3) the development of set intersection theorems and associated applications in social choice theory and fair division. This project will also support the active participation of undergraduates in this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Informally speaking, a "fair division" problem asks: how can we divide a set of goods among parties in such a way that each can be satisfied according to some notion of fairness.  Social choice theory asks: how does a society make a group choice (e.g., in an election) in a way that best aggregates the preferences of all the individuals?  Questions of fairness and social choice are of interest to political scientists, economists, and game theorists, and motivate interesting mathematical questions.  The space of preferences and the preference sets of each person are often naturally geometric sets (e.g., convex, connected, polyhedral), and the desired solution is often at the intersection of such sets.  This project aims to prove mathematical theorems (e.g., about set intersections and triangulations of polyhedra) that have direct bearing on important problems in the social sciences involving voting and fairness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the development of mathematical tools for understanding the underlying geometric ideas behind problems from the social sciences, including fair division (how to divide an object fairly) and social choice (how can individual preferences be aggregrated to form a group preference)? The project achieved goals along multiple directions: (1) the understanding of triangulations was advanced, (2) combinatorial versions of several fixed point theorems were developed, and (3) progress was made in developing new set intersection theorems that modeled applications in fair division and social choice. The major outcomes included 6 published papers (with others forthcoming).     With co-authors that included undergraduate students, the PI's main results in these papers included:   - connecting fair division ideas to the ideas of redistricting in political elections   - developing a new theory for approval voting in a situation where a person's set of approvals on a political spectrum might be disconnected,   - developing a new model for understanding how much support a winner might get in a situation where voters are voting for committees   - developing a new combinatorial fixed point theorem for trees, to provide a new route for proving a fixed point theorem on trees.   - developing a new connection between a famous topological theorem (the Borsuk-Ulam theorem) and a combinatorial theorem (Sperner's lemma).     In addition to contributing to a better understanding of elections, the project also achieved its goals in broader impacts by training several undergraduates in mathematical research, getting them excited about a future in mathematics, including 3 of 6 students who were women.
