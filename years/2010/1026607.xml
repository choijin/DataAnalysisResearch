<AbstractNarration>The California Current Ecosystem (CCE) LTER site is a productive coastal upwelling biome structured by remote and local physical forcing, as well as biotic interactions in the ocean water column. The CCE site, building upon 60 years of extensive time-series measurements by CalCOFI, seeks to understand the mechanisms underlying transitions between different states of this ecosystem, as well as their corollary: ecosystem resilience. In the first phase of CCE funding investigators at this site uncovered a new climate mode for the North Pacific (NPGO); found marked differences in food web structure between the offshore wind stress curl and the classical coastal boundary upwelling domains; detected long-term changes in gelatinous grazers (pelagic tunicates), optical properties, nitracline depths, prevalence of hypoxia, stratification, and other ecosystem characteristics; revealed zones of iron and iron-light co-limitation of primary production; developed a ROMS model and used it in hindcast mode to diagnose causality of ecosystem transitions and forecast mode to guide Lagrangian process cruises; developed an allometric approach to food web modeling; discovered differences between physical and biotic time series in degree of nonlinearities; demonstrated the destabilizing effects of fishing; initiated new data practices; and more. Findings from this first effort point to the importance of spatial structuring of the CCE, especially on the mesoscale.  In this renewal the LTER investigators target mesoscale fronts and eddies, which constitute an important part of the CCE ecological disturbance regime. CCE Investigators have found that such features vary on interannual and decadal scales in the CCE region and they hypothesize that their variability over time may contribute to ecosystem transitions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will continue studies at the CCE LTER. The overarching questions posed in this next phase of the study are: What are the mechanisms leading to different states in a coastal pelagic ecosystem? What is the interplay between changing ocean climate, community structure and ecosystem dynamics? To address these questions, the investigators propose to examine 4 mechanisms that could contribute to ecosystem transitions: anomalous alongshore advection; in situ food web changes in response to stratification and nutrient supply; changes in cross-shore transport; and altered predation pressure. They will also test 3 hypotheses related to the role of mesoscale processes, specifically concerning their role in altering nutrient fluxes and predator-prey interactions, the integrated biogeochemical effects of mesoscale fronts and eddies over the CCE region and the relationship of such features to larger scale climate variability. A combination of Lagrangian process cruises, experimental work, time series measurements, modeling, data synthesis, and a coupled human-natural system study will be used to address these questions. The project will also continue to measure the 5 LTER core variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Notable among the ecosystem services furnished by the coastal ocean off southern California is the region?s importance for spawning and/or harvesting of many commercially important fishes and marine invertebrates. This research will provide a key scientific foundation for understanding time and space variability of properties relevant to ecosystem-based fisheries management. This information is essential as managers begin to address the consequences of changing ocean acidity, stratification, and hypoxia for resource populations and communities. ISSE (Integrated Science for Society and the Environment) studies will partner an economist, graduate student, and scientists in the development of a bioeconomic model to examine the interplay between ecosystem variability and fishers? decision-making and resource allocation. In addition, the CCE Investigators will further develop and enhance DataZoo, the information system central to our Information Management and data sharing environment. They will implement new web-accessible tools to facilitate data visualization and communication of CCE results to students, teachers across all levels, scientists, managers, policy-makers, and the broader public. An Education, Outreach, and Capacity Building (EOCB) program will include a vigorous program of involvement of tens of graduate students in site science and communication. A graduate student will serve as a research liaison with the EOCB coordinator, to help translate CCE science into K-12 lesson plans. CCE LTER will work with local teachers in a diverse urban school district to bring CCE science into the classroom, and will continue outreach and coastal ocean time series activities with the nonprofit Ocean Institute. This LTER site will expand their successful RET and Teacher-at-Sea programs, to enable teachers to communicate the process of science inquiry directly to students. Their REU program will continue targeting under-represented undergraduates to expand the pipeline into the ocean sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit   We have made important strides forward in understanding the response of a major Eastern Boundary Current upwelling ecosystem to environmental forcing on multiple time and space scales. Our research has made fundamental contributions in the realms of:   -  Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems, including the effects of changes in stratification, dissolved oxygen, and ocean fronts on diverse elements of the pelagic food web, ranging from prokaryotic organisms, eukaryotic phytoplankton, micro- and meso-zooplankton, and mesopelagic fishes, to seabirds. Our studies have drawn on the 68-year record of CalCOFI observations to reveal important ecosystem variations on multiple time scales, including: (1) Interannual variations, especially associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Warm Anomaly of 2014-15; (2) Multi-decadal variations, dominated by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation; (3) Long-term secular trends, including changes in dissolved oxygen and nutrient stoichiometry.     -  The dynamics and ecological consequences of (sub)mesoscale ocean fronts.  We have illustrated commonalities and differences across different ocean fronts studied on our intensive, Lagrangian-based process cruises in the CCE-LTER region.  We have supplemented ship-based experimental studies with novel autonomous glider-based measurements of biophysical fronts and satellite remote-sensing studies of temporal changes in frontal occurrence. We have shown that (sub)mesoscale ocean fronts have consequences disproportionate to their geographic extent, because they are often regions of elevated phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass; they can be accompanied by pronounced changes in food web structure, signified by marked shifts in floristic and faunistic composition; and they are typically sites of enhanced predator and prey abundances, hence sites of increased encounter rates.  Our satellite studies have shown that frontal features have increased in occurrence over the past 2-3 decades, suggesting that these features will increasingly influence California Current Ecosystem food webs in the future.     -  Ocean biogeochemical cycling, including the novel finding that ocean fronts can be regions of 2-3 fold increased vertical export of carbon, via two primary mechanisms:  enhanced gravitational settling, combined with ocean subduction that increases carbon export out of the surface ocean in both particulate and dissolved phases.  We have also developed one of the most comprehensive nitrogen isotope budgets for any ocean region and the only one available for a coastal upwelling region.   -  Development of high quality measurement methods for Ocean Acidification studies, including continuous underway pCO2 and pH measurements from CalCOFI cruises and the development of geochemical proxy relationships that permit carbonate system variables to be estimated from autonomous measurements made by ocean gliders and interdisciplinary moorings.   -  Differentiating pelagic ecosystem consequences of the strong Pacific warm anomalies of 2014-15 from those of El Ni&ntilde;o 2015-16.   Broader Impacts   We have developed a coherent, integrated, interdisciplinary research and training program that includes field observations, experimental manipulations at sea and in the laboratory, and diverse modeling advances.   We have built a collaborative, interactive group of scientists, students, engineers, technical staff, and outreach personnel.  We have trained a large group of graduate students and sizable number of postdoctoral investigators and undergraduate students in collaborative, seagoing science and prepared them for careers in science. Many technical personnel have developed refined skills and state-of-the-art competence in their respective disciplines.  Our laboratory facilities (and seagoing instrument capacity) now include excellent resources for biological, chemical, and physical oceanographic studies.   We have built a state-of-the-art Information Management resource called DataZoo that effectively serves data to diverse users.  Our data are posted for widespread use by the scientific community and have been downloaded by people in 29 countries around the world.   We have a highly effective team that collaborates to communicate our advances in the ocean sciences outside the research laboratory. We communicate directly with school groups, the general public, and federal, state, and local representatives regarding the importance of the California Current Pelagic Ecosystem from diverse perspectives.  We are stimulating diverse age groups ranging from school children through undergraduate students to consider the impact of ocean ecosystems on their lives and on public policy.     Our autonomous real-time data, combined with model reanalyses, assist with the management of marine resources (e.g., coastal finfish and invertebrate fisheries) both by helping to (a) understand causes for past environmental conditions that have influenced marine resources and (b) provide near real-time information for updating management decisions as environmental conditions change.   We have illustrated the power of integration of empirical field measurements from diverse sources (shipboard, autonomous instruments, satellite remote sensing) with at-sea experimental manipulations and data-assimilating models.  This integration provides a quantitative framework for sensitivity analyses and for developing the foundation for forecasting future states of this major ocean ecosystem.
