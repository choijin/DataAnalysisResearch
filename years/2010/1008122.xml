<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in a week-long conference on function spaces at Southern Illinois University on May 17 to May 22, 2010. This is the 6th conference in a series focused on the areas of function algebras, spaces and algebras of analytic functions, Lp-spaces, geometry of Banach spaces and related topics. Much of the funding will be directed to young mathematicians (i.e., postdocs, graduate students, junior faculty) who do not have their own support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the conference is to foster awareness and enable interaction on current activity in the broad area of function spaces. This is a conference on an active area of research in analysis. The conference will also provide an opportunity for junior researchers to learn and interact with established researchers.</AbstractNarration>

The Conference was held on the Edwardsville campus of the Southern Illinois University between May 18 and May 22, 2010. It was attended by almost 100 mathematicians.   The Conference brought together both senior mathematicians and younger researchers (including graduate students). The Conference had a broad impact on a significant number of mathematicians by providing a forum (i) to exchange ideas between experts, (ii) to share new discoveries, and (iii) to educated graduate students. The ideas covered various areas of modern analysis involving function spaces.   Function spaces is a very active area of analysis which includes spaces and algebras of analytic functions, L_p spaces, isometries and isomorphisms between such spaces and related topics. It attracts mathematicians with very diverse interests who use similar methods or similar ideas in variety of different settings. It is very important to regularly meet other researchers in the area to share ideas, to remain active, and also to introduce graduate students to the new discoveries. The main conference lectures will be published in a special volume by the American Mathematical Sociaty. More information about the conference, its participants, and lectures may be found on the conference web page: http://www.siue.edu/MATH/conference2010/          Last Modified: 04/02/2011       Submitted by: Krzysztof M Jarosz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
