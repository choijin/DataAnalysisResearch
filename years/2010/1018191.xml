<AbstractNarration>Understanding of the function of network hosts is critical for securing, guaranteeing performance in, and managing computer networks.  Current approaches to application identification employ data packet analysis, a resource-intensive approach that ignores the available interaction information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work builds on techniques developed for social and biological networks, applying such analysis to communications extracted from only network flow information.  Application graphs are constructed per-port and annotated with meta- flow information, such as connection order and session length, followed by graph mining to extract motif profiles, lists of over-represented interconnection patterns, used to build classifiers mapping profiles to network functions.  Sub-usage of motif profiles distinguishes variations of usage of an application. Multi-port applications and multi-host groups are classified using co-temporally related host presence in motifs across distinct ports.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The automatic identification of network host function from flow data simplifies network management, providing administrators a better understanding of the way their network is used and supporting development of simplified security and resource-allocation mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will develop motif-based techniques that progressively allow for automated classification of host function, host intention, and group interaction, as well as collect and distribute new labeled traffic traces. This work will bring to network management novel ideas from social and biological networks and should add to the field of interaction network theory and result in algorithms generally applicable to group discovery and functional characterization.  Results will be disseminated through targeted publications and ongoing collaborations with companies and labs interested in security and cluster-management applications of the work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The goal of this project was to develop techniques that could simplify supporting network security and network management within an enterprise by being able to quickly identify applications being used on a computer network.  While many approaches for network application identification are available, most of them require significant privacy-invading and expensive-to-gather details about the traffic &ndash; capturing individual communication packets and being able to examine the data being sent in those packets. The focus of this project was exploring motifs, the patterns of interaction that computers involved in a network use when communicating with each other, and only using a view of the communications limited to traffic flows, where flows are simple summaries of the traffic incorporating just who was communicating, the length of communication, and how much information was transferred.  The idea to examine motifs in computer networks was inspired by similar approaches employed in analyzing networks from the field of social science (person-to-person networks, such as actor relationships or Facebook friends) and biology (such as networks representing interactions between proteins).  Flows were collected for common applications in use on an enterprise (corporate or academic) network. The project examined whether motifs could be used to identify the applications that generated the communications.  Motif shapes, representing how three or four hosts would communicate in-between each other, in combination with statistics about that communication, such as the duration of a host-to-host conversation or the number of bytes of information transferred, were shown to be able to distinguish between multiple types of application activity on a computer network.  As an example, it was possible to distinguish between whether a host was involved in game play or email sending, as these applications employed different patterns of communication. This approach was extended and shown to also be able to distinguish between intents of usage of a web browser.  In particular, it was discovered that the developed algorithms could determine whether the web protocol was being used for streaming digital media, web-based email, web-based chat, or standard web surfing.  Having such information about what applications are active on a network, and only needing to examine networks flows to gain this information, provides a network administrator a relatively inexpensive means of discovering what type of activity is present on his or her network.  An administrator could make use of this application information to implement new security policies or to change the quality of service mechanisms employed on the network.  This work led to, in the final year of the project, a study of how packet sampling, which is commonly used in real-world networks, affects the network communication graphs the developed techniques rely on.   Packet sampling, which reduces how often a network is observed to gather information about the communications (reducing observations to 1 packet sampled per 1000 packets sent on the network is common), significantly impacts the graphs of interactions that are observed. The effects of sampling on being able to classify the applications generating the traffic are still under investigation.   Four graduate students and four undergraduate students were supported by and trained under this project over the four years it was funded.  Two of the graduate students are now at top-tier graduate programs in Computer Science (Harvard, Georgia Tech), both continuing in the domain of computer security research.  One of the undergraduates returned to Wake Forest to continue participation on this project as a MasterÆs degree student.  Discussions between Wake Forest University, a major networking company, and a federally funded research project concerning a collaboration to employ the developed ideas on an international research network have started.
