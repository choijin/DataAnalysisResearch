<AbstractNarration>The American Meteorological Society (AMS) will bring to the United States scientists who are leaders in their national meteorological societies in developing countries for the first-ever International Forum of Meteorological Societies (IFMS).  In this Forum in these scientists will interact with their colleagues from developed countries to exchange information, share experience and knowledge that could identify challenges and opportunities for meteorological and related oceanographic research, not only within their countries, but on both regional and global scales as well.  Most communications between meteorological societies have occurred to date on a bilateral basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discussions and interactions at the Forum will address at least two scientific issues of a high priority -- global climate change and severe natural weather hazards.  The Forum will consider ways in which professional meteorological societies can assist in identifying issues that are likely to arise from global climate change and severe natural weather hazards and will consider ways to address these issues.  The latter effort will be directed at improvement of education and communications in the meteorological sciences; and of outreach programs to inform and educate decision-makers, professionals, and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The First Global Meeting of the   International Forum of Meteorological Societies      The International Forum of Meteorological Societies (IFMS) is a newly established, informal organization that seeks to facilitate interactions among the worldÆs national and regional professional and scientific societies that focus on meteorology and related sciences.  Such international interactions have previously occurred only on a bi-lateral basis and through the efforts of three regional societies: the African Meteorological Society, the European Meteorological Society (EMS), and the Latino American Federation of Meteorological Societies (FLISMET).  The IFMS focuses on advancing the goals and objectives of the worldÆs professional and scientific societies.  Specific terms of reference are available at the IFMS website (www.ifms.org).     The concept of an International Forum of Meteorological Societies arose out of discussions that began in 2007 within the Council of the American Meteorological Society.  Subsequently, in January 2009, the AMS convened an international planning meeting (Dabberdt 2009a,b) to explore whether there was sufficient common interest to form an international forum of this type.  Participants included representatives from 18 societies and organizations from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, as well as the WMO and the U.S. National Weather Service; the planning meeting participants unanimously agreed to establish the IFMS.     The first global meeting (GM1) of the IFMS took place January 18-19, 2010 in Atlanta, Georgia (USA) in conjunction with the 90th Annual Meeting of the AMS.  The meeting was hosted by the American Meteorological Society and was organized by the IFMS Steering Committee (Table 1). Twenty-nine societies and organizations participated in the two-day meeting (Table 2 and Figure 1).  Session themes included: the activities and challenges of regional and national meteorological societies; the role of meteorological societies in climate change research, education and outreach; and the role of meteorological societies in fostering international scientific and professional cooperation and education. A number of action items were identified and several working groups formed.  The action items include:   Enhancement of the IFMS website, Creation of a list of member societies and links to their websites, Creating an inventory of sharable resources at the various societies,  Electronic sharing of all societiesÆ bulletins and newsletters, Identifying potential new IFMS member societies, Providing assistance in establishment of new societies, Identifying best practices for supporting the needs of societies in developing countries, Developing guidance for issuing accreditations and certifications to individuals, Identifying IFMS benefits to member societies, and Sharing of educational and outreach resources.      The next Global IFMS Meeting (GM2) will be hosted by the Chinese Meteorological Society and chaired by Dr. QIN Dahe, CMS President and current chair of the IFMS Steering Committee.  The meeting will be held 9-10 November 2011, in Xiamen, Fujian Province, China.  All meteorological and related societies and organizations are welcome to attend and participate.      Acknowledgements  The National Science Foundation (award number: 1005592) provided travel support for nine IFMS GM1 participants from developing countries, and this support is gratefully acknowledged.
