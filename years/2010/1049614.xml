<AbstractNarration>Project Director: Peter Goodwin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:  EPS-1049614&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Idaho&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: 22nd National EPSCoR Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Idaho EPSCoR is hosting the 22nd National EPSCoR Conference in Coeur d?Alene, Idaho on October 24-27, 2011. The purpose of the conference will be to showcase the EPSCoR jurisdictions? contributions to the nation?s science, engineering, and economic competiveness, and to explore directions for enhancing future contributions through partnerships among the jurisdictions. The conference theme will be Building New Inter- and Intra-jurisdictional Partnerships. Session topics will be based on the strengths and commonalities of the jurisdictions? science and technology initiatives, and how partnerships of the future can be enabled by cyberinfrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The conference seeks to identify opportunities for and barriers to enhancing research and education partnerships among EPSCoR jurisdictions. Conference sessions and discussions will be centered on the topics of water and energy due to the importance of these natural resources to the economy of the EPSCoR jurisdictions and the nation (Note: Sixteen of the twenty-nine EPSCoR jurisdictions have Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-1 projects with significant research emphasis on water resources and/or energy). The conference will explore how extensive EPSCoR knowledge and research infrastructure can be better leveraged to accelerate knowledge discovery, and how research infrastructure and its data streams can better contribute to the national research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The conference aims to showcase the contributions of EPSCoR jurisdictions to the nation?s science, engineering, and economic competitiveness. In addition, the conference seeks to provide a forum in which a broad range of stakeholders, including state legislators, members in academe, and private sectors can interact. These stakeholders will have opportunities to increase their understanding of the vision and values of EPSCoR and use that understanding to develop additional mechanisms for generating inter-jurisdictional and international partnerships. Conference sessions will also seek to foster innovative avenues for enhancing STEM-based education for all, with particular attention to underrepresented minorities (URM) students and those from rural communities</AbstractNarration>

Voluntary surveys showed diverse representation in the event (45% females, 17% URM and 4% with disability), which included people from many professional levels and sectors (e.g., NSF officials, federal agency representatives, Tribal representatives, policy makers, EPSCoR directors and staff, EPSCoR governing committee members, EPSCoR scientists, scientists from non-EPSCoR states, representatives from URM institutions, representatives from community and four-year colleges, undergraduate and graduate students, and others from the private and public sectors). Approximately 69 students participated in the National Conference, presenting 60 research posters, many of which were selected for presentation based on winning competitions in their respective states.  Specific NSF EPSCoR objectives to be addressed by the National Conference were:  Catalyze key research themes and related activities within and among EPSCoR jurisdictions that empower knowledge generation, dissemination, and application; Activate effective jurisdictional and regional collaborations among academic, government, and private sector stakeholders that advance scientific research, promote innovation, and provide multiple societal benefits; Broaden participation in science and engineering by institutions, organizations, and people within and among EPSCoR jurisdictions; Use EPSCoR for development, implementation, and evaluation of future programmatic experiments that motivate positive change and progression.   The 22nd National NSF EPSCoR Conference was very successful in promoting research with high intellectual merit and programs with broader impact. Surveys administered nine months after the event indicate that:  90% communicated some of what they learned at the national conference with others on their own EPSCoR teams. 87% communicated some of what they learned with others in their States. 85% reported that one or more ideas from the conference had made a difference in one or more of their state EPSCoR programs. 75% reported that one or more ideas from the conference made a difference in their StateÆs EPSCoR research.   The conference also contributed to improvements in policy, behavior, and processes, including these outcomes:  Increased understanding of key issues within the EPSCoR community Formation of stronger professional relationships within the national EPSCoR community Increased appreciation for research being conducted by Native American tribes (for example: http://www.idahoepscor.org/DrawOtherVideos.aspx) Increased understanding of key issues within the national research community      In addition, multiple products resulting from the Conference, including presentations and videos, are available through a website: http://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/epscor/NationalConf_2011.jsp     "From a variety of angles, these respondents identified their new grasp and appreciation of the EPSCoR program &ndash; its scope and significance for scientific research and for helping the states to meet their science and technology goals; the e...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
