<AbstractNarration>One of the major scientific achievements of the 20th century was the fusion of Darwin's Theory of Evolution with the study of Population Genetics.  This fusion made it possible to use mathematics to explain how traits like color change as a species adapts to new environments.  However, to understand more dramatic transitions, the laws of Developmental Biology must also be considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses methods from Genetics, Developmental and Evolutionary Biology to find out how one dramatic change occurred during evolution - the origin of a complex trait or the creation of self-fertile hermaphrodites in roundworms.  Three factors make this an ideal problem to study: (1) self-fertility is a complex trait that involves independent changes in sexual development and in how sperm become active, (2) roundworms are the most common animals on earth, and many species infect plants, animals or humans, so their ability to evolve new ways to reproduce could significantly affect the environment, and (3) all of the tools of modern Genetics are available for use in the study of these animals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The famous roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans produces self-fertile hermaphrodites, but is related to several other Caenorhabditis species that instead make females.  This innovative project will focus on alterations in just two genetic pathways (one controlling germ cell fate and one controlling sperm activation) to determine if they are sufficient to transform XX females of into self-fertile hermaphrodites.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will provide advanced training for graduate and undergraduate students.  They should also reveal how the complex trait of self-fertility evolved in roundworms, which will advance Evolutionary Biology, and help explain how roundworms invade and adapt to new environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we studied the types of changes that occur when self-fertile hermaphrodites evolve from a normal male/female ancestral species.
