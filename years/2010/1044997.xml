<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to characterize the sources, composition, and interrelationships among nitrogen (N) species in rainwater and aerosols deposited into the North Atlantic Ocean. The island of Bermuda will be used for sampling due to its location in the western North Atlantic, its history as a key sampling location for studies of the marine atmosphere, and the fact that seasonal changes in transport allow for study of both anthropogenically and primarily marine influenced air masses. The intellectual merit of this project includes contribution to a fundamental understanding of the sources and composition of inorganic and organic N in the marine atmosphere. Results from this work will also have implications for diagnosing how much new, bioavailable N is entering the marine biogeochemical system. Estimates today suggest that atmospheric deposition can account for approximately a third of the ocean's external N supply. However, deposition fluxes to the ocean have typically been interpreted simply as N inputs, whereas recent work suggests that the ocean may influence and even contribute to the reactive N cycle found in the overlying atmosphere. This work aims to clarify both the natural and human-impacted atmospheric N cycle and its links to the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the education and training of undergraduates in the classroom, laboratory and field; training and career development of a graduate level research technician; the education, training and development of a post-doctoral researcher; contribution to the development of the research program of an early career scientist; and dissemination of results within the scientific community, as well as to a broader audience. The work will be highly collaborative and interdisciplinary, involving groups at Brown University, Princeton University and the Bermuda Institute for Ocean Sciences (BIOS). A Princeton undergraduate will participate in field and laboratory work, as part of the Princeton-BIOS summer internship program. A research technician will be dedicated to the project and based at BIOS for 18 months. A post-doctoral scholar will spend time at all three collaborating institutions and will coordinate the research of the undergraduate and a Brown graduate student. The results of the research will be disseminated at scientific conferences and through peer-reviewed publications. This research and its implications will be shared with a broader audience through three specific efforts: a public lecture in Bermuda, a presentation to K-12 teachers as part of Brown's NSF supported GK-12 program, and development of a module to be taught as part of an undergraduate environmental studies course at Brown entitled "Analysis and Resolution of Environmental Problems."</AbstractNarration>

Nitrate is the ultimate sink for atmospheric NOx and is produced through both hydroxyl radical (OH) and ozone (O3) driven pathways. At Bermuda, rain and aerosols from marine vs. continental air masses are different; marine rain has lower nitrate concentrations, higher average nitrogen isotope ratios (15N/14N), and lower average oxygen isotope ratios (18O/16O) (Altieri et al., 2013, Gobel et al., 2013), where 15N/14N is a tracer for the nitrogen source, and 18O/16O is a tracer for the chemistry that formed the nitrate. As expected due to the large anthropogenic sources of NOx and O3 over North America, the data indicate that continental air masses contribute anthropogenic nitrate from North America formed via the O3 pathway to the subtropical surface ocean, whereas nitrate associated with marine air masses has a different NOx source and is formed via OH from the marine atmosphere. One remarkable finding is that the nitrate concentration does not differ greatly in rain from marine air masses vs. continental air masses. This implies a natural source of nitrate from the atmosphere over the open ocean.

Measuring the isotopic composition of ammonium is very challenging; thus, there are no measurements from the marine atmosphere available for comparison with our data. We developed a mathematical model to investigate whether the surface ocean can be the dominant source of ammonia to the marine atmosphere given the observed concentrations and isotope ratios. The model demonstrates that this is indeed feasible. While 90% of the ammonium deposition to the global ocean has previously be...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
