<AbstractNarration>One of the greatest challenges of modern biology is to demystify the overwhelming complexity of living things.  Is it possible to explain how intricately complex organisms come to be, both during a lifetime through development, and across millennia through evolution?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genes are clearly important building blocks. But even more important may be how and when particular genes are used, or expressed.  The project team has been studying the role of gene expression in organizing the complex societies of bees and wasps, whose incredibly sophisticated social behavior in many ways rivals human society.  In the proposed work, they will be using new cutting-edge technologies, involving the generation of huge repositories of DNA and RNA sequence information, to compare how genes are expressed in the brains of social wasp queens and workers.  They will investigate the idea that animals with great flexibility and coordination in how their genes are expressed may be more likely to evolve complex, cooperative societies.  If so, this may be one of the "secrets" to how social complexity evolves, and these findings can bring us closer to understanding the genetic processes that allow organisms to become so diverse and well-adapted to their environments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also provide numerous training and educational opportunities.  Several students (including some from underrepresented groups) and a postdoctoral research associate will be broadly trained in field and laboratory techniques, and will learn some of the latest genetic methods and analyses.  The project team will also engage a local high school teacher in the project research, with the aim of sharing their findings through educational programs with school districts in rural Iowa.  The Principal Investigator plans to present several public lectures and outreach activities to educate the broader community about topics such as pollinator biology and health, genetics, and evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the biggest surprises of 20th century biology was the discovery of how few genes we human beings possess.  How can the species that invented rocketships have the same number of genes as a worm or flowering plant?  The secret may lie in how those genes are "expressed" in response to the environment&mdash; when and where theyÆre turned on or off during an organismÆs lifetime and within its tissues.     How genes are expressed is a key part of a new and exciting field in biology, called "epigenetics", which goes a beyond traditional genetics and considers genes as more flexible and responsive to the environment.  The addition of simple methyl groups to DNA, called "DNA methylation", is one way in which epigenetics can work, essentially translating environmental signals into chemical changes that affect DNA and change how genes are expressed.  An intriguing aspect of DNA methylation is that experiences that an animal or plant has during its early development can have long-term consequences on DNA methylation, and thus, how certain genes function for the rest of its life.  DNA methylation is especially important in relaying messages from social cues to genes, such as how caring a mother rat is toward her pups, in ways that can profoundly affect the future development and behavior of those pups.     Recently, DNA methylation was discovered another group of animals with complex social behavior&mdash;the colony-forming social insects.  In fact, DNA methylation in honey bees makes a big difference in the most important "decision" in beesÆ lives-- whether an egg becomes a reproductive queen or a sterile worker.  Parallels between the importance of DNA methylation in mammals and bees suggested to Amy Toth that DNA methylation might be a key factor in the evolution of social life.     In order to study the role of DNA methylation in evolution, Toth and colleagues focused on Polistes dominula paper wasps, excellent subjects for studying the evolution of social behavior.  As opposed to honey bees, paper wasp colonies are small and relatively simple, and there are only subtle differences between queens and workers (Additional File 1).    Toth and colleagues used a novel experimental approach in which they blocked DNA methylation in natural field colonies and lab-reared colonies of paper wasps (Additional File 2) and then followed individual wasps throughout their lives to see what impacts this might have on whether they end up as queens or workers.  They found that DNA methylation is indeed important for the formation of queens and workers in these wasps, despite their rudimentary social systems.  These studies suggest epigenetics may have an important role in the formation of social groups during evolution.     Part of the challenge of this project was studying genetics in paper wasps, which few scientists had done before. Toth and several collaborators started from scratch and generated huge new genetic datasets, allowing them to be the first ever to characterize all of the genes in a paper wasp (Additional File 3).  This project serves as a proof-of-concept that it is now possible to apply sophisticated genetic techniques to nearly any animal or plant of interest.  This is evidence of a sea change in that it is becoming possible to use genetics to solve problems related to the management, conservation, and control of economically and agriculturally important organisms.     In addition, this project has provided important opportunities for interdisciplinary training and career advancement for one postdoctoral researcher, several graduate and undergraduate students, and a high school teacher.   Several of these individuals have gone on to careers in STEM fields in academia or graduate school.      Finally, the themes, results, and implications of this work have been shared with the general public in several different contexts.  Toth and several members of her research group have shared the excitement of studying social insects and g...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
