<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in "A Conference on Complex Dynamics and Hyperbolic Geometry" that will be held at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York from October 21-23, 2010. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this conference is to celebrate the many contributions of Linda Keen to the field of "complex analysis," broadly construed. The primary focus of the meeting will be on areas in which Professor Keen has had a major involvement, specifically complex dynamics, Teichmuller theory, and Kleinian groups. All three remain central and extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Project funded two conferences at The City University of New York. The first conference titled "Complex Dynamics and Hyperbolic Geometry" was held at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York. The conference featured twelve internationally recognized leaders of the two fields: the complex dynamics and the hyperbolic geometry. The conference speakers and participants came from the United States, Europe and Asia. The two fields represented in the conference have seen a significant exchanges of ideas and viewpoints especially in the period of five to fifteen years ago. Hyperbolic geometry has greatly benefitted from the dynamical viewpoint, and complex dynamics have seen great advances when importing the ideas of the hyperbolic geometry. Since that time, the two fields have been developing in somewhat independent fashion. One of the contributions of the conference was to once again bring together the leading experts in both fields in order to facilitate the exchange of the latest ideas and compare advances in the two fields. The participants ranged from the leaders in the two fields,&nbsp; through mid range researchers to the novice researchers and PhD students. The schedule of talks was made such that there was a lot of time for the discussions after the talks and these discussions included varying level researchers and people from different fields. There was a conference proceedings of the Contemporary Mathematics series of the American Mathematical Society, Volume 573, in which the contributions were made by the speakers and conference participants which enabled a wider dissemination of the conference topics and discussions. The volume is acknowledging the National Science Foundation support of the conference.<br /><br />The second conference titled "Hyperbolic Geometry and Teichmuller Theory" was held at Hunter College of the City University of New York. The topics of this conference were the low dimensional topology, hyperbolic geometry and Teichmuller theory. There were twelve speakers which were all United States based leading experts in the fields represented by the conference. The conference participants mainly came from the United States and some from Asia. The conference had a wide participation from the junior researchers, PhD students and there were even some mathematics undergraduate students at the conference.
