<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23 July 2010&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1013408&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Hawaii&lt;br/&gt;PI:   A. Shor&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI(s):  S. Winslow, T. McGovern&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests numerous Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V KILO MOANA which is operated by the University of Hawaii; namely a portable cable spooler, a light-duty ?hydro? winch, and critical CTD handling system spares.  All of these items will either improve equipment reliability in the field or enhance science support capabilities for science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The University of Hawaii vessels support federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  During operations, the vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and University open house events.  All told, the KILO MOANA is scheduled to complete approximately 190 NSF sponsored days in 2010.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Final Report, NSF award #1013408  Alexander Shor, University of Hawaii, PI     NSF award 1013408 from the Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) Program in the Division of Ocean Sciences supported the acquisition of over-side handling equipment for use on R/V Kilo Moana, a research vessel owned by the US Navy and operated by University of Hawaii as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.     All of the items acquired were used to improve systems used for handling oceanographic sampling equipment.  Specific items included spare and replacement parts for our winch and crane CTD handling system,  remote winch displays and software for monitoring winch tension and wire length, a mobile spooler/tensioner system for loading wire on the ship, and air tuggers for handling equipment on deck.  All items are used routinely to support research programs funded by NSF on the vessel, which normally operates between 200 and 270 days per year, with the majority of the work funded by NSF.     In the two calendar years since this award was received, R/V Kilo Moana has carried out 481 operating days supporting ocean research, including 360 days for NSF-supported projects on 35 separate trips.  Equipment supported by the present award has been used on all of those projects.       Last Modified: 01/07/2013       Submitted by: Alexander N Shor]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
