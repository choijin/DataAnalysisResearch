<AbstractNarration>This project will utilize both VHF radio and a network of GPS sensor data collected in the southern (Western Australia) hemisphere, in a collaboration between the US, Australia, and India, to improve the  understanding of the storm-time response of the mid-latitude ionosphere.  The observations will be obtained in a longitude sector which has a large offset between geographical and geomagnetic sectors, thought to be important for storm-enhanced plasma density (SED) plume generation, and which is similar to that in the northern hemisphere where the proposers have conducted such investigations in the past.  Specifically, the investigation will focus on the dynamics and evolution of SED structures, including a comparison between SED behavior in the two hemispheres, as well as on associated total electron content (TEC) gradients and generation of scintillation, which will be observed at unprecedented spatiotemporal detail.  This project will provide access to data and research opportunities to students as well as support full-time post-doc involvement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project was to advance the use of the Murchinson Widefield Array (MWA) for the use of solar-heliosphere-ionosphere (SHI) science (http://www.mwatelescope.org) The MWA is a new radio interferometer located in Western Australia operating in the 80-300 MHz range. Located in radio quiet Western Australia, the MWA has been designated to be a precursor for the Square Kilometer Array, to be built at the same site. The MWA comprises 128 elements distributed in a centrally condensed manner over a region 3 km in diameter.  During the time period of this proposal, the facility was de-scoped from a full 526-tiles to a 128-tile array. The impact on SHI science objectives had to be reviewed to take into account the smaller array size (128 tiles versus 512 tiles).  Several ionospheric goals were compromised by this reduction, although there is still ample opportunity to investigate scintillation over a wide range of frequencies.  The primary SHI science goal that has not been affected by this reduction in size is solar imaging, and a fraction of our work on this grant was involved with this.  Some of the focus of this proposal was switched to solar imaging.  This research project led to the publication of 6 papers and 3 conference proceedings.  An undergraduateÆs senior research thesis was based on this work, as were several NSF REU student projects.  We list here three major findings.     Finding 1: MWA Solar Imaging     Low frequency radio images from the Murchison Widefield Array Prototype, christened 32T, (Figure 1, panel b) now represent the state-of-the-art in high dynamic range solar imaging at these frequencies, offering an order of magnitude improvement over the earlier ones(panel c). The high fidelity of these images can be seen by the comparison between the radio image (panel b) and the SOHO 304 A image (panel a). The horizontal blue lines are all the same length and demonstrate that even the weaker features seen in the radio image correspond to bright regions seen in the EUV image and represent real emission features. The 32T dynamic spectra (panel d) for the first time revealed the presence of numerous signatures of weak short lived non-thermal emission even during æquietÆ solar conditions. The novel and unique spectroscopic imaging capability enabled by these data allow us to follow temporal, spectral and spatial evolution of coronal features in unprecedented detail (panels e and f). These results have been published in  Oberoi et al. 2011, ApJ, 728, L27.     Finding 2  :  MWA Images during CME.     The MWA solar images shown in Figure 2 (bottom half panel) were presented by Divya Oberoi at the MWA Meeting in Bangalore in June. The images (bottom half) correspond to the same time as a CME (seen in the LASCO C2 coronagraph). The key point is that the coronagraph image is an integration over 19 s (which is the highest time resolution that the coronagraph can produce).

The dynamic range of these images is &gt;1000 and far exceeds that from the earlier generation of instruments (Nancay, Culgoora and Gauribidanur) and even some modern instruments (e.g. LOFAR).
