<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-LAMP) is a statewide, comprehensive systemic mentoring program aimed at rapidly increasing the number and quality of minority students earning baccalaureate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)disciplines. An associated goal is to increase the number of minority students enrolling and succeeding in STEM graduate programs, with emphasis on the Ph.D.  Over the next five years, (2010-15), to attain the annual degree production objective of 850 minority STEM BS degrees by 2015 and to achieve the transition of at least 30% of these graduates to graduate school. The attainment of these clear objectives is reasonably ensured by our holistic implementation of strategies characterized by (1) expanding our effective Systemic mentoring and learning practices for minority STEM undergraduate students (including research participation and financial support); (2) the establishment of a new bridge program for community college graduates transferring to a 4-year STEM program, (3) collaboration with other statewide systemic programs, business and industry organizations, professional organizations, federal agencies and national laboratories, and other entities; (4) enhancing the STEM infrastructure of partner institutions in a fashion that promotes total institutionalization of the gains of LS-LAMP; and (5) providing institutional support over five years and supplemental leveraging of resources by LS-LAMP partner institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Southern University and A&amp;M College serves as the lead institution for LS-LAMP with the active input and advice of eleven (11) Louisiana higher educational institutions and one research organization.  The institutions are:  Dillard University, Grambling State University, Louisiana State University, McNeese State University, Nunez Community College, Southern University and A&amp;M College, Southern University at New Orleans, Southern University at Shreveport, Tulane University, the University of New Orleans, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special emphasis will continue to be placed on (1) transfer of community college graduates to STEM disciplines in 4-year institutions, (2) pre-college outreach activities driven by the Louisiana Tuition Opportunity Programs for Students (TOPS), (3) comprehensive collaboration with statewide programs, public and private stakeholders, and (4) broadening international research experiences for our students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proven capability of the investigators ensures the attainment of the objectives.  Thorough external and internal evaluation is woven into the fabric of the project activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Louisiana Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority participation (LS-LAMP)  Final Outcomes (2011-2016)  HRD 1002541  Overview  The Louis Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-LAMP) is a comprehensive, statewide, coordinated program aimed at substantially increasing the number and quality of minority students enrolling in and completing baccalaureate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and subsequently going on to pursue graduate studies in STEM disciplines. The overall project reference at LS-LAMP and related activities? strategies are centered on enhancing and coordinating existing STEM workforce development activities at the partner institutions, supporting undergraduate research activities and introducing strategic state-wide and regional academic and research activities to promote networking and technology exchanges.  LS-LAMP continues to be a major player within Louisiana for developing intellectual leadership critical to the needs of a 21st century scientific and technological workforce.  The expansion of Louisiana?s STEM infrastructure has cooperated with several systemic initiatives (including the EPSCoR programs and others) coordinated through the Louisiana Board of Regents.   This Alliance is currently composed of twelve (12) institutions of higher education and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON), a research facility, with Southern University and A&amp;M College as the lead institution.  The original alliance was joined by Xavier University in 2010.  LS-LAMP utilizes the Ten-Strand Systemic Mentoring Model for achieving its goals. This model has been adopted by all partner campuses. It forms the foundation of the Strategic Implementation Plan that is utilized by all partner campuses of the alliance.  LS-LAMP Campus Coordinators have diligently worked to exchange best practices on incorporating externally-based stakeholders.  Thus, we are delighted to report that the LS-LAMP Senior Alliance Best Practices in Systemic Mentoring (1st Edition) is currently in its final publication stages.   Summary of Impacts:   This LS-LAMP Senior-Level Alliance is the third of four Alliance-wide projects received by Southern University and A&amp;M College (lead institution) to date. Through LS-LAMP, the Alliance-wide institutions have made a significant impact on the achievement of the numeric objectives that were accompanied by the enhancement of the quality of the graduates through a continued building of the STEM infrastructure of LS-LAMP member institutions and the continued institutionalization of LS-LAMP operations.  LS-&shy;LAMP?s strategy centers on expanding partnerships with the pre&shy;-college community, community colleges, 4&shy;-year institutions, other institutional programs (state and national), public and private research organizations, and funding sources for the purpose of expanding opportunities, sustainability, and institutionalization. The undergraduate enhancement activities, including financial support, rigorous mentoring, research participation, and guidance to graduate school are a part of the LS&shy;LAMP systemic mentoring activities that are carried out at the twelve (12) participating institutions. The LS-&shy;LAMP implementation continues on expanding the State's STEM infrastructure and joining together several systemic initiatives and EPSCoR programs coordinated through the Louisiana Board of Regents.  All of the LS-LAMP campuses are continuing to expand and to strengthen their partnerships for sustainability and institutionalization. More institutions have been tracking their students after graduation as a result of the persistence of the LS-LAMP Office.  Alliance-wide, data show that there has been an increase in the number of students attending graduate school since the implementation of LS-LAMP. Research opportunities afforded to LS-LAMP scholars have resulted in an increase in the number of students in Louisiana who continue on to graduate school.  All LS-LAMP scholars are encouraged to participate in a summer research program.  The LS-LAMP Office provided support to the campuses by supplying detailed information and application packages for research opportunities available nationwide. Increased awareness, via the World Wide Web, and other sources have facilitated student enrollment in research internships and have helped to promote graduate school attendance among students.  Programmatic Components:  Systemic Student Mentoring - the formula for retention, on-time graduation, quality enhancement, the development of professionalism, competitiveness, and research-based careers. The LS-LAMP Systemic Mentoring Model has been adopted and adapted by all the partner institutions. These systemic mentoring activities are coordinated by the LSLAMP campus coordinators and carried out with the assistance and support of the STEM faculty and some academic and administrative units. The general mentoring portfolio, for each scholar, is maintained by the campus coordinator while the research portfolio is maintained by the research advisor/mentor.  International Activities  LS-LAMP partners continue to increase the number of minority scholars participating in research outside the United States. The approach relies on the synergy and leveraging between LS-LAMP and existing and future international research opportunity programs and entities, including laboratories overseas.
