<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of virtual single crystal (VSC) technology for high-efficiency, low-cost and flexible CdTe solar cells. Wakonda has previously showed epitaxial deposition of CdTe on a flexible VSC metal foil, resulting in CdTe films with large (~ 50 microns) and highly-oriented crystalline grains.  This project will develop the technology to achieve optimized carrier concentrations in p- and n-type CdTe on VSC through non-equilibrium methods.  It is expected to lead to flexible CdTe solar cells with efficiencies at or above 15%.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to reduce the manufacturing cost of solar modules in the building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) market, which is projected to exceed $1.7 billion by 2011.  The VSC approach by Wakonda will enable the production of high-crystallinity CdTe films at low cost by using industrial-standard roll-to-roll manufacturing equipment. This project will also advance the science and technology of CdTe and other II-VI materials that are known to have high intrinsic material defects that limit free carrier concentrations and minority carrier lifetimes.  This knowledge could impact other existing and future II-VI optoelectronic devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary objective of this Project was to demonstrate increased free carrier concentrations in p-type CdTe thin films, leading to the possibility of significant improvements in efficiency and reduced photovoltaic module cost.  RealTime anticipates the production of substrate-based CdTe thin films using low cost roll-to-roll processes.  PV cell efficiencies in excess of 20% (AM1.5G) are predicted by semiconductor device models.  The project focused on non-equilibrium and near-equilibrium doping techniques that have the potential to suppress the self-compensation mechanisms in the CdTe base material.  Self-compensation tends to strengthen as the total amount of dopant increases, offsetting efforts to increase doping through traditional means.  Furthermore, the models show clearly that an increase in grain size can improve carrier lifetime and therefore efficiency.  Thin films were produced on both GaAs single crystal substrates and on large grain size, crystalline metal foil with a low resistance buffer layer.  The films were epitaxial in both cases.  High levels of dopant were achieved and the films were nominally p-type.  However, the desired free carrier concentrations were not achieved.  Improved deposition system control was determined to be essential to the control of both film stoichiometry and background contaminants.  New collaborations were developed under the course of the project and the collaborators have produced the necessary carrier concentrations in their laboratory.  Samples from this new collaboration were not available for analysis by the end of the project.  Efforts to validate the results and to demonstrate the improved PV cell efficiency will continue beyond the end of this project.
