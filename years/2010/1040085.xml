<AbstractNarration>This project involves acquisition of a water isotope instrument, trace gas analyzers, and an aerosol size analyzer that together serve as an integrated system to monitor atmospheric chemical composition at Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL), a unique, high-altitude atmospheric research station that experiences almost daily transition from free-troposphere to boundary layer air. The proposed trace gas analyzers for sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO) will enable correlative measurements to identify sources and transport of anthropogenic constituents in air masses impacting SPL. Carbon monoxide and NOx (NO and NO2) are indicators of anthropogenic combustion sources. While NOx is reactive, CO is relatively stable. The relative abundances of CO and mercury, for example, have been used to identify local versus distant sources of mercury. Recent evidence at SPL indicates that new particle formation occurs frequently. A scanning mobility particle-sizer will extend SPL's aerosol size measurement capability down to 2.5 nanometers, which is essential for identifying aerosol nucleation and the factors responsible for it. Sulfur dioxide is involved in aerosol nucleation, and measurements at trace levels are necessary for quantifying its role. A water vapor/isotopic analyzer will add a new dimension to cloud and precipitation studies at SPL. Acquisition of this instrument will help support recent work showing that isotopes can be used as a proxy for cloud formation temperatures and altitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities enabled by this new instrumentation will involve participation by undergraduate and graduate students plus post-doctoral fellows. SPL also hosts atmospheric science field courses from a multitude of universities for both undergraduate and graduate students. NSF's Opportunity for Enhancing Diversity in Geoscience Program supports field research experiences for a wde-ranging group of undergraduate students at SPL, including partnerships with several Historically Black Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions. The equipment will expand the scope and focus of research conducted at SPL, thereby providing additional opportunities for field training. SPL engenders public outreach through media coverage of the research. Reports have appeared on CNN, NBC, National Public Radio, National Geographic Explorer, local television stations, and in newspapers across the U.S.</AbstractNarration>
