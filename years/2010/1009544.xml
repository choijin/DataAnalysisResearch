<AbstractNarration>AST-1009544/1008330/1009113&lt;br/&gt;Pitman/Hofmeister/Speck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the nature and formation of cosmic dust is crucial to our understanding of the Universe.  The absorption, scattering, and re-emission of light by cosmic dust has a profound effect on the interpretation of observed spectral signatures and radiative transfer processes in a variety of astronomical objects.  Dust is crucial to star formation processes, and understanding the dust at high redshift is vital to cosmological models and dark energy studies.  To account properly for energy budgets in astrophysical environments requires an understanding of the physical properties of the dust, gained from several types of laboratory data: (1) absorbance spectra, which can be compared to observational spectra, and (2) reflectivity spectra, which may be used to derive (3) optical functions.  However, quality laboratory data are not available for many of the compounds believed to exist in space, particularly at ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) wavelengths.  This project will provide all three forms of UV-vis laboratory data for a suite of solid-state materials found in meteorites and in the condensation sequence.  The major goals are: (1) Determine the spectral behavior of selected silicates, sulfides, oxides, glasses, and other materials that may be present in space; (2) Determine optical functions for these materials; and (3) Apply these data to outstanding questions in astronomy, and make all of the data available to the astronomical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will broaden the participation of under-represented groups and enhance the infrastructure for research and education.  The synergistic, cross-disciplinary study involves scientists in astrophysics, mineral physics, and planetary science, using laboratory, observational, and theoretical modeling techniques.  Laboratory fundamental research for astrophysics is at a critical stage and this work will train new U.S. researchers and students in this area, matching personnel with underutilized but available equipment.  The female lead researchers are all strong role models for women in science, and have strong histories of public outreach and active mentorship of undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project addressed the lack of quality laboratory comparison data for many of the compounds believed to exist in space by providing three types of ultraviolet-to-visible wavelength spectra and refractive indices of silicate, sulfide, and oxide minerals and glasses and by making these data available to the international public on websites.  Our data can be directly compared to spectra from observatories and used in computer models of stellar energy budgets, allowing us to better identify different types of "dust" between and around stars, which helps determine how much light is lost between us and stars, the stars' sizes and ages, and other outstanding questions in astronomy.  Because the U.S. stands to lose dominance in laboratory astrophysics research due to aging facilities and lack of personnel, the American Astronomical Society recommends supporting laboratory facilities and training new researchers in this field.  To support these goals, this NSF award supported scientists who themselves are in an underrepresented minority (i.e., female Ph.D.s in astronomy) to sponsor internships and national conference presentations for one undergraduate student per year of the project.  NSF funds were spent to improve capability at a central research facility and then shared between two universities and a non-profit center, saving on cost.
