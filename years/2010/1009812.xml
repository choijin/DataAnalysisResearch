<AbstractNarration>This project provides funds for a two-year renewal of the St. Elias Erosion-tectonics Project (STEEP).  STEEP is a 9 institution, multidisciplinary study of the St. Elias orogen in southern Alaska that involves researchers examining the system from the outcrop to lithosphere scale.  To date, STEEP has produced 17 papers with another 9 submitted or nearing submission, sponsored 71 abstracts, will have matriculated 5 masters and 4 Doctoral students by Spring 2010, and fundamentally changed our understanding of Alaskan tectonics and the interaction of tectonics and climate in mountain building.  The renewal funds will be used for:  1) final processing and interpretation of some key datasets that were not acquired until year 5 of the project including the marine seismic survey (ship delays) and reoccupation of key GPS sites (weather problems in 2008); and  2) a complete integration of results which was not possible until now due to these delays. A complete integration and synthesis of these superb datasets has the potential to be transformative in our understanding of how crustal structure and tectonic forces interact with Earth surface processes of glacial erosion and sedimentary transport to grow a mountain range and a massive continental shelf.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The St. &shy;Elias Erosion and Tectonics Project (STEEP) has contributed, and will likely continue to contribute substantially to one of the more vibrant, new aspects of the earth sciences that engages a large community across several disciplines.  It examined the interplay between tectonic plate motion, erosion, glaciers, the ocean and climate that produced these mountains, the highest coastal mountains on the globe (Figures 1-3). This area is a world record breaker not only in terms of the extreme relief adjacent to an ocean, but it also features the largest and most erosive valleys glaciers on the planet.      The tempo of erosion is such that, if averaged over the entire STEEP area, a layer of rock equivalent in thickness to the average elevation of the range is eroded away within a million years. Despite the rapid erosion, the St. Elias Mountains stand out among the highest on the continent, and curiously, they most probably have been high for millions of years. This is based previous observations of ice-rafted debris in sediments cored in the Pacific; they indicate that the mountains must have been sufficiently high to support ice masses that reached the ocean starting five million years ago. At that time, the climate was generally warmer than it is currently, suggesting that the mountains may have been even higher than they are now millions of years ago because, with the current extent of the area over which glacial ice accumulates, only a few of the glaciers presently reach the ocean. Under a warmer climate, greater snowfall would be required to fuel glaciers that reached the sea to offset the faster melting. In the absence of a significantly greater snowfall, which is unlikely, this would necessitate higher terrain to accumulate more snow. The relationship between the elevation of the mountains and extent of glaciers provides a powerful constraint on paleo elevations that does not exist for mountains that have not been shaped by ice.     Our team has shown that the amount of rock removed by erosion must be closely offset by tectonic addition of rock and uplift in the STEEP region to sustain the St. Elias Mountains.  Indeed, in general, cooling ages in modern sediment show that rapid, sustained erosion coincides in space with zones of active deformation and high precipitation, as well as with rapid glacial erosion (Figure 4).     STEEP involved and impacted diverse disciplines. The petrologic, geomorphic, and geodynamic investigations of the STEEP area, and other the regions of extreme rates of erosion and uplift, illuminate the nonlinear interaction and cooperative behavior of tectonics and surface processes because of the high process rates produce high signal-to-noise ratios. The interaction and behavior are, however, likely to be universal, hence our work has broad relevance across the earth sciences. Notably, it contributes to current understanding of  - the interplay between climate, tectonics, and surface processes, which vividly connects the solid Earth to the Earth system and has engaged a generation of young scientists equipped with new analytical tools, instrumentation and vast, rich data sets.  - how active mountain belts work, and worked through geologic time.  - the understudied role of erosion and the resulting sediments on the response of glaciers that reach the sea to changing climates, past, present and future, with strong implications for efforts to improve predictions of sea level change.     More specific impacts on particular fields include:  - Structural Geology: sheds new light on the growth of continents, and how glaciers can reveal active tectonics.  - Marine Geology and interpretation of glaci-marine sediments: Glacier/sediment/ocean systems are richly complex; instructive models are emerging but validation is sparse.  - Interpretation of fluvial sediment records: sedimentation can be highly localized hence caution is in order when inferring orogen-scale environmental or tectonic changes fro...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
