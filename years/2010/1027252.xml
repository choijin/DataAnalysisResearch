<AbstractNarration>The Thirty-second Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at Northwestern University October 14-16, 2010. The theme of this year's meeting is Random Matrices, for which the centerpiece is the two lectures by Kurt Johansson. In addition to supporting the speakers, we will fund the travel and lodging expenses for graduate students, younger researchers and members of unrepresented minority groups.</AbstractNarration>
