<AbstractNarration>1062417&lt;br/&gt;Stair&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical reactions at surfaces are key processes in catalysis, coatings, lubrication, solid state devices, and other technologies that are critical for improving the quality of life while simultaneously reducing the adverse impact of human activities on the environment. The discovery and development of new surface processes and the improvement of existing ones, particularly in the area of photovoltaics, can make important contributions to securing the nation's energy supply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests support for the 2011 Gordon Conference on Chemical&lt;br/&gt;Reactions at Surfaces. The conference, which will be held at the Ventura Beach Marriot&lt;br/&gt;in Ventura, California on February 6 - 11, 2011, will bring together leading experts to&lt;br/&gt;discuss the latest and most exciting work in the field. Topics include:&lt;br/&gt;- catalysis by metals, &lt;br/&gt;- energy conversion at surfaces, &lt;br/&gt;- hydrogen production and separation at surfaces, &lt;br/&gt;- liquids at surfaces, &lt;br/&gt;- interfacial chemistry in photovoltaics,&lt;br/&gt;- chemical reactions at oxide surfaces, &lt;br/&gt;- surface chemistry of CO2 conversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special effort will be made to support young scientists who otherwise would be unable to attend: junior faculty members, postdoctoral fellows and advanced graduate students. Participation by young researchers will add significant value to this conference and will foster communications among current and future leaders in a field that combines academic and industrial issues. The setting and program for the conference keeps the participants on site and maximizes interactions and intellectual discourse and networking.</AbstractNarration>
