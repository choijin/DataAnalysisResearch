<AbstractNarration>Reducing the loss of crops to diseases is an essential factor in providing food for increasing global populations but minimizing demand on fresh water resources and pollution. This project aims to define the natural mechanisms plants share to protect themselves against microbial infection and the methods disease-causing bacteria use to overcome those defenses. Like the human immune response, plant disease defense responses are complex, involving many interacting biochemical pathways. These pathways, however, remain poorly characterized at the molecular level. This project aims to understand how a bacterium that infects a broad range of plant species (Pseudomonas syringae) overcomes natural plant disease defenses. It is anticipated that this information will help agriculture researchers to improve crop yields with minimal detrimental effects on the environment. Disease is caused when the bacteria transfers a dedicated set of its own proteins into plant cells. These proteins interact with molecular complexes in the plant that function in disease defense and prevent them from working. The investigators have developed assays to identify the specific host proteins that are inactivated by one of the transferred bacterial proteins called HopAM1. HopAM1 is one of the few bacterial proteins that induces several easily visualized responses when it is transferred into plant cells. These responses can be used in genetic experiments to identify the plant defense proteins that are affected by HopAM1. The investigators will use molecular genetic methods to identify and characterize the plant proteins affected by HopAM1. This will highlight and define one biochemical defense pathway and provide tools to understand how that pathway is involved in the overall plant defense response. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves training of a doctoral student, a postdoctoral researcher and undergraduate students. The participants will gain experience with genetic, biochemical and cell biological tools. Undergraduate students are regularly involved in the research. Students will be recruited from undergraduate institutions with limited access to federally sponsored research programs, as well as from the research location, UNC Chapel Hill. The students will learn research strategy as well as specialized techniques as they experience the excitement of scientific discovery.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>HopAM1 is one of many effector proteins that bacterial pathogens of plants inject into host cells to suppress immune responses and mobilize plant resources to feed growing pathogen colonies. The HopAM1 protein has toxic effects when expressed in plant cells either by transport from non-infectious bacteria or when expressed from a plant promoter in cells of transgenic plants. In most Arabidopsis genetic backgrounds, HopAM1 affects chloroplast development leading to bleached tissues. This is a systemic effect, even if the HopAM1 is transported into mature leaf tissue, the chlorosis will appear days later in new leaves that were simply buds at the time of exposure to HopAM1 (See Figure 1). In a minority of Arabidopsis genetic backgrounds, HopAM1 will cause local cell at the site of exposure in Arabidopsis leaves (See Figure 2). We identified genes in the model plant Arabidopsis that are involved in the plant responses to HopAM1 illustrated. We found that chlorotic responses and cell death responses are independent processes. The chlorosis processes involves at least one gene for a protein that is part of the transport apparatus for importing proteins into plant chloroplasts. Chloroplasts produce many of the defense hormones plants need to mount an immune response to pathogen infection in response to reactive oxygen and other more poorly defined chemical signals that are produced early in infection. Our genetic analysis suggests that HopAM1 alters the way chloroplasts respond to defense signals conferred by reactive oxygen in a way that reduces early immune responses. The localized cell death responses we found in a minority of Arabidopsis isolates are associated with induction of well characterized plant disease resistance mechanisms but this induction does not lead to plant immunity to the pathogen. Apparently, HopAM1 initiates plant defense mechanisms an ineffective way. The cells die more slowly than usual and it may be too late to protect the plant from spread of the bacteria. Instead, the dead cells may enhance the ability of the already established pathogen to grow. Our findings shed new light on the way bacterial toxic proteins enhance disease and the mechanisms plants use to defend themselves. The results were published in the peer reviewed journal Genetics: Iakovidis, M., Teixeira, P.J., Exposito-Alonso, M., Cowper, M.G., Law, T.F., Liu, Q., Vu, M.C., Dang, T.M., Corwin, J.A., Weigel, D.<em>, et al.</em> (2016).
