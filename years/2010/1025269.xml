<AbstractNarration>In this project, the investigators study the fundamental aspects of&lt;br/&gt;incorporating uncertainty with sensitivity analysis in the visual&lt;br/&gt;analytics process. They also aim to develop novel and scalable&lt;br/&gt;visual representations of sensitivity, from the visualization of the&lt;br/&gt;raw sensitivity coefficients to visual summaries of multivariate&lt;br/&gt;derivatives obtained from the analysis.  Uncertainty-aware visual&lt;br/&gt;analytics helps enhance analysts' confidence levels on the insight&lt;br/&gt;gained from the analysis. Furthermore, it gives toolmakers a&lt;br/&gt;methodology for measuring and comparing the robustness of&lt;br/&gt;data and visual transformations. Sensitivity coefficients of data and&lt;br/&gt;visual transformations are useful for discovering the factors that mostly&lt;br/&gt;contribute to output variability, identifying stability regions of the&lt;br/&gt;different transformations within the original data space, and&lt;br/&gt;telling the analyst what the interaction is between variables,&lt;br/&gt;outputs and transformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncertainty is introduced throughout the process of data generation,&lt;br/&gt;transformation, and analysis in most real-world applications. The ability to&lt;br/&gt;incorporate uncertainty into visual analysis is therefore critically important&lt;br/&gt;for insightful reasoning and key decision making. This project will have a&lt;br/&gt;wide-reaching impact on those areas relying on the ability to reason&lt;br/&gt;about large amounts of data. On one hand, it suggests to provide a variational&lt;br/&gt;view of the visual analytics process, which opens up new directions and&lt;br/&gt;paradigms for visual data analysis and mining. On the other hand,&lt;br/&gt;the improved understanding of the visual analytics process will help&lt;br/&gt;establish the field as a scientific discipline.</AbstractNarration>
