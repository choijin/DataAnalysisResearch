<AbstractNarration>This award continues support for the University of California Species Stock&lt;br/&gt;Center, a collection of living stocks of Drosophila species. The living&lt;br/&gt;collection consists of over 1000 strains representing approximately 250&lt;br/&gt;species of the small insect commonly referred to as the fruit fly. Project goals&lt;br/&gt;are to provide live flies to researchers and educators at a charge that helps&lt;br/&gt;defray operating costs. The whole genomes of 14 Drosophila species have&lt;br/&gt;been sequenced which has driven the use of these species by the biological&lt;br/&gt;community including researchers in behavior, neurobiology, development,&lt;br/&gt;genomics, ecology, physiology, immunology, and systems biology. Growth in&lt;br/&gt;the collection includes addition of newly collected wild type strains and&lt;br/&gt;addition of transgenic strains for those species whose genomes have been&lt;br/&gt;sequenced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These species provide unprecedented opportunities to study basic biological&lt;br/&gt;processes common to many species, including humans. In addition to&lt;br/&gt;enabling research, the Stock Center provides samples for educational uses in&lt;br/&gt;high schools, colleges and museums. The Stock Center also conducts an&lt;br/&gt;annual workshop for students and researchers wishing to learn more about&lt;br/&gt;the varied species in the collection and to acquire the special knowledge&lt;br/&gt;needed to work with them.</AbstractNarration>
