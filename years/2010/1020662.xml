<AbstractNarration>The award provides funding for NUESTRO FUTURO, a national conference designed to fully engage a cross-section of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) experts from around the country to critically review and discuss the best practices in STEM education, and to develop a series of concrete recommendation to encourage young Latinos to pursue STEM degrees and careers. NUESTRO FUTURO will utilize a comprehensive dissemination strategy, including traditional print media, web casting, and social media to reach a large segment of the Latino community regarding the urgent need to prepare future generations in STEM, and innovate to better serve the Hispanic community and the nation. Recommendations from the workshop will aid the NSF?s efforts to broaden participation of all underrepresented minorities, and facilitate the development of a diverse and competitive STEM workforce for the 21st century as mandated by the America Competes Act.</AbstractNarration>

The final panelist was Rick Dalton, president of the Vermont-based College for Every Student (CFES) , who said thereÃ†s a need to create a "intense culture of college" in the Latino community.  Several conclusions emerged from the conference. First, although Latinos are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, the tide is starting to turn.. Engineering is rapidly becoming the most popular choice for Latino students. Second, itÃ†s important to recognize that certain programs have proved quite effective in encouraging young Latinos to enter the STEM fields. Among those cited were LOFT, Great Minds in STEM and HESTEC. Third, there must be a renewed commitment to supporting teachers. In his remarks, Juan Sepulve...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
