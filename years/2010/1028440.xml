<AbstractNarration>An emerging interdisciplinary research area is systems biology.  This field is investigating how individual biological cells communicate, both internally and between cells.  These communication pathways are similar to a complex electrical circuit, in which the cell communication mechanism is a cascade, with multiple signals being generated simultaneously.  Untangling these parallel signals can be extremely complicated, requiring researchers to study single cells instead of large groups or ensembles of cells.  However, many of the currently available analytical techniques require a high concentration of cells and consequently are unable to provide a conclusive result.  Unfortunately, the few existing single cell experimental techniques require fluorescent labeling, making them unsuited for monitoring cell to cell communication in real-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of this research is to develop an instrument which can eavesdrop on cellular communications, at the single cell level and use it to study human aortic vascular cells.  By integrating an optical trap, or a photon tweezer, with an ultra-sensitive detector, it will be possible to detect the change in the signaling behavior of the aortic vascular cells in real-time.  The ability to perform these studies in real-time at the single cell level is not possible with the current state-of-the-art methods.  This technology can be applied to numerous biological systems and cell lines, further expanding its impact on biological research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The training future scientists and engineers at all age levels is a critical component of this project. In addition to the graduate student who will be supported by this project, several undergraduate researchers whose stipends are provided through USC's Undergraduate Research Fund and the Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) Program will be involved in different aspects of this project.  They will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art instrumentation and fabrication methods in USC's Class 10 cleanroom and electron microscopy center.  Additionally, high school teachers who are participating in an NSF Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program at USC will also contribute to this research.  Results will be presented at professional conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and the equipment will be demonstrated to middle school and high school visitors to the laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This highly interdisciplinary research program has combined science and engineering to advance integrated photonics and optical sensing technologies.  During  the course of this research, several novel methods for covalently attaching ssDNA, antibodies and biotin as well as self-assembling lipid bilayers to the surface of several types of optical devices have been developed and verified.  To accomplish this task, a method of increasing the surface activity of the device without damaging the device was developed.  Additionally, a wide range of optical glasses were designed and synthesized.  These materials enabled a wide range of devices to be developed.  For example, the high refractive index materials allowed precise control over the optical field profile, resulting in smaller devices to be designed and demonstrated.  Additionally, by including small amounts of metal in the glasses, a range of microlasers were fabricated.  The emission wavelengths spanned the visible (blue) through the near-IR with micro-Watt threshold powers.  In many cases, these thresholds were several orders of magnitude improvement over previous on-chip lasers.  By combining the developed surface chemistries with the devices, a microlaser-based sensor was developed.  This sensor demonstrated nearly a 60x improvement over previous devices.  In the final phase of the research, a fiber-based optical trap was built.  This trap was designed to hold individual biological cells, and the power was optimized so that it would have minimal impact on the behavior of the cells.  This work lays the foundation for combining the optical trap with the integrated sensors to study the behavior of living cells, opening the door to understanding cell-cell interactions.     The research team which accomplished this work spanned from high school students through PhD students, and included researchers from both the fundamental sciences (biochemistry and chemistry) and different areas in engineering (e.g. EE, CHE, Mat Sci).  Over half of the students (all-levels) supported by this award were from under-represented groups in engineering (minority or female).  All of the high school students are pursuing undergraduate degrees in engineering, and over half of the undergraduates are now pursuing PhDs in engineering or science.
