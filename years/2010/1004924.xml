<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Amy Prieto and Matthew Shores at Colorado State University for three summers, commencing in 2010.  The site will support nine students per summer in a ten week program.  The research projects focus on chemical research applied to "real world problems."  Sample projects include:  (1)  the synthesis and study highly distensible hydrogels with tailored-response capabilities; (2)  the study of polymerization and depolymerization reactions in areas with impact on sustainability; (3)  fundamental studies of light-matter interactions applied to areas of critical need like dye-sensitized solar cells; (4)  the study of the efficient synthesis of complex molecules with useful chemical or biological properties; (5)  the study of the complex chemistry in low temperature plasmas, like those used in material processing environments ; (6)  the study of the self-assembly of complex proteins; (7) the spectroscopic study of molecules at surfaces and in confined environments; (9) the development of new ways to synthesize nanoscale materials with useful properties; and (10) the design, synthesis and characterization of inorganic coordination compounds with tailored magnetic and electronic properties .   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities.  Students will be recruited from a large number of institutions across the country, including a number of schools that are minority-serving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in the chemical sciences to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity.  The research projects are in areas of chemistry that will have an impact in the areas of energy and sustainability.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

In an effort to achieve both goals simultaneously, our featured research projects section highlights a subset of the research involving our ~25 participating faculty where new researchers can be plugged into thoughtfully constructed assignments, with the aim to maximize discoveries. Over the course of this program we have demonstrated success in recruiting students from the three categories listed above, we have effectively tapped our deep pool of participating faculty, and we have supported the goals of NSF by disseminating the work produced broadly, and by providing additional enrichment activities to support research for our students.   In addition to the 27 students that were originally included in the budget, we were able to include 62 total students in the program by leveraging REU funds against funds from internal programs such as the Marshall Fixman Summer Theory School and the College of Natural Science undergraduate research fund.  We ultimately had over 350 applications over the course of this grant, which is a testament to the strong interest in the program.  The research done by these talented students has already contributed to 19 publications (either published or in press) as well as 16 lectures and posters presented at conferences thus far.  Finally, we are very pleased to report that so far almost 60% of our participants have matriculated in science graduate programs (with more expected as the last cohort graduates).
