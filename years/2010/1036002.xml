<AbstractNarration>1005984&lt;br/&gt;Akay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neural engineering is an emerging discipline which coalesces multiple engineering disciplines including electronic and photonic technologies, computer science, physics, chemistry, mathematics with cellular, molecular, cognitive and behavioral neuroscience to understand the organizational principles and underlying mechanisms of the biology of neural systems and to study the behavior dynamics and complexity of neural systems in nature.  To highlight this emerging discipline, the 5th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering will be held in Cancun, Mexico from April 27 through May 1, 2011. This project will support the travel  of graduate students and postdocs to  this meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this conference is to highlight progress in Neural and Cognitive Engineering, an emerging field bridging molecular, cellular, systems, cognitive and behavioral neuroscience with engineering, physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer science. The neural engineering conference further stimulates neural engineering research and education among neuroscientists, chemists, engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the keynote, plenary, platform and poster sessions at the conference, there will be a panel to focus on the challenges of making a career in the rapidly growing, interdisciplinary fields of neural engineering, from being hired as part of a team and finding exciting new research opportunities, all the way up to becoming a team leader and what to look for when organizing that team and choosing its members. Career options will be discussed for graduate studies and research internationally as well as within the U.S. and for collaboration among researchers and students internationally.</AbstractNarration>

Particular emphasis was place on the challenges of making a career in the rapidly growing,interdisciplinary fields of neural engineering&mdash;from being hired as part of a team and finding exciting new research opportunities, to becoming a team leader and what to look for when organizing that team and choosing its members. Options were discussed for graduate studies and research internationally, as well as within the US, and for collaboration among researchers and students internationally. The forum was organized by Paul Sajda, Colombia University, and Misha Pavel, NSF.  The 4 distinguished forum members were Semahat Demir,NSF, John White, Utah, Ferdinando Mussa-Ivaldi, Northwestern, Jose Principe, UF.  We partially sponsored travel expenses of 10 graduate students from the US Institutes to attend and present their papers at the 5th International IEEE EMBS Neural Engineering Conference. The fellowships were awarded to the prospective students as detailed in the proposal.  Disseminations of the Neural Engineering Activities  The accepted papers were published in the published conference proceedings and distributed to all the attendees. The details of the Neural Engineering activities were posted at http://www.ne2011.embs.org.  The selected papers will also published in the March 2012 issue of special issue of the IEEE TNSRE. We sent the travel award announcements to the women in engineering and science programs, the chairs of Biomedical and Bioengineering departments in the US, and the Deans of the historically m...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
