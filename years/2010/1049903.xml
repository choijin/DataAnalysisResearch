<AbstractNarration>How long have California's Sierra Nevada Mountains been high? This question is one of the most persistent challenges in unraveling the geological history of North America. Many studies argue that the Sierra Nevada reached high elevation by the Late Cretaceous (about 65 to 100 million years ago) and experienced subsequent limited surface elevation increases. An opposing array of studies argue that the Eocene (about 35 to 55 million years ago) Sierra Nevada had low elevation and weak relief and that a post-Eocene pulse of surface uplift linked to the Pliocene delamination of a crustal root led to the modern elevation of the range. These divergent views embody fundamentally different theories of North American tectonic evolution. The primary sources of evidence for the interpretation that the Sierra Nevada have been a region of persistent high topography since the Eocene are stable isotope and leaf-shape paleoaltimetry techniques. However, a series of recent atmospheric dynamics studies challenge these interpretations. These studies show that current frameworks for interpreting proxy records of precipitation isotopic ratios are based on assumptions about the atmosphere that are not generally valid for the Sierra Nevada or that do not take proper account of paleoclimate variation. The goal of this project is to merge the latest methods from geodynamical studies, atmospheric dynamics, and paleoclimate modeling, to substantially improve interpretations of paleoaltimetric data from the Sierra Nevada and thereby advance understanding of the surface elevation history of the range. The project will rigorously evaluate air parcel trajectories around the Sierra Nevada and associated precipitation isotopic and enthalpy distributions for a range of atmospheric conditions. These will be derived from suites of water-isotope enabled atmospheric General Circulation Model simulations of paleoclimate scenarios from the Eocene through the present, and for a range of proposed topographic settings for western North America over that interval. The result will be improved quantitative constraints on the topography of the Sierra Nevada throughout the Cenozoic and in particular on the potential for Late Cenozoic surface uplift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study is a new, interdisciplinary approach to tectonics that leverages modern atmospheric modeling techniques and applies them to one of the most persistent problems in geology, the surface uplift history of the Sierra Nevada. While the approach draws on dynamical meteorology and isotope geochemistry techniques, the results will directly impact our understanding of the geological evolution of North America. A suite of new techniques for interpreting paleoaltimetry proxy records that will be of use in a wide range of settings around the world will be developed. Once proven in the limited context of the Sierra Nevada, these techniques can be applied to other regions and time intervals to better interpret uplift histories and disentangle the mixed elevation/climate signals in paleoclimate records. The results of this study will be of interest to the atmospheric sciences community because it will advance our knowledge of static stability in several paleoclimate scenarios and will elucidate the nonlinear interactions between topography and climate. This study will thus have important implications for both the solid earth and climate change communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most challenging problems in geology is understanding the history of surface uplift of mountain ranges:  when did a mountain range reach its modern elevation?  This is a difficult question because most lines of geological evidence for surface uplift are circumstantial and only indirectly give us an indication of the actual surface elevation of a mountain range.  Stable isotope paleoaltimetry is one of the most promising techniques for unraveling the elevation history of mountain ranges and the basic concept is relatively simple.  It is well established that the stable isotopic composition of modern precipitation from mountain ranges is strongly correlated with surface elevation.  Over the last 20 years, geochemists have been able to identify geological proxy records of past precipitaiton isotopic composition and have used modern or simulated isotope lapse rates (the relationship between elevation and isotopic composition) to estimate the past elevation of mountain ranges.  This approach has been especially controversial in the Sierra Nevada of California.  On the one hand, there are many lines of geophysical evidence that suggest the southern Sierra Nevada underwent a pulse of surface uplift during the Late Cenozoic.  On the other hand, proxy records from the lee (eastern) side of the Sierras have been interpreted to suggest that the Sierras have been more or less at their modern elevation since the early Miocene, if not earlier.  Our study used a variety of climate modeling and diagnostic techniques in an attempt to resolve this controversy.  Our results are clear: the elevation of the Sierra Nevada is so high that air parcels are commonly deflected around the highest terrain, and that, as a result, leeside precipitation isotopic composition does not reflect the highest elevation of the range.  In fact, our results show that during earlier geological periods, the tendency for atmospheric flow to be deflected around the Sierras was even greater than it is today.  We believe that we can finally put to rest this longstanding controversy regarding the uplift history of the Sierra Nevada.  We argue that stable isotope proxy records from the leeside of the Sierras simply cannot record the proposed Late Cenozoic uplift and that the large body of geophysical evidence in support of a late pulse of uplift is likely correct.  We have also extended our results to another setting, the Southern Alps of New Zealand, which have a substantially lower average elevation than the Sierra Nevada.  In this setting, our results suggest that flow deflection is minimal, and that leeside proxy records from this region may in fact reflect the surface uplift history of the range.  This project funded a PhD student at the Unversity of New Mexico in a unique interdisciplinary program that links tectonics with atmospheric sciences, two fields that are traditionally quite separate.  This study shows the importance of such interdisciplinary training to advance the field of tectonics.  While stable isotope paleoaltimetry has potential to substantially advance our understanding of mountain building processes, the specific details of the setting and, in particular, the atmospheric flow properties around the range, must be thoroughly evaluated before making an interpretation of isotopic proxy records.
