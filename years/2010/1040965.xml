<AbstractNarration>Approximately one third of carbon dioxide emissions dissolve in the surface waters of the ocean and increase its acidity (the phenomenon of ocean acidification). Amongst the biological effects of seawater acidification are changes in the growth of phytoplankton, organisms that are the basis for marine food-webs. However, variable effects on phytoplankton growth of increasing carbon dioxide concentration have been reported, including an increase, no effect or a decrease. The objective of this project is to understand the physiological response of marine phytoplankton to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and acidity. This knowledge will make it possible to assess, and eventually predict, future changes in phytoplankton ecology and ocean productivity. The hypothesis to be tested is that the increase in carbon dioxide and the increase in acidity (a decrease in pH) both influence the growth of marine phytoplankton. It is postulated 1) that elevated carbon dioxide levels will lead to a higher photosynthetic efficiency, and 2) that a lower pH of seawater will decrease the energy that phytoplankton must spend to maintain their normal internal pH. Experiments will be carried out to test if differences in photosynthetic and respiratory physiology between phytoplankton species will result in different responses to carbon dioxide concentration and ocean acidity. These hypotheses will be tested in laboratory experiments and complementary field studies, using mass spectrometric techniques and the analysis of molecular markers to trace carbon and oxygen metabolism. Field experiments with natural phytoplankton will be carried out in New Jersey coastal waters, Bermuda, and iron-limited waters off California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project, which addresses an issue of significant concern to society, will provide research experiences for undergraduates and training for graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow. Summer interns from local junior colleges will participate in the project.  A problem-based learning package on climate change and ocean acidification targeting middle and high school students and teachers will be developed. The principal investigators will work with Climate Central, a nonprofit organization that prepares media content for the web, television stations and other outlets that provide information to the public.</AbstractNarration>

This project is concerned with the effects of the ongoing increase in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 and the attendant changes in the chemistry of the surface ocean on the physiology and growth of marine phytoplankton.   A number of previous laboratory studies with model species have obtained variable results concerning the effects of CO2 on the growth of marine phytoplankton with growth rates sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing and sometimes remaining constant as the CO2 concentration increases.  These variable results may be caused by physiological differences among phytoplankton species or by the fact that the many chemical parameters that change simultaneously along with CO2 may have different, and possibly opposite, physiological effects on phytoplankton. Many of the parameters that co-vary with the CO2 concentration are dependent on the pH of the water which decreases as CO2 increases. There are indications that increasing CO2 may increase both photosynthetic rate (which has a positive effect on growth) and respiration rate (which has a negative effect on growth)     We conducted a detailed study of the separate effects of varying the CO2 concentration and the pH on photosynthesis and respiration in a model diatom species (Thalassiosira pseudonana).  These experiments were made possible by manipulations of the chemistry of the growth medium that resulted in independent adjustments of the pH and CO2 and by an experimental method based on oxygen isotopes that quantified simultaneously with high precision the photosynthetic and respiration rates.  The results demonstrate remarkably constant photosynthetic and respiration rates over a range of pH and CO2 conditions that encompass predicted CO2 changes over the next century and beyond. This result obtained even when the light intensity (and thus the energy input to the cell) was decreased from saturating to severely limiting photosynthesis.     While no difference in photosynthesis or respiration rates could be demonstrated over the range of CO2 concentrations and pH of interest, we could measure significant changes both in the gene expression and the biochemistry of the organism. A prime example is the increase observed at low CO2 in the concentration and activity of carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme involved in concentrating CO2 at the site of fixation in the photosynthetic apparatus.  Together these results indicate a remarkably efficient physiological acclimation of our model diatom species to changing CO2 and pH conditions, one whose energetic and material cost is too small to lead to a measurable change in the rates of photosynthesis, respiration and growth.     Because high latitudes are inordinately subject to global change, we extended our studies to psychrophilic (i.e., cold-adapted) phytoplankton species.  These organisms support some of the most productive regions of the oceans and because of a short foodchain some of the most efficient and spectacular ecosystems on Earth: from phytoplankton to krill to seals and whales. This work included both field experiments at Palmer Station in the West Antarctic Peninsula and complementary laboratory experiments with model phytoplankton species.  Those experiments revealed several key biochemical adaptations that allow psychrophilic phytoplankton to grow rapidly at very low ambient temperatures, including high concentrations of key proteins that cannot be adapted to turnover rapidly when temperatures are near freezing.  However, we did not observe a significant effect of increasing CO2 on growth rates despite a clear down regulation of the carbon concentrating mechanism.  This result is best explained by the very low energetic requirement for saturating photosynthetic carbon fixation.  Results obtained in the course of this project are clearly advancing our understanding of the effect of increasing CO2 on the physiology and ecology of marine phytoplankton and primary production.  In addition, our work is elucidating fundamental processes that are at the core of the fields of algal physiology and biological oceanography.  Over the years, several postdoctoral researchers, doctoral students and undergraduate interns worked on this project which provided an excellent platform to further their training and scientific development. Most of these people have obtained good university positions (as faculty members, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students) which allow them to pursue careers in science. These young people are now part of a cadre of young environmental scientists and oceanographers who will develop a molecular understanding of environmental and oceanographic processes.
