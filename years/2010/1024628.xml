<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to advance personalize learning, one of the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges, by creating resources to develop self-directed, life-long learning.  The project is based on research in learning styles, motivation, life-long learning, and self-regulated learning.  The project identifies four characteristics of life-long learners, and seeks to develop these characteristics through on-line learning modules, having students create learning materials, and performing research on the effectiveness of these interventions.  Since life-long learning is an outcome required by most higher education accreditation agencies, development of these resources may be widely adopted, and thus have potentially large impact in higher education.</AbstractNarration>

The learning styles module creates the "first hand experience" by asking students to learn material that is presented in different formats.  The motivation module manipulates goal orientation, task value, and control beliefs in its presentation of new material to learn. The modules save student responses for further analysis.   Early module content was developed with Powerpoint and Visual Basic.  The first full versions of the modules were deployed using Lectora.
