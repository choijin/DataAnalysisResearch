<AbstractNarration>This project is developing curriculum that focuses on hybrid vehicle theory, operation, and service as outlined in the 2008 National Automotive Technical Education Foundation (NATEF) guidelines. The project addresses the need of current and future industry needs for skilled technicians in the emerging area of hybrid vehicles that is of significant importance to the country. The project improves the understanding of hybrid technology by automotive technicians and advances education infrastructure by providing a comprehensive curriculum that is not currently available. Seminars and presentations on hybrid and future power technology from the service side of the vehicle are being developed and presented to educators and students at the Four State Regional Technology conference and other national conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award developed an introductory level course in Hybrid and Electric Vehicle Technologies.   It was the goal of the program to develop a curriculum package that could be disseminated and used in secondary and post secondary automotive programs.  The curriculum includes seven student directed modules, power point presentations, technical learning activities, video resources, worksheets, lab activities and evaluation materials.  The curriculum can be used as a self directed student learning tool or a traditional instructor led program.  There is also a material lists and references for other instructors interested in using the curriculum.  The curriculum will be made available free of charge to any instructor interested in teaching Hybrid Vehicle Technology.  It is our hope that other educators will take what we have developed and add additional material to the curriculum. This will allow the curriculum to continually be updated with new technology.  Then we can make those changes available as well.  The PI's attended classes at Ford and Toyota that introduced new technology in hybrid vehicles.  The PIs attended a week long course in Dayton Ohio at Sinclair Community College. The PI's also attended a two week training seminar provided by Perfect Sky in San Bruno,California.   Additional training was also gained by attending Vision Automotive Training in Kansas City, Kansas.   The significant results of the project were the creation of the hybrid and future power curriculum that can be used to introduce the subject matter to many automotive students across the country.  Extensive knowledge was gained by the PI's that allow them to share with other automotive instructors through seminars and workshops that have been offered at the Four State Regional Technology conference at Pittsburg State University.  In addition,  an online dissemination tool was developed to allow other instructors access to the entire curriculum.  This site will allow them to use the materials, modify them and hopefully enhance the program for others to use.  A list of instructors that are interested in the curriculum was compiled and given access to the completed curriculum package.  An article explaining the project has been written and submitted to Tech Directions Magazine which provides new teaching innovations to educators around the United States.  Tech Directions accepted the article and it is on their list for publication in the Fall of 2014.  There have been several secondary outcomes from the project that have made an immediate impact on our local community as well.  Materials for First Responders training and local independent automotive technicians training were created. To date, we have held four First Responder classes which have included approximately 80% of the local firefighters in our community and outlying areas.     The program developed a basic overview of hybrid, electric, and fuel cell technology and  disseminated this material to other instructors looking for ways to teach hybrid technology. Hopefully others will review the curriculum, use it, possibly modify it, and thus improve it making the updates available to any secondary and post secondary automotive instructor.  The curriculum contains seven modules,  power point presentations, pre-tests, post-tests, final exam, as well as worksheets and video presentations for the material being discussed.The curriculum was developed with 7 modules for student use. Students may work in groups of 2 or 3 working on each module. When the student group begins this component of training, they take a 100 question pretest covering the 7 modules. This pretest is graded for comparison the post test taken upon completion of the 7 modules. The students proceed through the modules in order. They would take a pretest over the module. They would study the student learning/reading activities which consist of written text, and video clips related to the subject matter. Upon completion of this activit...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
