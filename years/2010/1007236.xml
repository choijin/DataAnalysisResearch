<AbstractNarration>The research proposed is concerned with the geometric and topological aspects of infinite discrete groups.   The proposal divides into two main parts: the large scale geometry of groups and the actions of groups on compact manifolds.  Both of these can be viewed as broad generalizations of the celebrated rigidity results of Mostow and Margulis for lattices in Lie groups.  A significant amount of research in geometric group theory is devoted to understanding the large scale geometry of lattices in Lie groups.   In this vein, recent results of Eskin, Fisher, and the PI establish rigidity for certain solvable Lie groups.    The techniques involved are only beginning to be understood, and the PI proposes to develop them further.   In particular the PI hopes to apply these techniques to show the invariance of the solvable radical in more general Lie groups and to the quasi-isometric classification of nilpotent Lie groups.   The second focal point of the proposal is the study of  groups can appear as topological symmetries of compact manifolds.  There has been much work on this problem, but the results almost all apply to specific low dimensional manifolds.  Even for the homeomorphisms of the circle there are many unresolved questions.   The PI proposes studying some classes of higher dimensional manifolds which do have large groups of symmetries on the level of homotopy and to determine whether these symmetries can be realized as groups of homeomorphism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roughly speaking, large scale (or coarse) geometry is the study of geometric properties of objects "seen from far away". From this perspective, any bounded object is indistinguishable from a point, and a line of dots is indistinguishable from a solid line. This sort of geometry has been influential recently in many areas of mathematics, notably group theory, topology, and geometric analysis. This research will extend previous work of the PI exploring the large scale geometry of several classes of mathematical objects, both classical geometric spaces and objects only now being viewed in a geometric manner.  A particular focus of the proposal is the study of the possible coarse geometries of groups of topological symmetries of relative simple objects built out of familiar spaces, like spheres or other surfaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      This award resulted in several papers advancing the state of the art in large scale geometry, specifically on finitely generated groups and symmetric spaces.   Particularly, the papers on quasi-isometric embeddings of higher rank symmetric spaces by the PI with D. Fisher (Indiana) exhibit some unexpect new phenomena that warrant further study ( with several papers/preprints already circulated ).   Our results largely determine when embeddings exists, but in the non-rigid cases it is unknown what the space of embeddings looks like.   The techniques of coarse differentiation that were developed early jointlys with Eskin and Fisher for the study of solvable groups were refined with the goal of applying them more generally to settle a number of open problems around polycyclic groups.   This work is ongoing.  It appears that there are connections with the theory of approximate subgroups which has been important recently in seemingly unrelated number theory questions.   On the question of realizing homotopy actions, significant progress was made, with the conclusion the by passing to finite index subgroups the obstruction can be removed through dimension two.   This is in marked contrast to the purely algebraic variant, where the corresponding statement is false.   These techniques also apply in higher dimensions in the stable homotopy category, but the unstable situation is still unclear.
