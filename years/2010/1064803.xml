<AbstractNarration>The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. James U. Van Dyke to work with Dr. Michael Thompson at the University of Sydney, in Sydney, Australia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanisms of reproductive allocation are the means by which individual animals provision resources to their offspring. These mechanisms may respond to food web disruption and subsequent resource limitation via alterations of either reproductive output, parental survival, or both. Therefore, understanding mechanisms of reproductive allocation is central to understanding population dynamics within the context of global environmental change.  Among amniotes, placentotrophic lizards of the family Scincidae are the only taxa to exhibit intermediacy between complete reliance on yolk (lecithotrophy), and complete reliance on placentation (placentotrophy), for embryonic nutrition. As a result, they have long served as the only available models for studies of evolution of placentation in amniotes. However, only recently has our understanding of the diversity of placental morphology and function progressed to the point that questions regarding the evolution of amniote placentotrophy can be addressed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research makes two major advances to the understanding of amniote placental function and evolution. First, it provides an analysis of how intermediate reliance on both yolk (lecithotrophy) and placenta (placentotrophy) affect reproductive success during periods of food limitation. Second, it utilizes a novel tracer technique to determine which placental tissues are responsible for providing embryonic nutrition in placentotrophic skinks. Together, the results of this project provide novel insights into the placental function of a species that utilizes both lecithotrophy (yolk) and placentotrophy (placenta), which advances understanding of the evolution of placentotrophy from an ancestral lecithotrophic state in vertebrates. By focusing on reproductive responses to food limitation, this research also provides a template for mechanistically predicting population-level responses to global environmental change. Therefore this research directly links studies of placental function with conservation in the face of global environmental change.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The placenta provides nutrition to embryos in many animals that give birth to live young, including humans. Disruption of the placenta is a primary cause of reproductive failure, yet we know surprisingly little about how placentas function or evolve. Contrary to common knowledge, placentas have evolved repeatedly in live-bearing vertebrate animals, including in some reptiles. In fact, complex nutritive placentas have evolved at least six times in lizards (twice in Australia), yet only once in mammals. Placentas also arise from the same tissues in both lizards and mammals: the maternal uterine epithelium, and the membranes that surround (and are produced by) the embryo. This repeated convergent evolution of the placenta in lizards means that lizards are actually a better model for understanding how placentas evolve than are mammals. Thus, while at the University of Sydney, I used Australian placental lizards to test several hypotheses about how placentas evolve and function. First, I manipulated food abundance during pregnancy to determine whether placental lizards could reproduce successfully when food was limited. Although this sounds obvious, many non-placental reptiles stop feeding entirely during reproduction and rely solely on fat stores. They can do this because they provision their offspring with nutrients with yolk before ovulating their eggs. As a result, food restrictions during pregnancy cannot impact offspring developmental success. In contrast, my study showed that placental lizards that ate less during pregnancy produced smaller offspring and had higher rates of developmental failure. These results suggest that high food abundance during pregnancy is critical for the placenta to be a successful mechanism of nutrient provisioning in animals, and might be necessary for allowing the placenta to evolve in animals in general. Furthermore, I found that food-restricted females were more likely to cannibalize their offspring. This is important because an earlier study on fish predicted that maternal cannibalism might be an important way for food-restricted females to &ldquo;gain back&rdquo; nutrients that they had provided to offspring doomed by a lack of food. In theory, these females could then re-allocate those nutrients, either to their own growth, or to future reproductive events. In a way, maternal cannibalism becomes a &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; to allow placental reproduction to not be a complete loss of resources to the mother if food abundance is low and reproduction likely to fail. My study was one of the first to demonstrate that female animals might use cannibalism in this way as predicted in that prior study. In the second study, I showed that the enzyme carbonic anhydrase II is an important mechanism for transporting embryonic carbon dioxide to the mother during development. Carbonic anhydrase II is expressed on the maternal epithelium of the placenta, which allows embryonic CO<sub>2 </sub>to be drawn from embryo to mother across the placenta. Failures in this mechanism would result in hypercapnia (the build-up of CO<sub>2</sub>) and eventual embryonic death. This study is important because it is a fundamental starting point to the evolution of live birth. One of the first challenges live-bearing animals must face is how to provide adequate gas exchange for their developing offspring, which cannot breathe for themselves until after birth. Lastly, I mentored an Australian PhD student in a project that showed that lizard placentas are epitheliochorial and do not invade into maternal tissues, even when embryos develop in the maternal body cavity, outside of the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). This is an interesting result because mammals equipped with epitheliochorial non-invasive placentas are still capable of invading maternal tissues during ectopic pregnancy.
