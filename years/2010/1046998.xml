<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a costeffective&lt;br/&gt;butanol&lt;br/&gt;production and purification process. The specific aim of this project is to scaleup&lt;br/&gt;a butanol production&lt;br/&gt;system from a small, ?laboratory scale? ,2 liter volume, to a 200 liter culture volume in order to&lt;br/&gt;determine the feasibility of its utility for production of practical amounts of the valuable biofuel.&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are that the process should be configurable for fuel&lt;br/&gt;and/or hydrogen production by individuals safely and with negligible environmental impact, and that&lt;br/&gt;demonstration of the feasibility of production of fuels by ?microrefineries?&lt;br/&gt;could foster growth of a&lt;br/&gt;network of ?cottage industries? devoted to local fuel and biochemicals'&lt;br/&gt;production that could provide&lt;br/&gt;increased opportunities for employment in rural areas where carbohydraterich&lt;br/&gt;waste streams are&lt;br/&gt;available. The growth of the dairy products industry in eastern South Dakota has resulted in the&lt;br/&gt;production of copious amounts lactosebearing&lt;br/&gt;whey. Given that cheese plants employ energyintensive&lt;br/&gt;processes and incur significant costs to reduce the biological oxygen demand of waste&lt;br/&gt;streams, it is expected that members of the dairy industry could become enthusiastic customers of&lt;br/&gt;Gaea's butanol production process, provided that this project is able to demonstrate the feasibility of&lt;br/&gt;using their excess lactose for the economical production of fuels that could be used onsite&lt;br/&gt;or sold.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The specific aim of this project is to scale-up a butanol production system that we have developed from a "laboratory scale" (2 liter culture volume) to a 200 liter culture volume in order to demonstrate its utility for production of practical amounts of the "bio-fuel". Analysis of the data gathered from fermentations conducted at the larger scale would facilitate projection of costs of production to evaluate the feasability of profitable large-scale production via our process. Successful scale-up of our process to the 200 liter (50 gallon) volume would yield a prototype of a butanol/hydrogen "micro-refinery" that would generate up to ca. 2 gallons of butanol per day (730 gallons per year) of butanol. It would also demonstrate the potential of our system to prospective customers who may wish to invest in large-scale fermentation plants. The main specific factors we proposed to consider in striving to retain the productivity of the small-scale system are: 1. Culture Vessel Selection 2. Maintenance of Sterility. 3. Temperature Control. In addition to execution of the work outlined above, the goal of which is to sustain levels of solvent production at large scales comparable to those achieved at small scale, we have also analyzed the bacterial biomass generated during the fermentation to determine if it may have economic value and we have investigated the performance of the hydrogen-rich "head-space" gas of our cultures for the generation of electricity via hydrogen fuel cells. We have learned that Clostridium beijerinkii NRRL B50244, and its parent, NRRL B597, produce far more isopropanol than acetone as products secondary to the major fermentation product, n-butanol. Accordingly, we have changed our conditions for analysis by gas chromatography.   Preliminary data indicated that either stainless steel or rigid polyvinyl chloride PVC vessels can serve our purpose. We have tested both material types.  We identified PVC vessels that can be adapted to serve as fermentation vessels and fitted with appropriate ports for temperature and pH probes, gas exchange, sampling, medium delivery, and medium withdrawal.  Their use was contingent on the demonstrated success of ozonation for sterilization.  Sterilization of the vessels and water for growth medium was accomplished by delivery of ozone into closed vessels through a diffuser at a rate of 600 milligrams per hour. A treatment time of 2 minutes per gallon proved adequate to achieve sterility. Concentrated medium salts and sugar solutions were autoclaved. Results obtained thus far are that fermentations conducted in the 20 to 40 liter range can be as productive as those conducted in the 400 ml to 2 liter "laboratory-scale" range. Productivity in a 150 liter vessel has been poor for reasons yet to be determined definitively. We suspect that control of pH in the largest vessel is not adequate nor is its cover tight enough to control gas-exchange rates. Both flaws are being corrected. While such occurs, we are conducting larger-scale fermentations by linking the smaller vessels in parallel as we had earlier proposed to do.
