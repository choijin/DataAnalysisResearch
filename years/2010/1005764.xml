<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports research focusing on the synthesis of materials that possess very unique physical properties resulting from strong correlations between the electrons in the material.  One of these properties is superconductivity.  When a material becomes a superconductor, it loses all of its resistance to the flow of electricity.  How the electrons in a material actually accomplish this amazing feat has been the goal of much experimental and theoretical research.  It is now known that the superconducting state depends on many factors, one of which is the material's structure.  One goal of this project is to elucidate how superconductivity is related to the structure of novel materials, many of which contain carbon or boron.  These elements often form large structural units in their compounds.  This increased structural complexity allows a greater range of optimization in the superconducting properties.  Another goal of the project is to investigate the improvement and discovery of new materials that can be utilized for applications in the emerging field of spintronics (spin-based electronics), which exploits not only the charge on the electron, but also its intrinsic magnetic properties; "spin" and "magnetic moment."  Finding a better material for spintronics applications could revolutionize the computer memory industry.  The results obtained from the experimental studies enabled by this award will be compared to the relevant theories and will aid in our understanding of strongly correlated electron systems in general.  This research could lead to the discovery of new materials that display exotic magnetic or electronic properties.  The research will be integrated into an educational plan, which over a 3-year period is intended to enhance both graduate and undergraduate learning in the laboratory and classroom.  This experimental research will provide post-doctoral associates, graduate, and undergraduate students with valuable experience in the areas of materials synthesis, structural characterization, measurement of physical properties as a function of temperature and magnetic field, and data acquisition and analysis.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports an experimental investigation of the electronic and magnetic ground states in novel intermetallic systems.  The focus of the project will be on intermetallic borides, carbides, and noncentrosymmetric systems.  These strongly correlated electron materials depend sensitively on parameters such as sample stoichiometry, carrier density, temperature, chemical/physical pressure, and magnetic field.  Intermetallic systems exhibit a wide range of ground states ranging from superconductors to Kondo insulators to high temperature ferromagnetism.  Synthesizing and investigating new noncentrosymmetric superconductors, such as Mo(3)Al(2)C, with unconventional pairing symmetries will enable theoretical work to be compared to experimental results.  Chemical doping of Kondo insulators, for example FeSi, into higher-temperature ferromagnets and control over the high-temperature ferromagnetism in the alkaline earth hexaborides could lead to important technological applications in the emerging field of spintronics. The experimental results enabled by this award will aid in our understanding of strongly correlated electron systems in general.  This research could lead to the discovery of new materials that display exotic magnetic or electronic properties.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An experimental investigation of the electronic and magnetic ground states in solid matter was performed.  Emphasis focused on the synthesis and characterization of small band-gap semiconductors, including, a series of compounds related to FeGa3 and the alkaline earth and rare earth hexaborides. The properties of these materials depend upon the collective behavior and interaction of their electrons, so-called strongly correlated electron systems, and depend sensitively on parameters such as sample stoichiometry, carrier density, temperature, chemical/physical pressure, and magnetic field.  Upon doping FeGa3, which means we replace some of the Ga atoms with Ge atoms, we discovered a specail kind of transition, known as a ferromagnetic quantum critical point (FM-QCP).  Here, the magnetic ordering temperature of the Ge-doped FeGa3 can be lowered in temperature to 0 K (absolute zero) at around 5% Ge subsititution.  Further studies showed that an external magnetic field can also play the role of a non-thermal tuning parameter of the quantum critical behavior.  We have synthesized small wires and microfibers of many superconducting materials.  These are materials that lose all of their resistance to the flow of electricity below some temperature called Tc.  In bulk form, NiBi3 is a superconductor that shows evidence of residual magnetism in the sueprconducting state.  Usually magnetism prevents superconductivity from ocurring, so to find them simultaneously in certain materials is particularly interesting.  The wires allowed us to make a very sensitive measurement known as the critical current density, which tells us how much electric current a superconductor can carry before it breaks down.  This is an important parameter for applications involving superconductors. What we found suggests the magnetiic fluctuations in NiBi3 have little effect on its critical current.  Finally, our study of intermetallic compounds with large, complex unit cells and ultra low thermal conductivity has led to the discovery of a new class of spin glass materials.  These are magnetic materials where the spins are disordered.  When the material is cooled down, short external magnetic field pulses aligns some of the spins and locks in their magnetization.  These pulses of magnetization can then be recovered upon warming the sample, thereby acting as an example of read-once memory.  The main element of this research plan was in the preparation of these materials in polycrystalline form, as high quality single crystals, and as thin films.  Materials synthesis and single crystal growth is an area where the United States currently lags behind much of the international community.  Supporting materials research helps train the next generation of scientists and strengthens the country's competitiveness in the global materials landscape, not to mention the fact that all new technologies are deeply rooted in basic materials research.  The synthesis was followed by a characterization of their physical properties, including:  determination of structure and phase purity and the measurement of their electronic, thermal, and magnetic properties.   Postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates are trained and gain experience in multiple techniques of materials synthesis and characterization.  Furthermore, the general public was exposed to our research through public lectures, demonstrations, and visitations to local middle and high schools.  For the last 15 years we have supported undergraduate research in our lab, providing experience and opportunities for non-physics majors.  They are involved in ongoing research projects that often lead to publications.          Last Modified: 04/20/2015       Submitted by: David P Young]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
