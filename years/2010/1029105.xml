<AbstractNarration>1029105&lt;br/&gt;Bralower&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of a high-performance transmitted light microscope for the Micropaleontology Laboratory at The Pennsylvania State University.  PI research focuses on study of calcareous nannofossils assemblages as recorders of past climate and oceanographic conditions.  A state-of-the-art Zeiss microscope with digital image analysis capability will allow for detailed taxonomic study of even the smallest nannofossils.   The microscope will support expansion of student training in methods of marine micropaleontology, a currently shrinking field that remains critical for advances in our understanding of Earth?s climate dynamics and for hydrocarbon exploration.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

The microscope is attached to a monitor for demonstrations and is calibrated for size measurement with a precision of a fraction of a micron.

We are currently using the microscope for studies of ancient nannoplankton assemblages during abrupt climate change intervals and during the recovery phase of mass extinctions, especially after the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary.  Futures studies include the significance of size of modern and recent nannoplankton and the forces driving extinction during the last 10 million years, as well as detailed phylogeny.  The microscope is used to train graduate students in the area of Cretaceous and Cenozoic calcareous nannoplankton biostratigraphy.
