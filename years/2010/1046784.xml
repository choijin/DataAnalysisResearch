<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop ?BunkerGreen?, a drop-in replacement fuel blend for use in medium and low speed marine diesel engines.~ The pending 200-mile EPA Emissions Control Area off U.S./Canada coastlines will require vessels transiting or operating within the area to burn fuels producing less than equivalent 0.1% sulfur fuel emissions. Presently, a potentially hazardous fuel switch from heavy fuel oil to less engine compatible low sulfur diesel fuel is required to achieve EPA requirements.~ ?BunkerGreen? will address fuel switching concerns by enhancing safe operation at sea through increased engine compatibility of low sulfur diesel fuel, using a proprietary blend formulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research will allow vessels to meet the new U.S./Canada emissions requirements without the dangers of switching to a less engine-compatible low sulfur fuel, and to do so with minimal upgrade costs as compared to stack-scrubbing or other mechanical solutions.~ This initially represents approximately 575 million gallons annually.  Other potential markets include current bunker fuel users in heavy transportation, commercial power, and manufacturing market sectors, with an estimated volume of 4.5 billion gallons used annually.  These represent a combined market value of nearly $87.5 billion according to the Energy Information Administration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This National Science Foundation SBIR Phase I Project demonstrated that glycerin in diesel emulsions are suitable replacements for petroleum products in certain applications.  This class of fuel has the ability to improve fuel efficiency, reduce unwanted emissions and displaces oil imports by using renewable and domestically produced glycerin.   Recent EPA environmental legislation limits the amount of unwanted engine emissions from the heavy transportation industries, which includes maritime shipping and locomotive freight.  As a result, these industries are forced to utilize highly processed petroleum products; increasing operating costs.  Subsequently there is a growing demand for alternative, domestic, low-emissions fuels.   Glycerin is a viscous, hydrophilic, and widely available energy source which is made in abundance as a significant by-product of the domestic biodiesel industry.  A family of emulsions was created which forcefully combined glycerin with diesel utilizing commodity surfactants as stabilizing agents to prolong the emulsion shelf-life.  The fuels were prepared by sonication methods in batch quantities and screened for fuel properties and resulting glycerin/diesel interfacial characteristics. Surfactants offering desirable characteristics were monitored for extended shelf-life, documented for some formulations at over 11 months, making them useful as long-haul and distributable fuels.  Emulsions containing between 0-50% by mass of glycerin have been developed and are expected to displace a variety of petroleum products, including #2-#6 diesel fuels which can service the off-road, locomotive and marine fuel markets.   Engine combustion and emissions behavior for these fuel mixtures were characterized in-house and at the Department of EnergyÃ†s Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Results indicate that glycerin in diesel emulsions offers advantages over straight diesel distillates by reducing in-cylinder temperatures; minimizing oxides of nitrogen effluents and increasing engine thermal efficiency.  Fuels tested to date have demonstrated a peak reduction of oxides of nitrogen in grams per kilowatt-hour of 17% and smoke emissions of nearly 50% using the filter smoke test method.  This work also demonstrated that crude glycerin sources can be readily upgraded to meet marine fuel standards and offer acceptable engine performance.  This offers a potential revenue increase for biodiesel producers and can further offset energy costs to end users.
