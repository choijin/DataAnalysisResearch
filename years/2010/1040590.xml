<AbstractNarration>Instrumentation will be developed for working with positronium atoms, molecules, and condensates. Positronium (Ps)is an exotic atom made of an electron bound to its antiparticle the positron. Once completed, the combined laser-cooling and spectroscopy capability, together with a bright pulsed positron source, will form a unique facility for positronium physics. The new laser instruments will enable laser-cooling of Ps atoms to prepare for high precision optical spectroscopy for cooled Ps atoms. The work will be a first step in the ultimate goal of trapping Ps atoms to form a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), which would be the first multi-atom macroscopic state containing antimatter.  The new lasers would also provide Ps 1S-2S measurements at new levels of precision which will encourage further developments in bound state quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory and permit their interpretation in terms of the fundamental constants and upper limits on various exotic interactions. The proposed new instrumentation will be integrated with a new high intensity accelerator-based positron beam at the university. Development of the proposed laser instrumentation will create a unique environment for undergraduate and graduate education and training in positron beam technology, atomic and molecular physics, advanced laser science, and precision metrology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of cooled positronium will pave the way for production of a BEC of anti-matter, and this will be of great scientific interest. The precision Ps spectroscopy will provide unique tests of fundamental atomic theory, such that unexpected results could unambiguously indicate physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics. This work will have a strong educational component for graduate students due to the multiplicity of experimental techniques required and the large number and variety of interesting thesis topics that it will generate. Once completed, the laser and positron facility will form the basis for additional antimatter-based programs directed toward pre-college students, as well as undergraduate and graduate students, providing material for laboratory tours and popular lectures for high school visitors, summer internships for high school teachers and their students, and a center piece for discussions.</AbstractNarration>

Laser-cooling is a way of slowing down atoms by absorbing light: the momentum of the light that is absorbed by the atom can slow down atoms moving toward the light and accelerate atoms that are moving away from the light source. Laser-cooling of atoms has been an important development in the field of atomic, molecular, and optical physics and was instrumental in the slowing and trapping of atoms and in making a Bose-Einstein Condensate which were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 and 2001, respectively. For ordinary atoms, laser-cooling is done slowly. The frequency of the light is shifted continuously over several 100's of nanoseconds to first address only the fastest atoms moving toward the light source to absorb light and then progressively addressing slower atoms so the whole group slows down together. However, the atom of our interest, positronium, is made of an antimatter particle, the positron, and its matter partner, the electron. Because it is unstable to annihilation, the triplet ground state of the atom has a lifetime of only 142 nanoseconds.  As a result, the challenge to laser-cool these atoms is to develop a laser excitation scheme that can cool the atoms efficiently and much faster in under 142 nanoseconds.  The intellectual merit of this work, is that we devised a novel scheme to laser-cool positronium using a train of laser pulses with a special frequency spectrum, and we built a custom laser system to meet these requirements.  Each pulse contains only the spectrum of light which slows down the on-coming atoms&mdash;to do this there must be an extremely sharp frequency cutoff of only 6 GHz. Second, we must minimize the time for excitation/de-excitation cycles by using very short  &lt;100 ps duration pulses with a wait time between pulses of only 3.2 ns corresponding to the minimum set by the spontaneous emission lifetime of the 1S-2P transition which we utilize for the laser-cooling absorption cycles. Finally, to obtain the maximum excitation efficiency per pulse, we use adiabatic rapid passage excitation which then requires the frequency spectrum of the pulse to be chirped over the 100 ps pulse duration. In this limit, all atoms are excited with 100% efficiency as long as the laser intensity exceeds a threshold value.  We built a laser system meeting these requirements. In order to do this, we developed a very high resolution optical component called an optical chirped-pulse stretcher. The stretcher provides the chirp needed for adiabatic rapid passage excitation. The standard stretchers have a optical focal plane in which the spectrum is spread out spatially with a frequency resolution typically &gt;100 GHz. Even when a frequency mask is used for computer-control of the amplitude and phase of the different frequency components, the typical bandwidth being controlled per pixel is over 100 GHz.  Here because our requirement was control of the spectral shape at 6 GHz, our optical focal plane has 6 GHz spectral resolution.  The laser system is ready and will be used in experiments scheduled for Summer of 2014, when it will be tested first to see if the excitation probability is high due to adiabatic rapid passage excitation, and then we will try laser-cooling with up to 16 optical pulses in a train designed to cool approximately 6 GHz on very pulse, i.e., it should cool atoms initially in a +-96 GHz bandwidth toward the line center in a +-6 GHz linewidth, where 6 GHz is the fundamental limit set by the absorption of +-1 photon.  The impact of this work if successful on the atomic spectroscopy community is that we will have demonstrated a new way of laser-cooling atoms which have short lifetimes. This opens up the possibility of cooling and high precision spectroscopy for unstable atoms, for example those containing antimatter or molecules that are chemically unstable.
