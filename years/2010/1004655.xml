<AbstractNarration>The University of Western Kentucky has been granted an NSF award to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site (REU). The unifying environmental theme of this REU site is focused on land use and land cover and its impacts on water in the Upper Green River Watershed, a karst hydrologic system. The research components are all directly related to water quality, contaminant transport, and near surface atmospheric water cycling. REU students will spend 10 weeks during summer at Western Kentucky University working with a faculty mentor from the Department of Biology, Chemistry, or Geography and Geology.  Students will learn in standard field techniques, collect samples and analyze data in the laboratory.  In addition, they will also analyze existing environmental data sets.  Eight undergraduates and four students from the Kentucky Math and Science Academy will participate in this REU site.  The Academy provides advanced academic opportunities for gifted high school juniors and seniors.  Each student will develop a research project linked to the impacts of land use and land cover in the Upper Green River Basin. The Upper Green River supports a great biodiversity of fish, macroinvertebrates and freshwater mussels, many of which exist only in this part of the watershed.  In addition, there are rare and endangered cave-dwelling invertebrate species that have never been fully identified. The change in Land Use/Land Cover in this sensitive ecosystem further complicates these issues, including hydrologic and atmospheric responses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student participants will also be provided opportunities to discuss ethical issues related to collection and use of data, experimental design, professional standards, and the broader impacts that environmental research may have on society.   The broader impacts of this proposal are first addressed by the creative scientific research investigations undertaken by undergraduates with the corresponding promotion of training and learning.  Secondly, the recruitment focus of disadvantaged students from Appalachia clearly broadens the participation of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We provided a uniquely structured REU program with a second summer international research experience.   Eight undergraduates as well as four students from the Kentucky Gatton Math and Science Academy participated in a interdisciplinary faculty research project submitted jointly from the Departments of Chemistry, and Geography and Geology.  The Gatton Academy, which is housed at WKU, provides advanced academic opportunities for gifted high school juniors and seniors throughout Kentucky and has been ranked as the top public high school in the United States for the past two years. Each student developed a research project in collaboration with a faculty mentor linked to environmental issues related to the impacts of land use and land cover in the Upper Green River Basin in western Kentucky.   The student participants had an opportunity to apply their knowledge to a real and current environmental problem.  Virtually all students prepared and presented a research poster at both regional and national conferences during the academic year.  Our goal is to have more than 50% of the participants pursue post-graduate studies and/or pursue careers in an environmentally related profession.   The student participants discussed ethical issues related to collection and use of data, experimental design, professional standards, and the broader impacts that environmental research may have on society.  At least 50% of the students were first-generation college students and/or from rural and disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds in the Appalachia region.   The intellectual merit lies in the project focus on the critically important issues of land  use/land cover and its impacts on water in a karst hydrogeologic,  geomorphic and atmospheric context. The research components of this REU  site were all directly related to water quality, contaminant transport,  and near surface atmospheric water cycling.  There are, to-date, nine peer-reviewed publications with REU student co-authors with several more planned.  Of the 33 students, all but one presented at national or major regional professional meetings with several students presenting multiple times.  The broader impacts of this proposal were addressed by the creative scientific research investigations undertaken by undergraduates with the corresponding promotion of training and learning.  Secondly, the recruitment focus of disadvantaged students from Appalachia clearly broadened the participation of underrepresented groups.   Of the 35 internships in the  program during three years, 33 students were participants with two  repeats.  Of the 33 students, 15 were women.  A total of 12 students  were from the Kentucky Math and Science Gatton Academy, currently the  top-ranked public high school in the United States.  All students from the Gatton Academy graduated and  are currently pursuing undergraduate degrees, all in STEM and/or  environmentally-related degree programs.  One Gatton Academy student is at the  University of Louisville and is a Congressional Junior Fellow.  Of the  21 other undergraduate student interns in the program, 14 are currently in graduate school or  have already graduated with a M.S. degree.  Of these 14 students, 7 are  women.   Several students are still undergraduates.  One is currently  in Medical School and one is in Pharmacy School.   One student intern graduated from Elizabethtown Community College,  transferred to Western Kentucky University and subsequently graduated in 2012 with a  degree in Middle School Science Education.  She currently teaches  science in a rural middle school in Kentucky.  One student graduated with a M.S. in Meteorology from Iowa  State University, and is currently at NOAA.  Another student graduated from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology  and is now a professional geologist at the South Dakota Geological  Survey.
