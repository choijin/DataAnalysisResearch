<AbstractNarration>Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are intended for usage under demanding physical conditions. As a result, their displays face two unique challenges. First, contextual factors, including the viewing angle, ambient lighting, and unwanted shaking of the device, tend to distort the perceived display content. Moreover, the display is known to be among the largest power consumers on a state-of-the-art mobile device. The goal of this project is to provide the algorithmic foundation as well as software and hardware solutions required for addressing these two challenges. As a close collaboration between Rice University and the University of Southern California, the project targets the following scientific contributions. (1) Sensor-based inference of viewing context that efficiently obtains the viewing context from sensors available in modern mobile devices. (2) Compensation for contextual factors that transforms the display content to produce an improved user perception in terms of fidelity and/or usability. (3) Supply voltage scaling and color/image transformations that modify the display data to significantly reduce the power consumption of mobile OLED displays under human perceptual constraints. &lt;br/&gt;By improving the performance and energy efficiency of mobile displays under challenging viewing conditions, this project will extend the reach of mobile computing beyond its current levels, therefore, having a far-reaching socio-economic impact. Through the NSF/FDA Scholar-in-Residence (SIR) program, graduate students working on this project will visit the US FDA and collaborate with FDA researchers to apply research results to medical imaging problems with mobile displays. The multidisciplinary nature of the proposed research will invite new research problems in system architecture and circuit design, human-computer interaction, image processing, and photometry. It will also provide a multidisciplinary platform for undergraduate and graduate education and research.</AbstractNarration>

In the course of this research project, the PI at USC achieved the following results.  Display: Developed an OLED power saving technique  based on dynamic (driving) voltage scaling  of the OLED panel.

Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling in Embedded Systems: Investigated the question of how one can achieve full energy autonomy of a real-time embedded system with an energy harvesting capability (RTES-EH) by applying a global control strategy. The energy harvesting module is comprised of a Photovoltaic (PV) panel for harvesting energy and a supercapacitor for storing any excess energy. The global controller performs optimal operating point tracking for the PV panel, state-of-charge management for the supercapacitor, and energy-harvesting-aware real-time task scheduling with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) in the embedded load device.  Experimental results showed that the proposed global controller lowers the task drop rate in a RTES-EH by up to 60% compared with baseline controller within the same service time.     To summarize, our research has had the following broader impacts:  Improved state-of-the-art with respect to power and thermal modeling, analysis and optimization of mobile device platforms with advanced display technologies. Mobile devices are ubiquitous; battery life is a major concern; our research results improve power efficiency of these devices and hence extend the battery life (between consecutive charging operations).
