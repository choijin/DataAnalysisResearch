<AbstractNarration>1039707&lt;br/&gt;Brady&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grants supports acquisition of an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) equipped with a variable pressure sample cell that enables imaging of uncoated and hydrated samples.   The ESEM will also be equipped with an energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS) that will permit semi-quantitative microchemical analysis.   The ESEM would complement an existing transmission electron microscope (TEM) and laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) in the Center for Microscopy and Imaging (CMI) at Smith College.  Research applications will include: geochemical investigations of porphyroblasts in low grade metamorphic rocks; characterization of the chemistry and structure of boron doped carbon nanotubes and fibers; studies of carbonate diagenesis; biofilm investigations; small mammalian vertebrate taxonomy and functional morphology; petrogenetic investigations of hydrothermal ore deposits; marine microfossil paleontology; and materials studies for the historic preservation of art.  Smith College is the nation?s largest liberal arts college for women and more than 30% of Smith women major in a science.  Smith also has a strong record of recruiting underrepresented students, students from low-income families, and first generation college students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
