<AbstractNarration>The Center for Elementary Mathematics and Science Education at the University of Chicago in partnership with the Batelle Center for Mathematics and Science Education Policy at Ohio State, will conduct a study that examines the factors affecting the implementation, spread and sustainability of innovative high school teaching and learning in Ohio.  Specifically, the project examines the five STEM Platform Schools and their accompanying hubs within a larger Ohio STEM Learning Network (OSLN) project. These schools exemplify innovative practices in STEM teaching, learning, and school governance. Research questions include: (1) the status of implementation plans in each of the five schools as measured against their theory of action; (2) factors that contribute to or inhibit implementation; (3) factors that affect "spread" to other schools; and (4) factors that affect sustainability of the reforms. The study includes both qualitative and quantitative data collection at the school, hub, community, and network levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The Ohio STEM Learning Network (OSLN) study originated at a time when STEM schools were just emerging as a means for providing widespread opportunities for all youth to pursue STEM education and careers. It was the first to answer the question "What exactly is a STEM school?" from the "ground up." The team from Outlier Research &amp; Evaluation at the University of Chicago went to the creators, leaders, teachers and students in OhioÃ†s five STEM "platform" high schools to determine what they considered to be the most essential elements of their STEM schools.   Systematically Describing STEM Schools: Outlier identified a little over 100 STEM school components and then worked with leaders from each school to prioritize them. The team organized the components into a theoretical framework consistent with their earlier work describing and measuring innovation implementation. Outlier created instruments for measuring the presence of these components, thus creating a foundation for the fieldÃ†s ability to clearly describe and measure their impact.  Measuring Factors that Affect STEM School Implementation: The team identified and measured the "factors" (the contexts and conditions) that affect STEM school implementation. The team created instruments for measuring the presence and influence of the factors and found that factors related to the individual (i.e. innovativeness and self-efficacy) were more influential than organizational or environmental factors.  Defining the Components and Role of STEM "Hubs":  Since this study began, several states have established STEM School "networks" and have sought to replicate the "Hub" model in Ohio. When the study began, hubs were not clearly defined. We created a framework that clearly describes their components and the range of roles that hubs can play in supporting STEM school creation and implementation.  Student Perceptions of STEM and Being in a STEM School: The team also collected data directly from students. The team found that students view "STEM" very differently than it is commonly used. For students, there is no "STEM" related to disciplines. Rather, studentsÃ† interest and self-efficacy varies by each of the S, T, E, and M disciplines. Gender also plays a role in that females generally report less interest and self-efficacy. Additionally, students view "STEM" as something unrelated to any discipline. Rather, they view STEM schools as places of community and belonging; and "STEM" as representing an approach to learning and engaging with content and others.  Critical Examination of if "Spread" Happens and How to Measure Spread: Finally, the team examined the role of networks as a means of spreading innovation. The theory of action for spreading change in the OSLN was fundamentally one of networking and the expectation that individuals connected together could leverage one anotherÃ†s work to benefit all. As others have embraced the "network" idea, it was important to look at whether the theory worked in practice; ultimately it fell short of the original aspirational goals.  Broader Impacts: This work has already (and continues) to benefit STEM schools leaders at the state, district and school levels.  In fulfilling its commitment to conducting work in collaboration with practitioners, Outlier has used the findings of this project to support and improve STEM school development across the nation.  Sharing Findings Directly with Schools: First, The project generated a number of interactive data visualization tools. The most widely used has been the "STEM School Infographic" that organized the STEM school components in an explanatory, interactive visual. It illustrates the extent to which components are common across schools, which schools identify this component as essential, and provides links to examples. Many have commented on their use of this resource to inform their own school development and to support their conversations with others about STEM schools.  Wide Rangi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
