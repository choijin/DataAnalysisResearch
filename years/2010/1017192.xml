<AbstractNarration>The widespread demand for high rate multimedia wireless communications has drastically increased the power consumption of wireless networks. However, the advances in battery technology have not kept pace, resulting in a severe mismatch between the energy thirst and battery capacity of mobile units. The major objective of this research is to develop energy-efficient techniques for robust and secure wireless networks through distributed optimization of cross-layer network design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research performs a comprehensive investigation into energy-efficient wireless communications. In wireless networks, the channel conditions of users, at different locations, times, and frequencies are different. The quality of service and network efficiency can be significantly improved if these differences can be exploited. Since all protocol layers impact energy consumption, the investigators will develop cross-layer energy-efficient techniques to reduce redundant message transfers and the associated energy consumption. This research will focus on energy-efficient transmission and resource allocation strategies that are amenable to applications in wireless OFDM and MIMO systems, and emphasize energy efficiency over peak rates. To enhance energy efficiency for wireless networks, novel approaches and techniques based on new performance criteria for integrative network optimization will be investigated.  Key energy considerations for developing cross-layer network media access protocols and resource allocation algorithms will be integrated into the new framework.</AbstractNarration>
