<AbstractNarration>Many computing services are moving to the "cloud" because cloud&lt;br/&gt;computing offers economic and operational benefits. However, cloud&lt;br/&gt;services not only are complex black boxes operated by third parties but&lt;br/&gt;also refuse to give service guarantees. Thus, instead of trying to make&lt;br/&gt;cloud services more trustworthy (that is, giving customers reasons to&lt;br/&gt;place faith in the cloud), this project explicitly removes trust from&lt;br/&gt;the cloud: the project is building systems that give cloud customers&lt;br/&gt;guarantees, even under arbitrary service malfunctions. Two such systems&lt;br/&gt;concern storage and function computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the storage system, the challenge is to use client-side&lt;br/&gt;verification to resist arbitrary or malicious cloud malfunctions (losing&lt;br/&gt;data, returning stale data, corrupting data, compromising data, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;Under the function computation system, a client specifies a computation&lt;br/&gt;to a server, the server executes it and returns the output and auxiliary&lt;br/&gt;information, and the client uses the auxiliary information to&lt;br/&gt;efficiently check whether the output is correct. The approach is to&lt;br/&gt;adapt, and translate into practice, a fascinating body of theory (on&lt;br/&gt;probabilistically checkable and interactive proofs) that is currently&lt;br/&gt;thought to be impractical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With qualitative advances in reliable yet practical computing, this&lt;br/&gt;project will make cloud computing safer for existing customers and spur&lt;br/&gt;the adoption of cloud services. This will mean more people paying less&lt;br/&gt;for computing, producing beneficial effects throughout the computational&lt;br/&gt;ecosystem. The educational thrusts include teaching graduate students to&lt;br/&gt;teach (applying the K-12 student teaching model), graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate mentoring, curriculum development, and outreach to&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ IMPACT AND INTELLECTUAL MERIT This project has addressed a fundamental question in computer security: how can one computer be sure that another one has executed correctly?  This question has broad relevance; applications include securing cloud computing, enabling trustworthy execution even when hardware is manufactured or operated by an untrusted entity, and enhancing confidence in distributed systems. We all want to use third-party computing resources, but we don't want to have to assume that they are computing correctly. On the one hand, computer science theory had long offered solutions to this problem, based on spot checking a long proof of a correct execution.

A principal outcome of this project has been a series of built systems that have challenged this wisdom.
