<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on understanding noisy nonlinear dynamical systems using multidisciplinary approaches from advanced measurement capabilities, modeling, and simulations. The unique features of the problem are interactions between information collection, information fusion and information assimilation. The subtleties of the interaction between these effects will lead to new and novel analytical techniques. The approach is to (1) develop novel data-driven lower-order modeling and multi-scale nonlinear filtering frameworks using probability-based decision-making approaches for state estimation of the power system; (2) develop new algorithms and tools for the distributed collection, sharing, mining and harnessing of data for cooperative health monitoring and vulnerability assessment of power systems in real time; and (3) enhance overall power system dynamic performance and stability through novel data fusion techniques and particle methods which are specifically adapted to the complexities of the underlying dynamical system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The daily operation of interconnected electric power systems must guard against failures due to natural disasters, human attack, and failures due to aging and unexpected conditions. At the heart of this effort is huge data collection, analysis, and control strategies spanning time scales from microseconds to minutes and hours. Through the creation of new techniques this project will advance our understanding of the critical operational issues of the next-generation power system and will lead to smarter power grids to provide better electric energy security, efficiency, and sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this grant we will foster intensive training of engineering undergraduate students, developing their motivation to pursue graduate studies in this multidisciplinary area. The PIs anticipate a direct scientific benefit in training researchers who are well-versed in engineering, modeling, and applied mathematics. The Co-PI and his group have developed Applets designed for education of K-12 students in how power systems operate. An integral part of the final outcome of the proposed work will be to provide the community a predictive tool that will enhance visual understanding of the effect of noise and uncertainty on power system operations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The United States power grid has been classified as one of the most complex human infrastructure systems ever built by man. The grid consists of hundreds of thousands of interconnected nodes (or buses) where power is drawn from and injected into by consumers and generators respectively. A feature of the grid that complicates dynamic analysis are the widely differing time-scales of crucial grid interactions. This essentially implies that the grid is never in an absolute steady state of operation. Hence, there are many areas of concern within the emergent power industry that warrants enhanced dynamical systems analysis techniques, in addition to this, classical analysis techniques which may have presumed a lack of information are quickly becoming outdated due to the influx of information and innovation within the field of sensor technology. A novel measurement device known as a Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) which has the capability to provide high fidelity time synchronized data of key network variables at a high sampling rate is currently becoming a widespread feature of the modern grid. The data provided by PMUs offers the capability for better state and parameter estimation techniques leading to system models of reduced complexity.  The aims of this completed project are the development of methods to unravel complex interactions between noise and nonlinearities and the generation of efficient new algorithms that estimate and present and future state of power system models, based on observations that might be partial, distorted or corrupted. Specifically, while exact determination of the state is impossible under noisy observations, the objective is to obtain probabilistic estimates of the state conditioned on the available information. The work on phasor measurement units (PMUs) provides unique opportunities to utilize data-driven techniques and data analytics to monitor and control the electric infrastructure and make advances in the information infrastructure that is so critical to its operation.  This project provided novel and theoretically sound results, which are efficient in exploring the instabilities and the associated stochastic bifurcation characteristics in the neighborhood of a dynamic instability that contains rapidly oscillating and decaying components.  The analysis of multi-scale systems provided a transparent medium for applying the homogenization procedure. Then the project dealt with the theoretical aspect in the development of reduced-dimension nonlinear filters for multiscale systems. The purpose of this part of the project was to formulate and develop, with mathematical rigor, efficient and robust methods to produce "data enhanced" lower - dimensional models, nonlinear filters in pattern recognition and change detection for the electric power system.  Major project activities and findings include:   1) The completion of a homogenization procedure for high dimensional, multiscale random dynamical systems excited by real noise processes;   2) The completion of the analytical development of a reduced-order particle filtering method for high-dimensional, multiscale random dynamical systems;   3) The application of the particle filtering method to a high-dimensional, multiscale, chaotic system and comparison with existing techniques.  This project also had an educational and academic outreach component. Specifically, two Ph.D students and threee MS students were fully/partially funded by this project. The interaction between Electrical Engineering and  Aerospace Engineering faculty/students broadened the scope of nonlinear systems to include features of the electric power system that exhibit behavior that could be analyzed using rigorous mathematical techniques. This provided a valuable intellectual foundation for studying power system stability and designing new operational practices to improve overall grid reliability.
