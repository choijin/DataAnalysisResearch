<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation is providing partial funding for sponsorship of the Board on Behavioral, Cognitive and Sensory Sciences (BBCSS) at the National Academies of Science. This board, comprised of an impressive range of expertise with outstanding scholars as its members, facilitates the exchange of information and ideas on topical policy issues through meetings and workshops, and explores avenues (e.g. through planning meetings) that may lead to new and important studies. The Board offers high-quality analysis and sound scientific judgment to inform policy decisions and to guide research agendas in the diverse fields that are represented by the Board's mandate. It also brings together government decision makers with the world's most prominent scientists to elicit forward thinking about potentially significant scientific developments and policy issues. It also collaborates with other Boards and Divisions within the National Academies such as the Institute of Medicine and the Division of Earth and Life Sciences. The work of the Board and of its committees is subject to the Academies' high scientific standards for rigor, excellence, and peer review. Sponsorship of BBCSS will also support the retention of experienced staff who can be responsive to requests and opportunities as they arise to enhance the ability of the BBCSS to meet its mission and fulfill its responsibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the Board's work in advancing behavioral science research can be seen in the research agendas of multiple Federal agencies that fund such research. The Board influences public policy in a variety of areas such as national security (helping intelligence analysts with decision-making tools), human capital (contributions to education and learning), and human interactions with technological advances. Importantly, the imprimatur of the National Academies ensures attention to the products and activities of the Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report NSF Grant: 1032051     The Board on Behavioral, Cognitive and Sensory Sciences (BBSCC) was established in 1997 to better equip the National Research Council (NRC) to promote the contribution of these sciences to national policy.  BBCSS is an integrative force for the behavioral, cognitive and sensory sciences; it directly benefits these sciences by (1) involving academic research scientists in the consideration of policy issues; (2) involving the behavioral research community in cross-disciplinary inquiry; (3) providing forums for the exchange of ideas and information; and (4) advancing the behavioral sciences within the National Academies and through the BoardÆs relationships with Congress, and many research and program agencies of the federal government.   BBCSS was created in 1997 to offer the best analysis and judgment of the scientific community to inform decisions on pressing policy issues, and to assist in setting research agendas that are emerging in these scientific fields.  Members have been chosen specifically for their ability to work productively in interdisciplinary settings.  Each member serves a three-year term, which can be renewed once.  Committee members and staff provide intellectual continuity and institutional memory through their knowledge of the sciences and scientists.   During this award period, the Board held its 23rd and 24th biannual meetings. The first meeting was held on October 27-28, 2011 in Washington, DC. Presentations were given by two Board members: Patricia Kuhl (NAS), co-director of the Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences, director of the NSF Science of Learning Center, and professor of speech and hearing sciences at the University of Washington; and Nina Jablonski, Distinguished Professor of anthropology at Pennsylvania State University. Presentations were also given by Lisbeth Nielsen, chief of the Individual Behavioral Processes Branch of the Division of Behavioral and Social Science Research at the National Institute on Aging; Mark Weiss, director of the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences with the National Science Foundation; and Richard Nakamura, director of the Center for Scientific Review at the National Institutes of Health.    The second Board meeting was held on April 12, 2012, also in Washington, DC. A presentation was given by Alice Eagly, BBCSS member, professor of psychology and of management organization, James Padilla Chair of Arts and Sciences, and faculty fellow in the Institute for Policy all at the Northwestern University.

In addition to the biannual Board meetings, BBCSS continued its engagement with the scientific areas of Future Attribute Screening Technology, motivation and aging, and intelligence interrogation. BBCSS held expert meetings that convened Board members and scientists whose research is focused within these areas.     For more information on the work of the Board and the current work of the committees that are subsumed under the Board, please visit our website at http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/bbcss/index.htm.
