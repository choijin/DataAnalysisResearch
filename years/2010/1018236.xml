<AbstractNarration>While the continued scaling of transistor dimensions enables the integration of an increasing number of processing cores on a single chip, the performance of future multicore processors will be limited by power dissipation and peak temperature constraints.  High-performance computing systems will be achievable only through energy-efficient design and energy-aware programming methods. Each core will require dedicated active power and frequency management to make sure that at any given instant it does not waste any energy by operating at a speed higher than what is required by the given task that is executing.  Such management requires the introduction of novel on-chip voltage regulation modules, real-time monitoring of the current usage for each voltage domain, as well as detailed awareness of the extent of parallelism achievable for each running application.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will investigate the design and fabrication of a scalable on-chip infrastructure for message-passing multicore processors that integrates support for efficient inter-core communication with programmable fine-grain control mechanisms to regulate independently the processing speed and power dissipation of each core.  The proposed infrastructure will consist of a heterogeneous network-on-chip (NoC), a set of voltage and frequency control modules that are distributed on the chip, each next to the controlled core, and a new application programming interface (API).  The NoC will be dynamically configured to sustain multiple traffic classes with different quality-of-service requirements.  The fine-grained power management will rely on high-Q on-chip magnetic energy storage through the use of magnetic materials in a CMOS post-process fabrication step combined with high-efficiency Buck converters based on pulse-width modulation with hysteric control for fast response times. The API will expose both the inter-core message-passing communication and the voltage/frequency control of each core to the application software programmers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will allow the PIs to train graduate and undergraduate students in integrated circuit design employing a leading edge CMOS technology and exploiting new magnetic materials as well as in hardware/software co-design of on-chip infrastructures for dynamic power management.  Ongoing industrial interactions with leading information-technology and semiconductor companies promise continual relevance of the project and avenues for dissemination.</AbstractNarration>
