<AbstractNarration>This award funds a new CISE Research Experience for Undergraduates site focused on information assurance and security at Purdue University. Each year, eight undergraduate students will be recruited to work with faculty from Purdue's Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Education (CERIAS). The site plans to target students from institutions without graduate programs who would not normally have access to undergraduate research as well as students from traditionally under-represented groups.  Students will work on a variety of research projects that embody the nature of the socio-technical challenges in information assurance and security including assurable software and architectures, enclave and network security, authentication and privacy, risk management, policies, and trusted social and human interactions.  Students will also participate in a number of professional development activities and a special ethics component. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies with the strong faculty and infrastructure of the CERIAS Center. Students will work with top researchers on projects that are relevant and important.  Information assurance is vital for the protection of the nation?s critical computing and communications infrastructure. Thus the students and faculty working together have the potential to impact the research body in this important area.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups and from institutions with limited research environments. Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of the multi-discipinary REU program in information security at Purdue University were to:  develop undergraduate students' sense of identity as a researcher; expose students in a meaningful way to the research milieu; and introduce undergraduate students to one of the most complex  social challenges we face today, i.e., information assurance and  security.   Over three years, 27 students participated in the Purdue Information Security REU.  An evaluation of the program found statistically significant positive changes in students' ability to:  locate and understand primary research literature; formulate a research problem and hypothesis; design a research study; collect, analyze and interpret data; communicate research results with others.   The evaluation also found statistically significant positive changes in students' willingness to apply to graduate school and perceived ease of applying to graduate school.   Students worked with faculty, graduate students, and technical mentors from the government on a variety of challenging research projects in information security such as:  A security-enabled interface for humanoid robot-to-robot communication, within a HARMS Model Big Data Security and Privacy Random Packet Size Morphing and Direct Target Sampling for VoIP Language Obfuscation Assessing Security of Protected Health Information for Information Systems Schema and Script Based Analysis to Identify Spam Email Attacks Modeling Impact Relationships for Software-as-a-Service Public Cloud Systems        Last Modified: 08/11/2015       Submitted by: Melissa J Dark]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
