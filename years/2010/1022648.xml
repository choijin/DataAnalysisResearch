<AbstractNarration>Spatial evolution, dispersal and interaction of different species of substances could generate complex spatiotemporal patterns.  This project investigates the spatial bistable dynamics and related pattern formation problems occurring in  biological sciences.  Typical interactions between species are of consumer-resource (predator-prey) type, and phenomena caused by bistability and spatial dispersal include  catastrophic shifts in water-limited ecosystems, desertification of grassland with water shortage, success or failure of marine species population restoration, and also autocatalytic chemical reactions with deep biochemistry implications.  Often accompanying the bistable dynamics are the spatiotemporal patterns observed in experiments or in nature, such as the self-organized patchiness of many ecosystems like lakes, grassland, deserts and oceans, or spot, stripe and labyrinths spatial patterns in biochemical reactions with positive feedback.  New mathematical tools in nonlinear elliptic, parabolic partial differential equations, bifurcation theory and infinite dimensional dynamical systems are developed to understand the stationary and evolution problems in the complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Emphasis is on analyzing and undertanding the nonlinear phenomena which cannot be obtained through linearization, and formulating universal natural principles not bounded by specific mathematical models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in this project helps to give scientific explanation to phenomena such as marine species population collapse, catastrophic environment shifts from grassland and forest to desert and arid areas, and global climate changes.  A specific component of the project is to model and simulate the native oyster (or other marine species) population, which provides direct guidance to state and federal government efforts to restore oyster population by reconstructing habitat reefs in several Chesapeake Bay locations.  Theoretical investigation in this project provides specific suggestions to the design of reef construction and larvae release.  Training on qualitative and mathematical analysis and ecological modeling is provided to undergraduate students in  College of William and Mary and other institutes, and graduate students in marine sciences from Virginia Institute of Marine Science, which broadens trainees' background and perspective, and enhances the mathematical science and marine science workforce in the 21st century.  New curriculum material reflecting the cutting-edge knowledge on mathematical biology is developed and available to the academic community from the internet and other publications.</AbstractNarration>
