<AbstractNarration>This study aims to shed light on how interactions across different levels (individual, group and network) affect organizational effectiveness. Drawing on four research streams within the organization sciences -- strategic leadership, group processes, inter-organizational social networks, and competitive dynamics -- it addresses three questions: How do the characteristics of management teams influence the nature and structure of the relationships their organizations form with other organizations and entities? How do these relationships enhance (or constrain) an organization's capabilities for strategic or operational innovations? How does an organization's approach to decision making, strategic planning, and teamwork influence innovation and effectiveness? &lt;br/&gt;The study sample consists of a set of economic development organizations (EDOs) in an economically distressed region of Kentucky. Methods include ethnographic interviews, data gathering from archival sources and web-based surveys, social network analysis and sequence analysis. Findings will contribute to our scientific understanding of organizational effectiveness and innovation. They will also have practical implications for enhancing effectiveness of EDO's in Kentucky. These will be shared with managers and policy makers so as to ensure maximal positive broader impacts from the work.</AbstractNarration>
