<AbstractNarration>The Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) Site at Clemson University engages nine undergraduate students each summer in cutting-edge interfacial science research projects.  The research and program activities part of this REU site are designed to help participants have a positive research and social experience, and to encourage them to pursue graduate studies and research careers. Participants are mentored by faculty from a diverse set of departments (Materials Science and Engineering, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, BioEngineering, Chemistry and Mechanical Engineering) on projects that focus on exploring the role of interfaces and surfaces on system response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All REU students participate in two different workshop series designed to enhance their laboratory experience by focusing on (1) technical skills, specifically, materials characterization techniques and (2) professional skills and knowledge: navigation of scientific literature, laboratory documentation, and career path options. At the end of each summer program, participants will present their research results at a joint poster symposium hosted in conjunction with other Clemson REU programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through this grant, the National Science Foundation brought undergraduate students across the country to Clemson University to conduct research projects focused on understanding the relationship between a material's structure and their properties.  The focus of the twenty-sevent projects offered to students ranged between understanding the mechanical properties of spider silk to the wear properties of polymers used in knee implants.  These students were paired with both a faculty advisor and a graduate student mentor to help participants have a positive research experience and to encourage them to pursue graduate studies and research careers.   All REU participants also leanred about navigating of scientific literature, laboratory documentation, and career path options.  At the end of each summer program, participants will present their research results at a joint poster symposium hosted in conjunction with other Clemson REU programs.  One of the program's goals was to encouraging students to consider research careers and find a graduate program that fits their interests and goals.  After conducting the ten week program, 70% saying that this program made an impact on their future career plans and over 80% of participants said they were likely to pursue a research career in engineering or science. Participants shared their results through conference      presentations, conference proceedings and also journal articles.   They also mentored high school students about STEM opportunities in undergraduate programs.          Last Modified: 11/23/2014       Submitted by: Marian S Kennedy]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
