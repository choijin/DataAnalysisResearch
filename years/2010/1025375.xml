<AbstractNarration>This award supports participants to EAAI-10: The First Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence. EAAI-10 provides a venue for researchers and educators to discuss pedagogical issues and share resources related to teaching artificial intelligence (AI) and using AI in education across a variety of curricular levels (K-12 through postgraduate training), with a natural emphasis on undergraduate and graduate teaching and learning. The symposium will seek and disseminate contributions showing how to more effectively teach AI, as well as how themes from AI may be used to enhance education more broadly. Examples of this kind of broad AI impact include its use to motivate and inspire students in introductory computing courses or as a means for fostering computational thinking. We encourage the sharing of innovative educational approaches that convey or leverage AI and its many subfields, such as robotics, machine learning, natural language, and computer vision.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The first symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence (EAAI) was held on July 13-14, 2010, in conjunction with the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-10). The symposium was established in response to growing community interest in sharing best practices for (1) how to teach Artificial Intelligence and (2) how AI can serve as a motivating problem for teaching concepts in other areas of Computer Science, especially in introductory CS courses. EAAI encourages the sharing of innovative educational approaches that convey or leverage AI and its many subfields, e.g., robotics, machine learning, natural language, computer vision, etc. It followed the successful 2008 Spring Symposium and AI Education Colloquium, providing broader publicity, access, and peer review.   EAAI-10 included an invited talk by Mark Guzdial of Georgia Institute of Technology ("Technology for Teaching the Rest of Us"), 8 paper and presentations, 8 Model AI Assignments, a Teaching and Mentoring Workshop, a Best Educational Video award, and a Robotics Track.  Attendees were overwhelmingly enthusiastic about the broad range of ideas for AI education (ranging from elementary to undergraduate education) and techniques for improved teaching.  Another important outcome was the connection of new teachers to those with more experience, enabling ongoing mentoring relationships.  More information about EAAI (including papers and model AI assignments to download) is available at the symposium website: http://eaai.stanford.edu/2010/  EAAI 2011 will take place on August 9-10, 2011, in San Francisco.
