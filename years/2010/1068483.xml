<AbstractNarration>East Los Angeles College (ELAC) is providing the programmatic, academic and student support necessary to increase the annual number of STEM graduates and transfers by 60 students by the end of five years, which is 64% growth over baseline.  The project improves articulation at both high school to college and two-year to four-year institution levels; implements faculty advisement and counseling, assigns students to faculty mentors who help design efficient educational plans and STEM pathways; expands research and internship opportunities at university laboratories; and exposes students to professional milieus, broadens their vision of career opportunities, and helps them to develop research skills.  In addition, a summer bridge program attracts high school juniors and seniors who have not previously considered STEM careers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given its large Hispanic enrollment, advancing STEM education at ELAC helps to increase Latino STEM graduates and transfers. Increased rates of graduation and transfer enable more educationally disadvantaged Latinos to enter the STEM workforce. With this project, the college's infrastructure is redesigned to focus on opportunities in STEM careers, and to smooth transfer pathways to regional universities. Faculty participation in advising, mentoring and sharing of effective pedagogical methods helps transform ELAC into a STEM transfer gateway institution.  ELAC disseminates information about the project to similar types of institution, shares best practices, and encourages them to adopt procedures to increase STEM transfers and graduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ East Los Angeles College serves more Latino students annually than any other community college in the California Community College System (113 colleges).  ELAC received a five year NSF grant in 2011 with a major goal "to increase the number of STEM graduates and/or transfers." The ASSIST Project (Academic and Student Support to improve STEM Transfers) did see an increase in the number of STEM transfers with more than 840 students transferring during the grant period.  Following is a description of ASSIST?s three major activities and their outcomes.STEM Summer Research and Internships  STEM programs support students  in undergraduate research opportunities and industry internships.  A total of 167 students participated in summer research projects and internships (2016-41; 2015-34; 2014-41; 2013-22; 2012-29). During the grant, ELAC was able to expand its internship site offerings to many prestigious organizations including NASA?s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, UC Berkeley, Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, University of Southern California (USC) STEM Consortium, U.S. Navy, and the UCLA Wireless Health Institute. In 2016, ELAC began the Biotech Leaders Program. Highlights included two students who presented their research at the Gulf Coast Undergraduate Research Symposium hosted at Rice University on October 22, 2016.STEM Summer Academy The STEM Summer Academy is a five-week summer program designed for recent high school graduates who participate in the summer academy before their first semester at ELAC.  The program consists of a mathematics and English review, university field trips, workshops on academic success in college, and science and engineering experiments.  In the Fall, eligible students participate in an accelerated math cohort to become calculus ready in one academic year. More than 90% of students surveyed strongly agreed that doing hands-on activities or projects and/or introductions to the ELAC STEM &ndash;related clubs had a lot of impact on them. Having the program on a college campus and working with science faculty made a lot of difference to 75% and 69% of the students, respectively STEM Counselor STEM students visit the STEM counselor significantly more often than they visit General Counselors. The STEM counselor received "very good" or "Excellent" ratings ranging from 82% to 87. In contrast, ratings for general counselors on the same questions only ranged from 37% to 54%. The college, partially due to the success of this activity in the ASSIST project, is now in the process of institutionalizing the STEM Counselor position. Project Outcomes and NSF Merit Review Criteria The following table presents a quantitative summary of the project objectives, updated as of November 1st, 2016.  The delta value indicates the difference between the target number of students stated in the grant and the actual number of students that met each of the objectives. Proposed Objective (by 2016) As of Fall 2016 Delta to 2016 30 of 180   high school students enrolled in summer academy will successfully graduate or   transfer as STEM majors 14 -16 50 of 200   STEM students engaged in mentoring programs will successfully graduate or   transfer as STEM majors 101 +51 125 of 500   STEM students who meet with a STEM counselor, and create detailed degree   plans will graduate or transfer as STEM majors 214 +89 63 of 125   STEM students who participate in research will successfully graduate or   transfer as STEM majors 76 +13 80 of 160   STEM students will matriculate directly into B.A./B.S. level STEM programs as   a result of robust articulation with universities 214 +134   Lessons learned from ELAC?s ASSIST project can be used as best practices for other community colleges who serve underserved STEM Hispanic/Latino and Asian students.
