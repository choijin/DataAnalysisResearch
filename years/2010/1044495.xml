<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate bursty bulk flows, dipolarization fronts, and energetic particle flux enhancements in Earth's magnetotail plasma sheet during magnetic substorms. Four specific topics will be investigated: &lt;br/&gt;(1) How dipolarization fronts are related to the geomagnetic variations and whether or not magnetic observations on the ground are related to the amplitude of the dipolarization front; (2) How a dipolization front is formed, how it evolves with time, and what controls its amplitude; (3) The role dipolarization fronts play (if any) in the injection of energetic plasma into the near-Earth plasma sheet during substorms; (4) Determine whether or not bursty bulk flows play a role in creating energetic plasma injections or if they are simply the way energetic plasma is transported from the mid-tail to the near-Earth plasma sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will utilize data from the THEMIS satellite spacecraft, ground-based measurements of magnetic field variations, and particle simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will lead to an improved understanding of the physical processes that lead to the injection of energetic particles into the near-Earth plasma sheet and how those energetic particles are transported within the magnetosphere.  Energetic particles play in important role in space weather phenomena.  The work will also lead to improved understanding of plasma phenomena related to magnetic reconnection which is a process of importance not only in Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere but also in the solar wind, in the magnetospheres of other planets and in astrophysical plasmas.  The project will include support for and participation by two graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
