<AbstractNarration>Intellectual  Merit: Endocytosis is the process by which cells engulf portions of the plasma membrane to uptake nutrients and to control membrane composition and surface area. Upon completion of this research, this concept is expected to change by demonstrating that Endocytosis can also lead to changes in cell proliferation by removing key molecules from the cell surface. Specifically, the central hypothesis of this project is that the yeast endocytic protein Ent2 binds the cell division regulator Bem3 and promotes its Endocytosis. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following goals: 1. To determine the intracellular dynamics of fluorescently-tagged Ent2 and Bem3 together and in relation to other endocytic proteins using time-lapse microscopy. 2. To establish the nature of the functional link between Ent2 and other endocytic proteins for Bem3 endocytosis using molecular and genetic techniques. This project is innovative and important because it will contribute to establish novel mechanisms by which endocytosis and cell division are coordinated. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The second equally important objective of this project is to contribute to the education of the public on the topics of Endocytosis, cell regulatory mechanisms and the importance of the baker yeast as model organism. This objective will be fulfilled by pursuing the following goals: 1. To disseminate knowledge relevant to this investigation. 1.1-Development of a webpage entirely dedicated to this project. This hyperlinked page will be devoted to the dissemination of general concepts related to Endocytosis and cell division as well as of the novel results of this project. 1.2- Tours to the lab: Open to students and the public, aimed to learn about the objectives, methods and results of this research area. 2. To integrate research and education. 2.1. New lectures will be developed for undergraduate and graduate courses including findings resulting from this project. 2.2. To educate about the importance of yeast as relevant eukaryotic model. 3. Active recruitment of new students to research, with special emphasis towards underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The long term objective of our research is to understand the mechanisms by which cells control the essential process of division or proliferation.  Intellectual Merit: This specific project aimed to understand how a key player in cell division known as Bem3, is spatially controlled. This molecule has an important role during daughter cell growth in the benign yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but also in the pathogenic Candida albicans.  This study established that the Bem3 molecules, believed to regularly come on and off the cell surface into the cytosol, instead moves from one point to another within the cell (particularly towards the growing daughter cells) by "piggybacking" on small intracellular vesicles.  Moreover, we found that the Bem3 "piggybacking" molecules are not passive passengers, but they actually control the total size, composition and traffic of a subset of vesicles (Figure 1).  Importantly, we found these transport phenomena to be very important for cell division.     Broader Impacts: Our strategies to broadening the impact of our research were:  Knowledge dissemination and integration of research and education:  In addition to published articles in scientific journals and presentations at meetings, we fostered communications by participating graduate and undergraduate students.  We made special emphasis on communicating the purposes, methods and results of our investigations to non-expert audiences.  For example, we organized several visits by high school students to the lab. During these presentations we showcase some cell biology techniques including fluorescent microscopy (which the students enjoy very much); indeed, we encourage the students to take snapshots of cells expressing fluorescently-tagged proteins (Figure 2). As a way of highlighting the success of these visits, I would like to mention that several students requested summer internship to do research in our lab. So far, we accepted and trained 3 high-school students that presented the results of their work in our lab at the Purdue University science and state fairs, collecting several awards.  I developed new lectures for my undergraduate and graduate courses including findings resulting from this project. These lectures also make special emphasis in the importance of yeast as relevant eukaryotic model.     Recruitment and development of human resources:  Lab members are recruited into our lab from different sources:  1. The Dept. of Biological Sciences graduate program.  2. The Purdue University Interdisciplinary Life Science Ph.D. program (PULSe). This is a Campus-wide umbrella graduate program with participating faculty from several departments including Biological Sciences.  3. Undergraduate students are recruited among Biology majors in general (and among students of my own "Eukaryotic Cell Biology" course in particular). Other very important sources of talented students are the Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP) and the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program. Both programs are invaluable for providing undergraduate students with the opportunity of participating in scientific research. However, we also perceive SROP as a source of graduate student candidates and LSAMP of permanent undergraduate research assistant candidates.     Students in our lab receive training on: A) Scientific endeavors: Technical instruction and critical thinking (evaluate experiments/results and hypotheses produced in our and other labs); B) Scientific presentations (poster and oral presentations); C) Teaching skills; D) Scientific writing        Taking into consideration its whole duration, this project involved 4 graduate, 13 undergraduate (4 with stable positions in the lab) and 3 high-school students (summer internships).  In terms of the impact that this project had on students: 3 graduate students are authors in articles published, submitted or in preparation.
