<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a Workshop on Statistical Analysis of Neuroimaging Data for Social and Behavioral Science Research, to be held during September 2011 in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  The workshop will convene a multidisciplinary group of experts in magnetic resonance imaging, statistics, and the social and behavioral sciences to address questions concerning the nature of the analysis of fMRI data and the nature of social and behavioral science questions that reasonably can be answered by fMRI experimentation.  In particular, the workshop will focus on the following issues:  (1) What experimental designs are appropriate and what can or cannot be learned with these designs? and (2) What are "proper" statistical analyses and what statistical methods are inappropriate?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the mid-1990s, neuroimaging has moved from being almost exclusively a clinical science to an experimental tool with widespread application in the social and behavioral sciences.  There is, however, no general agreement on how to analyze data from neuroimaging experiments.  This workshop will facilitate a much needed dialogue on the interplay between neuroimaging techniques, data analysis, and the social and behavioral science questions that can be addressed with these approaches.  Plans for dissemination to the broader research community include a web site for the workshop and a collection of papers in a neuroscience journal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported a two-day workshop in Arlington, VA of a small number  of experts (about 20) to discuss the use of neuroimaging (such as fMRI) in social science research.  The experts came from diverse fields such a MRI physics, statistical analysis of fMRI data, neuroscience, economics, and the nascent field of neuroeconmics. The first three workshop sessions focussed on: functional MRI of the human brain; statistical analysis of the data collected by fMRI experiments; the relation between neuroscience and economics.  The final session was a review and summary of the previous sessions prepared by several of the participants with the idea of elucidating the important points raised during those sessions.  I believe this is the is the first public meeting among the diverse fields to discuss the interrelationships of magnetic resonance physics, statistics, neuroscience, and economics.  There is now a heightened awareness both within the NSF and among the workshop participants of the value of the different components to the new field of neuroeconomics.In particular, without carefully planned data collection of the fMRI images, careful statistical analysis of that data, and a careful experimental design by neuroscientists, it is possible for the social science research within neuroeconomics to produce misleading results.  At the same time it became clear that neuroimaging is producing results that are valuable to the science of econmics.
