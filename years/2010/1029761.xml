<AbstractNarration>The International Society for Computational Biology is awarded a grant to support student and select presenter participation in the annual meeting of the International Society for Computational Biology on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology.  The conference will be held in Boston, Massachusetts, July 9-13, 2010.  The conference will hold thematic sessions for invited presentations, tutorial programs on related subjects, and special interest group workshops. Biological areas presented at the conference will include molecular structure, genomics, molecular sequence analysis, evolution and phylogenetics, molecular interactions, metabolic pathways, regulatory networks, developmental control, molecular biology generally and human health. Results will be disseminated as published proceedints indext in MEDLINE and Current Contents, and video recordings of selected presentations will be available online at http://www.iscb.org/ismb2010.</AbstractNarration>

The skills developed through participation in the SCS, for both organizers and attendees/presenters, will serve each of them well in preparing for a long and successful scientific career that inevitably includes attending and organizing conferences.  Over the years, bioinformatics and computational biology have become essential tools for understanding biology. The widespread acceptance of these tools has been largely driven b...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
