<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to fundamentally advance our understanding of super-resolving electrically small antenna arrays using biomimetic design concepts. The approach is to use the analogies between acoustical and electromagnetic systems and develop miniaturized antenna arrays that mimic the hyperacute sense of directional hearing observed in certain small vertebrates and insect species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project seeks to address a fundamental challenge in the area of electrically small antennas using a previously unexplored approach. This work is expected to introduce super-resolving capabilities that have not been achieved from conventional small antenna arrays. These capabilities can bring a whole new level of functionality to small wireless systems and enable applications that are not currently feasible.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project is expected to have a significantly positive impact on society and economy by revolutionizing how we address challenges in areas such as microwave medical imaging, wireless networks, radar systems, sensors, radio-frequency identification, and radio-frequency devices for assisting the disabled and visually impaired. Educational goals of this work are intimately linked to research goals and include facilitation of engineering-oriented professional development of middle-school and high-school science teachers, integration of research activities into the teaching of science and engineering at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels, involvement of under-represented students in research, and development and broad dissemination of research-based educational materials. Indirectly, these educational activities are expected to have a positive impact on increasing the number of female students who pursue engineering and minority students who pursue graduate studies in electrical engineering.</AbstractNarration>
