<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through its first NSF ATE $2.9 million grant and no-cost extension, the Southeast Maritime and Transportation (SMART) Center has taken a leadership role as a convener and catalyst for effectively connecting industry employers and educators to produce more highly skilled, credentialed technicians for the maritime and transportation industry. The SMART Center has achieved significant results toward its three initial goals:<strong> <br /></strong></p> <p class="ParagraphText"><strong>Goal 1: Increasing Career Awareness</strong></p> <p class="ParagraphText">The SMART Center made significant strides in developing greater national awareness among educators, students, veterans, women, and underserved populations of the stable, well-paying STEM-based careers in the maritime and transportation industry. The Center created the immersive SMART Maritime &amp; Transportation Institute model of professional development which engaged more than 250 secondary and post-secondary educators, administrators, guidance and career coaches, as well as industry leaders, who participated in a total of 13 Institutes in three locations (Virginia, Texas, Maryland) over five years. Those participants impacted more than 24,000 students from 16 states, and more than 1,200 students reported enrolling in a maritime program as a result. SMART Institute alumni developed more than 32 academic programs and modified curriculum in 39 high schools and community colleges across the southeast.</p> <p class="ParagraphText">The Center&rsquo;s nationally-recognized &ldquo;Make the SMART Choice&rdquo; career awareness video series were viewed by more than 5,000 people through the Center&rsquo;s website and YouTube channel, shared with students and educators at more than 30 career fairs and 50 national conferences, and directly disseminated to over 1500 &nbsp;students, educators, career coaches and guidance counselors through DVDs.</p> <p class="ParagraphText">More than 13,000 unique visitors have used the <a href="http://www.maritime-technology.org">www.maritime-technology.org</a> website, and more than 60% of SMART Institute alumni report using the website to educate students about maritime and transportation career pathways.</p> <p class="ParagraphText"><strong>Goal 2: Create Effective Career Pathways</strong></p> <p class="ParagraphText">The SMART Center&rsquo;s Maritime Technologies Consortium of 40+ leading industry employers and secondary and post-secondary educators aligned workforce needs and educational pathway formation. In collaboration with the Consortium, seven focus group meetings, and one DACUM (Developing a Curriculum) session, the SMART Center developed four Career Studies Certificates in maritime technologies, marine electrical, marine mechanical, and maritime welding. Students can &ldquo;stack&rdquo; those certificates toward a SMART-developed A.A.S. degree in Maritime Technologies at host institution Tidewater Community College (TCC). The SMART Maritime Technologies pathway is based on the registered apprenticeship model of workforce development and provides academic credit for apprentices&rsquo; required instruction. The 2+2+2 pathway begins with high school students earning college credit for dual enrollment courses, continuing through community college certificates and an A.A.S. degree with industry credentials, and articulates to several four-year college programs.</p> <p class="ParagraphText">The SMART Maritime Technologies pathway produced a 59% increase in maritime-related enrollments (from 502 to 802) at TCC and a 127% increase (from 22 to 50) in high school dual enrollment rates. The first SMART Center recipient of the A.A.S. degree in Maritime Technologies was recognized with a place on the DOT Website&rsquo;s &ldquo;Women in Transportation History Timeline.&rdquo;</p> <p class="ParagraphText">The SMART Center collaborated with five community colleges and industry giant Huntington Ingalls Industries to develop the award-winning Maritime Trades Training Program which provides a fast-track pathway into the industry for critically-needed skilled trade positions including electricians, welders, and painters through short-term, portable-lab course delivery. SMART-certified instructors educated more than 363 technicians through the program, 93% of whom went on to immediate employment. In addition the SMART Center created three crosswalks from workforce training or industry credentials to academic credit in maritime technical programs, helping more current industry technicians begin or continue to earn industry-valued academic credentials.&nbsp;</p> <p class="ParagraphText"><strong>Goal 3: Model Effective Industry-Educator Partnerships</strong></p> <p class="ParagraphText">The SMART Center created a new synchronously-delivered hybrid course using a hands-on trainer to address the complex need for worker education in marine programmable logic controllers. More than 20 technicians completed the customized course, receiving both academic credit and industry certifications. Industry employers have requested replication and expansion of this model program in the Southeast and West Coast to meet the complex and changing industry workforce needs. In addition,<strong> </strong>collaborating with ATE Center Weld-Ed, the SMART Center provided hybrid (online and in-person lab) instruction and American Welding Society (AWS) credentialing for 43 secondary and college welding instructors who impact more than 6,000 students.</p> <p class="ParagraphText">As a result of the development and demonstrated impact of the SMART Maritime Technologies partnerships and pathway, PI Murray was invited to serve on a joint federal agency panel with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to modify the DOL&rsquo;s TDL competency model. Inclusion of maritime transportation in this new tier, as well as recognition of The SMART Center for its role on the DOL&rsquo;s CareerOneStop Website, represents enormous reach for the Center and will impact all industry employers (through hiring requirements) and educators (through educational pathway formation).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/18/2016<br>      Modified by: Barbara&nbsp;R&nbsp;Murray</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003068/1003068_10034024_1471467682421_OutcomesReport-Institutes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003068/1003068_10034024_1471467682421_OutcomesReport-Institutes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SMART Center Institutes"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003068/1003068_10034024_1471467682421_OutcomesReport-Institutes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SMART Center Institutes"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SMART Center Institutes produced secondary and college level educators, career coaches, guidance counselors and industry employees prepared to educate students about the maritime and transportation industry and educational pathways; alumni went on to create new modules, curriculum and programs.</div> <div class="imageCredit">NSF SMART Center/Anne Wernikoff</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Barbara&nbsp;R&nbsp;Murray</div> <div class="imageTitle">SMART Center Institutes</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003068/1003068_10034024_1471467818579_OutcomesReport-CareerAwarenessTools--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003068/1003068_10034024_1471467818579_OutcomesReport-CareerAwarenessTools--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SMART Center Career Awareness Materials"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1003068/1003068_10034024_1471467818579_OutcomesReport-CareerAwarenessTools--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SMART Center Career Awareness Materials"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The SMART Center has been recognized nationally for its suite of tools to educate students, veterans, underserved populations and career switching workers about the maritime and transportation industry.
