<AbstractNarration>"Bridging STEM to STE(A)M: Developing New Frameworks for ART/SCIENCE Pedagogy", hosted by the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) will be a two-day workshop aimed to develop an innovative educational agenda that forges relationships between art and design disciplines and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The workshop will bring together leading scientists, IT experts and creative technologists, artists, designers, and education researchers to initiate discussions about how to bridge STEM education practices and creative problem-solving.  As this innovative educational approach holds the potential to open new areas of exploration, and provide a platform and network for the further development of STEM to STE(A)M pedagogy. The long-term goals of this initiative are to: (1) Develop strategies for enhancing STEM education through the integration of art and design thinking (STEM + ART = STE(A)M); (2) Invent and share techniques that take advantage of simple, freely available IT systems and applications to support enhanced observation, analysis and understanding of pictorial and numerical data; (3) Build new connections between art and design disciplines and scientific fields to advance understanding of complex systems, e.g., through improved strategies and techniques for the shared perception and visualization of scientific data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methods and practices that promote shared ideas, insight, and language have the potential to alter STEM education and research practices in formal and informal settings. The diverse mix of disciplines and approaches represented at the workshop will give participants access to shared processes of inquiry into art/science pedagogy with the goal of achieving a high level of comprehensibility and knowledge sharing, broadening the accessibility and appeal of science, and transforming the discourse on STEM discovery and learning. As art thinking influences scientific thinking and vice versa, there is great potential for increased public understanding of science and scientific challenges. Workshop discussions will inform the creation of educational materials that exemplify interdisciplinary couplings between the arts and sciences. To begin to explore this potential, the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) will develop prototype STE(A)M classes for high school students through a Pre-College summer program offered through RISD's Continuing Education division. In addition, in connection with the workshop, a new graduate-level course will be developed at RISD to prepare future artists and arts educators to lead successful arts/design/science collaborations. The broader intention of these prototype courses is to provide tangible examples that can prompt parallel developments at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

The two-day workshop brought together 60 leaders from the fields of science, information technology, engineering, art and design, mathematics, and education research to strategize about innovative ways for these fields to interact and develop new teaching approaches to creative problem solving.

An installation in London called The Breathing City, sponsored by the Royal Society of Science, showed links between data visualization in complex systems and public engagement with science as presented by Holger Zschenderlein.  Intellectual Merit:  The goal of the workshop was to develop strategies to enhance Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education by integrating art and design&mdash;thereby transforming STEM into STEAM and promoting intellectual and creative possibilities in the process. Among the key points emerging from the workshop was the idea that the STEAM agenda should embrace exploration, experimentation, and problem-solving. The goal should not be to simply add Art to existing STEM education. Rather the goal should be to think about fundamental changes in education that encourage the creative spirit of art and design disciplines.  A number of strategies and recommendations emerged from the workshop for STEAM learning, research and collaboration.  Studies of Existing Art/Science Collaborations. To support the development of new frameworks for Art/Science pedagogies, educators need to develop a greater understanding into the processes of how we learn, identify the gaps in knowledge, and explore ways to bring together arts and science pathways in education.  One proposal is a study of successful learning models for best practices in effective STEM/STEAM education and collaborations, in either academic or industry settings.  Pedagogical Innovations. New ways of teaching and learning can come from encouraging and facilitating unorthodox methods and strategies. It also means pushing institutions forward on STEAM education, especially in finding ways for art and science to intersect.  Creating Spaces for Transdisciplinary Work. Interdisciplinary research and collaboration of the arts and sciences can be further facilitated through the creation of physical, inclusive spaces where artists and scientists can come together to experiment, explore, and develop insights.  Dialogue Between The Arts and Sciences. Finding ways and means for continuing the dialogue between Art / Design and STEM and inquiry into the myriad of ways they can interact should be a priority. Ongoing dialogue will assist those from different disciplines in exploring issues and opportunities related to bridging STEM to STEAM, engaging in spaces that foster ideas about what might be STEAM, and to find ways to bring art, design and scientific communities together and make them stronger. Equally important is fostering diplomacy between the disciplines to facilitate a deeper understanding of learnings from different disciplines and to find a common language.  Broader Impact:  Public Engagement. RISD has taken an active role in engaging the world in conversations about the concept of STEM + Art = STEAM, and the role the Arts can play in making science more visible and humanizing technology. This workshop and other, related public engagement activities have helped move the STEAM idea into the mainstream, and support a greater understanding of basic principles of STEAM...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
