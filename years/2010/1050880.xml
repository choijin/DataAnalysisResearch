<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Professors Zheng Ouyang and R. Graham Cooks of Purdue University are hosting a US - China Workshop on analytical chemistry graduate research and education.  The workshop will take place at Purdue in West Lafayette, IN, on October 6-7, 2010.  US academic analytical chemists will meet Chinese counterparts to exchange information and develop plans for effective research collaboration and improved graduate and undergraduate instruction.  Interests common to the two groups will be identified and infrastructure for instrumentation development and analysis services will be discussed.  NSF support will ensure participation by a diverse cross-section of junior US faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate aim of this project is to enhance research progress in technical areas related to measurement science, by identifying technical synergies between the research capabilities in the two countries.  It will also provide a mechanism to identify and share best practices in analytical chemistry education.</AbstractNarration>
