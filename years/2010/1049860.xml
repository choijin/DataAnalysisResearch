<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Francisco Raymo of the University of Miami, for the synthesis and characterization of a novel class of switchable organic fluorophores based on the [1,3]oxazine skeleton.  The goal of this work is to use the fluorophores for the visualization of biological samples with nanoscale resolution on the basis of single-molecule fluorescence imaging. The molecules will be designed to interconvert continuously between fluorescent and nonemissive states, blinking at the single-molecule level allowing temporal resolution within the same subdiffraction volume. The work provides the ability to record super-resolution images of biological preparations with commercial fluorescence microscopes and conventional optics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research include the potential impact on subdiffraction microscopy and extension of these techniques to image biological substrates on the nanometer scale.  The Raymo laboratory will take advantage of the large pool of students available from underepresented groups from the local Miami metropolitan area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: We developed a new family of fluorophores specifically designed to enable the acquisition of fluorescence images with spatial resolution at the nanometer level.  Our compounds switch reversibly from a nonemissive form to a fluorescent state, under illumination at an appropriate activation wavelength.  Their reversible structural transformations translate into fluorescence blinking at the single-molecule level and, therefore, offer the opportunity to distinguish closely-spaced molecules at different intervals of times.  In turn, the sequential localization of multiple fluorescent labels, co-localized within the same subdiffraction volume, permits the gradual reconstruction of images with nanoscaled precision.  Indeed, we have been able to visualize polymer nanoparticles, doped with our switchable probes, in the interior of fixed cells as well as the tubulin structure of cells, immunolabeled with our photoresponsive compounds, with a spatial resolution that is, otherwise, impossible to achieve with conventional fluorophores.  Broader Impact: Our research activities provided viable synthetic strategies to construct switchable fluorophores and elucidated the structural factors regulating the photochemical and photophysical properties of these innovative molecular switches.  These investigations at the interface of chemical synthesis and spectroscopic analysis ultimately identified an valuable mechanism to overcome diffraction and record fluorescence images of biological samples with resolution at the nanometer level.  Thus, our research program can have an immediate impact on its field of study, by encouraging the design of fluorescent probes with similar structural design and spectroscopic response, as well as profound implications in biology and medicine.  Indeed, analytical tools for the investigation of cell processes and substructures at the molecular level can evolve from these fundamental studies in the realm of molecular switches.  The proposed activities contributed to the training of 2 postdoctoral associates, 7 graduate students (1 Hispanic, 2 Women) and 8 undergraduate students (1 African American, 2 Hispanic, 3 Women) in chemical synthesis, spectroscopic analysis and fluorescence imaging.  In addition, 7 high-school students (1 African American, 5 Hispanic, 3 Women) participated actively in the development of this research program and were exposed to its interdisciplinary laboratory environment.
