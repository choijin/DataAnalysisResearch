<AbstractNarration>NSF is providing partial financial support for a Student Research Workshop &lt;br/&gt;at the AMTA-2010 conference in Denver, Colorado. The Association for Machine &lt;br/&gt;Translation in the Americas (AMTA) is a non-profit professional organization &lt;br/&gt;in the area of Machine Translation (MT) in the US and the American continent. &lt;br/&gt;The main mission of AMTA is to facilitate and promote the exchange of &lt;br/&gt;knowledge and information between the communities of researchers, developers &lt;br/&gt;and users of Machine Translation and related translation technologies. In its &lt;br/&gt;effort to foster the professional growth of the next generation of MT &lt;br/&gt;researchers, AMTA-2010 is featuring a Student Research Workshop, embedded &lt;br/&gt;as an integral part of the research program at the conference. Students at &lt;br/&gt;all levels of study (undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate) are invited to &lt;br/&gt;submit papers describing their research work. NSF is providing funding to &lt;br/&gt;subsidize travel, conference and accommodation expenses for up to 10 students &lt;br/&gt;that have been selected to present their research work at the workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AMTA-2010 Student Research Workshop will greatly facilitate professional &lt;br/&gt;growth for the brightest young researchers in the field of MT, in the early &lt;br/&gt;stages of their professional career. The workshop will contribute to the &lt;br/&gt;professional development of a skilled and diverse workforce in the area of &lt;br/&gt;Machine Translation and computational processing of natural language. MT and &lt;br/&gt;other language processing applications are becoming vital technologies in the &lt;br/&gt;global information age. Strength in these areas is crucial to American &lt;br/&gt;competitiveness in the global economy of the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>
