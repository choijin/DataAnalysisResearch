<AbstractNarration>The 7.0 Earthquake in Haiti has mobilized the entire world to support&lt;br/&gt;the relief effort, especially through novel uses of the cyberspace.  &lt;br/&gt;Even though the earthquake damaged much of the communication &lt;br/&gt;infrastructure in Haiti, Haiti's Internet connectivity is robust &lt;br/&gt;because most Haitian Internet Service Providers use satellite, rather&lt;br/&gt;than the damaged undersea fiber optic cable link, to connect to the &lt;br/&gt;Internet. Consequently, relief workers, regular citizens, and &lt;br/&gt;non-governmental organizations (NGO's) have used Tweets extensively &lt;br/&gt;to spread and share information about the needs, events, and relief &lt;br/&gt;operations.  However, these tweets are not easily aggregated into &lt;br/&gt;meaningful topics for ease of delivery to people who critically need &lt;br/&gt;the information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research project is to develop and &lt;br/&gt;deploy, in collaboration with an NGO coordination body (NetHope), &lt;br/&gt;a reusable text message-based infrastructure that classifies and &lt;br/&gt;aggregates multi-lingual tweets and text messages about Haiti &lt;br/&gt;relief operations by topics and regions so that they can be easily &lt;br/&gt;subscribed by NGO's, survivors in Haiti, and their friends and &lt;br/&gt;families. The research project leverages existing software &lt;br/&gt;developed for entity extraction and topic classification so that the &lt;br/&gt;system can be developed and deployed quickly to respond to the time &lt;br/&gt;critical needs at Haiti.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation of the system includes&lt;br/&gt;feedbacks from NetHope as well as quantitative metrics about the&lt;br/&gt;usage and performance of the system.  The intellectual merit of the &lt;br/&gt;research is developing integrated engineering solution to automatic &lt;br/&gt;identification of topics and geo-location from short-messages &lt;br/&gt;utilizing contextual information, which lays important foundation &lt;br/&gt;for designing the next-generation information infrastructure for &lt;br/&gt;emergency response and disaster management.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tweets and short text messages have been generated in large volume during extreme events such as the Haiti earthquake and the Fukishima nuclear disaster.  While many of these short text messages contain useful information for assessing damages and identifying needs of survivors, they are not well-organized to allow critical information to be easily aggregated so that they can be acted upon by relief workers in a timely and effective way.  Even though text documents such as scholarship publications and news articles have been successfully classified by computers, tweets and short text messages remain difficult for computers to classify automatically because they contain much less words.  To solve this problem, this RAPID project uses a novel method to classify short text messages about Haiti earthquake (collected by Ushahidi http://haiti.ushahidi.com) into categories meaningful for relief workers.  A key novelty of the method is that it clusters words based on the similarity of the frequency of their occurrences in different categories.  This method is shown to perform better than other existing methods.   The second contribution of this RAPID research is the identification of organizational barriers for NGOÆs to adopt microblogging as trustworthy information for disaster relief, and a proposed social-technical solution for addressing such barriers.  These results can contribute to policy changes that facilitate information sharing and coordination among NGOÆs by better leveraging the information in tweets in short text messages.  The RAPID project also provided a unique interdisciplinary education and training experience for a diversified group of undergraduate students, graduate students, and post doc, working with six faculty mentors.  A cloud-based infrastructure for large-scale streamline processing of text messages during extreme events has been developed.  Further information and publications of RAPID project can be found at http://emerse.ist.psu.edu.  The web site also displays tweets streamed from several NGOÆs and the results of classifying them in real-time using the novel tweet classification method mentioned above.   The software that implements this method for classifying tweets is publically available for download in SourceForge.net under the name "Abstraction-based short text classification".
