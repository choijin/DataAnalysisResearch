<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to seek and establish the relationship between the chemical and mechanical properties of asphalt binder and its inherent ability to reverse micro-cracks and self-heal.  This will be achieved by advancing, verifying and integrating the theories of contact mechanics that describe crack wetting, and theories of adhesion and inter-diffusion that describe strength gain.  Novel experimental tools that allow measurement of crack opening and closing in real time at the nanometer scale will be fabricated and used in this research.  The educational component of this award will develop an e-learning module that will use simple, short examples and case studies to expose, educate, and inspire undergraduate students to investigate and understand the link between the macroscopic behavior of fundamental chemical and mechanical properties of materials used in civil engineering applications to their macroscopic behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental tools and theoretical findings from this research will advance the understanding of micro-crack growth and self-healing in viscoelastic materials such as polymers and asphalt binders that are used to construct pavements.  Billions of taxpayer dollars are spent annually to expand and maintain our pavement infrastructure.  The findings from this research will also provide much needed fundamental knowledge to design asphalt binders and mixtures with superior self-healing characteristics and mechanical properties.  The use of these engineered binders will significantly improve the serviceable life of pavements and ultimately reduce consumption of non-renewable natural resources such as crude oil and crushed mineral aggregates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this research was to seek and establish the relationship between the chemical composition, microstructure, and mechanical behavior (rheology, resistance to crack growth and ability to self-heal) of asphalt binders. This knowledge is critical for designing and engineering high performance asphalt binders, which are a critical and expensive cornerstone for our vital roadway infrastructure.  A multi-disciplinary approach combining analytical and experimental methods from different fields of science and engineering was used to accomplish the goals of this project.   At a micrometer length scale, a combination of different microscopic methods was used to investigate the influence of chemical composition on the microstructure of the binder on its surface, and perhaps for the first time in its bulk. The evolution of these structures as a function of the binders? chemical composition was also modeled using techniques that were originally developed for metals and polymers at these length scales. The influence of the size and distribution of these microstructural features on crack resistance was also theoretically modeled and experimentally verified, thus creating models that are capable of connecting the chemical composition to the microstructure and engineering properties.  At a higher length scale, it was determined that when binders are subjected to a stress state similar to that in real asphalt mixes, cavitation is the primary form of crack nucleation (and subsequent healing).  An approach to measure and model the cracking and healing characteristics of the binder in a composite was also created and verified. This approach can be extended to time dependent materials other than asphalt binders as well.   This study confirmed that oxidative aging in binders increased the concentration of certain polar fractions, but more importantly, it revealed that such changes are also accompanied with a favorable change in microstructure and increased tensile strength in many cases.  The findings from this study have led to the framework for an Asphalt Genome research initiative that involves several partner universities to create a global database of chemical compositions of a variety of different binders.  This knowledge can be used to engineer additives, modifiers, and asphalt binders with desired characteristics.  It will also promote the recycling of binders.   Finally, this research resulted in the development of a virtual laboratory to facilitate learning about the behavior of asphalt binders.  The virtual laboratory is available and is being used by instructors in other universities, as well as engineering practitioners.  The ability to scale and apply this virtual laboratory concept to other areas of this discipline is being explored.         Last Modified: 11/22/2017       Submitted by: Amit Bhasin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
