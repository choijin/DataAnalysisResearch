<AbstractNarration>The goal of the S-STEM scholarship program at Truman State University is to increase the number of academically talented students who successfully complete a STEM baccalaureate degree and to increase the diversity of the STEM student body at Truman. The project supports talented students with demonstrated financial need who are majoring in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics or related interdisciplinary programs. Scholarships and student support services are provided during the freshman and sophomore years, when evidence shows that Truman State students are most vulnerable to leaving STEM majors. The objectives of the project are: 1) to increase the freshman to junior year retention rate for students in the target disciplines; 2) to increase the percentage of freshman Biology, Chemistry, and Physics majors who are minority students; 3) to engage first and second year students in the target disciplines in interdisciplinary thinking and reasoning; 4) to connect project participants to critical student support services. Through special seminar courses and cohort meetings, scholarship recipients engage in a range of activities with an interdisciplinary theme designed to promote a sense of community and develop a support network to help them persist in their STEM major.</AbstractNarration>

Participants were provided need-based scholarships for the first two years of college ranging from $250 - $4,500 in support per semester. They were enrolled in an intrusive advising program that involved regular individual meetings and drop-in hours with a STEM advisor throughout all supported semesters and trained tutors were available upon request or following suggestion by the intrusive academic advisor. The advisor provided support for current courses, course selection for future semesters, and career guidance. Students enrolled in STEM 101: Integrative Freshman Seminar, which gave them insight into the interaction of the STEM disciplines and explored the value and importance of the STEM disciplines, and STEM 105: Inquiry Seminar, which provided a foundation in scientific communication and culminated in students writing a research proposal. Students showed significant gains in interdisciplinary thinking compared to other Truman students and national averages based on assessment from the Research on the Integrated Science Curriculum (RISC) survey. As second-year students, participants attended a three-day workshop on statistics and computer programming, had the opportunity to shadow researchers in labs, and applied to summer research experiences. Graduating students reported the workshop prepared them for labs in elective courses. Forty percent of the participants secured a position in an REU or internship for the summer after their second year and many presented their research at Truman&rsquo;s Student Research Conference. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Broader Impacts </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">of the program had the goal of increasing participation from students that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields and increasing the retention to the target STEM disciplines. The project proposed to increase overall URM representation in STEM at Truman from 12.8% to 14.5%. Through recruiting efforts for this program and other initiatives on campus, URMs represented 17.8% of freshman STEM majors at Truman for the two most recent incoming cohorts. This far exceeded the original goal of the program. Thirteen percent of participants were underrepresented minorities (URMs); recruiting additional URM participants was a challenge because generous scholarship support from other sources reduced the number that had outstanding financial need. While Truman&rsquo;s general population is composed of approximately 16% first-generation college students, 56% of STEP Scholars were first-generation college students - leading to increased support and participation for this category of underrepresented students in STEM. The target for retention to the target STEM majors was to increase retention by 5% (improving from 52% to 57%). Seventy-seven percent of participants were retained to majors in Biology, Chemistry, or Physics with 87.5% of participants either graduating from or currently enrolled in any STEM major at Truman. Participants who have already graduated from Truman represent approximately 5% of all graduating students in the target disciplines. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Overall, the program met its goals of increasing support for students from underrepresented backgrounds (URM, first-generation college student, and low SES) and successfully increased recruitment and retention of students in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. </span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/11/2017<br>      Modified by: Timothy&nbsp;D&nbsp;Walston</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1060658/1060658_10119416_1502485047467_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1060658/1060658_10119416_1502485047467_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Interdisciplinary learning gains by Truman State University STEP Scholars"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1060658/1060658_10119416_1502485047467_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Interdisciplinary learning gains by Truman State University STEP Scholars"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Learning gains as measured by the RISC analysis for interdisciplinary learning outcomes.
