<AbstractNarration>For a smooth complete algebraic curve X over an algebraically closed field k, and a reductive group G, there is a fundamental object called the moduli space of G-bundles on X, and denoted Bun(G). The theory of automorphic sheaves, which is a geometrization of the classical theory of automorphic functions, studies various categories of sheaves on Bun(G). Most fundamentally, we study the (derived) category of quasi-coherent sheaves QCoh(Bun(G)), as well as various categories of twisted D-modules. The goal of Geometric Langlands Correspondence is to study the remarkable relation of this category to the similarly defined category for another reductive group, called the Langlands dual of G. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As was discovered in the middle of the 20th century, one can give a list of all fundamental laws of symmetry that occur in nature--these are classified  by Dynkin diagrams, also known as root systems. Our fundamental object of study, the theory of automorphic sheaves, couples these symmetry laws  with another fundamental object in modern mathematics, namely algebraic  curves (also known in their incarnation as Riemann surfaces). The discovery of Langlands correspondence indicates that the theory of automorphic sheaves admits additional symmetries of its own. The current project aims to study these new symmetries at their most fundamental.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focuses on a new and exciting area of research known as the geometric Langlands theory.  In the early 1970's Robert Langlands came up with non-commutative reciprocity (duality) laws that establisha correspondence between two problems obtained by coupling in two different ways the datum of a global field (i.e., a basic datum for arithmetics) to the datum of a reductive algebraic group (i.e., one of the basic laws of symmetry that exist in nature).   The geometric Langlands theory is an analogue (and a generalization) of the original Langlands paradigm to a geometric setting, which has profound connections to quantum field theory, as we recently discovered by E.~Witten and his collaborators.   As a result of the completion of the current project, one can give a precise formulation of the geometric Langlands conjecture, and make significant progress toward its proof.   The work on this project involved the development of other areas of mathematics,  such as derived algebraic geometry, higher representation theory and homological algebra.    A highlight of the results is the notion of singular support of a coherent sheaf, a notion that had been missed by researchers for many decades. This notion paved a way to the formulation of the geometric Langlands conjecture.                 Last Modified: 10/06/2017       Submitted by: Dennis Gaitsgory]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
