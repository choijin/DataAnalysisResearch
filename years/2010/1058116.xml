<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is funding Professor Richard Magliozzo, at Brooklyn College of The City University of New York, to examine the chemical reactions auto-catalyzed by the heme group in catalase-peroxidase that produce an unusual the amino acid adduct cofactor involving covalent attachment of methionine and tryptophan side chains to the phenol ring of a tyrosine.  The heme enzyme catalase-peroxidase found in microorganisms and responsible for their protection from harmful oxidative reactions, is an example of an enzyme that contains two cofactors; the well-known heme group (iron-protoporphyrin IX), and also this amino acid adduct.  The modification of the polypeptide under study here is unique to catalase-peroxidases and the cofactor structure enables the rapid catalase reaction (2H2O2 = O2 + 2H2O) in an active site designed like that of peroxidases, which generally lack catalase activity.  The mechanism for generation of the covalent amino acid adduct is unknown, but expected to involve radicals on the side chains of the tyrosine and tryptophan residues.  The principal technique to be applied is electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.  The rapid reactions will be probed using rapid mixing techniques to identify the radicals and their evolution in the enzyme isolated under conditions that do not allow formation of the cofactor until samples are prepared for these experiments.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;In terms of Broader Impacts, the research in Professor Magliozzo's laboratory will produce an environment for the training of young scientists at the chemistry-biology interface, including high school and undergraduate students.  Particularly for the former, exposure to modern scientific research at this early stage will be important, as they begin to formulate their interests and career goals.  There are also scientific broader impacts, as this work will provide insight about the unusual post-translational modification chemistry that leads to the formation of this interesting cofactor.  Moving forward, the precedents set in this work will position the bioorganic/biophysical chemistry community better to look for other such cofactor adducts in other enzyme active sites.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of the activities in the project include advancements in understanding protein structure and functions.  These properties are often modified in cells beyond those made possible in proteins and enzymes containing only the 20 naturally occurring amino acids.  In catalase-peroxidases, three amino acid side chains are covalently linked (see figure) to form a new cofactor, MYW, with unique function.  Catalase-peroxidase enzymes play a key role in microorganisms' response to oxidative stress because they remove hydrogen peroxide from cells.  Our research prior to this award demonstrated that a radical is localized on the MYW-cofactor without which the enzyme does not exhibit its unusually high catalase activity.  The project was developed to probe the pathway to formation of the covalent cross-links in the MYW cofactor and to apply chemical calculations focused on understanding the role of the MYW-radical in the catalase reaction mechanism. We developed an efficient route to produce catalase-peroxidase lacking the cross-links as a means to follow the early steps leading to bond formation.  The chemical steps require catalytic events initiated by peroxidase function at the heme group, which is adjacent to the amino acids of the cofactor.  We found a protein-based radical during the first steps of the cross-linking reaction that is most likely on an amino acid later cross-linked within the cofactor.   Our chemical calculations provided a detailed view of the energetic requirements for catalase activity in catalase-peroxidase.  The insights gained from these calculations could not be gained by  standard experimentation because the reaction is too fast to be followed  in the test tube.  The final step in the novel catalase  reaction pathway involves an electron transfer between oxygen bound to heme iron and a radical on the MYW-cofactor.  This transfer is dependent upon the proximity of the Arginine side chain to the tyrosine oxygen within the MYW-radical cofactor.  Our calculations allowed us to confirm that an experimentally observed enzyme intermediate is in fact responsible for part of its catalytic function.  The activities funded by the award enabled the training of scientists at all levels of education from high school through post-doctoral training, in a highly diverse public univeristy environment.  Women and other individuals underrepresented in the STEM fields learned fundamental and advanced biochemcal science through the hands-on experiences supervised by the project leader and through their interactions on the Brooklyn College campus, the City University of New York at large, and the scientific community beyond.  Research in the fields of rapid-reaction kinetics, electron  paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, molecular biology, and chemical  calculations was enhanced through the project's activities. Results were disseminated and NSF funding was acknowledged in printed articles published in the scientific literature, and at local and international conferences.
