<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  Jumbo phages are very large viruses capable of infecting bacteria. There are many different kinds and they are easy to find, isolate, and grow and play important roles in global ecosystems. This project concerns the relationship between the structures of the protein shells (capsids) of viruses and the sizes of the viral DNAs (genomes) packaged inside them, as well as the evolutionary pathways that lead to viruses of increasing size. Very few structures of jumbo viruses have been determined to date and very little is known about the evolutionary processes that produce their elaborate architectures. Important questions about the evolution of jumbo viruses will be tackled comprehensively by combining cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), to investigate the details of capsid architecture, with biochemistry and molecular genetics, to establish their protein and DNA compositions. One hypothesis that will be tested posits that individual mutations in the major capsid protein modify the self-assembly of capsid monomers so as to increase the size of the assembled capsid, allowing additional, superfluous DNA sequences to be packaged, for example, extra copies of some genes. Over time, these unneeded gene copies may be gradually replaced with useful and eventually essential gene sequences, thus locking in the new capsid structure. The studies of virus structural evolution are enabled, on the one hand, by significant improvements in cryoEM technology, and on the other, by advances in sequencing genomic DNA. The two researchers leading this project are experts in these technologies and will work together to address questions not accessible by either approach alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project aims at revealing evolutionary connections between the virus capsid and genome by studying structural relationships among very large capsids of different bacterial viruses. In a broader sense, the project will illuminate a regime of macro-molecular complexity that is significantly under-investigated. Bacterial viruses are important model systems for understanding protein structure, self-assembly, and function and are important sources of biotechnology tools (for example, viral promoters, phage display libraries). Structure determination of viral components continues to contribute significantly to the understanding of virus biology and the interactions between host cells and viruses. A complete structural description of the viral subunits, their binding sites and accessible surfaces, will allow exploration of new anti-viral molecules that will be useful medically, in fermentation-based industries, agriculture and in biotechnology including bacterial use for cleaning oil-spills and for generating renewable energy. Education and Outreach opportunities come from the synergy between the two collaborating disciplines and the anticipated impact on undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows from the two participating departments, Structural Biology and Biological Sciences. Five students will be recruited each year for this unique training opportunity that includes screening for exceptionally large virions, performing biochemical analyses, and processing cryo-electron microscopy images to visualize capsid structures in three dimensions. Undergraduate recruiting will follow the successful model of the existing "Phage Hunters" program, recruiting from undergraduate classes and through campus chapters of minority-oriented professional organizations (POMS, NSBE). Graduate students involved in the project will gain teaching experience by mentoring undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We have examined the relationship between the virus capsid &ndash; the protein shell built primarily from many copies of one protein &ndash; and the genome that is packaged within the capsid with the particular aim of understanding the evolutionary pathway that leads to extremely large dimensions of both. Few structures for large virus capsids have been reported, and the processes that drive capsid assembly and which lead to such elaborate architectures targeted here are so poorly investigated as to be not understood at all. We used cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) to investigate capsid architecture, and biochemistry and molecular genetics to study corresponding protein and DNA compositions. The virus family that we targeted includes double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) tailed bacteriophages (viruses infecting bacteria) that exploit the bacteriophage HK97 capsid protein fold, a family that is predicted to account for 90-95% of viruses on the planet and which includes the herpesviruses. Our focus is on very large capsids that package at least 200,000 base pairs of dsDNA, and we call these the &ldquo;jumbophages&rdquo;.</p> <p>Finding large bacteriophages (phages) required developing special methods of growth and purification, which is why they have not been readily identified in the past. With these methods we could isolate, grow and purify jumbophages from water and soil samples. Our initial focus was on six jumbophages that had large capsids of different sizes. Five of these have icosahedral symmetry (20 triangular facets) and one was a prolate (extended) icosahedron. DNA content ranged from 203,000 to 640,000 base pairs of DNA, and capsid diameters from 120-180 nm. We imaged phage samples by cryoEM for determining structures of the capsids to resolutions where the protein folds can be visualized. We observed that all six capsids were constructed primarily&nbsp;from many copies of a single capsid protein, and that all six of these proteins adopted the same fold (shape) as the bacteriophage HK97 capsid protein. This is convincing evidence that the viruses all derived from a common ancestor that is likely deeply remote in time.
