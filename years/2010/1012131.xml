<AbstractNarration>The SDCI/STCI PI meeting will bring together leading software cyberinfrastructure projects to discuss issues relevant to the community as we move into the future.  This meeting will discuss the effective use of NSF middleware development projects by scientists and engineers so that researchers in a number of domains can make advances in their respective fields without being burdened by the interactions with the cyberinfrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will support the exchange of ideas among the current software cyberinfrastructure projects. It will potentially provide guidance on issues related to the development of robust software and to the problem of software sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will solicit participation from major science and engineering projects that rely on the national cyberinfrastructure for their computations and data management needs. Their participation will help ensure that the cyberinfrastructure software developed as part of SDCI and STCI projects will be relevant and broadly applicable to a number of science and engineering domains. The results of this meeting will then potentially guide middleware development and testing in the future</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the SDCI/STCI workshop was to bring together the Principle Investigators of the leading software cyberinfrastructure projects and discuss issues relevant to the community as it moves into the future. It is critical that the funds used by NSF for middleware development result in software being used effectively by scientists and engineers. This would allow researchers in a number of domains to make advances in their respective fields without being burdened by the interactions with the cyberinfrastructure. To achieve its goals, the workshop focused on four main themes:  Understanding the needs of todayÃ†s observatories and large-scale projects Sharing experiences in building quality software and services Fostering collaboration and providing incentives for collaboration and cyberinfrastructure development as a career Sustaining the software capabilities in the long term.   The workshop discussed the various needs of large-scale projects, such as DataNet, Earth Systems Grid, the iPlant Collaborative, the Ocean Observatory Initiative, Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation, and the Southern California Earthquake Center. The middleware provider community needs to understand the needs of the science and engineering communities so that the software is relevant and enhances the productivity of their community members. Some of the challenges that were identified were: data management, the ability to understand the results of computations, the ability to formulate complex analysis at the level of the scientist, and the need for single sign-on with fine-grained authorization.  The workshop participants also commented on the need of continuity of software development, however, this issue also brings with it the need to identify "good" software that needs to be sustained over time. Participants also stated that software is part of science today and it is wrong to assume that commercial companies will take up and sustain the software needed by scientists. The workshop discussed a number of software practices that can help in developing sustainable software as well.          Last Modified: 07/03/2013       Submitted by: Ewa Deelman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
