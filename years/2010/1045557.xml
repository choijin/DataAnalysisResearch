<AbstractNarration>Mathematics Research and Mentoring Program (Math RaMP) &lt;br/&gt;Spelman College&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Department of Mathematics at Spelman College has structured a comprehensive program: Mathematics Research and Mentoring Program (Math RaMP). The two main components of Math RaMP are the Scholarship Program and the Teaching Fellowship Program. The Math RaMP Scholars Program will prepare and direct talented students of color to mathematics graduate education and to careers in the mathematical sciences. Students who have demonstrated high potential and interest in mathematics through their achievement during the first-year and/or second year of college will be selected as RaMP Scholars to participate in a structured enrichment and support program. RaMP Scholars will be awarded academic scholarships that will require participation in the Journal Club Seminar as well as independent research in the mathematical sciences. The Math RaMP Teaching Fellowship Program will award a fellowship to a master?s level woman of color who is transitioning into a doctoral program. The RaMP Teaching Fellow will be mentored by faculty in the department and will gain experience in teaching college-level math. The Fellow will contribute to the Scholars Program by providing supplemental instruction for upper level mathematics courses. The objectives of Math RaMP are to mentor women of color and provide experiences to undergraduate students and a master?s level student that would contribute to the academic success of both groups and assist in increasing the pipeline of women of color pursuing advanced degrees in the mathematical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematics Research and Mentoring Program (Math RaMP) addresses many of the critical issues and challenges facing African American women at the undergraduate level in mathematics while also preparing and inspiring women of color to continue to graduate study in the mathematical sciences and to associated careers. Overcoming some of the challenges involve: meeting financial needs,  building self-confidence, providing role models and mentors, promoting a sense of belonging in science and mathematics for the under-represented, and providing a challenging yet supportive academic environment within a nurturing community?one which expresses high expectations and  confidence in the ability of students to achieve.  The overall goal of the proposed program is to increase the number of African American women who pursue advanced degrees or careers in the mathematical sciences with an enhanced understanding of the broader career options available in pure and applied mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
