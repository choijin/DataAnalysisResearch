<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-1066222   &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Markus J. Pflaum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award serves to support participants from the U.S. at the&lt;br/&gt;conference and school "Quantization of Singular Spaces" in&lt;br/&gt;December 2010 at the Center for Quantum Geometry of Moduli Spaces&lt;br/&gt;in Aarhus, Denmark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supported conference will be aimed at recent approaches to&lt;br/&gt;quantization of singular spaces. The goal of the conference is to&lt;br/&gt;encourage cross-fertilization among various approaches, to bring&lt;br/&gt;seemingly independent lines of research together, and to consider&lt;br/&gt;where the field can go in the future.  It is expected to give a&lt;br/&gt;strong impetus to innovative work in the field. In addition, the&lt;br/&gt;workshop is aimed at training young researchers in the field by&lt;br/&gt;internationally renowned experts.  A mathematically rigorous&lt;br/&gt;theory of singular quantization would have considerable&lt;br/&gt;repercussions. For example, in mathematical physics a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the nonperturbative structure of gauge theories&lt;br/&gt;would come within reach, which would be essential preparation for&lt;br/&gt;the construction of quantized Yang--Mills theories and grand&lt;br/&gt;unified theories.  In mathematics, new index theorems for&lt;br/&gt;singular spaces would emerge, among other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for the conference will ensure that experts from the&lt;br/&gt;U.S. working in the field of quantization theory will be able to&lt;br/&gt;significantly contribute to the conference and will profit from&lt;br/&gt;the exchange of cutting-edge research.  Moreover, support for the&lt;br/&gt;school and conference will enable U.S.-based young researchers to&lt;br/&gt;participate in the special training which will be offered through&lt;br/&gt;three minicourses on foundational material and recent&lt;br/&gt;achievements in the field during a school preceeding the&lt;br/&gt;conference.  The conference and school in Denmark will also&lt;br/&gt;strengthen US-Scandinavian research connections and will lead to&lt;br/&gt;new scientific collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://qgm.au.dk/events/dec-2010-conference-quantization-of-singular-spaces/</AbstractNarration>
