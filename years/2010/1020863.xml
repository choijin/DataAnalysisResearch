<AbstractNarration>Transfer of genes from one species to another is an important cause of rapid genetic adaptation, as a new and functional gene can be acquired in one or a few steps. While most processes of gene exchange between species are obscure, in certain rare naturally transformable bacteria, an efficient mechanism of such horizontal gene transfer is directly available for experimental analysis. This project studies such a horizontal gene transfer process, found in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterial species that can enter a temporary special physiological state, competence, in which it can kill neighboring bacteria and take up their released DNA. This project studies a peptide pheromone that S. pneumoniae employs as a method of cell-to-cell communication that counts the bacterial population size and coordinates the activities of cells in the population. The research will reveal how the population density signal is transmitted to the cell interior by a global regulator of gene expression that carries the population signal to scores of individual genes. Finally, it explores how this global gene regulation is quickly and simultaneously activated in all cells of a local population. Using genetic strategies to identify key regulatory proteins, as well as direct biochemical methods, it will provide new insights into bacterial cell-to-cell communication, horizontal gene transfer, and control of RNA polymerase specificity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts  &lt;br/&gt;The project intimately integrates research and education: every experiment in this project is done by a student at some level of training. Participating students include advanced secondary school students under special mentoring programs, undergraduates majoring in Biological Sciences or Biochemistry, and graduate students pursuing the PhD degree in Molecular Biology. Many are members of groups under-represented in the national science and technology workforce. Six genetic studies in this project will be carried out by undergraduates working directly with the PI. Five graduates of the PI's laboratory have gone on to become professors, while more than a dozen others are pursuing careers in biomedical research and biotechnology. This project also supports the national science and engineering infrastructure by providing training and by distributing specialized materials and discoveries. S. pneumoniae is the object of intense worldwide study, and is a model species for the streptococci that are important factors in agriculture and the dairy industry. As this project increases the understanding of horizontal gene transfer, it also provides important genetic tools for use in such studies. The tools it develops are available without restriction; those developed previously have already been distributed to over 60 research groups in academia and industry, in forms including the peptide pheromone that regulates competence, special plasmids, new genes, and bacterial strains, as well as individual consultation.</AbstractNarration>
