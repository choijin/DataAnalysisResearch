<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Optoelectronics Industry Development Association (OIDA) is a non-profit industry assocation located in Washington, DC.  OIDA held a 1 1/2-day forum on U.S. Competitiveness and the Future of Telecom on November 16-17, 2010, in Arlington, Virginia.

The forum featured speakers and presentations from carriers, major industry players, and government agencies. The agenda included the following sessions:  U.S. Competitiveness in a Global Economy Government Agency Perspectives Telecom Infrastructure and Challenges The Future of Telecom National Broadband Plan Roundtable What's Next: A Panel Discussion  With NSF funding, OIDA solicited academic researchers from around the United States to present posters as the focus and highlight of the evening reception and the next day's morning activities. NSF support helped students offset travel and hotel costs. OIDA allocated time on the agenda for NSF to provide an overview of the photonics research programs sponsored by NSF and for the students to introduce briefly the work that they were exhibiting at the poster session.  The poster session provided students an excellent opportunity to meet high-level management and technical personnel. Industry leaders, on the other hand, had the opportunity to become acquainted with cutting-edge academic research. It also created opportunities for industry and academia to find common interest areas for future collaboration.  Student participation in the OIDA Annual Forum contributed to workforce development in science, engineering, and technology. It also benefits numerous existing photonics programs through the government such as those sponsored by NSF, DoD, NIST, etc. Their participation also helps industry, especially small companies that normally have limited access to academia, to develop collaborative relationships with academic researchers.
