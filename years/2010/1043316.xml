<AbstractNarration>Southern University is centering itself at the forefront of the sustainability frontier by engaging in the development of the next generation of sustainable materials, energy and technologies. Basic sciences that will lay the foundation for development of this initiative within the SU STEM enterprise are Agricultural Sciences, Engineering, and Physical Sciences, which will combine to support three primary research thrusts - Materials Science &amp; Energy Technologies; Biomass Conversion, Biofuels &amp; Bioenergy; and Climate Change &amp; Environmental Impact. Computational Science &amp; Information Technology will serve as an undergirding connection throughout. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACE Implementation project entitled: The New Energy Workforce - Sustainable Materials, Energy &amp; Technology, will develop concentrations within the Colleges of Agricultural Sciences, Engineering, and Sciences, and create an interdisciplinary international degree program that integrates research, academics and experiential learning toward resolving sustainability issues faced by Louisiana, this nation and the global community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will expose undergraduate students to sustainable materials, energy, and technologies through an interdisciplinary dual-degree curriculum that integrates academics, research and global engagement with international universities; assemble interdisciplinary teams of international scientists and engineers to identify solutions to sustainability challenges affecting the global community; and engage in interdisciplinary sustainable materials, energy and technologies research activities with special emphasis on clean and renewable resources suitable for commercialization and replication. Forging collaborative partnerships that emphasize student and faculty exchange, joint research foci, joint course offerings and joint academic degree programs will promote scientific and technological understanding within the global STEM Enterprise.</AbstractNarration>

It offers numerous Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) undergraduate and master&rsquo;s degrees, and several STEM Ph.D. programs including Environmental Toxicology and Urban Forestry. The New Energy Program builds upon several current and previous NSF-funded programs at SU designed to increase the numbers of students enrolling in and successfully completing degree programs in STEM disciplines.</p> <p>A primary goal of the project was to develop STEM scholars and practitioners with the&nbsp;breadth of knowledge and experience in sustainable materials, energy, and renewable&nbsp;technologies to discover and develop solutions to real-world sustainability problems from&nbsp;a global perspective. Increased student awareness and competence on campus of natural resource conservation and sustainability has come through student assignments, discussions, presentations, and field trips. The number of students who engaged in experiential learning activities increased each semester.&nbsp; Over the course of the grant period, 68 students participated in grant activities, including four high school students. From Summer 2011 through Spring 2017, these student participants represented 19 different academic majors.</p> <p>As future leaders charged with achieving sustainability in the face of challenging environmental, economic, and societal needs, this project prepared undergraduates to address some of the most critical challenges of our time. The University, through the academic affairs department and applicable curriculum committees, approved &ldquo;Principles of Sustainability&rdquo; (ENGR 201), a beginning-level three-credit undergraduate course that introduces students to the concepts, principles, and applications of sustainability. The course is open to students of any major, thereby increasing the interdisciplinary academic engagement of students majoring in various STEM and non-STEM fields.&nbsp; As of project end, 50 students enrolled in the course, beginning with 10 students who participated in the first research study abroad experience at Guizhou University in Guiyang, China in 2012.</p> <p>Through study abroad opportunities for students and faculty and student collaboration with other&nbsp;universities, national laboratories and international partners, the program sought to increase the number of students and faculty involved in scholarly activities including conference presentations, publications, and other scholarly works. Many international research experiences were provided to program students and faculty during the grant period. These included exchanges, summer research, conference presentations, and joint research projects. These experiences included events in China, Turkey, Africa, India, and the Bering Glacier (Alaska), enhancing their breadth of knowledge and experience in sustainable materials, energy, and renewable technologies from a global perspective.</p> <p>The Southern University New Energy Program was successful in implementing key program components, and made excellent progress toward its objectives of increasing interdisciplinary academic and research engagement in STEM disciplines. The New Energy Program provided a solid foundation in which to build upon these successes to further impact SU students, faculty, and international partnerships in the future and to contribute to the global knowledge base in sustainable materials, energy, and technologies.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;A&nbsp;Stubblefield</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1043316/1043316_10041230_1514597307282_GuizhouUniversity1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1043316/1043316_10041230_1514597307282_GuizhouUniversity1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sustainability-based Cultural and Academic Learning Experience"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1043316/1043316_10041230_1514597307282_GuizhouUniversity1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sustainability-based Cultural and Academic Learning Experience"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Southern University Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (Guizhou University ?
