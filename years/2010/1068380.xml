<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Leonardo Senatore at Stanford University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observational Cosmology has made great advances in recent years:  its results have become vital for many theories of fundamental physics, and it is yielding significant amounts of critical experimental data.  Professor Senatore plans to exploit this promising observational situation in order to make definite progress in our understanding of the beginning of the universe as well as its current accelerated expansion. In order to achieve this, Professor Senatore will focus his attention on various projects that explore a wide range of topics in cosmology, ranging from theoretical aspects to subjects closer to the actual data.  On the theoretical side, he will concentrate on applying modern quantum field-theoretical techniques to study the dynamics of inflation, the primordial phase of the universe, and the large-scale structures that we currently see around us. On the observational side, the PI will focus on developing and implementing various new data-analysis techniques in order to look for the non-Gaussian signals expected in various fundamental theories of cosmological inflation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  Professor Senatore will involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training to junior physicists beginning research in this field.  The PI will additionally outreach his results to a broader audience by giving public lectures.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research performed with the help of this grant has been focussed on finding ways to understand what happened in the first instants of the universe. We currently believe that the universe was formed by a period of inflation, where space expanded exponentially. However, we do not know much more than this simple fact. This research has been trying to identify the possible experimental signatures of such a primordial phase of acceleration. We have developed a formalism that has allowed us to parametrize the various mechanisms in which inflation could have happened, and identified the signatures associated with them. The best way in which we currently believe we can test the beginning of the universe relies on the following mechanism. In the beginning, the period of inflation created very small density perturbations, just like little ripples on a sea. Because matter attracts more matter under the influence of the force of gravity, the little primordial ripples have grown into larger and larger waves to ultimately become the temperature fluctuations that we see in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), and, ultimately, the galaxies and the structures that we see around us. Therefore, by studying the distribution of galaxies in our universe (or of the fluctuations that we see in the CMB), we can try to reconstruct what happened during inflation. In fact, different kinds of inflationary mechanisms lead to different patterns in the primordial fluctuations.

These tools are based on the realization that we can describe with great accuracy the distribution of galaxies if we model them as a sort of fluid with viscosity and pressure, indeed the actual numbers are such that this fluid turns out to be very similar to chocolate syrup!  We have shown that this description is not just an analogy, but is actually accurate, and can be made more and more precise as more detailed calculations are performed.  Not only it is satisfying to have such a simple description for the universe at long distances, but this tool will hopefully be very useful to continue to explore what happened at the beginning of the universe.
