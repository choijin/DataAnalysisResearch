<AbstractNarration>This is a 4-year project to modernize and upgrade the data infrastructure for the Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) research program. CEDAR is a NSF supported research program that began in 1986. Initially focused on instrumentation, it soon broadened to include theory, modeling and coordinated observational campaigns. A database has been an important component of CEDAR since its inception. Since the beginning, the CEDAR Database format has been the standard for archiving and distributing data from the wide variety of instruments and models employed by the CEDAR community. Currently, the primary CEDAR data archive is housed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, but from the start there have been two primary distribution mechanisms - that provided by NCAR and the Madrigal Database, a distributed system that is employed by all incoherent scatter radars used for CEDAR research.  The result of this effort will be a merged system with Madrigal providing both data archiving and distribution. Madrigal will be extended to include the concept of one or more archiving nodes that will automatically download and archive new and modified data when it appears on any of the distributed nodes. The main new archiving node will be located at the Haystack Geospace Science Center, with off-site backup at the MIT Data Center.  In addition to the archiving capability, a number of other new features will be added to Madrigal in response to user and administrator requests. The most important of these will be the replacement of the existing scaled integer data format with a modern floating point, self-describing format. This will greatly simplify adding new data types to Madrigal and will also allow Madrigal data sets to be directly accessed from a wide variety of existing standard analysis software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Community infrastructure building and service is at the heart of the proposed activity.  There are numerous societal benefits to enhanced understanding of atmospheric effects and sustained, easy access to CEDAR data is vital to this research community. Madrigal is already used by the CEDAR community as an efficient and popular tool for training of undergraduates and graduate students. Madrigal is an open-source project, which means that software and developer documentation are on-line so anyone can contribute capabilities. The web services component of the system, coupled with the use of a standard scientific data format will enable anyone with internet access to participate in the analysis of CEDAR data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The primary goal of this award was to develop a central archive of upper atmospheric data built on the existing Madrigal system.  Madrigal is an upper atmosphere scientific distributed database used worldwide by groups that study geospace and its variations. Madrigal is a robust, World Wide Web based system capable of managing and serving archival and real-time data, in a variety of formats, from a wide range of upper atmospheric science instruments. Users can access Madrigal data either through the web, or through a web based applications programming interface (API).  Current wrapper APIÆs exist in python, Matlab, and IDL. Data at each Madrigal site is locally controlled and can be updated at any time, but shared metadata between Madrigal sites allow searching of all Madrigal data holdings at once from any individual Madrigal site.   The central CEDAR Madrigal archival database site developed as part of this award serves the science community in a number of important ways.  It ensures all Madrigal science data is backed up from the remote Madrigal locations to the central CEDAR Madrigal archive, which is in turn backed up remotely.  It also provides a long term repository for data from science instruments that are no longer in existence, such as the Malvern Incoherent Scatter Radar in England, which ceased operations in the early 1970Æs.  In addition, it provides alternative access to data from remote Madrigal sites which have limited bandwidth, providing faster data access for users of data from those sites.   The award support of CEDAR Madrigal archive site development and deployment also provides significant service to the observational community, as it allows scientists who do not maintain their own local Madrigal site to easily archive their instrumentsÆ data in the Madrigal system.  As part of this award, MIT Haystack worked with many different scientists, developing procedures to load their data into the standardized Madrigal format.  To make this as easy as possible, we allowed each group to submit data in their own format, and we developed scripts to load that format into the CEDAR Madrigal database.  The success of this approach toward making it easier for scientists to load their data into this archive is well measured by the increase in the number of instruments in Madrigal over the period of this award.  Specifically, unique instruments with data in Madrigal increased from 90 in the beginning phase of this award to 143 at the end, for a total of 53 new instruments.  (The initial figure was measured after the old CEDAR database had been fully integrated into the new CEDAR Madrigal database.)   This award also provided support for work with existing Madrigal sites to help them make better use of the Madrigal system.  Eight different Madrigal sites were supported during the period of this contract, either remotely or through site visits.  The staff at MIT Haystack also wrote loading programs that increased the number of instruments and kinds of data being loaded at those existing Madrigal sites.   Another award activity supported updates to Madrigal software systems.  MadrigalÆs data format was developed by the science community in the 1980Æs, and more modern alternatives are available.  With the new version of Madrigal developed under this award, Madrigal will use the standard scientific format HDF5.  This new version of the software is being tested currently at MIT Haystack and is planned for release at the end of 2015.
