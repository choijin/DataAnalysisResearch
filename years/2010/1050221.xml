<AbstractNarration>Washington State University's GridStat project is developing middleware for electric power grid monitoring and control systems incorporating new technology that precisely measures currents, voltages, and phase angles many times per second. The GridStat at Scale using GENI project will demonstrate GridStat middleware?s ability to meet the power grid?s need for high-speed, reliable communications and will establish baseline performance expectations. Using GENI as the experimental platform allows experimentation with hundreds of nodes and isolated networks to make repeatable performance measurements over wide geographic areas. The ability of redundant resources in GridStat networks to help withstand attacks that attempt to remove or overload resources will be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These experiments will establish credibility factors for wide-area communications used in coordinated control systems to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the electric power grid and will establish an approach for testing new design ideas for the smart transmission grid.</AbstractNarration>

Local detectors are deployed at edge-routers where localized statistics can be gathered and updated to the global detector.
