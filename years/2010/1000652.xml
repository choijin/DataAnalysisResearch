<AbstractNarration>This project advances a novel perspective on the theoretical and computational modeling of interactions among solid bodies and vortical fluids, illuminating the fundamental presence of integrable and nonintegrable constraints in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions of such interactions. The project focuses on four distinct topics: (1) the formal equivalence of gyroscopic lift forces to nonholonomic forces of constraint, (2) the mathematical treatment of conditions of flow attachment or stagnation as holonomic or nonholonomic constraints, (3) the resolution of the Hamiltonian structure underpinning interactions of free bodies with discrete vortex distributions into constrained and unconstrained components, and (4) the realization of variational integration methods which preserve balance principles between vortex shedding from solid surfaces and the corresponding development of surface forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problems involving the dynamic interaction of fluids with solid structures abound in the natural and engineered worlds. A deeper understanding of such interactions promises to improve the design of systems ranging from robotic vehicles to energy-harvesting devices, but the subtle physics underpinning such interactions presents challenges to traditional mathematical modeling methods. This project will explore fundamental parallels between the modeling of fluid-structure interactions and the modeling of other mechanical phenomena, with the goal of illuminating pervasive physical principles and novel analytical techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The dynamics of solid bodies moving through fluids are often influenced by the phenomenon of vortex shedding, a mechanism for transferring momentum between a body and a fluid that depends fundamentally on the fluid?s viscosity and that produces a particular category of flow in the body?s wake. Vortex shedding plays an essential role in the self-propulsion of diverse aquatic organisms, many of which exhibit properties like agility or energy efficiency to a degree that strongly motivates biomimetic designs for aquatic robots. Propulsive vortex shedding from a swimming animal or robot can be modeled computationally with high fidelity, but the computational cost of simulating such systems has traditionally been high, and the underlying mathematical models have generally been too complex to provide much conceptual insight.     The physics of terrestrial robots with passive wheels is generally simple in comparison to model. Such robots exemplify a class of mechanical systems, called nonholonomic systems, that can exhibit complex behavior in spite of the ease with which the principles underlying this behavior can be described mathematically. Mathematical models for nonholonomic systems share certain properties that can be understood in geometric terms, and recent research has illuminated links between geometric features of nonholonomic systems and their rich dynamics.     The goal of this project was to substantiate a link between the dynamics of solid bodies shedding vorticity in viscous fluids and the dynamics of nonholonomic systems, enabling a simplified approach to the modeling of aquatic locomotion using geometric ideas. Low-order computational models were derived for fish-like and jellyfish-like propulsion from the idea that propulsive vortex shedding of the appropriate kind can, in each case, be equated with nonholonomic rather than viscous dynamics. Simple swimming robots were developed to validate a selection of these models and to enable physical experiments concerning the energy-efficient control of locomotion in fluids. The project revealed not only that systems involving vortex shedding in fluids can exhibit features of nonholonomic systems, but that the reverse is also true, so that conceptual analogies exist between phenomena like the synchronization of adjacent pendulum clocks and the fluid dynamics within fish schools.
