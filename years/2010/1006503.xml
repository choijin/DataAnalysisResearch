<AbstractNarration>The high-dispersion optical spectrographs that have thus far enabled the discovery of more than 400 extrasolar planets have a common susceptibility: the need for ultrastable, broadband, high-line-density, bright, and continuous wavelength calibration so that the small reflex velocities of the host stars can be precisely characterized over periods of weeks to years.  One crucial technology for these investigations utilizes a mode-locked femtosecond pulsed laser - which produces a bright, regularly spaced set of emission features in frequency space - together with a Fabry-Perot filtering cavity to create the appropriate line-density, all locked to an atomic clock for long-term stability.  These so-called "laser combs" have the potential for enabling radial velocity measurements to a precision &lt;10 cm/s; thus the determination of the mass of Earth-like exoplanets should eventually be possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Ronald Walsworth of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and Dr. Franz Kaertner of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are planning to construct such a laser comb for the orange-green spectrum, a region well-suited to the detection of solar-type stars and therefore of stars in which a planet with an orbital period of ~1 yr would exist in the "life-zone", where surface water would be in liquid form.  The team of investigators has an excellent track record in this area, having developed laser combs for the optical red and blue spectral regions.  The new comb will be tested at the 1.5-m Whipple Observatory telescope on Mt. Hopkins, Az, and, when proven reliable, applied to an ongoing project at the 1.5-m telescope at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory that is searching for exo-Earths orbiting stars in the very nearby alpha/beta-Centaurus star system.  The activity will involve both women as both scientists and students, and the resulting time-controlled laser technology should have application well beyond astronomy. Funding for this work is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we developed, tested, and successfully operated a new type of laser-based device to enable precise calibration of the spectral analysis capability of astronomical telescopes and spectrographs used for searches for small, rocky planets around other stars ("exoplanets").  We refer to this laser calibration device as a "green astro-comb," as it employs a special type of laser known as a laser frequency comb and operates over about a 120 nanometer wavelength span in the middle part of the visible spectrum (centered in the green).  This new instrument can be referenced to atomic clocks and optimized for wavelength calibration of light from Sun-like stars observed with telescopes and analyzed with spectrographs.  After fabrication and testing of the green astro-comb in our laboratory at the Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, MA, we relocated the device to the TNG telescope in the Canary Islands, and operated it successfully as a wavelength calibrator for the HARPS-N spectrograph.  We found that the green astro-comb works as hoped, so that in future work it will enable the discovery and characterization of Earth-like exoplanets.     As a broader impact of this research, we showed that laser frequency combs, which had previously been delicate laboratory instruments, can be successfully adapted for long-term operation in non-laboratory environments of mountain-top astronomical observatories, while providing visible wavelength light.  Students and postdoctoral researchers were active participants in all phases of this research: design, construction, and execution of experiments; detailed calculations; astronomical observations; analysis of data; presentation of results at scientific meetings; and writing scientific papers.  In addition, the investigators on this NSF-supported project described the scientific process and results in a wide variety of presentations ranging from scientific conferences and seminars to public lectures.
