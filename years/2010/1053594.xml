<AbstractNarration>The research plan of this project consists of two main tasks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first task, the PIs are developing a formal proof-theoretic framework to ensure that the partition management protocols (which results in the elasticity of cloud computing systems) are correct. The PIs will then use this framework to analyze the partition management functionalities of two representative systems: BigTable (equivalently HBase) and Yahoo?s PNUTS. The PIs will also validate the functionality of the storage subsystem in Google GFS and Hadoop HDFS to ensure that the read and write operations at the file system level indeed satisfy the stated invariants. The PIs will then extend this study to ensure that the atomicity of operations on a single key-value pair indeed are atomic and durable irrespective to the size of the value attribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second task, the PIs will investigate more stringent levels of data and object consistency in cloud computing systems. In particular, the PIs will develop a distributed implementation of snapshot isolation and evaluate its effectiveness in cloud computing environments primarily with respect to elasticity and scalability. Also, the PIs will put all the pieces together (with their associated invariants) and evaluate if the overall system thus formed is correct. Moreover, the PIs will formalize the characteristics of different replica management protocols to identify the limit of data availability in various cloud computing environments.</AbstractNarration>

The key enablers for cloud computing models are two  technology components:  broadband connectivity and  virtualization technology.  Broadband connectivity has made it possible to move services and  applications away from the users into the network core comprising large  data-centers. Similarly, virtualization has made it feasible to execute  programs designed for a specific machine configuration to a different physical machine. Some of the key properties of  the cloud computing model are scalability,  fault-tolerance, availability, elasticity, and self-manageability. The notion of dynamically provisioning capacity in the cloud gives rise to some of the major  challenges in managing cloud infrastructures. Since it is  inevitable that most user applications and services will be increasingly  dependent upon the cloud, it is important that we ensure that indeed  these infrastructures operate in a predictable manner. Otherwise, a  minor glitch or an error can have devastating consequences in that it  can potentially cause broad outages such as transportation system  malfunctions, financial or banking system breakdowns, and in general  users not being able to access data or services.  Although there is significant research and development  activity to enhance various aspects of cloud computing, what is sorely  lacking among these efforts is a systematic approach to characterize the  properties of these systems and to establish the correctness of various components in the presence of system dynamics. The  goal of this proposal was to fill this void by starting a systematic  investigation to develop tools, techniques, and methods to reason about  cloud computing architectures.  Our focus was in two important research directions  for cloud data stores (1) support for ACID transactions and (2)  multi&shy;data center clouds. We surveyed the existing literature on  transactional cloud datastores, hosted in a single data center, and  updated our abstract model to include the components and features  necessary to support transactions. Scalable database management systems are a critical part of the cloud infrastructure and play an  important role in ensuring the smooth transition of applications from  the classical enterprise infrastructures to next generation cloud  infrastructures. Though scalable data management on distributed  platforms has been a vision for more than three decades, cloud computing brings its own set of novel  challenges that must be addressed to ensure the success of data  management solutions in the cloud environment.    Based on our background study, we crystallised the design choices made  by some successful large scale database management systems, and were able to develop protocols that achieve better  overall performance (than current commercial systems, such as Google's Megastore) and reduce the rate of transaction  aborts significantly.   Maintaining consistency across datacenters is expensive and requires  wide&shy;-area communication. This renders current solutions to either settle  for weaker forms of consistency or suffer from large delays. We  developed Message Futures, a strongly consistent concurrency control  manager with low commit latency to ensure mutual consistency of  replicas across datacenters.  Consolidation of multiple databases on the same server allows service  providers to save significant resources because many production database  servers are often under&shy;utilized.  We studied the trade&shy;off between the amount of memory and the I/O  bandwidth assigned to OLAP workloads, and developed a principled  approach for allocating resources to tenants in a manner that minimizes  the total number of servers required to host all tenants while  satisfying the SLA of each tenant.
