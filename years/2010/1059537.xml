<AbstractNarration>PhD candidate Dvera Saxton (American University), supervised by Dr. Brett Williams, will investigate the relationship between types and scales of regional socioeconomic production systems and worker health. The research, which will be carried out among migrant farm workers in Central Coast California, will focus on the differential effects of the organization and scale of work in both conventional and organic agricultural production systems. Research questions include: 1) How are production and labor organized? (2) How do organizational differences shape farm worker health experiences? (3) How do farm workers respond to the physical effects of work? Research methods will include ethnographic interviews, participant observation, and health perception maps. This research is important because it will contribute to social scientific theory of the new relationships between the organization of work and embodied human experience in the context of changing agricultural production systems. Findings from this work also will elucidate the social effects of sustainable production systems. Supporting this research also supports the education of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

I discovered that the economic, political, and social power of corporate agribusinesses in California pervades not only the workplace, but policy making, and state and non-profit social and health safety nets.

These exclusionary or unenforceable laws in addition to practices of legal and social neglect proved to be far more significant in shaping farmworker health outcomes than the variables of organic and conventional production.

Following the feedback of farmworkers, I examined two sets of agricultural labor and environmental polices: the workersÃ† compensation system and the CA Department of Pesticide RegulationÃ†s approval of the toxic pesticide, methyl iodide.   FarmworkersÃ† experiences with work-related co-morbidities and pesticide exposure remain under-attended to by biomedical models and the legally mandated limits of occupational medicine.

These "reverse remittances" from Mexico also provide emotional and social support to immigrant farmworkers in the U.S.  Farmworkers confront multiple assaults to their health, living with simultaneous health, social, economic and environmental problems at the individual, family, community, and binational levels.
