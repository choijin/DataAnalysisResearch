<AbstractNarration>The Green Algae Tree of Life (GRAToL) is a project involving the collaboration of five institutions to understand the evolutionary relationships of all of the major groups of green algae, a diverse group of more than 14,000 photosynthetic species worldwide.  Green algae are abundant and play important roles in a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic habitats, including deserts, extremely salty ponds, and coral reefs, and several species are symbiotic partners with lichens and animals.  Thus, green algae are important primary producers in most ecosystems.  Green algae are diverse in form - from microscopic single cells to large seaweeds - and function as important primary producers in most ecosystems.  The project will employ DNA sequence data to assemble a tree of life reflecting the evolutionary history of the group.  This tree will be critical for an improved classification of known species of algae as well as species that are yet to be discovered.  The project will facilitate further studies of green algae genomics and evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train 3-4 postdoctoral researchers, several graduate students, and numerous undergraduate students in basic research on algae and genomics.  New analytical tools will be developed for use by the broader scientific community.  A public exhibit on the GRAToL will be produced, along with a web site containing images and other information on evolution of the group that will be of interest to educators and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Overview of the project on Assembling the Green Algal Tree of Life (GrAToL) The GrAToL project is an exploration into the diversity evolutionary relationships of the green algae, mostly aquatic photosynthetic organisms that are close relatives of the plants that live on land.  Using advanced tools of molecular biology and computer analysis, groups of investigators from three universities and two botanical natural history collections have unraveled the major trends in evolution of this important groups of plants.  This report provides project information related to the conjugating green algae, the most diverse types of green algae found in freshwater ecosystems worldwide, and one that includes the genus Spirogyra, a well-known model system studied in many primary and secondary schools.     Conjugating Green Algae and GrAToL Conjugating green algae reproduce by the fusion of cells (conjugation) rather than the release of sex cells into the environment.  Despite the fact that they are simple in structure (single cells or cells joined together in filaments or colonies), they possess a number of features of cell division and physiology that suggest they are evolutionarily close relatives of the first plants that colonized dry land a half billion years ago.  Our part of the GrAToL project has confirmed this close relationship and provided a more detailed understanding of the phylogeny, or family tree, of these algae.  The project has discovered new species and new branches within this family tree that will help us understand both the diversity and history of these algae over long spans of evolutionary time.  Understanding of the genetics and structure of the common ancestor of conjugating green algae and their near relatives, the land plants, enables us to infer how land plants first gained a foothold and then diversified so widely and so rapidly to form the dominant vegetation of forests, prairies, savannas, and other terrestrial habitats.   The research also provides the starting point for further studies of the many unknown species of conjugating green algae alive today in freshwater habitats across the globe.   Products and Discoveries This research has illuminated some of the earliest events in the evolutionary history of conjugating green algae and other advanced green algae known as charophytes, including an improved understanding of the evolutionary history of their chloroplast genomes. As part of this research, we discovered new species and lineages of conjugating green algae from California and Portugal. These new discoveries reveal that there are many undescribed species of algae in freshwater ecosystems. It is also apparent that researchers have underestimated the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of the conjugating green algae.   More than 20 publications in peer-reviewed journals and books have been published, as well as a number of blogs and papers for the general public.  Presentations of papers and posters were contributed to two International Phycological Congresses, and national meetings, including the Phycological Society of America and the Botanical Society of America, and regional meetings such as the Northeast Algal Symposium.   Public Engagement and Broader Impacts  The GrAToL project has performed many outreach activities and provided training to a new generation of scientists who will study algae and plants.  A postdoctoral researcher was trained and contributed to numerous scientific publications resulting from the project.  A half dozen undergraduate students were trained in modern methods of research on genomics and evolution.  A science teacher worked for two summers on educational modules for high school courses in Advanced Biology and Environmental Science.  The Principal Investigator, postdoctoral scientist, students and teacher also participated in public presentations on the science of algae in a natural history museum and at national and international scientific festivals and conferences, including the American Society for Cell Biology, The USA Science and Engineering Festival, the Phycological Society of America.  In addition, exhibits on algae were presented to thousands of visitors to open houses and members' night events at the museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.
