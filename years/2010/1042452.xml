<AbstractNarration>The University of Virginia proposes to leverage and scale the Tapestry Workshops, a successful series of workshops for high school computer science teachers that includes training in both content and in methods for attracting and retaining women and minority students. After participating in this workshop, teachers report success in recruiting more students - particularly girls and minority students - to their classes. With this proposal, the Tapestry workshops will be scaled for national impact with a new workshop, Teachers Attract Girls to high school CS (TAG HSCS) that will train "trainers" to organize new Tapestry-type workshops in their own geographic regions. Specifically, the proposed effort will recruit organizers for train-the-trainer workshops to be held in conjunction with SIGCSE, the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, and the Regional Hopper Celebrations; it will create community among those organizers for sharing resources; it will replicate the Tapestry workshops around the country; and it will develop and distribute an NCWIT Program-in-a-Box for offering Tapestry-type workshops. The community of organizers will be sustained in part through attendance and sessions at the annual NCWIT meetings. The project will ensure workshop quality by reviewing and consulting on plans, providing tested content, and funding participants for the first implementations. Together these trainers and the teachers who participate in their workshops have the capacity to have a broad impact on the entry and early experiences of underrepresented students in computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tapestry workshops (www.tapestryworkshops.org) are highly successful face-to-face high school computing teacher professional development workshops that focus explicitly on improving diversity in computing. The workshops improve high school computer science teachers? abilities to attract and retain more and more-diverse students in computing. Over the course of the grant, twenty-two workshops were offered to over 600 HS teachers. Tapestry teachers now reach more than 11,000 students every year, many of whom would never have previously considered studying computer science.  During three-day workshops, Tapestry participants explore activities for gaining the interest of all students; interact with national experts on teaching and diversity practices; meet university faculty desiring to serve as ambassadors to their schools; and form a network of like-minded people for ongoing discussion and development.  A Tapestry Workshop has the following components:  &middot; Motivate the importance of diversity in computer science classes;  &middot; Describe proven, field-tested practices for increasing the number and diversity of students in high school computing classes;  &middot; Demonstrate teaching methods that engage students regardless of sex or ethnicity;  &middot; Provide high-quality resources (e.g., NCWIT Programs in a Box, Aspirations, and Counselors for Computing materials);  &middot; Discuss teacher challenges and how to overcome them;  &middot; Conduct daily integration activities;  &middot; Commit to carrying out elements of recommended practices and strategies.  By focusing on teachers, Tapestry workshops produce measurable and ongoing improvements in computing diversity. Teaching the teacher ultimately affects many more high school students than direct intervention with students would affect.
