<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator plans to study algebraic structures that arise&lt;br/&gt;naturally from invariants of Legendrian submanifolds in contact manifolds&lt;br/&gt;as well as arbitrary submanifolds in smooth manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;More specifically,  the invariants for a Legendrian submanifold come from&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic curves in certain symplectic manifolds, while the invariants&lt;br/&gt;for a smooth submanifold arise from open string topology which&lt;br/&gt;is based on the intersection theory of the manifold's path space.&lt;br/&gt;Both theories have algebraic structures guided by topological field theory.&lt;br/&gt;Part of this project is to refine the&lt;br/&gt;language of differential graded operad algebras to express the two&lt;br/&gt;theories in the similar algebraic language.&lt;br/&gt;There is a growing body of evidence that suggests a connection between the&lt;br/&gt;string topology of a manifold and the holomorphic invariants for its lift in&lt;br/&gt;the symplectic cotangent bundle or contact unit cotangent bundle.&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator plans to define and compute some of these&lt;br/&gt;invariants, hopefully leading to a connection between the two theories&lt;br/&gt;when the smooth submanifold is a knot in Euclidean 3-space.&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator also proposes several more computational&lt;br/&gt;projects related to knots in 3-space and smooth surfaces in 4-space,&lt;br/&gt;also defined using holomorphic curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contact geometry makes many appearances in physics, from optics&lt;br/&gt;to thermodynamics to classical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;For example, particles obeying the Least Action Principal from mechanics&lt;br/&gt;translate into objects in contact geometry (or its closely related field,&lt;br/&gt;symplectic geometry) known as holomorphic curves.&lt;br/&gt;Studying these holomorphic curves have led to some powerful&lt;br/&gt;and sometimes surprising discoveries about contact rigidity and contact&lt;br/&gt;dynamics. Knot theory has applications in understanding large and small &lt;br/&gt;aspects of the universe, as well as long DNA strands confined to small space.&lt;br/&gt;A central question in knot theory is determining&lt;br/&gt;the complexity of knots which in turn requires developing computable&lt;br/&gt;non-trivial knot invariants.&lt;br/&gt;Again holomorphic curves has recently provided a plethora of such useful&lt;br/&gt;knot invariants.&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator plans to develop other knot invariants,&lt;br/&gt;motivated by string theory, that should be connected to these invariants&lt;br/&gt;based on holomorphic curves.</AbstractNarration>
