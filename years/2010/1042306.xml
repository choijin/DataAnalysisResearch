<AbstractNarration>Hampton University, in collaboration with Carnegie-Mellon University, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, the University of the District of Columbia, Norfolk State University, Winston-Salem State University, Morgan State University, Jackson State University, Elizabeth City State University, Duke University, the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa, and the University of Michigan, proposes the ARTSI Alliance (Advancing Robotics Technology for Societal Impact). ARTSI is a consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and major research universities (R1s) working together to increase African American participation in computer science, with a focus on robotics. This extension proposal will expand ARTSI to seventeen Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and roughly 10 major research universities (R1s). Hampton University is the new lead institution; Carnegie Mellon University remains the lead R1 school. The extension introduces three new initiatives that (1) improve the quality and uniformity of robotics instruction by developing robotics curriculum modules specific to the needs of HBCUs, (2) pilot a program to attract STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students to HBCUs by offering robot programming activities in local high schools, and (3) pilot skill-building program for rising sophomores to better prepare them to become involved in robotics research. The extension also includes new collaborations with the Caribbean Center for Computing Excellence (a BPC Alliance in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The ARTSI Alliance consists of the following schools:  HBCUs:  Spelman College, Hampton University, University of the District of Columbia, Florida A and M University, Norfolk State University, Morgan State University, Winston -Salem State University, Elizabeth City State University, Jackson State University, Tennessee State University, North Carolina A &amp; T University, Howard University, Fort Valley State University, Virginia State University, University of Maryland Eastern Shore and Bowie State University   R1s: Carnegie Mellon University, Duke University, University of Alabama, Georgia Institute of Technology, Brown University, University of Pittsburgh, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania and University of Michigan  This grant was part of a collaborative grant with several of the schools listed above.  The outcomes listed below represent only those that occurred at Norfolk State University as a partner school in the ARTSI Alliance.  The outcomes are as follows:  Over the duration of the grant at least 30 computer science students at Norfolk State University (NSU) were exposed to robotics through competitions, outreach activities and the robotics course.  Four of these students are now matriculating in graduate computer science/computer engineering programs. These students have been accepted at the following graduate schools, Norfolk State University, University of Southern California, University of Connecticut and Virginia Tech. Approximately 100 students in K-12 in the Hampton Roads have been exposed to a robotics presentation and have programmed  the LEGO Mindstorm NXT robots.  The 45 minute presentation exposed these students to the uses of robots and their impact on society.  The students then actively engaged in a short challenge that required them to use a graphical interface to program the robot to accomplish two tasks.  The principal investigators worked with other programs at NSU such as Saturday Scientist and Science is Alive. A robotics course has been incorporated in the curriculum of the computer science department as an advance topics course.  It was taught using the Create/ASUS and the Calliope, a robot that was designed for use by the participating ARTSI schools, during the fall semester of each year of the grant. This course will continue to be taught in the department as long as the enrollment meets or exceeds the minimum enrollment cap for upperlevel courses in the department. Two short workshops on how to program the Mindstorm NXT robots were given to help approximately six teachers in the Norfolk School System learn how to build one of the robots supported by Mindstorm NXT kit and then learn how to program that robot.
