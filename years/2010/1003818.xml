<AbstractNarration>The research team, in this collaborative proposal, aims to produce regional decadal-scale climate forecasts from paleo proxy data.  Generally, the researchers will improve existing analytical methods and develop new statistical methods for the reconstruction of past climates from heterogeneous geological proxies (tree rings, ice cores, speleothems, corals, sediments), with particular emphasis on regional variability over the past two millennia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the research team will use the regularized expectation-maximization algorithm (RegEM) algorithm to exploit linear covariation in space among different climate variables or proxies to impute missing values and estimate climate statistics. The goal is to directly address uncertainties in data, especially surrounding missing data within a series.  This is important for paleoclimate data sets since the spatial or temporal series may not be continuous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve the training of students across disciplinary boundaries in a timely integration of statistics and climatology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This project aimed to improve our knowledge of climatic changes before the era of widespread thermometer measurements (around CE 1850) by developing better datasets and statistical methods.  We advanced methodologies to reconstruct past climate from proxy observations, first by significantly updating a widely-used method, RegEM: the new code is more efficient, more flexible, and exports a richer output that will help in interpreting its results. In parallel, USC/Stanford postdoc Dominique Guillot developed a close cousin, GraphEM, based on a sparse representation of relations between climate objects (e.g. temperature measurements). USC graduate student Jianghao Wang then showed that GraphEM can outperform competing methods when it is given enough reliable information about past climates from ``proxy'' data.    How much is enough? What we found was that the existing proxy database yielded estimates of past spatial temperature patterns that were greatly method-dependent. For instance, a prominent study found that the differences in sea surface temperature (SST) between the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 950 - 1250 AD) and the Little Ice Age (LIA, 1400 - 1700 AD) displayed a La Ni\~na-like pattern (cold eastern tropical Pacific, warm western Pacific). This pattern has been used as a key diagnostic to evaluate climate models by the venerable IPCC, but no simulation has been able to reproduce this SST pattern, and the discrepancy has been blamed largely on model deficiencies.  What we found was that, by applying 4 different reconstruction methods to this dataset, we got 3 different answers -- a worrying lack of robustness, and a sign that some major improvements were needed on the data collection side.   Thankfully, using an updated data synthesis from the awesome PAGES2k project, we found much more consistent results: a globally warm MCA and no hint of a La Ni&ntilde;a-like pattern. We were lucky enough to be swooped up by the \href{}{PAGES2k bandwagon}, and have been working on publishing an expanded, community-curated database of temperature-sensitive proxies (Fig. 1), with the hope that it will lead to more reliable reconstructions.    These efforts are paying off. We are just at the point where we can unveil preliminary results leveraging parts of the PAGES2k synthesis. Once again using GraphEM, Jianghao reconstructed global surface temperature over the past 2,000 years, and -- just as importantly -- rigorously estimated its uncertainties.  The global mean is shown in Fig. 2, and suggests, like a large body of previous work, that we really do live in extraordinary times: it is very likely warmer now that it has been in 2,000 years, and the rate of warming over the twentieth century does seem awfully unusual as well. But the beauty of a climate {\it field} reconstruction is that one can probe the {\em spatial} patterns and regional characteristics of this warming.  Fig. 3 thus shows that most regions are very likely to have experienced this warming, and that it was most intense over high-latitude northern continents.      There is much more that one can do with such a rich reconstruction. We are now working to diagnose the effects of variations in solar luminosity, explosive volcanism, and how this compares to climate model simulations. Most importantly, we are making all the code and data publicly available so others can check -- and extend -- our work. We are very thankful for the opportunities afforded by this grant, which will serve as a stepping stone for a deeper understanding of natural climate variability, bringing man-made climate change into sharper focus.
