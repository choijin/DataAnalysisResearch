<AbstractNarration>Thomas Soerens&lt;br/&gt;OISE- 1042778 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S.-Sri Lanka Planning Visit: Hydraulics and Hydrology of Sri Lanka?s Dry Zone Tank Cascade Systems in a Changing Landscape &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning visit will initiate a new research collaboration between University of Arkansas (UA) Civil Engineering Professor Thomas Soerens and University of Sri Jayewardenepura (USJ) Geography Professor G.M. Bandaranayake to study the hydraulics and hydrology of the reservoir cascade system in Sri Lanka's dry zone.  Sri Lanka, which has no natural lakes, has a network of about 18,000 small to large water reservoirs, called 'tanks', which date back to at least the fourth century BC.  Their purpose is to reuse water over and over and to recharge groundwater.  The tank cascade systems show a high degree of sophistication in their construction and design.  During the visit, the co-investigators will visit field sites in the dry zone to identify research sites, design the subsequent research project, and meet with Sri Lankan government officials.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit- Professor Bandaranayake has studied the tank cascade systems using Landsat imagery and other geographic data, but now hopes to incorporate the engineering aspects of the systems.  The collaboration with Dr. Soerens will bring expertise in hydraulics, water monitoring, and groundwater modeling and access to advanced geographic tools at UA?s Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies; Soerens will gain access to the field sites in Sri Lanka and the geographic expertise of his counterpart.  This research collaboration will advance the study of the tank cascade systems, which to date have been studied only from historical, cultural, and geographic perspectives.  The inclusion of quantitative investigations of their hydraulics and hydrology will advance understanding or these systems and enable the creation of a comprehensive model to analyze and predict the reaction of this important water resource in a changing landscape.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts- The tank cascade systems are the critical water resource for Sri Lanka's dry zone, which faces stresses from climate change and changes in population.  The results of the proposed research could be key in planning and management of water resources and other infrastructure. The proposed collaboration will lead to an ongoing program for students and researchers from UA and USJ to work together in the field and at the universities. The connection between the PIs, USJ, and CAST will strengthen the capability of the PI and his students in geographic analysis and hydrologic modeling. For UA students, the work will broaden their education as they consider the historical and social perspective of the tank systems. For UA students that participate in the field research, it will be a transformative experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a planning visit for the PI, Thomas Soerens from the University of Arkansas (UA) Department of Civil Engineering, to visit Professor G.M. Bandaranayake at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura (USJ) in Sri Lanka.  Sri Lanka, which has no natural lakes, has a network of approximately 18,000 small to large water reservoirs, called "tanks", which date back to at least the fourth century BC.  The purpose of a cascade of tanks in a meso-catchment is to reuse the water over and over again and to recharge groundwater.  The ethic behind the tanks is expressed by the 12th century Sinhalese king Parakrama Bahu the Great, renowned for rebuilding and expanding the tank system, who said "let not even a drop of rain water go to the sea without benefiting man".  The tank cascade systems show a high degree of sophistication in their construction and design and were perhaps the greatest engineering feat of their day.  The tanks became such a part of Sri Lankan culture that is often said that the tank and the dagaba (stupa) are the twin supports of Sinhalese culture and it was considered each kingÆs main task to build tanks and temples.   The tank cascade systems have proven to be invaluable during drought periods.  Social systems and tank management systems have evolved to sustain communities through droughts. There have been several studies of the water budget and the water management of the tank systems, but there remains a need for quantitative hydrologic and hydraulic research that includes measurements of sedimentation and groundwater levels.  These studies are needed to evaluate Sri LankaÆs water resources in a changing landscape.  In assessing the impacts of climate change, a thorough understanding of the tank cascade systems is critical.   The PI visited Sri Lanka in November, 2010.  He met with Professor Bandaranayake as well as researchers from the International Water Management Institute and UNICEF.  The PI, Dr. Bandaranayake, and S. Kumara of USJ made a field visit to the northern dry zone in Sri Lanka to visit prospective field sites.  They identified several good field research sites and planned future research.  The future research will include investigation of water budgets and hydraulics of the tank cascade systems, land use history and evaluation, human response to water scarcity, trends in crop rotation and yields, and analysis of historical weather and water data. A comprehensive model of the tank cascades including hydrology, hydraulics, and groundwater will be an advancement of our understanding of the systems and will help us analyze and predict the reaction of this important water resource to a changing landscape.   The connection established between the PI, Professor Bandaranayake, and their universities will be beneficial for them and for their students.  The collaboration on proposed research projects will lead to an ongoing program for students and researchers from both cooperating institutions to work together in the field and at their universities. The partnership will be a valuable resource for education at both universities.       Last Modified: 10/07/2011       Submitted by: Thomas Soerens]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
