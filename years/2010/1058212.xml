<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Brad Andersh and Wayne Bosma of Bradley University will use a tandem approach of synthesis and computational chemistry to investigate the mechanism and the scope and limitations of gamma-carbon-alkylation reactions of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds using equilibrating bases such as carbonates and alkoxides.  The specific mechanistic questions that will be addressed are: (1) why gamma-alkylation rather than alpha-alkylation occurs when an equilibrating base is used and (2) how the gamma-anion of a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound forms.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of chemical processes that are cost-effective and environmentally safe is an area of emphasis in the chemical community.  The goal of the proposed research is to understand and exploit a new method for selectively modifying organic compounds at one or more similar sites.  The proposed methodology is procedurally less complex than existing methods and will allow for new greener chemical processes.  The broader impacts of the project include (1) providing scientists with a greater understanding of this green method, and (2) the training of future scientists by providing research opportunities for undergraduate and high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 1898 Emil Knoevenagel published "Condensation von Malondiure mit aromatiachen Aldehyden durch Ammoniak und Amine" in Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft. For over a century, variations of this reaction have been a staple in the organic chemistÃ†s tool box for preparing materials for use as pharmaceuticals, adhesives, perfumes, and agrochemicals.   Because of the impact that this discovery has had, the reaction is known today as the Knoevenagel reaction.  This chemistry has been widely used because the reaction does not produce many waste products, and it is a highly selective chemical reaction. When dicarbonyl compounds are used, the reaction occurs exclusively at the alpha-carbon rather than at the gamma-carbon.   In 1958 Hauser and Harris reported a modification to this chemistry that allowed the reaction to occur exclusively at the gamma-carbon of dicarbonyl compounds.  However, to accomplish this, highly reactive reagents were needed to generate the necessary dianion for the chemistry to occur at the gamma-carbon.  In fact, the reagent that is most widely used to prepare dianions spontaneously ignites upon exposure to moisture including atmospheric water (humidity). We have found a new method for inducing chemistry at the gamma-carbon of dicarbonyl compounds that utilizes ethanol (drinking alcohol) and potassium carbonate, an ingredient used in cooking.  These findings contradict what every organic graduate student learns about gamma alkylation of beta-keto esters, i.e. that strongly basic dianions are necessary.   This NSF-sponsored research project was a joint experimental/computational effort to better understand why this counterintuitive reaction occurs.  Computational efforts focused on studying the relative energies of the reactants, products, and intermediate species produced in between reactants and products.  From this work, it was demonstrated that the products from the gamma-alkylation reaction are more stable than the products from the alpha-alkylation pathway.  Reactivity and spectroscopic studies were performed to provide a theoretical explanation (mechanism) for how this new environmentally friendly reaction occurs and to better understand the utility of this method for producing compounds that have been shown to have antifungal, antiviral, antinociceptive, and antioxidant properties.
