<AbstractNarration>Technical: The scientific goal of this project is to understand and control film growth and penetration of atomic layer deposited copper sulfide semiconductors onto mesoporous oxide templates. Critical to this research is use of atomic layer deposition to control the material growth at atomic resolutions to achieve ultrathin conformal copper sulfide-based semiconducting films that follow the contours of nanostructured oxides, and a suite of characterization tools to understand the mechanisms for film growth and resulting materials properties. The industrial partner, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., provides custom metal organic precursors, which enable unprecedented control over material stoichiometry and phase, a major issue with previous attempts to utilize Cu-based materials for solar energy conversion. The ability of the atomic layer deposition precursors to conformally coat the mesoporous nanoparticle and nanowire templates as a function of material processing conditions is studied using high resolution electron microscopy and optical studies. Focus is placed on understanding and controlling the material phase and homogeneity, trap state density, structural defects, and electronic structure as evaluated by X-ray synchrotron measurements, photothermal deflection spectroscopy, and the transport properties of materials and devices.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. It contributes to the development of semiconductor materials based on abundant, non-toxic elements that could be used for solar energy conversion. The PIs plan to expand their successful track record of training underrepresented physics students through collaborations with local Hispanic-serving community colleges and organizations. Much of this work is performed at the UCSC Advanced Studies Laboratory, providing students exposure to both NASA and industrial collaborators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The laboratory built a new low cost ALD/CVD materials deposition system that can deposit up to 3-different precursors for making metal sulfide alloy films via pulsed-CVD and ALD.  This system is specifically designed to work with non-pyrophoric precursors and with insitu generated hydrogen sulfide, providing a much safer alternative to more commonly used systems for CVD and ALD deposition systmes.  Using this system, we were able to successfully deposit Cu2S, ZnS and SnS2 ALD and CVD thin films using a low temperature and less corrosive organometallic precursors.  We also demonstrated how (Cu,Zn) and (Cu,Sn), and (Cu,Zn,Sn) sulfide alloys form using multilayer deposition, and the role of the temperature, substrate (i.e. glass, silicon, ZnS, TiO2, etc), and post annealing conditions in controlling the resulting stoichiometry. The local structure of these alloys, probed by EXAFS, revealed that the (Cu,Zn) sulfur system fully phase separates on the nanoscale producing ZnS and CuS, the (Cu, Sn) sulfur system successfully forms into Cu2SnS3, and the (Cu,Zn,Sn) sulfur system shows features of both. (Cs, Zn, Sn) sulfur nanoparticles were also studied to demonstrate how the synthesis method and dimension of the nanophase (0D versus 2D) affects overall composition and structure or sulfide alloys.  These materials were incorporated into PV device structures to understand the impact of the structural phases on device performance.  These results will be important for any group working on ALD or CVD sulfide films or on cupper sulfide alloys for solar energy conversion.

Carter and her students also ran an Expanding Your Horizons workshop focused on teaching high school students about solar energy.  Finally, Carter stated the IRIS Science Academy to teach hands-on science education to students who do not currently have access to this training.  Some of the students supported under this grant volunteered to help in the Summer Science Camps.             Last Modified: 11/05/2014       Submitted by: Sue A Carter]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
