<AbstractNarration>This project is investigating the following three research problems concerning knowledge extraction and data mining from real-time stream systems:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel Framework for Stream Mining Systems: &lt;br/&gt;The project is studying how to formalize the problem of large scale distributed knowledge extraction from high volume streams by defining appropriate local and end-to-end objective functions, along with resource and delay constraints that will guide the different optimization and adaptation algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology construction: &lt;br/&gt;The project is studying methods to organize classifiers into a connected topology mapped onto a distributed infrastructure. The research starts by studying linear chains of classifiers and then seeks to extend the work to multiple chains working in parallel, and to classifier trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decentralized Solutions based on Interactive Multi-Agent Learning: &lt;br/&gt;For large scale stream mining systems, where the classifiers are distributed across multiple nodes, the project is developing a decentralized decision framework and distributed algorithms for joint topology construction and local classifier configuration. In such distributed scenarios, optimizing the end-to-end performance requires interactive, multi-agent solutions to be deployed at each site in order to determine the effect of each classifier's decisions on the other classifiers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Multimedia data is now produced by more and more sources and in more and more formats: documents, email, transactions, tweets, audio files, videos, sensor readouts.  With the proliferation of the sources and formats of data, the extraction of information from these data is becoming ever more challenging. Magnifying this is that the information must frequently be extracted from many distinct data streams and in real time to be of value!  In this project, we have developed knowledge extraction engines that addressed the above-mentioned challenges and contributed to the foundation of a new field: multimedia stream mining.  We have developed novel methods required to perform multimedia stream mining, such as constructing, managing, and adapting applications for the extraction of information in real time.  Such applications are built as topologies of classifiers deployed on a set of processing nodes, which may be heterogeneous and distributed (so that the nodes can operate largely independently but still function in a coordinated way).  In the first phase of this project we developed efficient methods for constructing and ordering such classifier topologies to extract knowledge in real time (e.g. answering specific queries of interest) from dynamically changing data streams. These queries are posed as a set of conjunctive classification operations. Our methods are able to adaptively construct optimal classifier topologies that minimize the end to end misclassification of data, while also minimizing the end to end processing delay across distributed stream mining systems. Developing such methods was challenging since the optimal ordering of classifiers to extract desirable knowledge from a dynamic data stream is dependent on the changing data characteristics, system resource constraints, and the performance and complexity characteristics of each classifier. We first developed centralized algorithms for joint ordering and individual classifier operating point selection. We then proposed a decentralized approach for distributed stream mining systems and used reinforcement learning methods to design a dynamic routing based order selection strategy. We demonstrated that these strategies lead to rapid convergence to an optimal chain of classifiers, while requiring minimum coordination and message exchange among the distributed classifiers.  In the second phase of the project, we went a step further and developed online distributed algorithms which can learn how to construct the optimal classifier chain in order to maximize the stream mining performance based on the dynamically-changing data characteristics, but which do not require the distributed local classifiers to exchange any information. We prove that the long-term time average performance loss of the proposed distributed algorithm without message exchanges among classifiers as compared to the centralized algorithm which has available all the information tends to zero. This means that, surprisingly, our distributed algorithms without message exchange among classifiers do not incur any performance loss.

With the vast availability of traffic sensors from which traffic information can be derived, numerous traffic prediction techniques have been developed in recent years (e.g. Google traffic prediction), which in turn improve route navigation, traffic regulation, urban area planning etc. One key challenge in traffic prediction is how much to rely on prediction models that are constructed using historical data in real-time tra...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
