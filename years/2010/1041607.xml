<AbstractNarration>This award is an outcome of the NSF 09-524 program solicitation "George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Research (NEESR)" competition and includes the Georgia Institute of Technology (lead institution), Howard University (subaward), and Rice University (subaward). The project will utilize the NEES mobile shakers operated by the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team will evaluate the efficacy of a new class of innovative systems with recentering and/or high damping capabilities, and develop a framework for their design and implementation to retrofit reinforced concrete (RC) buildings to improve seismic performance. The goal is to validate, via innovative large scale field testing, a new class of retrofits for RC buildings. Five retrofit measures will be investigated, consisting of novel bracing systems, beam-column connection elements, or columns wraps. Common advantageous characteristics of the systems include the ease of application (requiring little-to-no heavy machinery), scalability and adaptability, passive nature, and need for little-to-no maintenance through the life-cycle. Furthermore, these systems aim to provide improved seismic performance in terms of minimal damage, enhanced post-event functionality, and improved cost-benefit compared to traditional retrofit approaches. The use of advanced materials in innovative systems will result in improved seismic retrofits for RC buildings that may find more widespread adoption due to their efficient design, minimal maintenance or disruption for installation, and enhanced cost-effectiveness.   The research includes a series of unique multi-scale experiments, coupled with detailed finite element simulations, fragility analyses, and cost-benefit studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research, education, and outreach plans include the following key components:  (1) first of its kind full-scale system-level validation of innovative retrofit systems (many based on shape memory alloys) using the NEES mobile shakers; (2) code-based designs of retrofit measures, in collaboration with experienced design professionals; (3) damage detection approaches using wireless sensors that project detailed information on the condition of the innovative retrofits, and the system response; (4) detailed fragility analyses, or vulnerability models, of buildings with and without retrofit; (5) cost-benefit and life-cycle cost analyses to inform decision-makers on optimal building retrofits; (6) international cooperation on reduced-scale system-level tests with Sherbrooke University in Canada, and medium-scale testing at National Taiwan University, and Hongik University (Korea); (7) a comprehensive outreach and education program impacting all levels (K-12, college, and industry); and (8) workshops focused on technology transfer with industry leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This research provides the first large-scale validation of high performance systems based on a series of multi-scale component and full-scale system-level field tests. Detailed analytical modeling and fragility analyses will be performed to assess the impact of various innovative retrofits on reducing the seismic vulnerability of RC buildings. A framework will be established, ranging from smart sensing and structural damage state estimation, to fragility modeling, performance assessment, and cost-benefit studies of retrofitted RC buildings. The validation of the new systems are expected to provide a marked advance in performance (seismic and life-cycle) through innovative design, material usage, and implementation to transform current approaches for seismic retrofit of buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of the proposed research, education, and outreach program are four-fold. First, the novel multi-scale testing, coupled with detailed analysis, will provide the first known system-level validation of such high performance systems. Second, the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and minimal disruption caused by retrofits proposed can result in superior retrofit approaches with broad application to improve building performance nationwide. Third, the collaboration with industry partners and field testing of retrofits in real structures will address realistic challenges of implementation and streamline transfer to practice. A series of workshops will bring together academics, researchers, and industry to advance the transfer of innovative systems for seismic building retrofit.  Fourth, a multi-faceted education program addresses the need to improve high school science and engineering curriculum, while addressing the lack of underrepresented students pursuing degrees in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES data repository.  This award is part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through the course of this project, the research team has evaluated the efficacy of a new class of innovative seismic retrofitting systems and developed a framework for their design, implementation, and assessment for retrofitting reinforced concrete (RC) buildings for improving their seismic performance. The goal is to validate, via innovative large scale testing, a new class of retrofits for RC buildings.  With the support of a large number of industry partners, four identical and full-scale 2-story 2-bay test frames were constructed outside the Structural Engineering and Materials Research Lab at Georgia Tech.  The frame design was carried out using simplified analysis techniques that would have been employed during the era when nonductile reinforced concrete frames were built before modern seismic code was used.  The structures replicated many deficiencies common to such older structures, including low global strength and stiffness, inadequate joint transverse reinforcement, inadequate column transverse reinforcement, and beams with substantially higher flexural capacities than columns. The construction was made possible by the support  of over 20 local construction companies in Atlanta who donated materials, supplies, and services to make the project possible within budget.     Using the NEES@UCLA mobile shakers, each of the four frames was dynamically excited until significant visible damage occurred.  Intended for baseline comparison, Frame #1 was tested in March 2014 as built, i.e. without any retrofitting measure.   Frame #2, tested in July 2014, all columns were retrofitted using high strength and high ductile steel bars mounted near surface to enhance the column flexural strength and ductility, and using carbon fiber-reinforced polymeric (CFRP) wraps to enhance column shear capacity.  Frame #3, tested in August 2014, columns on the ground floor were retrofitted with a commercially available pre-cured fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) jacket system.  Frame #4, tested in September 2014, two innovative superelastic shape memory alloy (SMA) braces were installed on the group floor.     Common advantageous characteristics of the retrofitting systems include the ease of application (requiring little-to-no heavy machinery), scalability and adaptability, passive nature, and need for little-to-no maintenance throughout the life-cycle. Furthermore, these systems aim to provide improved seismic performance in terms of minimal damage, enhanced post-event functionality, and improved cost-benefit compared to traditional retrofit approaches.
