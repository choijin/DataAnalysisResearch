<AbstractNarration>This project examines the large anticyclonic high pressure systems found over the oceans on the western sides of the Southern Hemisphere subtropical landmasses.  These features are generally regarded as the Southern Hemisphere equivalents of the Bermuda High and the Pacific High in the Northern Hemisphere, but this research will examine the extent to which the Southern Hemisphere anticyclones are different from their northern counterparts and are affected by the geography and climatology of the Southern Hemisphere.  Three broad questions are addressed: 1) How is the South Atlantic anticyclone during the southern winter connected with the West African and Asian monsoons? 2) How significant are the interhemispheric influences of the Atlantic Warm Pool on the southeastern Pacific? 3) In the Southern Hemisphere, do atmospheric-ocean interactions contribute significantly to the links between monsoons and tropical highs?  These research questions are addressed primarily through numerical experiments with atmospheric general circulation models and coupled atmosphere-ocean-land climate models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The southern subtropical anticyclones are important features of the earth's climate, and research leading to a better understanding their origins could lead to improvements in their representation in climate models.  The stratus clouds found in conjunction with the anticyclones are quite important for the Earth's energy budget, and better representation of the anticyclones in climate models may help us to produce better climate model projections of future climate change.  In addition, the work will provide education and training to a graduate student and two postdoctoral researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major focus of this project was the "subtropical highs", which are the regions of high sea level pressure that develop over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in the subtropics (~30 latitude). These are fundamental features of the global climate, and as such have been studied by several previous authors.  Nevertheless, outstanding questions remained.  For example: Why subtropical highs remain comparatively strong in the southern hemisphere during winter and summer, while those in the northern hemisphere are clearly stronger in summer than in winter?  We found that southern subtropical remain strong in winter due to interhemispheric influences of monsoons in the northern hemisphere, which is in its summer season.  This significant finding motivated us to continue work on monsoons and on the mechanisms responsible for the transmission of regional climate variability to remote locations (teleconnections).   Concerning the monsoons we found that sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Pacific and Indian Oceans provided the major contribution to the 20th century Sahel drought.  Anomalies in land-use-land-cover have first effects on the Sahel climate system.  Moreover, anomalies over Africa can have a larger global impact in comparison to anomalies over the other continents through equatorial wave propagation. This impact can be further enhanced by an "indirect" effect, as ocean-atmosphere interactions can generate remote perturbations that feedback on the region.  Concerning teleconnections, we clarified the mechanisms for propagation across the equator.  Turning to El Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), we elucidated mechanisms for teleconnections within the tropics and between tropics and subtropics. This is relevant to a better understanding of the Southern Oscillation component over the western tropical Pacific, and to why an essentially baroclinic signal in the tropics generated by El Ni&ntilde;o heating turns into a barotropic signal in the extratropics. Finally, we worked with coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (CGCMs).  In this context, we argued that improving the simulation of regional processes might not suffice to achieve an overall better model performance, as the effects of remote biases may override them.  Using CGCMs we estimated that melt water run-off originating from Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet mass loss in a warmer climate can result in regional sea level changes that are significantly different from the global mean. The project partially supported two graduate students and fully supported one postdoc. The results have been submitted for publication in refereed journals.  So far, 8 papers have been published, 1 is in press, and 2 papers are under review.         Last Modified: 03/20/2016       Submitted by: Carlos R Mechoso]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
