<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to develop a novel photoacoustic (PA) microscopy system that would enable the mapping of deeply buried subsurface defects in optically opaque materials. Imaging of subsurface objects with sub-100 nm dimensions in opaque materials remains a major concern to integrated circuit reliability and performance. PA techniques combine the benefits of the large penetration depth of ultrasound with the lateral spatial resolution of an optical probe.  However, the spatial resolution of PA techniques is limited by diffraction. To overcome these challenges, a novel approach is proposed for sub-wavelength PA technology by creating highly localized optical and ultrasound fields using: a) surface plasmonc nano-focusing for sub-100 nm confinement of the optical probe for high sensitivity detection of laser generated high frequency (0.5 - 10 GHz) ultrasound, and b) time reversal acoustics for spatial focusing of the scattered ultrasound field from nanoscale sub-surface objects. This PA system would provide an unprecedented spatial resolution and penetration depth for imaging sub-surface defects in microelectronic devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational and out-reach programs proposed are deigned to excite high school level students to pursue careers in STEM and provide unique multidisciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in the area of photoacoustic imaging.</AbstractNarration>
