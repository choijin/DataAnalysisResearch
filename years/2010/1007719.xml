<AbstractNarration>This project studies methods for analyzing large datasets using L1 and&lt;br/&gt;related regularization. Coordinate descent algorithms are developed to&lt;br/&gt;provide entire families of solutions for L1 and more aggressive&lt;br/&gt;concave penalized regression problems. Applications include&lt;br/&gt;generalized linear regression models for very wide datasets, and&lt;br/&gt;structure-finding algorithms for undirected graphical models. L1&lt;br/&gt;regularization is used as well to develop efficient convex algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for finding low-rank approximations (SVDs) to extremely large,&lt;br/&gt;sparsely populated matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops tools with a wide variety of applications,&lt;br/&gt;illustrated here in medicine and merchandising. Modern technologies in&lt;br/&gt;genomics produce measurements of half a million or more&lt;br/&gt;genotypes at particular locations (SNPs) along an individual's genome&lt;br/&gt;in a few hours. Armed with such measurements on a few thousand&lt;br/&gt;individuals, some sick and some healthy, this project develops&lt;br/&gt;powerful statistical tools for identifying groups of SNPs associated&lt;br/&gt;with diseases such as Alzheimer's or breast cancer. Online movie&lt;br/&gt;renters or book buyers are often asked to rate their&lt;br/&gt;purchases. Although each individual sees a minuscule fraction of the&lt;br/&gt;selections available, the investigators are able to develop&lt;br/&gt;recommender systems that exploit the overlap to learn genres of&lt;br/&gt;movies, and assign viewers to like-minded cliques, and which allow&lt;br/&gt;them to make recommendations for products not yet seen.</AbstractNarration>
