<AbstractNarration>Predicting how key ecological and biogeochemical processes respond to changing environmental conditions such as temperature, light and carbon dioxide concentrations requires a combination of field and laboratory manipulation at various scales. This proposal seeks to restore and enhance the ability of scientists at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON), and throughout the member consortium institutions, to examine how environmental changes impact key ecological and biogeochemical processes critical to the health of our coastal ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests two state of the art large walk-in environmental chambers in order to enhance our ability not only to simulate in-situ environmental conditions but experimentally manipulate environmental conditions in a controlled manner. Because LUMCON is Louisiana's primary field marine laboratory, the emphasis on empirical research is particularly high. Whether cultured organisms (fish, phytoplankton, marsh grass) are used, or organisms are brought back from sampling trips, the environmental chambers are a critical component of the experimental work that has been and will continue to be performed at LUMCON.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LUMCON site is incredibly active with student (K-12 and college) training and public outreach. College students actively publish with their faculty mentors, and the environmental chambers that need replacing are routinely used in educational/training programs on-site. Thus, the purchase of the new chambers will enhance the infrastructure of LUMCON in a way that benefits both researchers and students. LUMCON does a great job integrate educational opportunities into station programs. For example, they have an internship program onsite, hosted a JASON Foundation for education expedition, served as a partner site for the Gulf of Mexico Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence program, and developed the Bayouside Classroom. Such educational opportunities are invaluable to the area, as LUMCON services the needs of educational systems in a culturally diverse and typically underprivileged region of the United States.</AbstractNarration>
