<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Spinal cord injury leads to, among other things, cavity formation that interrupts the directional architecture of the cord and cell death (i.e., neurons, oligodendrocytes, and precursor cells). Considering this, a successful therapy will likely include new structural support for directed axon guidance as well as replacement cells. Electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds present a potential platform to help rebuild this lost architecture. Electrospinning is a technique that uses an applied electric field to draw out fibers of submicron to micron diameter from viscoelastic substances (e.g., a poly-l-lactide polymer dissolved in an organic solvent), creating biodegradable scaffolds that closely mimic the topography of the extracellular matrix. With the alignment of these fibers, greater control over cell orientation, migration, and process outgrowth can be achieved. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a population of adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to a pluripotent state, having the ability to differentiate into progeny characteristic of all three germ layers. These cells are of great interest because they mitigate much of the ethical and immunogenicity concerns that arise with embryonic stem cell therapies. This research aims to explore how the topography of nanofibrous scaffolds influence iPSC behavior and differentiation into cell types relevant to neural regeneration. Also, towards the goal of spinal cord repair,  this work looks to demonstrate how nanofibrous scaffolds may enhance  <span class="il">iPSC</span> generation and neurite outgrowth from <span class="il">iPSC</span>-derived neurospheres. Through this project we were able to demonstrate the feasibility of adult human dermal fibroblast transfection by the controlled release of cationic lipid-DNA plasmid complexes from negatively charged nanofiber scaffolds. This work aims to improve the ease somatic cell reprogramming using non-integrating plasmid transfection methods. In addition, we showed that nanofiber scaffold alignment can improve axon outgrowth from hiPSC-derived neurospheres by 2 fold.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/02/2010<br>      Modified by: Timothy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Downing</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2010/1015714/1015714_10016855_1291277571485_NSF Image--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2010/1015714/1015714_10016855_1291277571485_NSF Image--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Scaffold's aligned nanofibrous topography promotes (unidirectional) neurite outgrowth"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2010/1015714/1015714_10016855_1291277571485_NSF Image--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Scaffold's aligned nanofibrous topography promotes (unidirectional) neurite outgrowth"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image shows the effect of aligned nanofibrous scaffolds on human iPSC-derived neurons</div> <div class="imageCredit">Timothy Downing</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Timothy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Downing</div> <div class="imageTitle">Scaffold's aligned nanofibrous topography promotes (unidirectional) neurite outgrowth</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
