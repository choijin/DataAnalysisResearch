<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to create a new class of thermophotovoltaic cells cells that convert thermal radiation (heat) into electricity that harness wide-ranging heat temperatures frequently occurring in home appliances, factories, and during electricity generation.  The approach is to use recent advances in infrared photodetectors, developed in part by the PI, which maximize conversion of light into electrical current.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Thermophotovoltaics convert energy efficiently, but have traditionally not been able to convert photons of wavelengths &gt;3-microns, meaning that only very hot sources (&gt;1500Â°C) can be used.  The work proposed explores substitution of bulk materials with strained-layer superlattices, and replacing the traditional pin-photodiode with a new barrier-based design, called pBn, which reduce Auger and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination rates, respectively.  This could allow for thermal-energy conversion even at temperatures approaching body heat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In addition to creating a new course on the benefits and limitations of green energy technologies at Tufts, this grant will enhance the opportunity for students to apply and expand upon the knowledge they have gained in the classroom and utilize it in a research setting.  The PI is dedicated to training the next generation of engineers and scientists for this country, with a focus on underrepresented groups.  The proposed creation of universally accessibly web- and museum-based green-energy animations could help inspire underrepresented groups to pursue jobs in science or engineering.  Increased energy efficiency of power-generation, and potentially every device that uses electricity, would elicit profound, widespread societal and economic effects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded our research into developing technology to push the advancement of thermophotovoltics (TPVs).  TPVs convert infrared light, one form of heat, into electricity in a similar fashion to how solar cells convert light into electricity.  With TPVs, however, there are extra components to make the process more efficient, i.e. emitters and filters.   Through this work we made dramatic improvements in both emitters and created a new class of front-side filters.  The emitters were based off of a metamaterial design that uses nanostructured metal and dielectric layers.  These materials combine to create a narrow spectral band of high emissivity controlling the wavelengths under which the emitter will emit; thereby making it a "selective emitter".   While these have been designed before, the materials used were not suitable to TPV applications, since they could not withstand the high temperatures that emitters are exposed to in TPV devices (&gt;1000K).   By finding new material combinations we were able to overcome these limitations.  Over the time of this award TPV has moved from a field that few were working on anymore to becoming another hot area of research.  We would like to think that we had some small part in that.   This work resulted in over two dozen publications and conference papers.       Last Modified: 08/18/2016       Submitted by: Thomas E Vandervelde]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
