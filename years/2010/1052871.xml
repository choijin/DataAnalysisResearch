<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the research of Professor Simon Friedman at the University of Missouri at Kansas City to develop and refine the method of Light Activated RNA Interference (LARI), a technique being developed to control gene expression with light.  Specifically, with this tool, the Friedman group aims to exert spatial and temporal control of gene knockdown via RNA-interference, and also to control the extent of this knockdown.  To refine the approach, new photolabile groups will be developed and attached to the termini of small RNAs (siRNA and dsRNA), and their ability to reduce gene expression with light will be assessed in model systems.  This will include the light dependent knockdown of gene expression in transfected and endogenous gene targets.  The refined method will be used to examine and address questions in a range of biological systems, including those related to developmental biology and tissue engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the training of students at the interface of chemistry and biology, the Broader Impacts of the proposed work are aimed at the community beyond the immediate scientific community affected by LARI. In the first of two projects, the PI will refine a series of demonstrations, previously developed to help students understand the universality of chemical principles by showing how they apply to non-laboratory situations. In a second proposed activity, the PI will organize a series of discussions about science for the local community. These will be centered on biographical science movies that described the life of famous scientists.  The PI will use these films as a starting point to discuss the specific science that was being investigated, and also the nature of scientific inquiry, and how scientific questions are posed and ultimately addressed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching aim of this project was to develop new tools for controlling gene expression in a spatial and time dependent manner.  We accomplished this by using the existing mechanism of RNA interference as controlled by small interfering RNA (siRNA).  siRNAs allow for the specific reduction in expression of essentially any gene.  We modified siRNA with new chemical groups that were sensitive to light, thus allowing the process of RNA interference to be toggled with light.  By using these new chemical groups incorporated into siRNA, we were able to create patterns of expression in monolayers of cells.  These patterns were created by exposing the cells to patterns of light, as created by masks and a light source.  The mask creates areas of light and dark, or sometimes variations in darkness called a gradient.   One of our principle applications of our new method of spatially controlled gene expression was to attempt to make different arrangements of cells on a surface.  While many others have created such patterns, they universally depend on the spatial manipulation of the surfaces the cells are growing on.  While this can work in a monolayer, it wonÃ†t be effective if one is trying to shape larger collections of cells in three dimensions.  This is what is needed in order to create natural tissues in the process of tissue engineering.  We were able to demonstrate that we could spatially manipulate native gene expression, specifically a gene called pten, and in so doing, control how cells stuck to each other.  Where there was pten reduction, created by our specific light controlled siRNA, cells unadhered and were washed away.  In so doing we were able to create patterns of cells, patterns created for the first time through spatial manipulation of gene expression.   In the course of developing these methods, we also created a new reagent that allows any nucleic acid to be modified in a very specific manner, at the termini.  In addition, this reagent incorporates a convenient attachment point, for incorporating a very wide range of additional molecules, molecules that can be useful for tracking the nucleic acid (for example).  Finally, this reagent can also be easily cleaved using light, to regenerate the original, unmodified nucleic acid.  This regent is a powerful tool for the reversible labeling of any nucleic acid, and as such can be utilized in a wide range of potential applications, including assays for the detection of disease.  In conclusion, in executing this project we have successfully created a new method for spatial control of gene expression, we have applied it to the creation of a new approach to shape and engineer tissues, and in so doing, we have created a new type of chemical reagent that can be used to modify nucleic acids in a specific but reversible manner.
