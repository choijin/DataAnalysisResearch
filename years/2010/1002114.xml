<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research project between Arizona State University and Notre Dame University is to explore novel multijunction solar cell designs that offer ultra-high efficiencies for both space and terrestrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the approach is to use lattice-matched II/VI (MgZnCd)(SeTe) and III/V (AlGaAsSb) material systems grown on GaSb to demonstrate the designs with an increased number of junctions to realize breakthroughs in conversion efficiency. Before the device demonstration, very substantial research effort will be focused on the study of the doping in the II/VI (MgZnCd)(SeTe) materials. Various doping sources and methods will be explored. After the successful demonstration of both p- and n-types of doping, p-n junctions and tunnel junctions will be carefully studied before the final integration of them into new device designs. Device testing will be carried out to compare the performance with the theoretical predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this study include the understanding of the properties of the proposed new material systems and their application to ultrahigh efficiency multijunction solar cells, which can not only reduce the spacecraft launch payload but also enable the terrestrial concentrating photovoltaics systems to minimize the overall wafer demand and cost, from currently 75% down to 10% or less.  Since the proposed material systems uniquely offer very broad wavelength coverage, from UV to IR, they can also be used for full-color LEDs, multicolor photodetectors, and other optoelectronic devices.  The program will train 1.5 Ph.D. students and reach out to domestic multi-junction solar cell companies and local communities.</AbstractNarration>

These accomplishments have attracted strong interest from academia and industry.   This program has contributed to the publication of 1 book chapter, 17 peer-reviewed journal papers, 18 conference proceeding papers, 8 invited talks and 43 contributed conference presentations.     Broader Impacts  Ultra-high efficiency solar cells greatly reduce the spacecraft launch payload and enable many more capabilities that are not possible with low efficiency solar cells.  They are also necessary to enable terrestrial concentrating solar cell systems to reduce their overall semiconductor wafer demand and cost from the current 75% down to 10% or less, making it possible to solve the semiconductor materials bottleneck and lower overall electricity costs.  It is worth noting that the proposed material systems can also be used for full-color LEDs, offering an important alternative to nitrides.  It is expected that the reliability of the devices will be much improved compared to those grown on GaAs a decade ago because the (MgZnCd)(SeTe) materials can be perfectly lattice matched to GaSb or InAs substrates.
