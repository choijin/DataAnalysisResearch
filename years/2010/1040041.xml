<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and the Chemistry Division,  Chad Leverette and colleagues Garriet Smith and Monty W. Fetterolf from University of South Carolina (Aiken) will acquire a Raman microscope for spectroscopy and imaging applications of novel materials and biological samples.  The award will enhance research especially in areas of study that include (1) developing novel nanostructured surface-enhanced Raman (SERS) and surface-enhanced infrared (SEIRA) dual spectroscopic sensors utilizing glancing angle vapor deposition (GLAD), (2) the trace detection and differentiation of radionuclides in the environment, (3) investigating and determining the defense mechanisms in diseased coral sea fans, and (4) analyzing novel inorganic materials synthesized for hydrogen storage applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raman spectroscopy measures the vibrational frequencies between atoms and molecules in a sample.  Identification of these frequencies provides information on the chemical composition and structure of the material.  This widely used technique, employing lasers to probe the material, is non-destructive.  A Raman microscope allows one to scan across a sample to provide a spatial image of the response to the laser probe. This instrument will strengthen undergraduate education by connecting USCA students with scientists in two separate departments at USCA, with scientists throughout the university system, with researchers at a national laboratory, and with local industry.</AbstractNarration>
