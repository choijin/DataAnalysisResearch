<AbstractNarration>PI: (Jenny) Qiuyun Xiang &lt;br/&gt;co-PI: Robert G. Franks&lt;br/&gt;co-PI: DeYu Xie&lt;br/&gt;IOS - 1024629&lt;br/&gt;Evolution of Floral Display Strategies in Dogwoods - A Synergistic Approach to Explore the Developmental and Molecular Mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variation in the arrangement of flowers (i.e. the inflorescence architecture) affects the yield of many crop species by influencing the number of seeds and fruits and the ability to harvest the crop. Despite the importance of inflorescence architecture to humankind, little progress has been made in understanding how developmental and genetic changes have shaped inflorescence architectures in the diversity of flowering plants on earth. Species of Dogwood (Cornus L.) are popular ornamental trees in American landscapes due to their spectacular inflorescences. In addition to being beautiful, the genus Cornus offers us a unique opportunity to understand the evolution and development of different inflorescence architectures. Different Dogwood species exhibit a wide variation in inflorescence structures. In this project this interdisciplinary team of scientists will apply molecular and developmental approaches to understand the molecular basis for the diversification of inflorescence architecture in the Dogwood species. This greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of inflorescence development and evolution may enable efforts to breed agricultural varieties with inflorescence structures to allow greater agricultural productivity. The primary investigators of this project are also involved in a K-12 school outreach program in which members of this research team lead demonstrations at local grade schools, thus promoting scientific literacy at this early age.</AbstractNarration>
