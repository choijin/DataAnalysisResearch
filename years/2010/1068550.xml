<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Giovanni Ossola at the New York City College of Technology (City University of New York).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the largest and most powerful particle collider ever built, has begun operations. A major objective of the LHC is to search for the last missing particle predicted in the Standard Model of fundamental interactions, namely the Higgs boson.  However, the process of discovering new particles and interactions requires extraordinary efforts from both the experimental and the theoretical sides of the high-energy physics community in processing, analyzing, and then comparing a huge amount of data with theoretical models and predictions. The main objective of Professor Ossola's research is the development of new theoretical tools in order to increase the precision of these theoretical predictions.  Specifically, his research seeks to develop new methods for the automated computation of multi-particle one-loop scattering amplitudes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  Professor Ossola aims to establish and maintain a stronger connection between the events taking place at CERN and the New York City College of Technology (CUNY), one of the most diverse institutions of higher education in the United States. This connection will be achieved through presentations within the Physics Departments of the City University of New York, where the ongoing progress at the LHC will be discussed;  through the organization of public presentations, which will be directed to a broader audience outside of the physics community;  and through the involvement of undergraduate students in activities that will convey the excitement of the new discoveries of science.  New ideas and computational techniques will also be integrated into the development of new courses and curricula, which will provide encourage interest and participation in the sciences and technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The beginning of operations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the largest and most powerful particle collider ever built, marked the starting point of a new era for particle physics. The first objective of the LHC was to search for the last missing particle predicted in the Standard Model of fundamental interaction, the Higgs boson. After achieving this goal in 2012, the hope is to discover more than this long-awaited particle. Thanks to high energy and luminosity, the LHC explores the TeV energy scale for the very first time, possibly revealing "new physics" which is not described by the Standard Model. This process requires extraordinary efforts by both the experimental and the theoretical side of the high energy physics community, in processing, analyzing, and then comparing a huge amount of data with theoretical models and predictions.  The major goals of the research project "Automated Computation of One-loop Scattering Amplitudes", and therefore its intellectual merit, were related to the development of new theoretical and computational tools for the calculation of multi-particle one-loop scattering amplitudes, which describe the possible outcomes of proton collisions, such as the ones produced at the LHC, with unprecedented accuracy.  Under the support of NSF, the PI and his collaborators developed a new framework for Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO) calculations, called GoSam. After an initial phase of improvement and testing, the code has been published and released, and it is currently publicly available to all users. The GoSam framework, thanks to the combination of integrand-reduction techniques and traditional tensorial reduction, allowed for the completion of advanced calculations related to the production of the Higgs boson at the LHC, which are of great interest for the experimental collaborations. Papers such as "NLO QCD corrections to Higgs boson production plus three jets in gluon fusion" or "NLO QCD corrections to Higgs boson production in association with a top quark pair and a jet", both published by the prestigious journal Physical Review Letters, represent the culmination of many years of hard work in understanding the mathematical structure of scattering amplitude and using this information to design and develop new computational codes for their evaluation, but also the starting point for advanced phenomenological analyses which will allow to further extend our investigation of the building blocks of our universe.  The broader educational goal of the project has been to create a link between the exciting events taking place at CERN with the new results and discoveries coming from the LHC experiments and the community of students and faculty at the New York City College of Technology of the City University of New York, one of the most diverse institutions of higher education in the United States.
