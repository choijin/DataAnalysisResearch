<AbstractNarration>Truskett, Thomas M.&lt;br/&gt;CBET-1065357&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diffusing Probes of kT-scale Specific Protein-Protein and Protein-Carbohydrate Interactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with using Diffusing Colloidal Probe Microscopy (DCPM) to directly&lt;br/&gt;and nonintrusively measure kT and nanometer scale interactions of surface immobilized proteins and&lt;br/&gt;carbohydrates. Ensembles of freely diffusing colloids will be employed as ultra-sensitive probes to&lt;br/&gt;measure energy vs. separation dependent protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate potentials of mean&lt;br/&gt;force (PMF) between proteins/carbohydrates attached to colloids and planar surfaces. By using&lt;br/&gt;evanescent wave and video microscopy, DCPM will monitor three dimensional Brownian excursions of&lt;br/&gt;protein decorated colloids near homogeneous, heterogeneous, and patterned substrates with covalently&lt;br/&gt;attached and oriented proteins/carbohydrates. Because diffusing probes sample spatial positions according&lt;br/&gt;to their relative energies, statistical mechanical analyses of diffusing probes can be interpreted as net&lt;br/&gt;PMFs including superimposable non-specific (colloidal, macromolecular) and specific (residues,&lt;br/&gt;conformational) contributions. DCPM will interrogate protein and carbohydrate interactions by exploiting&lt;br/&gt;natural gauges accessible with diffusing colloidal probes including Brownian time scales (a2 /D), thermal&lt;br/&gt;energies (kT), and molecular length scales (nm) (and hence weak forces (~fN)).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is related to the fundamental and technological&lt;br/&gt;insights that will be gained into immobilized protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions.&lt;br/&gt;Specific biomolecular interactions to be investigated include: (1) Ca2+ dependent homophilic and&lt;br/&gt;heterophilic cadherin interactions on supported lipid bilayers, (2) CD44-hyaluronic acid (HA) interactions&lt;br/&gt;in the presence of competing oligosaccharides. Cadherins are transmembrane proteins whose interactions&lt;br/&gt;play a critical role in determining cell adhesion in cellular processes including for example tissue&lt;br/&gt;morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity, apoptosis, and cancer metastasis. CD44 is the main cell surface&lt;br/&gt;signaling receptor for HA, which is an extracellular matrix component. As a result, CD44-HA interactions&lt;br/&gt;regulate cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, morphogenesis, cell proliferation, cell signaling via regulation&lt;br/&gt;of gene expression and RNA splicing, cell differentiation, and metastasis. Ultimately, measuring how&lt;br/&gt;immobilized cadherin-cadherin and CD44-HA interactions are influenced by physical, chemical, and&lt;br/&gt;biochemical variables is important to understanding fundamental biology and biomedical applications.&lt;br/&gt;The first task of the proposed work is to covalently attach/orient proteins and carbohydrates onto&lt;br/&gt;silica colloids and surfaces either with or without supported lipid bilayers. To allow for deconvolution of&lt;br/&gt;non-specific and specific contributions to net potentials, the second task is to measure how the&lt;br/&gt;interactions of covalently attached/oriented carbohydrates and proteins are influenced by varying solution&lt;br/&gt;chemistries (e.g. ions, small molecules), physical configuration (e.g. orientation, spatial organization),&lt;br/&gt;competitive interactions (e.g. antibodies, monosaccharides), and biochemical variations (e.g. different&lt;br/&gt;types, mutations). The last task is to measure non-specific and specific interactions on model arrays&lt;br/&gt;consisting of patterned regions of carbohydrates or covalently attached/oriented proteins. Successful&lt;br/&gt;completion of proposed objectives will demonstrate a conceptually new approach to directly and&lt;br/&gt;sensitively quantify kT-scale non-specific and specific interactions that control non-covalent, equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;binding of proteins and carbohydrates immobilized on particles and surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research include scientific and technological outcomes as&lt;br/&gt;well as integrated education and outreach activities. The ability to directly and sensitively measure weak&lt;br/&gt;interactions between proteins and carbohydrate on synthetic material surfaces provides information to&lt;br/&gt;enable many biomedical applications involving diagnostics, devices, therapeutics, drug delivery, and&lt;br/&gt;tissue engineering. Such understanding provides a basis to quantitatively design, control, and optimize&lt;br/&gt;(formally engineer) the properties and behavior of immobilized proteins and carbohydrates in biomedical&lt;br/&gt;applications and provide new insights beyond what is known from trial-and-error discovery. In terms of&lt;br/&gt;education, research images/videos will be incorporated into undergraduate thermo and graduate&lt;br/&gt;colloid/polymer elective courses and execution of the proposed research will involve training&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate students. In terms of outreach, content involving optical microscopy of&lt;br/&gt;colloids will be adapted for use in programs for 7-12 students and public museum presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many technologies, from injectable drugs for the at-home treatment of disease to new batteries for powering portable devices, rely on our ability to create liquid forms of matter with novel combinations of properties required for a specific application.  Unfortunately, a systematic and inexpensive means for designing the properties of a liquid (e.g., its capacity to absorb heat, resistance to flow, conductivity, color, etc.) for a given use has been missing, in large part due to a lack of fundamental understanding of what controls these properties.  For example, it is not generally known how to make sure that a liquid form of a therapeutic drug will flow easily enough to be injected into a patient via a small syringe, while also ensuring that the liquid contains a high enough concentration of the active ingredient to provide the required dosage.  In this and many other applications, the properties required to process or deliver a material are not necessarily aligned with those needed in the final product.    The goal of this project was to explore one new, but general, idea for how to use computer simulations and theory to engineer liquids with specific and desired properties that meet various constraints. The results from this project demonstrated new concepts important for designing particles with an enhanced transport rate through liquids (important for drug delivery and chemical reaction applications).  It also introduced a new idea for how to create concentrated liquid forms of therapeutic protein drugs appropriate for injection into patients. Finally, it addressed several new ways that particles in a liquid can be designed to "self-assemble" for various engineering goals.  These projects were primarily carried out by four graduate students and several undergraduate researchers supported by the grant.  The work resulted in 15 peer-reviewed publication, a patent application, and a new educational web applet for engineering, chemistry, materials science, and physics students.
