<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major technological advances over the last half-century have been fueled by the development of a fundamental understanding of materials.  Transistors, computers, and solid state memory devices are based on relatively simple solid state systems like silicon whose electronic properties are controlled at the atomic level.  More complex materials such as high temperature superconductors hold tremendous potential for new technologies in the future, yet in order to make progress we must understand and control the strong interactions between the electrons in these systems.  Indeed, one grand challenge of modern physics is a fundamental understanding of the unexpected behavior and phenomena that emerge in new materials with strong electronic interactions.  A key aspect of these phenomena is that the electron density becomes spatially dependent at a microscopic length scale (nanoscale).  This individual investigator award supports a project with a goal of identifying the conditions and underlying mechanisms under which these inhomogeneities emerge by systematically imaging the magnetic and charge spatial variations across several classes of materials using cutting edge magnetic resonance techniques.  Along with increasing our understanding of these materials, the research may lead to the development of new technologies in the future.  This project will support the education of a PhD student, and will revitalize US competitiveness with Asia and Europe where similar efforts are well established and growing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports a project with the goal of identifying the conditions and underlying mechanisms under which static nanoscale variations in electronic density emerge in strongly interacting condensed matter.  In contrast to silicon, where electrons are essentially noninteracting, electrons in strongly correlated materials exhibit unexpected behaviors and emergent phenomena which cannot be predicted a priori.  A fundamental understanding of the ground and excited states of these materials is one of the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, is critical for the design and functionality of new materials, and is the focus of a tremendous international research effort.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) will be used to systematically probe the inhomogeneous electronic states in several correlated electron systems to provide detailed information about the nanoscale spatial correlations of the spin and charge inhomogeneities in the bulk.  These experiments will address some of the most fundamental and hotly contested issues in condensed matter physics concerning the nature of the inhomogeneous electronic states that emerge in the transition metal oxides, the heavy fermions, and the ferropnictide superconductors.  Along with increasing our understanding of these materials, the research may lead to the development of new technologies in the future.  This project will support the education of a PhD student in these advanced technologies, and will revitalize US competitiveness with Asia and Europe where similar efforts are well established and growing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was designed to investigate the behavior of strongly correlated electron materials at the nanoscale using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  Many of the materials that are of interest to condensed matter scientists have unusual properties such as superconductivity that emerges in a region of phase space that is close in proximity to antiferromganetism. This behavior is surprising because usually magnetism and superconductivity are anathema to one another.  In fact, one of the most surprising recent discoveries is that high temperture superconductivity occurs in iron-based materials. Iron, of course, is well known for its magnetic properties.  In the iron-based superconductors, the superconductivity and antiferromagnetism do not coexist locally, but form something akin to 'electronic mayonnaise', in which these two types of order are physically separate, but at the nanoscale.  Our work using NMR to study the microscopic behavior identified this coexistence regime, where frozen antiferromagnetic clusters exist within a superconducting background matrix.  This inhomogeneity occurs in a material that is nominally very homogeneous, and exists as a pristine single crystal.  The strong correlations between the electronic degrees of freedom ultimately give rise to the inhomogenous behavior we observe.     Similar behavior was also investigated in other types of materials, including high temperature superconductors based on copper, as well as low temperature heavy fermion superconductors based on cerium.  This work helps to provide a fundamental understanding of the origins and nature of inhomogeneity in modern materials that someday may be exploited for applications.
