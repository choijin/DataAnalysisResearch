<AbstractNarration>Building on the successful selection and funding of two UK e-Science research themes related to data-intensive computing (3DPAS and DIR; to be hosted by the e-Science Institute, Edinburgh), we will couple US Researchers to the intellectual advances that these year long research themes (2010-11) will engender. This award will support participation by ten US-based researchers in three workshops, as part of the eSI Research themes on data-intensive research to be held in Edinburgh, UK. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshops associated with the eSI Research Theme will be organized along the following three tracks: (i) Abstractions for distributed and dynamic data-intensive applications, (ii) Understanding the issues to enable Relational technology to be widely and effectively used in the support of data-intensive methods at extreme scales, and (iii) Algorithms, Software and Cyberinfrastructure for data-intensive research</AbstractNarration>

Such data is increasingly large-scale and distributed: the datasets, their locations, and associated scheduling decisions are time-dependent.

The specific aim of this project was to support the participation of US researchers at these workshops on Distributed Dynamic Data-Intensive Programming Abstractions and Systems organized at/by UK e-Science Institute organized.  In the process US researchers were able to appreciate the broader landscape as well as improve the understanding of US applications as well as improve state-of-the-art in development and deploying such '3D' applications. The workshop report is available at the UK eSI wiki (www.esi.ac.uk).  The primary findings are also captured in a publication to be submitted to the journal on concurrency and computation: practise and experience.
