The report is a summary of the outcome of the working group  deliberations and other important outcomes of the meeting.  It  highlights the progress in the development and implementation of the  observing network. It also shows progress in implementation to document  the changes now ongoing in the pan-Arctic and the broad  multi-disciplinary participation in the effort.  By documeting the results of the meeting, the broader impacts of the report will serve as a major tool  for informing the broad science and lay communities of AON work, as  well as provide access to the rich datasets that are an outcome of AON. The report will also serve as justification and background for the future evolution of AON.  The intellectual merit of the report is highlighted through a collection of short project progress reports, a summary of lessons learned during the International Polar Year (IPY), assessments of key challenges impeding AON development, recommendations for fostering international coordination and colaboration post IPY, assessment of AON data usage by both the scientific community and stakeholders, and recommendations for encouraging more widespread data use with the scientific community.
