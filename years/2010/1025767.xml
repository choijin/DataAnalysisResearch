<AbstractNarration>The question of shared leadership is growing more important as complex world issues increasingly require distributed collaboration. Organizational researchers lack an understanding of the multiple kinds of leadership roles that virtual teams rely on and of the optimal balance of these roles. Previous research has confounded virtuality and distribution or included only a few combinations of these characteristics.  &lt;br/&gt;Systematically examining the combined effects of degree of virtuality and geographical distribution on emerging forms of leadership and outcomes, this research includes a lab study to understand leadership structure in virtual teams. It investigates how team cognitive processes and performance are affected by: (1) how leadership is shared or distributed among internal and external team members, (2) the degree of virtuality inherent in the tools used for collaboration (e.g. synchronicity, informational value), and (3) the degree of distribution among team members (e.g. fully distributed, partially distributed). Results will extend existing theory on shared leadership and team cognition to hybrid teams of virtual and face-to-face interactions to illuminate the relationship between leader behaviors and team outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These findings will ultimately provide evidence-based guidelines for practitioners regarding the form(s) of leadership best suited for particular types of virtual teams and the corresponding processes required for effective performance. Additionally, findings will contribute to knowledge concerning how virtual team structure interacts with computer and communication support technology to impact team process and performance with potentially transformative results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[As complex world issues increasingly demand collective expertise from around the globe, the prevalence of distributed collaboration both within and across organizations has risen drastically. Such collaboration is often accomplished through teams composed of physically distributed members who utilize a range of virtual tools (e.g., email, videoconferencing) to achieve their goals. Driven by this trend, research has begun to disentangle the factors which lead to successful performance within these virtual teams.  While leading such teams has been shown to be challenging for leaders, there is a lack of practical evidence-based guidance regarding what behaviors leaders should engage in and the degree to which leadership should be distributed throughout the team.  The research supported by this award was designed to provide insight into how the degree to which team members are physically distributed from one another and the amount of social information afforded to them by the communication method (chat, teleconference, videoconference) impacts the type of leadership behaviors that should be engaged in as well as the structure of such leadership (how is it best distributed within the team).   The results of the study provided many new insights into the nature of leadership within distributed teams.  Specifically, results indicated the degree to which team members are distributed and the amount of social information transmitted by the method of communication are important determinants of which team members engage in leadership behaviors and the relation of those leadership behaviors to teamwork.  Leadership that was engaged in by those members who were distributed was found to facilitate teamwork and subsequent team performance to a greater extent than leadership exhibited by members who were co-located with one another. Furthermore, communication methods that provided more social information were found to facilitate leadership occurring within those team members who were distributed. Lastly, findings indicated that the distribution and the amount of social information provided by the communication medium impacted the degree to which team members identified with particular subgroups within the team.  Results suggest that distribution may cause members to identify more strongly with those members with whom they are co-located, while the use of rich communication media (more social information provided) facilitates identity among those members which are distributed.  The results of this study are valuable to both science and practice.  Our findings advance science by providing insight into how leadership may be best distributed within teams where co-location of members is not possible and highlights the importance of investigating teams that are partially distributed.  With regard to practice, the results of the study are valuable as practitioners know very little about how leadership behaviors and the corresponding distribution of such behaviors are impacted by the degree to which team members are distributed or the degree of social information provided by the communication method.  This is of particular importance in the case of partially distributed teams where some members are co-located and other team members reside at one or more additional locations &ndash; a condition that is increasingly prevalent in todayÆs teams, but little studied.  Without such knowledge it becomes difficult to train leaders how to maximize performance within the many forms which teams take in organizations today; thereby, leading to wasted resources (time, money, personnel).  Additionally, the results regarding the effects of distribution and communication medium on identity formation within the team suggest mechanisms that team leaders can use to form team bonds which, in turn, may overcome some of the prior reported challenges in communication, coordination, and trust within distributed teams.
