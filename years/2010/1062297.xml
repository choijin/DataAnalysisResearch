<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to investigate how working on service-learning design projects affects students' attitudes towards people with disabilities.  Students are working on either an adapted physical activity capstone project or an industry-sponsored capstone project. Quantitative instruments are being developed to measure students' motivation, design self-efficacy, and attitudes toward people with disabilities. Qualitative assessments that consist of student reflections and focus group interviews are also being conducted. The project helps increase the understanding of student motivation, perceptions of engineering design, and the principles of inclusion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The tremendous benefits of service-learning on student motivation and learning have been well established. The majority of students in service learning courses reported positive increases in understanding, learning, and motivation. Yet prior studies had not focused on direct involvement of students with people with disabilities, and had not investigated how working on service-learning projects affects student attitudes towards people with disabilities.  People with disabilities constitute a minority group within society and as such are stigmatized in a similar way to other social minority groups. Many people with disabilities can become marginalized through prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. For people with disabilities, physical activity provides a range of benefits including physiological, emotional, cognitive, and social aspects.  The primary goal of this study was to advance understanding of design learning in a service-learning context in which engineering students design adapted physical activity devices that increase access to recreation for people with disabilities. Secondary aims of this study were: to evaluate collaboration between engineering and kinesiology students in a team environment; to improve our adapted physical activity design program by incorporating student feedback; to understand if engineering students participating in their project value the experience and confirm the necessity of such a program; and to determine if students consider pursuing employment in the field of designing devices for adapted physical activity.  Twenty-four innovative capstone projects involving the design of adapted physical activity equipment were completed by teams of engineering and kinesiology students as part of an interdisciplinary approach to meeting client needs. All teams were led by faculty advisors through the design process that ended with functioning prototypes. These prototypes had the potential to greatly enhance the quality of life for those individuals with disabilities who utilize the equipment.
