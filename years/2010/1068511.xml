<AbstractNarration>This research program explores the quantum physics of thin vapors of atoms and molecules at nanokelvin temperature scales controlled by laser beams, magnetic fields and electric fields. It seeks to uncover relationships between different, seemingly unrelated, physical properties of given many-body systems, to yield extremely precise knowledge about the interactions in certain systems that can flow without friction, to predict basic properties of vapors confined in a thin tube, to uncover new liquids and solids that are, counterintuitively, millions of times thinner than the air, to reveal properties of fast rotating strongly interacting quantum gases, and to understand the behavior of many atoms near narrow resonances. The project builds on the knowledge about one or a few atoms or molecules and extends to the collective behavior of a large number of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least one graduate student will participate in the project by close interaction with the principal investigator (PI) and learn a wide range of techniques and concepts in theoretical condensed matter physics. The project is interdisciplinary, bringing ideas from solid state physics and nuclear physics to the research of matter at extremely low temperatures. Theoretical results out of this project will stimulate experimental work on verifying or realizing them around the world, and are likely to have a very positive impact on the development of technology. Traditionally physics is about the properties of things that exist in nature; with the technology to control atoms more and more states of matter will be created, and become a focus of research. Public awareness of this change will be increased by talks and lectures by the PI.</AbstractNarration>
