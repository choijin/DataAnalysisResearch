<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research program is to explore and understand the microscopic origin of high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity in iron and copper based superconductors using neutron scattering as a primary tool. Specially, the project will focus on electron-doped iron and copper based high-Tc superconductors. We will investigate the nature of the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. Neutron scattering experiments, the core part of this research program, will be performed mostly at the high-flux isotope reactor (HFIR) and Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). However, the project will also utilize other world-class facilities in the U.S. and Europe when similar capabilities are unavailable at HFIR and SNS. The impact of this research program will include the training of the next generation of neutron scatters and elucidating the nature of the exotic properties of these high-Tc superconductors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF project addresses the fundamental physical processes that give rise to novel collective phenomena such as high-transition temperature superconductivity. The materials known to exhibit these collective phenomena are the strongly correlated electron materials. The understanding of these phenomena will not only enhance our knowledge of basic science, but also gives us the ability to design materials with novel and predictable properties. Specifically, the experimental program integrates neutron scattering experiments with lab based materials efforts, aimed at the fundamental understanding of the spin and lattice excitations in electron-doped high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors based on iron and copper. The objective of the program is to explore and understand the microscopic origins of various phases of iron and copper high-Tc superconductors using neutron as a probe. Neutron scattering experiments will be performed mostly at the high-flux isotope reactor (HFIR) and Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. However, the project will also utilize other world-class facilities in the U.S. and Europe when similar capabilities are unavailable at HFIR and SNS. The impact of this research program will include the training of the next generation of neutron scatters and elucidating the nature of the exotic properties of the correlated electron materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most unresolved problems in modern condensed matter physics is the determination of the microscopic origin of high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity.  Originally discovered in 1986, high-Tc copper oxide superconductors are derived from electron- or hole doping of their antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott insulating parent compounds.  Therefore, Mott physics and electron correlations may play an important role in the superconductivity of these materials.  In 2008, a new class of high-Tc superconductors based on iron pnictides or chalcogenides was discovered.  However, instead of being Mott insulators like the copper oxides, the parent compounds of iron-based superconductors are semi-metallic antiferromagnets, consistent with predictions from band structure calculations.  Intellectual merit: The primary research goal of this NSF contract is to study the interplay between electron correlations and superconductivity in high-Tc superconductors, and to determine if magnetism can induce high-Tc superconductivity.  Neutrons -with their wavelengths comparable to atomic spacings and their spins directly probing unpaired electrons in solids - have played a unique role in determining the magnetic properties of high-Tc superconductors. Using neutron scattering as a primary technique, our group has made major contributions to our understanding of the magnetic properties of iron-based superconductors.  In addition to determining the magnetic structure in their parent compounds, we have systematically mapped out electronic/magnetic phase diagrams for several iron-based supeconductors.  Our results provide the basis to understand the transport, magnetic, and superconducting properties of these materials.  Our inelastic neutron scattering experiments of spin excitations in the parent compounds CaFe2As2, SrFe2As2, BaFe2As2, FeTe, NaFeAs, Rb0.89Fe1.58Se2 have determined the effective magnetic exchange couplings for different families of iron-based superconductors, and formed the basis for a microscopic understanding of their magnetic exchange interactions. These results also allowed a direct comparison of the magnetic interactions between the copper- and iron-based superconductors.  Broader impacts: In addition to obtaining interesting scientific results, this project also contributed to the training and education of the next generation of scientists. During the NSF contract period, four students graduated with a PhD from The University of Tennessee. They are now employed at universities, national laboratories, and industry.  NSF support is critical to the success of the neutron scattering program at The University of Tennessee, and this is important for keeping the US at the forefront of scientific discovery.
