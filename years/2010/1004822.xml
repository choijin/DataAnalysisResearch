<AbstractNarration>This award supports a new REU site at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Louisiana State University.   The intended impact of this program is to foster interest in careers in science, by introducing students to the nature of research-oriented careers in physics and astronomy and by developing research-related skills and knowledge. REU students will be recruited nationally; students can be of any academic year and need not have a declared major, but must have completed the general physics sequence at their school. For the 10-week program, the participants will be matched with faculty mentors based on student interests. Students will join their mentors in active research projects in  astronomy, astrophysics, and physics.   Weekly seminars and workshops introduce the students to faculty research, to skills development, to common research resources, and to professional development topics such as ethics and patents/intellectual property. Students will participate in field trips and other activities, some of which will be coordinated with concurrent LSU summer science programs in chemistry, biomedical science and other areas. Students from all programs will be lodged in proximity at on-campus apartment-style housing, to foster group interactions and a sense of community.   This award is funded by the Physics Division and the Division of Astronomical Sciences at the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>

Thus, the direct benefits to the P&amp;A REU student participants are:    Seeing the "work" of research firsthand, including its challenges and rewards; Developing technical and analytic skills that will be useful in future careers; Making acquaintances with other participants who may one day be future colleagues and collaborators; Learning about professional issues related to research-oriented careers; and Experiencing the geographical and cultural flavor of Louisiana and the southeastern U.S.     At the same time, the Dept. of Physics &amp; Astronomy and the faculty mentors benefit from the productivity of the REU students, from the inherent "advertising" and increased awareness by the studentsÃ† home institutions of our departmental research and education programs, and by using our experiences with the REU students to continuously improve our programs and the quality of training of our students.
