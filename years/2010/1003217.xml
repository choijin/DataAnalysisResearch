<AbstractNarration>SES-1003217&lt;br/&gt;Cynthia Buckley&lt;br/&gt;Erin Hofmann&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas, Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies how social norms and socioeconomic factors shape the experience of migration for men and women, focusing on three main research questions: How do social norms and socioeconomic conditions influence migration decisions? Does the influence of norms or socioeconomic conditions vary by gender? What are the mechanisms through which norms shape migration? The researcher will address these questions through a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data. Quantitative data from the Gender and Generations Survey and the National Household Survey, both conducted in Georgia in 2006, will identify the predictors of migration in national samples and determine if there are gender differences. Qualitative data from interviews with returned migrants and family members of migrants in two regions of Georgia will provide insight into the potential motivations for migration and the gendered nature of migration experiences. The economic and political conditions that motivate migration such as individual human capital, household socioeconomic status, social networks, state policies, and labor market demands are well documented, particularly in Latin America and Asia. Research on social norms and migration is less extensive, but demonstrates that norms can facilitate or discourage migration. Understanding the joint influence of norms and socioeconomic conditions is particularly important to understanding women's migration, because women are most likely to face conflict between economic conditions that encourage migration and social norms that discourage it. Examining social norms and migration in Georgia can expand existing migration theories, particularly those related to gender. The Georgian context of strong patriarchal norms coupled with high levels of human capital and labor market experience among women makes it an interesting case to explore the influence of norms and socioeconomic conditions on migration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide an analysis of the selectivity of migration from Georgia, which will be beneficial to policymakers looking to take advantage of the development potential of migration. Findings from this research will be disseminated broadly to the academic community via professional conferences and publications, and shared with colleagues in the academic and migration communities in Georgia.</AbstractNarration>
