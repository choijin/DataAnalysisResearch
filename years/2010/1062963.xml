<AbstractNarration>An award made to the Wadsworth Center will provide 10 weeks of research training for 10 undergraduate students, during the summers of 2011 - 2013. The training program focuses on collaborative networked approaches for undergraduate research in molecular genetics, cell biology, structural and computational biology, and neuroscience. The Center has more than 20 mentors guiding REU students in specifically designed, state-of-the-art collaborative research projects. The students will tackle the networked research projects in teams consisting of one fellow REU student, two individual mentors, as well as graduate students, postdocs, and other scholars in their laboratories. Students will perform full-time lab research and be introduced to exciting new research topics through a seminar series. They will also participate in training workshops that cover topics such as the responsible conduct of research, professional development and communication skills, and career opportunities in government, industry, and academia. Extensive national outreach efforts, combined with focused outreach to CSTEP programs at regional New York State community colleges, will ensure participation of underserved student populations. Student selection will be based on academic record, expressed interest in research, and potential for continued success in the biological sciences. The program will be assessed by various means, including use of the REU web-based common assessment tool, and participants will be tracked for the influence of the research experience in their academic field of study and career paths. More information is available by visiting http://www.wadsworth.org/REU, or by contacting the PI, Dr Sam Bowser, or the Program Director (Dr Keithly) at reu@wadsworth.org.</AbstractNarration>
