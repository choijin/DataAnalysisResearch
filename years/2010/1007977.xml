<AbstractNarration>This award will support a theoretical effort to explore uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates in models of nova outbursts and the structure pre-supernova stars.  The principal goal will be to construct a new reaction rate library for calculations of stellar evolution.  This will, for the first time, provide the ability to assign rigorous errors to the results.  The calculations will explore 66 nuclear reactions on target nuclei from carbon through calcium, for which reaction rate rates are now available, as a backbone for construction of a next-generation library of thermonuclear reaction rates.  The project will also employ the new reaction rate library for simulating the evolution of massive stars and classical novae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to workforce development and will include the distribution of research products to the astronomical community.  The input models and data and the progenitor models for studies of supernovae and novae will be made available on a website for use by advanced students and other scientists for use in their own studies.  Graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow will receive training in modern experimental and theoretical techniques, lead development of a state of the art reaction rate library, use high performance computing resources, and manage large, complex data sets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed and publicly released a new library for stellar reaction rates, STARLIB, a new software instrument for the evolution of stars, MESA, and assessed the effects of the new reaction rate library on the evolution of massive stars, classical novae, and supernovae.  This project saw the 2013 public release of STARLIB, a next-generation reaction-rate library for nuclear astrophysics.  STARLIB is a unique reaction rate database that which provides recommended reaction rates along with previously unavailable information such as the experimental uncertainties with each reaction rate. This information is crucial for defensible predictions of the chemical elements synthesized by stars.  This project also saw the initial 2011 public release of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software instrument, and a subsequent 2013 update.  During the project period, MESA attracted over 800 registered users world-wide, conducted an annual Summer School program since 2012 (about 30 graduate students, postdocsand faculty each year), provided a Software Developers Kit to easily build MESA, and hosted a relatively popular (about 100 messages/month) web portal for the stellar community to openly share knowledge.    Since the publication of the two instrument papers describing MESA, the instrument has been used in 385 publications as of October 2014 and the number of publications continues to grow. The first MESA instrument paper ranks as one of the 25 most cited astronomy and astrophysics papers published in 2011, while the second MESA instrument paper ranks as one of the 30 most cited in 2013.  The aggregate of these metrics suggests that MESA has had a significant adoption by the astrophysics research community and is well on its way to becoming the world-standard for evolving stars, thus providing a crucial resource to the astrophysical community at just the right time.  MESA has driven, and will continue to drive, innovation in the stellar astrophysics community as well as the exoplanet, galactic, andcosmological communities. Many of the 385 MESA-based papers published during this project came from the exoplanet (e.g., NASA's Kepler mission), galactic (e.g., ages of star clusters), and cosmological (e.g., dark stars and modified gravity) communities.  Undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs whose research and education have been enabled by STARLIB and MESA received interdisciplinary STEM training in a diverse set of skills, including computation and the analysis of Big Data.  This skill set is adaptable, flexible, and fits a wide range of careers in both the private and public sectors.       Last Modified: 10/28/2014       Submitted by: Francis X Timmes]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
