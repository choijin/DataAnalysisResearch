<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in the third "Pingree Park Dynamics Workshop" that will be held at the Pingree Park campus of Colorado State University from August 2-7, 2010. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference, the subject matter of which falls under the general heading of topological, measure-theoretic, and smooth dynamical systems, will focus on three principal themes: (1) orbit equivalence theory, (2) descriptive set theory as it relates to dynamical systems, and (3) smooth ergodic theory. All three represent extremely active areas of current dynamical systems research. The format of the workshop is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and otherwise be engaged in the various conference activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funds from NSF were used to host the 2010 Pingree Park Dynamical Systems Workshop. This workshop focused on dynamical systems and ergodic theory, a branch of mathematics that investigates the evolution of systems over time. The workshop took place at the Pingree Park Campus of Colorado State University. Funds from the NSF were used to sponsor the visits of participants at the meeting - travel, meals &amp; lodging. The Pingree Park Campus is a somewhat remote facility in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado which provides an ideal setting for working on abstract mathematical problems. This meeting brought together 35 mathematicians working in closely related fields to discuss new ideas in the subject. Even with evolving technologies, these kinds of meetings are still essential for making progress in a field because it brings a substantial number of people together for face-to-face communication. In this field of mathematics the goal is to work to solve abstract mathematical problems, i.e. to prove theorems. This meeting provided participants an opportunity to learn from others who can share their results and their perspectives on unsolved problems. The synergy of these alternate perspectives are typically a key ingredient to producing new results in mathematics. During this meeting, talks were scheduled throughout the afternoon and evenings. These talks gave researchers the opportunity to report on new results and for audience members to question the speaker about their techniques. Mornings were reserved for more open ended discussions, allowing researchers working on very closely related problems to exchange ideas and collaborate toward solving problems. The meeting had a wonderful mix of junior researchers who are working on establishing their research and more senior scholars who are truly leaders in their field. Altogether this successful meeting which advanced the subject of dynamical systems.         Last Modified: 10/31/2011       Submitted by: Nicholas S Ormes]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
