<AbstractNarration>The environmental conditions which impact life in natural ecosystems are constantly fluctuating.  While some fluctuations change predictably with the seasonal cycle, the lunar cycle or the daily (day/night) cycle, all have a seemingly unpredictable component that impacts biological populations in complex ways.  A central prediction arising from many models of global environmental change is an increase in the magnitude of environmental fluctuations.  Predicting how such an increase will impact natural ecosystems requires an understanding of how fluctuating environmental conditions impact biological populations directly, by altering rates of births and deaths, and indirectly, by altering the abundance of predators, competitors and resources.  Mathematical models will undoubtedly be a key element in establishing our understanding of the indirect impacts of environmental fluctuations because they are easily configurable to a variety of different ecosystems.  Unfortunately, the ability of current mathematical models to accurately reproduce indirect impacts of environmental fluctuations is largely unknown. This goal of this project is i) to draw on the strengths of existing models and data to develop a general mathematical theory to predict how the different ecological interactions (predation/herbivory and competition/mutualism) modify the way in which environmental fluctuations effect population dynamics and ii) to validate the theory using a series of laboratory experiments on freshwater-inhabiting ciliated protozoa.  These single-celled model organisms are particularly well-suited to this type of study; species respond quickly to environmental fluctuations and exhibit a wide range of feeding behaviors, allowing realistic ecosystems to be configured in small-scale experiments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will integrate research with education and public outreach by incorporating the training of a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student, numerous undergraduate students, and local high-school students who will be engaged through an outreach program at the Peabody Museum of Natural History.  In addition, the understanding gained through this project will be directed towards education through the development of teaching modules and courseware.  Ultimately, improving our understanding of how environmental fluctuations impact biological populations will aid our ability to manage and conserve the growing number of species and ecosystems at risk from human activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A critical challenge limiting our ability to monitor, conserve, and manage the earth's biota, hinges on understanding how the fluctuations in abundances of biological populations are linked to those of the non-living environment.  This project has broadened our understanding of this phenomenon by considering both the direct links between populations and their non-living environments and the indirect links that are mediated by interactions with other species that compete, consume, or are consumed by them.    An important finding arising from this project is the recognition that temperature variability has a strong interaction with the average climate in determining the effect that this variability has on populations.  Coupling theoretical models, climate change predictions and empirically-estimated relationships between temperature and performance, I demonstrated that the temperature variation populations experience across days and seasons is beneficial in cold (temperate) climates whereas it is detrimental in warm (tropical) climates.  Furthermore, I demonstrated that the anticipated changes to temperature variation due to global change will have far greater consequences for populations than long-term warming.    A second major contribution of this project has been to show that environmental fluctuations have a very strong tendency to synchronize the fluctuations in abundance expressed by different species that exist in a common environment. This goes against our basic expectations that competing species (those that negatively impact each other) should exhibit a compensatory pattern where a decline in one species is coupled to an increase in its competitor. This synchronization can unfortunately result in large fluctuations of aggregate-level properties in a system (e.g. algal blooms can be the result of a synchronized decline of aquatic insects).  Using a large sample (58 lakes) of zooplankton species monitored over many decades I demonstrated that synchronization is far more prevalent that the opposing pattern, demonstrating the critical importance of environmental fluctuations for  In addition, this project has used theoretical models of interacting species to determine how fluctuations in temperature can allow competing species to coexist.  A major challenge in our ability to describe the natural world with theory and mathematical models lies in understanding why there are so many species using the same essential resources (e.g. light, water, space) occupying the same plot of land or puddle of water.  Using models based on mechanistic relationships between temperature and vital biological rates, I demonstrated how temperature variation can provide the structure to allow a vast diversity of competitors to coexist.  This coexistence depends both on the magnitude of temperature fluctuations and the degree to which these fluctuations are correlated through time (i.e. the relatedness between the temperature today and the temperature yesterday).  This theoretical foundation will pave the way for a better understanding of coexistence in natural systems where temperature variation is a key feature and will also provide insight into how changes in temperature variability under global change will alter ecosystems.
