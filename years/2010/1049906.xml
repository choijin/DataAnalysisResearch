<AbstractNarration>The Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) organizes studies and workshops that provide top-quality statistical science advice to help guide major government programs. Some of those programs support the statistical science community, but others do not yet have strong ties to it. CATS activities are carried out by specially appointed committees of experts tailored for each particular activity and in general survey existing research frontiers and recommend best steps for strengthening or applying them; review federal programs and recommend improvements; and/or provide strategic advice to federal programs that depend on the mathematical sciences community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, the mission of CATS is to manage and reduce uncertainty in national decision-making through the use of modern statistical thinking and to nurture a vibrant statistical sciences research enterprise.  The latter goal calls for a statistical sciences discipline that is well-connected with other fields of science, engineering, and medicine; absorbs challenges from those other fields; and maintains a robust core.  CATS works to strengthen these attributes of the community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Project Outcomes Report for the General Public            For Award #1049906     "SUPPORT FOR THE     COMMITTEE ON APPLIED AND THEORETICAL STATISTICS"      Period of Performance:  04/01/2011 - 03/31/2015                     The Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) of the National Academy of Sciences serves as a source of expert advice on statistic s and data analytics for a wide variety of federal agencies. That advice helps to guide federal investments in the sciences, engineering, and medicine and to incorporate strong statistical insight into public policy. By providing a link between important national issues and the statistics research community, CATS also helps to inform that community of emerging challenges and thus maintain its vigor.             The subject grant supported six meetings of CATS, two associated technical symposia on data science that were open to the general public, and a workshop on statistical challenges associated with improving the reproducibility of scientific results. Through its six committee meetings, CATS also oversaw and initiated additional projects that were funded separately. Those additional projects included the following:              A study on the mathematical science foundations of verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification. (Funded by the Department of Energy and Air Force Office of Scientific Research)  A study on the analysis of massive data. (Funded by the National Security Agency)  A workshop on observational studies in a learning health system. (Funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute)  A workshop on training students to extract value from big data. (Funded by the NSF)  A workshop on image analysis for fisheries stock assessments. (Funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)                      Each of these five activities resulted in a published report from the National Academies.
