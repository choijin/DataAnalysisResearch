<AbstractNarration>Professor Frank Vogt of the University of Tennessee Knoxville is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop chemometric methods for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of complex chemical and biological samples. The specific objective is to develop "Bayesian Information Fusion," a novel chemometric concept which merges different types of information from complementary sources for sample classification. To further enhance the accuracy of the classification and the quantification, a novel "Plausibility Analysis" software will be developed and incorporated. As a proof-of-principle, these novel chemometric methodologies will be applied to FTIR spectroscopic data obtained from microalgae samples with the goal to utilize them as environmental bioprobes.&lt;br/&gt;The analysis of complex chemical and biological samples is extremely challenging because of the large number of analytes present and their wide range of concentrations, and chemometric data analysis is increasingly becoming an invaluable analytical chemistry tool for improved classification and quantification of such samples.&lt;br/&gt;The project results will be integrated in classroom material  by means of the cyber-enabled and interactive software package "Virtual Chemometrics Laboratory."</AbstractNarration>

As a Broader Impact, a scaled-down version of the VCL has been implemented in the PIÃ†s Instrumental Analysis Lab (Chem329) and has enabled his students to design their own analyzer in form of semester projects (see Fig. 1).  As proof-of-principle application, microalgae have been investigated regarding their chemical adaptation to environmental conditions.

For experimental studies utilizing FTIR spectroscopy and microscopy, a steady supply of microalgae grown under well-known conditions has been generated by means of a culturing facility developed in the PIÃ†s lab (Fig. 2).  The chemical composition of microalgae cells has been shown to be influenced by the cellsÃ† environment in a strongly nonlinear way (Fig 3 left).
