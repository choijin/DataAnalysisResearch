<AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports Doris Pun of the University of Wisconsin - Madison as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Pun will develop catalysts and methods to selectively dehydrogenate partially-unsaturated ring systems using molecular oxygen as the oxidizing agent. She will collaborate with scientists at Eli Lilly to develop the methodology in a process-chemistry environment. For her plan for broadening participation, the PI will work with colleagues from SCIENCountErs (a collaborative program between the University and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Dane County) and the Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) Conference (a program for girls and their parents) to develop curriculum materials and hands-on activities for young people demonstrating green-chemistry principles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Pun is aimed at developing better routes for the synthesis of pure chemical compounds. These chemicals are used in consumer products as well as in pharmaceuticals. The particular methods that Dr. Pun is developing are "green" in that they use environmentally benign reagents (oxygen) and produce relatively benign waste. The hope is to develop more sustainable ways to produce the chemical compounds that society depends upon. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Pun will enable the development of a talented and diverse scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
