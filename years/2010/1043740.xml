<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to utilize computer models used by hydrogeologists to establish the fate and transport of contamination and determine the extent of drilling fluid contamination in the ANDRILL SMS core. For these models, previously collected logs of lithology, porosity, fracture density, fracture type, fracture orientation, drilling fluid loss, drilling fluid characteristics and temperature will be used as input parameters. In addition, biodegradation and sorption constants for the drilling fluid will be determined and incorporated into the models. Samples of drilling fluids used during coring as well as the return fluids were collected at the drill site using standard microbiological sampling techniques. Fluids will be tested at in situ temperatures under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to determine biodegradation constants. Sorption will be determined between the drilling fluids and core samples using standard isotherm methods. Geochemical and microbial fingerprints of the fluids and the changes during biodegradation will determine the potential impact of the drilling fluids on the isolated microbial communities and the geochemistry within various subsurface lithologic units beneath the southern McMurdo Sound in Antarctica. The results of this study could potentially provide guidelines on developing less detrimental methods for future exploration, if deemed necessary through this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This proposed project will train a graduate student. The methods developed for analyses of samples in this project will serve as a guide for future studies of similar interest and will improve the understanding of ecological impacts of geologic drilling in Antarctica. The results of this study will be used as a reference for comparison with future studies examining newly developed, and improved, sample collection methods in future exploratory drilling projects in pristine environments. The PI is new to Antarctic research.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this research was to determine geochemical and initial biodegradation response to drilling fluid used during the SMS core recovery.  This biodegradation experiment utilized drilling fluid samples that were collected onsite during the SMS core recovery.  Aliquots were incubated in conditions similar to those of the subsurface for specific time intervals to monitor biodegradation over time.  To study the significant chemical changes, data was collected for seven different chemical parameters; dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, total carbon, total nitrogen, major anions, and major cations.  Two different methods were used to study the microbial population on a community based level.  Biolog EcoPlates&trade; were used to study the metabolic diversity of the viable microbial communities. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods using RAPD (random amplification of polymorphic DNA) primers were used to analyze the bacterial community structure and determine the microbial diversity between samples.  The results indicate shifts in the microbial population with time along with changes in the geochemistry, both of which are signs that biodegradation is occurring.  The highest rates of biodegradation were observed at 25&deg;C representing the upper part of the corehole with the least degradation occurring at the base of the at 50&deg;C.  The second objective of this study is to create reactive transport scenarios to model the extent of fluid migration into the borehole formation.
