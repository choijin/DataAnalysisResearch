<AbstractNarration>ABR: Testing Hypothesized CO2 Forcing of Climate, Glaciation &amp; Biotic Change During the End-Carboniferous&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isabel Montanez&lt;br/&gt;EAR-1024737&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this ABR project, through collaboration with colleagues and students, is several key issues regarding the late Paleozoic Ice Age that remain poorly constrained ? i.e., the true magnitude of CO2 shifts, late Paleozoic climate sensitivity, and the nature of the linkages to regional hydroclimate, soil productivity, ice sheet stability, and major restructuring of paleotropical vegetation.  The proposed two-component research plan focuses on a ~9 Myr interval of the end-Carboniferous, in particular a hypothesized ?climate event? during the mid-to-late Pennsylvanian transition. &lt;br/&gt;Component 1 will evaluate how paleo-pCO2 varied through this interval, and its role in widespread aridity and major vegetation restructuring. Anticipated products include a cyclothem-scale (~105 yr) stomatal index-based record of paleo-pCO2 using two long-ranging and well understood, wetland seed-fern taxa from the Illinois Basin. Integration of xerphytic walchian conifer cuticles from select cyclothems will permit comparison of SI-based CO2 estimates for wet- and dry-land flora and interglacial-glacial-scale CO2 variability. Compound-specific isotopic analysis (채D and 채13C) of the same fossil cuticles will further constrain the rate of onset and magnitude of paleoaridity in the Illinois Basin and test for causality between pCO2, terrestrial paleotropical aridity, and floral ecological restructuring. A proposed 4-year long-duration, plant growth experiment under controlled atmospheric O2:CO2 ratios and inferred Carboniferous climate conditions will provide novel insight into the fossil-based trends. Integration of results with paleobotanical data and our paleoclimate proxy records will be used to develop an appropriate vegetation-feedback component for our climate modeling efforts.  &lt;br/&gt;The 2nd research component will develop a cyclothem-scale 채18O apatite record using already collected conodonts (CAI 1-3) from two paleotropical basins for the same end-Carboniferous interval. The objective is to test the hypothesis that periods of CO2-forced global warming also drove ice sheet ablation and a reduction in the amplitude of high-frequency (104-105 yr) glacioeustasy. Through collaboration, we will test the potential of the ?carbonate clumped isotope? method to define sea-surface temperatures of precipitation from a suite of exceptionally well-preserved and diagenetically screened brachiopods from the same geological sections. We anticipate that for the best-preserved brachiopods, this approach should permit reconstruction of Pennsylvanian SSTs and 채18Oseawater, and ultimately the most rigorous evaluation of relative changes in ice volume during the LPIA to date.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research which focused on 2 scientific objectives produced four major findings of intellectual merit.  These are:  (1) The development of the first multi-proxy, high-resolution record of atmospheric CO2 for 16 million years (312 to 296 Ma) of the late Paleozoic that reveals fluctuations (of up to 300 ppm) with an apparent 105-yr rhythmicity varying over a range that resolves a long-lived radiative forcing conundrum &mdash; i.e., that the continent-size ice sheets, which would have formed at that time of 3% lower solar luminosity under the CO2 values available in the literature, would have been too large and stable to wax and wane and thus could not explain the geologic record of ~100 m fluctuations in sea level inferred from cyclothems. We further find that CO2, which fluctuated within the magnitude of predicted anthropogenic change, co-varies with substantial change in sea level and ice volume with clear implications for our future with continued warming under rising CO2 levels. Finally, we documented coincidence between CO2 changes and repeated restructuring of Pangaean tropical forests that in conjunction with modeled vegetation shifts indicate a more dynamic carbon sequestration history than previously considered and a major role for terrestrial vegetation-CO2 feedbacks in driving eccentricity scale climate cycles of the late Paleozoic icehouse.    (2) Method development for the extraction-chemical conversion-d18O analysis of conodont apatite that led to a new comprehensive protocol for analysis of ~500 &micro;g size conodont samples that will permit the use of conodont d18OPO4 for paleoceanographic, paleoclimatologic, and paleoecologic studies of higher temporal resolution than previously possible given the size constraints associated with conventional analysis of conodont d18O.  We further developed and evaluated a protocol for laser ablation-multicollector-ICPMS Sr isotope analysis of bioapatites such as conodonts.  No such protocol exists in the literature as this approach (laser ablation) is quite novel &mdash; i.e., the first publication presenting such results (Permo-Triassic) came out in Oct. 2015.  (3) We developed U-Pb calibrated conodont-based records of oxygen isotopic (d18O) and Sr isotopic (87Sr/86Sr) compositions from the Donets Basin, a marginal sea bordering the paleo-Tethys, that are resolved at the eccentricity time-scale. Fluctuations in d18O and 87Sr/86Sr covary with major sea-level highstands and lowstands, defined by the cyclothem stacking patterns in the Donets Basin, but are notably different in absolute values and variability from contemporaneous conodont-based records from the open-water Najing succession in South China.  We interpret this unanticipated result as indicative that the marginal sea Donets record faithfully records changes in seawater d18O and 87Sr/86Sr within the more restricted waters of this setting with fluctuations recording orbitally modulated changes in freshwater influx and P:E in the region. The linkage between conodont isotopic compositions and sea level fluctuations indicates that existing Carboniferous records of inferred seawater chemistry, dominantly developed using epicontinental sea deposits, may record a high climate sensitivity of seawater composition to environmental perturbation but which can be decoupled from global seawater curves.  This finding  has not been previously discussed in published studies of this time period.  Broader Impacts:   (1) During the course of the research 4 graduate students, 3 undergraduate students, 1 high school student, 1 post-graduate researcher, and a postdoctoral fellow were mentored and trained in various aspects of the research.   (2) The PI designed and set-up a state-of-the-art image analysis/petrographic system for stomatal frequency analysis that several undergraduate and graduate students use on a regular basis.   (3) The PI and her students disseminated the reseach results in over 20 professional presentations at universities and national and international conferences.  In addition, the PI used the research findings in presenatations on ancient climate change at community events (Cool Davis; Green Interfaith Alliance of Davis and Sacramento), and a national secondary teachers conference.
