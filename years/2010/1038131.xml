<AbstractNarration>Although they are the base of the food-web in deep sea hydrothermal systems, the growth efficiencies and other essential metabolic characteristics of microorganisms that live off chemical energy from geothermal/mineralogical sources in hydrothermal vent areas in the deep ocean are poorly known.  This research uses a novel, flow through, laboratory reactor apparatus to run first-of-a-kind experiments looking at microbial growth rates and metabolic efficiencies at the temperatures, pressures (100 to 250 bars), and chemical conditions found in hydrothermal systems on the deep seafloor. Experiments will target the metabolic processes of two common deep sea vent microorganisms by measuring, in the reactor solutions,  nitrogen-bearing respiratory products of nitrate-reducing and hydrogen-oxidizing microbes.  Research goals are to determine the role of redox gradients on nitrate reduction and ammonification in hydrothermal systems, use isotopes to determine metabolic rates using kinetic isotope effects, and determine the growth efficiency of mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic microbes at a range of H2/CO2 molar ratios.  Broader impacts of the work include cross-training of a graduate student in two disciplines and laboratories and inclusion of a student from an under-represented minority in research.</AbstractNarration>

It is under these extreme conditions that, by a synergy of chemistry and biology, life thrives in spite of the darkness and sparse food. This occurs through the process of chemolithoautotrophy - the production of organic matter from carbon dioxide coupled to a redox reaction between inorganic chemicals to obtain energy. Microorganisms carrying out chemolithoautotrophy, also referred to as chemosynthesis, are at the base of the food chain of deep-sea vent ecosystems.  Chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms that use oxygen (aerobic microbes) or can grow in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic microbes) thrive in the mixing zone between reduced hydrothermal fluids and oxidized seawater.

Furthermore, from the variety of bioavailable electron acceptors in low-temperature mixing hydrothermal habitats, the role of seawater nitrate had not been fully explored, despite the highly energetic nature of the microbially mediated nitrate reduction reactions.  At pressures and temperatures resembling these environments, we investigated the cycle of nitrogen and carbon through the metabolism of nitrate-reducing anaerobic chemolithoautotrophic bacteria, i.e. bacteria that use nitrate rather than oxygen to oxidize reduced chemicals generated by geothermal processes, such as hydrogen sulfide or hydrogen. Novel experimental techniques have been developed to grow microbes at pressures similar to those at 4 miles deep in the ocean. In detail, we used Caminibacter mediatlanticus and Thermovibrio ammonificans as model organisms to constrain physiological parameters associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in deep-sea vent Epsilonproteobacteria and Aquificaceae. We accessed the 15N/14N isotopic signatures of DNRA during growth of nitrate reducers at atmospheric and seafloor pressures, and determined their growth efficiencies. We observed that while C. mediatlanticus achieved higher cell densities than T. ammonificans, the overall metabolism of the latter was ~ 2.8 times higher and ~ 3 times faster.
