<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the feasibility of a new composite foam material for thermal insulation applications.  Residual energy losses due to leaky insulation in the nation's buildings (commercial and residential) contribute to the inefficiency and instability in the electrical grid. This problem can be addressed with new and improved building materials. In this project, we will use ceramics recycled from discarded coal combustion ash as an additive in polyurethane foam, which is one of the highest-performance insulating materials available.  The ash derived ceramics (ADCs) will replace halogenated flame retardants, which pose health risks during handling and combustion.  The incombustible ADCs add strength to the foam without disrupting the closed cell structure that gives polyurethane its insulating capability.  As a result, incorporation of ADCs will extend the applicability of polyurethane foam to structural applications, such as roof underlayment, subfloors, and sidewalls.  The new composite foam to be demonstrated will be a safe and green alternative to traditional insulating materials, which will help improve the energy efficiency of our buildings and, thus, the nation's electric grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is multi-faceted and far-reaching. Polyurethane foam is one of the best insulating materials available; yet, its flammability and combustion byproducts limit its share of the insulating materials market to 3.4% ($212 million).  Incorporating ceramics recycled from coal combustion ash into the polyurethane foam is a safe, green, and cost-effective mechanism for growing the market for polyurethane foams and replacing traditional insulating materials like fiberglass.  Ash derived ceramics are incombustible and serve as a flame retardant in the foam, making it safe and greatly reducing the negative environmental impacts of the material.  Furthermore, the raw material used in the production of ADCs, coal combustion ash, is in oversupply in the Appalachian region.  Not only will ash derived ceramics improve the performance of polyurethane foam, but their incorporation into new value-added products will beautify the region and provide economic stimulus in a depressed area.  Ultimately, incorporating this high efficiency insulating material into new and retrofit construction will ease the utility cost burden on consumers and contribute to the nation's energy efficiency and security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NuForm Materials, LLC  Each year in the United States, nearly 150 million tons of fly ash is produced as a byproduct of burning coal for electricity.  Most of this fly ash is stored in neighboring retaining ponds where it settles over time.  Utilizing fly ash in beneficial applications not only mitigates the risks associated with storing fly ash, but it also makes the process of generating energy from coal more sustainable.  NuForm MaterialsÆ core technology is a process designed to recycle high quality ceramic materials from ponded coal combustion ash.  The unit, which is deployed to and operates at the ash pond, is designed to handle high volumes of slurry at relatively large throughput rates.  The ceramic products generated during the classification process are dried and residual carbon materials are burned away.  The ceramics found in coal combustion ash have many benefits&mdash;they are a recycled material, they are low cost, and they are plentiful.  Traditionally, beneficial re-use is limited to large volume, low cost applications, such as road construction, land backfill, and cement.  At NuForm, we are developing new applications and new markets for these high quality, refined materials that will command higher prices.  This Phase I/IB project was focused on developing our ceramic products as additives in polyurethane foam insulating materials.  Our ceramic products are small, spherical, and incombustible, making them ideal candidates for flame retardant applications in cellular foam materials.  During this research effort, we evaluated ceramic products recycled from several sources of fly ash.  The fly ash was processed in our labs and the resulting ceramic products were used to fabricate composite foam materials from polyurethane.  During this project, composite foams were fabricated with 15%, 30%, and 45% (by weight) recycled ceramics.  Using a series of standard characterization tests, the composite foams were analyzed for strength, water absorption, and thermal conductivity.  The composite foams were also tested for flame resistance using two nationally recognized methods.   Our ceramics products, recycled from discarded coal combustion ash, proved to be a good additive for polyurethane insulating foams.  The ceramics blended well into the polyurethane resin system.  Further, the ceramic-loaded resins blended well to form closed cell composite foam.  The composite foams showed improved strength, decreased water absorption, and low thermal conductivity (equivalent to good insulating properties).  Additionally, the composite foams easily passed the Ford Motor Vehicle Safety Standard test for burn rate and great progress was made in the stringent and aggressive full room flame test.  We determined that using ceramics recycled from coal combustion ash as an additive in highly insulating polyurethane is feasible.  Further, we demonstrated that, when heated, the ceramic-loaded resins could be mixed and delivered in a controlled, continuous process.  This is important for scaling to meet the needs of high volume manufacturing.  Overall, we were able to show that ceramics recycled from coal combustion ash exhibit flame retardant properties and are an altogether very good additive for polyurethane foam insulating materials.
