<AbstractNarration>The Northwest Indian College is the only accredited tribal college in the Pacific Northwest.  &lt;br/&gt;Lummi Nation hosts the main campus.  Full-service extended campuses exist at four other tribal &lt;br/&gt;communities in Washington and one in Idaho.  With grant funds, the College will significantly &lt;br/&gt;increase its capacity to deliver effective STEM programs.  Enrollment in the four STEM programs, &lt;br/&gt;and especially the new Bachelor of Science in Native Environmental Science (BSNES) program, is &lt;br/&gt;growing and retention is relatively high.  However, the College has identified specific needs in &lt;br/&gt;STEM programs.  These activities will increase institutional capacity in the critical need areas: &lt;br/&gt;? Employ one new full-time faculty with an expertise in wildlife biology and develop new &lt;br/&gt;program of study emphasis areas in Native Fish and Wildlife Biology and in Native Ecology &lt;br/&gt;? Begin to offer 300 and 400 level courses at the College?s extended campuses   &lt;br/&gt;? Create two new positions to: undertake targeted recruitment of high school and community &lt;br/&gt;college students, employees of tribal natural resource agencies, and others; develop student &lt;br/&gt;internships and service learning activities; create a new student mentorship program; develop &lt;br/&gt;pre-college STEM programs; and identify employment opportunities for STEM graduates &lt;br/&gt;? Add new tutoring positions in English, math, computers, and science that will be embedded &lt;br/&gt;in critical filter or gateway courses and that will also provide out-of-class tutoring &lt;br/&gt;? Provide professional development for faculty, especially on the use of distance learning &lt;br/&gt;teaching modalities and on learning models (e.g., active learning and problem-based &lt;br/&gt;learning) that have been shown to be successful with Native American students</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Northwest Indian College had four (4) outcomes designated for the 5 year grant period.  The outcomes included the following: having an increase in fall-to-fall retention rates, which measures both returning students and students who enroll in the program each year; having 58 students with 45 or more credits enrolled in a STEM degree track, which indicates an increasing program enrollment; having a minimum of 20 earned degrees in STEM programs, which indicates student retention and degree completion; and having a minimum of six (6) 300- and 400-level Native Environmental Science courses designed and offered to students at the extension campuses, which indicates evidence of a growing program that responds to student and community needs and advances our knowledge and understanding within STEM fields of study.        During the 5 year program period, our retention numbers increased initially, our fall-to-fall retention rate remained at its current status of 52%. This was the only outcome NWIC did not exceed during the funding period.  The department programs dramatically exceeded the rest of the outcomes; for example, during the 5 year period, 545 students who had earned at least 45 credits were enrolled in STEM degree programs, 110 of these students were enrolled in STEM degree programs during the final year of the reporting period: this represents an outcome almost twice the goal amount.   Forty-three (43) students graduated with BS-NES degrees, 6 students graduated with AAS-ES degrees, and 5 graduated with AST-LS degrees for a total of 54 students who graduated with STEM degrees during the funding period, more than doubling the goal of 20 earned degrees.   Advancing our institutional knowledge and place-based environmental understanding, 8 new courses have been created, 7 Environmental Science courses (ENVS 310, 340, 350, 388 A &amp; B, 488), and a Native Environmental Science course (NESC 488).  ENVS 340, Oceanography; ENVS 388 Population Ecology Birds of the Salish Sea; ENVS 388 Soils Ecology; ENVS 488, Restoration Ecology; and NESC 488 Current Topics in Native Environmental Science have been offered and/or are offered in the upcoming quarter.  These courses were created by NWIC Science faculty in response to faculty, student and community input.  The intention behind these newly designed courses is to bring the direct benefit of expanded knowledge in these fields of study to the students and the tribal communities.  The broader impacts of our successes include a substantial increase in the number of STEM field Native American degree holders, communities now have more scholars who have STEM field knowledge and experience specific to their communityÆs needs, and we have a newly re-established Graduate Student Club, which prepares soon-to-be graduates for taking the Graduate Records Exam (GRE), and assists with graduate school application tasks.
