<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a device that will allow onsite production of PET (Positron Emission Tomography)isotopes at almost any hospital or clinic.  Emerging isotopes such as 11C, 13N, and 15O have significant medical utility, but very short half-lives (20, 10, and 2 minutes, respectively). This precludes their use at most hospitals and clinics where no onsite production capability exists. In fact, the size and mass of even the most modern cyclotrons prevents their installation at most medical facilities. The proposed device exploits the energy gain from nuclear fusion reactions between deuterium and helium-3, enabling the creation of high energy protons (&gt;10 MeV) with a simple, lightweight accelerator operating at only a few hundred kV. This work builds on an existing prototype in which a highly focused deuteron beam impacts helium-3 gas, creating protons. A proton capture device will be installed in the prototype containing distilled water, an efficient parent material for the production of 13N-labeled NH3, which is effective for diagnosing heart disease. Proof-of-feasibility will be established by attaining a proton production rate of 3 x 1011 protons/s, and the synthesis of 0.5 mCi of 13N.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is realized as an increase in access to the already widely used PET isotope 18F, and more significantly, a transformational increase in access to the shorter lived isotopes 11C, 13N, and 15O. These isotopes have proven powerful tools at research hospitals, but due to their inaccessibility, are unavailable to most doctors and patients, especially at the early stages of a disease when they would have the most beneficial impact. Improved access to onsite production of PET isotopes would have a significant positive impact on human health. In addition, this innovation has significant market potential. PET is rapidly entering mainstream healthcare, and enabling widespread access to new isotopes and procedures will further fuel this growth. The market for this technology could ultimately exceed $200 million per year, which represents about half of the present annual 18F market</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this National Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project was to develop a working prototype of an innovative device, the FLAME&trade; generator, that would allow on-site production of PET isotopes at almost any hospital or clinic.  This work bootstraps ongoing Phase II SBIR efforts to create a high-intensity neutron source.  For this project, the objective was to convert to a high-energy proton source by changing reactant types, and install an isotope production system to employ these protons for isotope synthesis.        The FLAMETM proton generator offers a transformational new way to generate PET isotopes. This compact, lightweight, and simple system could be installed in almost any PET-capable facility.  The FLAMETM generator could substantially benefit human health by enabling access to many new procedures. The market potential for this innovation is significant. PET scans are rapidly entering mainstream healthcare and enabling widespread access to new procedures would further fuel this growth.  During the course of this SBIR, Phoenix Nuclear Labs (PNL) has made significant progress towards the development of the FLAMETM prototype.  These improvements include the demonstration of operation at 300 kV, the development of a 50 mA ion source, the development and construction of two 13N production target prototypes, the demonstration of a high-purity differential pumping system, the design and construction of a 3He purification and recycling system, and the operation of the FLAMETM prototype with target gas (as shown in Figure).  With these improvements, it is expected that 13N will be produced at the PNL facility within the next few months.  PNL believes that once this technology matures it could fundamentally alter the way that PET imaging isotopes are generated, and that this new production strategy will provide doctors and patients with the best isotope options.  After completing the remaining set of objectives from this phase of the program, PNL will pursue building a new prototype in which the beam energy is increased from 300 to 500 keV and the beam current delivered to the target is increased from 10 mA to 60 mA. This will result in 2x1013 protons/s, which is the rate needed for a saturation activity of about 60 mCi of 13N, or about one useful dose at injection time.
