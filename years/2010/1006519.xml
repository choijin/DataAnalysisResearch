<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Atoms and elementary particles are decidedly quantum mechanical: these objects can seemingly be in more than one mutually exclusive state at the same time. While such counterintuitive behavior is foreign in most of the everyday world, certain macroscopic systems have been experimentally demonstrated to behave quantum mechanically. Such systems can potentially be exploited as qubits - the elements of quantum computers that process data - and could thereby one day revolutionize computing. This individual investigator award supports a research project that will experimentally elucidate the extent to which chemically synthesized nanomagnets and lithographically fabricated superconducting devices can behave quantum mechanically. New macroscopic quantum phenomena will be explored; the experiments will illuminate how a quantum system's environment can affect its behavior by either suppressing or enhancing telltale quantum phenomena. The results will have implications for the viability of these systems as potential qubits. The research will be conducted primarily at an undergraduate institution and will involve collaborations between undergraduate student-scholars, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty. Such interactions will not only produce important research results but will also serve to educate and train students pursuing careers in science or related technical fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports a research project that will explore the extent to which macroscopic objects can behave quantum mechanically by looking for new macroscopic quantum phenomena in single-molecule magnets (SMMs) and superconducting devices. Both systems have a collective coordinate (spin orientation for SMMs or phase or charge for superconducting systems) that behaves quantum mechanically. Building on recent work that showed that 10^16 SMM spins can be collectively coupled to a microwave cavity, the project aims to look for related effects, including superradiance, as well as coherent interference effects in which a strong microwave field repeatedly drives the spins through a Landau-Zener transition. In superconducting devices, the project will look for a geometric-phase effect that can suppress tunneling as well as some novel forms of dynamical-phase interference effects. These experiments will illuminate how the system's environment can affect its behavior by either suppressing or enhancing telltale quantum phenomena. The results will have implications for the viability of these systems as potential qubits. The research will be conducted primarily at an undergraduate institution and will involve collaborations between undergraduate student-scholars, graduate students, postdocs and faculty. Such interactions will not only produce important research results but will also serve to educate and train students pursuing careers in science or related technical fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the quantum properties of molecular nanomagnets and superconducting devices.  These are artifical systems that nevertheless behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics.  Studying such materials explores the boundary between the quantum and classical realms of physics.  Specifically, in this project, a quantum mechanical process known as tunneling was investigated using magnetic fields and pressure to augment or suppress the rate at which nanomagnets reversed direction via tunneling.  In addition, the quantum coupling between a collection of nanomagnets and a microwave resonator was studied, revealing a quixotic state in which a photon is in a "quantum superposition" of being absorbed and not absorbed by the magnets.  In the course of doing some of the experiments, some unusual magnetic behavior was observed.   The research was conducted at Amherst College, a primarily undergraduate institution.  Five undergraduates, one graduate student, one postbac and one postdoc participated in the research and received valuable training.  Some students were authors on publications in premier journals and/or gave talks at major scientific conferences.  Their critical-thinking skills were honed and they became better prepared for careers in science, engineering or other technical fields.   The research was enabled by an interdisciplinary collaboration between physicists and synthetic chemists and involved researchers at several institutions working together.
