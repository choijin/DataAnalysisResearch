<AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports Nicholas Strandwitz of the California Institute of Technology as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. Strandwitz will work with Prof. Nate Lewis to investigate the use of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to create inexpensive, stable photoanodes for water oxidation and solar fuels generation.  The work will be carried out in collaboration with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory -- taking advantage of the state of the art deposition and microanalysis capabilities available there.   For his plan for broadening participation, the PI will develop energy-themed curriculum hands-on teaching modules,  in collaboration with 8th grade public school science teachers at John Marshall Fundamental School in Pasadena, CA.  The teaching modules incorporate California State Standards for 8th graders, and will be designed to be easily integrated into the existing curricula.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Strandwitz is designed to enable next-generation energy technology to help wean the country of its dependence upon fossil fuels for energy.   The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Strandwitz are aimed at enabling young people from all backgrounds to be better prepared for further study in STEM fields, as well as developing in them an appreciation of the kinds of societal problems (e.g. energy sustainability)  that science has the potential to solve.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                 This project took aim at addressing an ongoing problem with solar energy conversion: direct conversion of energy from solar light into chemical fuels like hydrogen gas.  Our strategy is to use semiconductors, like silicon crystals, to absorb sunlight, take that energy, and use it to cause chemical reactions.  One reaction of interest is water splitting where water is decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen.  A recurring problem with this strategy is that the semiconductor (silicon) tends to oxidize and degrade, just like an iron pipe that grows rust.  This causes the semiconductor energy conversion system to fail, just like a water pipe might burst.                   To circumvent this problem, our work made use of an emerging deposition technique for growing thin films of metal oxides to protect the semiconductor.  Our most notable result was that if just a few layers of manganese oxide, an abundant and non-toxic material, were grown on the silicon surface, the semiconductor could still cause reactions like water splitting, but was much more stable.  Further enhances in stability are still needed for such a system to be useful and inexpensive, and these advances will build on current results.  Continued success in this field could lead to widespread use of solar energy for fuel production, decreasing reliance on fossil-based fuels.                  Additionally, this project developed a collaboration with an 8th grade classroom at a Pasadena-area public school.  In this collaboration, we built and experimented with the water splitting reaction where water is decomposed into oxygen and hydrogen gasses, the very same goal of the technical part of the project.  The students used a battery or solar cell to provide the energy to split water.  This project and several others taught the students key principles like conservation of energy, oxidation/reduction reactions, and endothermic/exothermic reactions.  More importantly, we emphasized that careers in the physical sciences can be fun, productive, and satisfying, and that such careers are within their reach.
