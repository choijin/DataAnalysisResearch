<AbstractNarration>1040114&lt;br/&gt;Szalay&lt;br/&gt;This award funds the development and deployment of the Data-Scope, a computational instrument specifically designed to enable data analysis tasks that are simply not possible today. The instrument?s unprecedented capabilities combine approximately five Petabytes of storage with a sequential IO bandwidth close to 500GBytes/sec, and 600 Teraflops of GPU computing.The need to keep acquisition costs and power consumption low, while maintaining high performance and storage capacity introduces difficult tradeoffs. The Data-Scope will provide extreme data analysis performance over PB-scale datasets at the expense of generic features such as fault tolerance and ease of management. This is however acceptable since the Data-Scope is a research instrument rather than a traditional computational facility.</AbstractNarration>
