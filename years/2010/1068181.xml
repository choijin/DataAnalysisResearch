<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to overcome the deficiencies of the currently used computational technologies by developing spectral/hp finite elements with least-squares formulation and algorithms.  The physical interaction of fluids and solids is of practical significance in various branches of engineering.  Examples include flutter of aerodynamic structures, structural deformation due to explosions, vortex induced vibrations of sub-sea pipelines and risers, inflatable dams, parachute dynamics, and blood flow through arteries.  Since fluids and solids are described by different sets of equations, they are solved independently and the tractions calculated from the fluid flow equations is used as applied force on the structure.  Geometric changes of the structure due to the tractions in turn influences the flow characteristics.  This two-way coupling can be significant when high-speed flows and/or geometrically complex structures are involved.  The present study employs a single computational framework that allows for enhanced compatibility and accuracy in the physical coupling of the fluid and solid.  The coupling between the fluid and solid is enforced using implicit strongly coupled partitioned procedures.  Blood flow through deformable arteries will be used as a benchmark problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed computational framework has the potential to transform, for example, diagnostic capabilities for the initiation and propagation of blood-related diseases, and aerospace structures design.  The research will also revamp some of the courses in structural mechanics and computational methods to include approaches to study fluid-solid interaction problems and enable students to find accurate solutions to societal challenges in designing systems involving fluid-solid couplings.</AbstractNarration>
