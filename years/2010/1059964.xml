<AbstractNarration>Northwest Missouri State University provides twenty-five S-STEM scholarships to talented yet financially disadvantaged students pursuing baccalaureate degrees in computer science or the computer science track of the interactive digital media major.  Scholars receive extensive mentoring, including culturally specific mentoring by faculty, peers and industry professionals as well as career-planning assistance.  Special activities include research and internship opportunities, field trips, attendance at national conferences, ACM membership and tutoring.  Students from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply for these scholarships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Socially relevant aspects of computing have been integrated into the computing curricula at Northwest Missouri State University.  This project will measure the effectiveness of using this approach to improve student retention. The effects of culturally specific mentoring will also be measured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the project, Northwest Missouri State University faculty members work with area K-12 teachers to integrate computing into the K-12 curriculum.  These ties introduce computing to a diverse pool of potential scholars and improve exposure to computing concepts in area K-12 schools.  In addition, the resources developed through this project are available to other colleges and universities so that results obtained at Northwest can be replicated at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our goal within this program was to utilize socially relevant projects and assignments to increase student buy-in for related courses within our Computing majors (Computer Science and Digital Media). Early on, we adjusted the focus slightly as the majority of our efforts turned to helping at-risk students succeed in a higher education environment.  While the majority of our scholars flourished, a good number struggled early in their collegiate career.  This is not to say they were unable to do the work.  The issue was their ability to adjust to the new academic environment and focusing efforts towards the work required to succeed.  We built a supporting community for these students.  This involved monthly meetings where we encouraged students to support one another in their courses.  We also shared monthly tips for succeeding in college.  As the program grew, the scholars themselves became a bigger part of the solution.  We hired several of the older scholars to be tutors for the younger group.  This helped further develop a social community amongst the scholars, and we believe it was a critical component for our program?s success.   In addition to this, several scholars joined our CS ?Road Show? project.  This group of students travelled to high schools in our region as part of our School outreach program.  Participating in the road show gave scholars an opportunity to ?give back? to the community and see the impact that their knowledge and work in technology can have on society.  We also offered scholars the opportunity to attend an external Computer Science education conference to build awareness of the global scope of computing.  Ten scholars took advantage of this opportunity and volunteered to work a few hours at the conference to help defray their costs to attend the conference.  These scholars worked and interacted with students from other universities who were also studying Computer Science and attend presentations.  After this event, it was apparent that several had a greater appreciation of the worldwide impact of what they were learning in the classroom.  While we expected our efforts to have an effect on retention within this group of students, the numbers are much higher than we anticipated and notably higher than within the general population in the Computer Science and Digital Media programs:            Completion Percentage in field    Graduating from university      Overall CS / Digital Media    16%    44%      Scholars:    81%    Not Available       Several potential variables likely affected these outcomes:  Funding motivated scholars to stay in major Scholars received elevated academic support including faculty and peer tutoring Student academic ability was part of the criteria for admission into this program Scholars were forced to engage with other students, resulting in a greater sense of ?belonging? Mentor and outreach programs provided external validation of their education experiences   Reflecting on what we have done within this program and where our success came from, we found that engaging students early in their academic career has a huge impact on completion rate.  We were most successful with connecting them to older students who can share their experiences.  We also found that providing opportunities for the scholars to interact with the outside world using their Computer Science knowledge helped as well.
