<AbstractNarration>Recently, there has been an explosion of research on exciting new fashionable (so-called "smart") materials that can react to stimuli such as temperature, chemical composition, light, and magnetic field by deforming and changing their shape. They have the potential to completely revolutionize the design of a wide variety of devices ranging from human adaptive exoskeletons/prosthetics, to morphable wings of aircrafts and energy harvesting applications. The global market for such "smart" material devices is growing at a rate of approximately 10% and is one of the areas where a significant competitive advantage of the US can be maintained. However, designers of "smart" components have been stymied by the lack of well-developed simulation tools to evaluate their designs and to control the devices during use. The proposed research addresses this need by establishing a rational scientific basis for the analysis of "smart" structural components based on a novel thermodynamical framework that combines aspects of Lagrangian mechanics together with newly developed simulation techniques (which are called discrete variational integrators). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has the potential to transform the "smart" systems design landscape by bringing scientific predictive capabilities into the hands of designers of "smart" devices, allowing them to conceive and develop innovative structures and devices for a variety of applications. The research will also revamp selected structural mechanics courses in mechanical engineering to include a rational approach to designing with these materials. The research will motivate both graduate and undergraduate students to create innovative solutions to societal challenges with these materials.</AbstractNarration>

Computationally we are able to exploit this and create a "two step" scheme were we take a purely non-dissipative "shape change step" followed by a dissipative "internal redistribution" step.   By using this technique, we were able to do the following:   1. We were able to develop a new way of modeling shape memory behavior (which was called a discrete thermodynamic Preisach model)  which was very accurate for both mechanical and thermal loads  while at the same time amenable to obtaining data from experiments.   2. We carried out the first large deformation torsion (or twisting) tests (both loading and unloading and complex paths) on wires and show how well the model is able to simulate this.   3 We developed a new way of quantifying functional degradation of sma wires under thermomechanical loads.  4.
