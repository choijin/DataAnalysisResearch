<AbstractNarration>Ecosystems provide a wide variety of services to human societies.  The services from riparian ecosystems in the Southwest United States derive from the presence of water in a dry land and a web of physical, biological and human processes. Southwestern rivers have been significantly altered by human impacts through surface water diversions, damming, groundwater extraction and impacts from land use change. This project seeks to understand how ecosystem services change in response to extraction or addition of water to ecosystems due to population change and climate change.  The project will look at how the value of ecosystem services changes in response to decreases in water availability and to increases in water availability to these systems. The standing hypothesis is that once dewatered, restoration of hydrologic conditions will result in a lower level of ecosystem services and value than was originally found in these ecosystems.  The utilization of existing data on dewatering and on restoration will provide a robust library of understanding of how the value of ecosystems services in riparian systems change in response to hydrologic and biological conditions.  This library of knowledge will then be used to understand how these systems might respond to drivers of change in these systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further understanding of the interaction of physical, biological and economic processes in free flowing river systems will better inform management in more controlled and human affected systems such as dammed rivers or rivers with large amounts of diversion for agriculture.  Since this project will project the potential effects of future changes in population change and climate change, it is important that these efforts be transferred quickly to the decision-making realm. This project's team incorporates federal, state and local stakeholders. Interaction with these stakeholders will ensure that this research is relevant and can quickly be applied in the real world.  This interaction will also expose students and post-doctoral researchers to potential career paths across the earth, ecosystem and economic sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project focused on the integrated set of physical (atmospheric, hydrological, geomorphological), biological, and social factors that impact arid and semi-arid riparian areas.  These impacts in turn influence the ecosystem services society receives and the economic value that society places in these ecosystems.  Our work focused specifically on two river basins that span the US-Mexican border in southern Arizona; the San Pedro basin and the Santa Cruz basin.  In each area of research we made significant scientific progress.  In atmospheric modelling research work showed that precipitation intensity is likely to increase in the near future potentially increasing flood risk in the region.  Such a change might have an impact on total recharge and thus on water resources in arid and semi-arid regions.  Hydrologically our modelling was able to show an increase in runoff due to urbanization processes but alternatively our research results showed the projected decrease in winter precipitation with climate change would likely result in a significant decrease in recharge in both of our study basins.  Geomorphically we demonstrated that the increase in precipitation intensity would result in increased scour events in stream systems of the region.  Such increases in flooding would likely have the result, when combined with increased aridity under climate change, of decreased plant diversity in riparian systems.  An additional biological result was the biological value of effluent discharged to the environment differs significantly based on the hydrologic conditions of that environment.  Specifically, adding effluent discharge from urban areas results in much greater riparian vegetated area when the re-effluent conditions are relatively wet.  Our demographic projection s of population growth in the two basins indicate significantly lower (approximately half as large) population growth than is included in current projections.  The reason for this difference is that current economic development projections rely on past migration patterns to hold. The more detailed analysis done as part of this project indicates that change in demographics in source regions for migration (the US Midwest, California, and Mexico) will result in slower population growth than currently projected.  Finally, the attempts to estimate the value of ecosystem services provided by the studied rivers showed a significant threshold effect in peopleÆs valuation of the systems.  When asked to invest resources in restoration or preservation participants changed their responses when they saw significant degradation of the system that they previously had not chosen. This change in choice indicates some threshold for degradation that induces concern on the part of the participants.
