<AbstractNarration>The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) is a shared corpus that supports research across&lt;br/&gt;several disciplines: linguistics, computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics and&lt;br/&gt;machine learning. It includes a wide variety of present-day American English texts annotated for&lt;br/&gt;several linguistic phenomena. Because MASC provides a unique resource, considerable&lt;br/&gt;community momentum has grown up around it. This project builds upon this momentum to&lt;br/&gt;enable the corpus to grow on its own, and to address the need for additional annotations. The&lt;br/&gt;major activities are to : (1) provide web-based mechanisms to facilitate community contribution&lt;br/&gt;and use of MASC annotations; (2) develop means to more fully automate the annotation&lt;br/&gt;validation process; (3) extend the WordNet annotations to cover adjectives, to support research&lt;br/&gt;on evaluation of ?subjective? annotations and harmonization of WordNet with other resources;&lt;br/&gt;(3) promote use of MASC and new annotations by diverse groups, by sponsoring shared tasks&lt;br/&gt;that exploit the corpus? unique characteristics and supporting beta-testers of software, data, and&lt;br/&gt;annotations; and (4) aggressively develop an ?Open Language Data? community around MASC&lt;br/&gt;through workshops, tutorials, and active participation in relevant community activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MASC provides an unparalleled resource for training and testing of tools for natural language&lt;br/&gt;processing, which can enable a major leap in the productivity of NLP research and ultimately&lt;br/&gt;impact the way people use and interact with computers. It is the first fully open, communitydriven&lt;br/&gt;resource in the field. All data and annotations are freely distributed in a manner that&lt;br/&gt;permits immediate and easy accessibility for users around the globe.</AbstractNarration>
