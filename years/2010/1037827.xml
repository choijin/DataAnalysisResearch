<AbstractNarration>Kapiolani Community College, University of Hawaii (UH) System proposes to develop ?Hawaii?s Pre- &lt;br/&gt;engineering Education Collaborative? (PEEC) that will support 155 Native Hawaiian (NH) students &lt;br/&gt;(females, males, and students with disabilities) pursuing and completing baccalaureate degrees at the UH Manoa College of Engineering (UHMCOE).  Since 2006, the UHMCOE has accepted a total of 117 &lt;br/&gt;transfer students from the four participating community colleges and UH Maui College (UH MC): &lt;br/&gt;Kapiolani (50), Leeward (51), Honolulu and Windward (4 each), UH MC (8). &lt;br/&gt;Goal 1: A Quality Pre-Engineering Core Curriculum: that prepares NH students for success in &lt;br/&gt;progressively higher level courses in their Engineering education, effectively integrating Calculus, and &lt;br/&gt;that is available online in every semester during the project and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;Goal 2: A Community of Practice in Engineering: connecting NH students, mentors, and &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate researchers with nurturing advising, structured cohort experiences, quality curriculum, &lt;br/&gt;faculty/researchers, and community partners, through funded positions for students, increased &lt;br/&gt;engagement with engineering issues and industries, and online communication strategies.  &lt;br/&gt;1) Faculty leaders in PEEC will review pre-engineering course success rates for NH students, and &lt;br/&gt;improve existing and new courses by integrating technology, service, peer mentoring, research, and &lt;br/&gt;internship opportunities, preparing NH students for Engineering degree completion and careers in Hawaii. &lt;br/&gt;Activities &lt;br/&gt;2) Develop one new course Engineering 100, Introduction to Engineering, and one existing course, &lt;br/&gt;Physics 272, General Physics 2, for online delivery.   &lt;br/&gt;3) Integrate key concepts from ?Introduction to Engineering Design? (ME 213), and student projects from &lt;br/&gt;?Junior/Senior Engineering Design? (ME 481-482), into successive NH Summer Engineering &lt;br/&gt;Experiences (SEE). &lt;br/&gt;4) Develop three SEE that anchor NH cohorts for successful transfer, degree completion, and careers. &lt;br/&gt;5) Increase and strengthen recruitment and engagement (service, peer mentoring, undergraduate research, &lt;br/&gt;renewable energy and sustainability projects) opportunities for NH students. &lt;br/&gt;6) Increase NH student engagement with each other and key stakeholders: NH scientists, community &lt;br/&gt;experts, UH researchers, local industry, and federal, state, and county government partners. &lt;br/&gt;1) 170 NH students complete 6 week Summer Engineering Experiences at KCC, UH MC, and UHMCOE. &lt;br/&gt;Outcomes &lt;br/&gt;2) 50 students complete the ASNS degree in Physical Sciences at KCC. &lt;br/&gt;3) 155 students complete all of a shared 39-credit pre-engineering core curriculum and transfer. &lt;br/&gt;4) 124 NH students complete UHMCOE Bachelor of Science degree (80% completion rate). &lt;br/&gt;5) Improved Pre-engineering core curriculum available online to all ten UH campuses and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;6) Hawaii?s PEEC curriculum, support and engagement strategies disseminated statewide and nationally. &lt;br/&gt;7) Hawaii?s PEEC partnerships for sustainability established, program expanded to all UH campuses.</AbstractNarration>
