<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award to Mississippi State University funds the acquisition of a triple quadrupole gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS/MS) system to enhance the scientific response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and its effects on coastal ecosystems.  Reliable and sensitive state-of-the art instruments are critically needed in order to provide the much needed rapid analytical services for various state agencies and research groups in the State of Mississippi for monitoring and biological research efforts in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster.  Therefore, an expected result of this NSF-RAPID award is timely and critical information to inform policy and remediation efforts in response to the oil spill.  Short-term and long-term monitoring, biological, environmental exposure, remediation, and public health research programs addressing the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill disaster are examples of the research areas that will benefit from reliable, sensitive, and timely analytical support. This analytical support can certainly also be provided to agencies of other affected States. In addition, examples of Gulf Oil Spill contamination analysis will be incorporated into graduate level courses, beginning with the Fall semester of 2010.  Results from the studies and education efforts will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journal publications and though participation at regional and national scientific meetings, as well as to the state and federal agencies and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

This is an ongoing concerted effort with the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality. The first set of samples consisting of shrimp, crab, oysters, and finfish were received by MSCL on May 27 2010. Samples were collected and analyzed weekly until November 2010 and monthly thereafter. Up to date, the levels of PAHs detected in all the seafood samples were far below the public health Levels of Concern (LOC) established jointly by the NOAA/FDA/Gulf Coast states under the protocol to reopen state and federal waters. The PAHs levels in the seafood samples were similar to those detected in the commonly consumed processed foods purchased from local grocery stores and restaurants. In addition, there is insignificant concentration difference between PAHs detected in the oyster samples for the current study and the 10-year historical data from the NOAA Mussel Watch program. In addition to working with state agencies, MSCL has been working closely with agencies from other states and FDA on analytical method development, information exchange, and analytical support. Up to date, four presentations have been made at the national and international meetings, and one manuscript to be submitted to the Environmental Science and Technology is in completion and to be submitted in late-October.
