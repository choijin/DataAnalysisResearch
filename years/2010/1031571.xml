<AbstractNarration>SES-1031571&lt;br/&gt;PI: Robert B. Willer&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Sarah B. Garrett&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California, Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do one's cultural resources such as one's skills, styles, and ways of understanding the world shape the experience of becoming a mother for the first time? This study is designed to enrich research on motherhood and evaluate and elaborate a well-established theory of how culture works in everyday life. The mixed-method, longitudinal study collects survey data from pregnant women at diverse institutions in Northern California, and pre- and post-partum interview data from a subset of these women.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This study will illuminate a historically understudied life stage while simultaneously representing the experiences of less privileged women and women of color, who have been largely excluded from social science accounts of motherhood. This research will be shared with academic audiences, expectant parents, and prenatal care providers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research study is broadly about how culture shapes womenÆs experiences of new motherhood. It is designed to accomplish four goals: (a) to diversify the populations of women represented in this area of study; (b) to investigate how individuals perceive the meanings and importance of certain behaviors in the pre- and post-birth period. These perceptions ("interpretive frames") are the core aspect of culture investigated in this study; (c) to investigate whether and how these perceptions affect individualsÆ preferences, actions and well-being in this period; and (d) to consider how individualsÆ communities and social networks shape these effects.   For this project I (co-PI Sarah Garrett) administered English and Spanish surveys to over 400 pregnant women in the California Bay Area who were receiving care at prenatal clinics or at home in preparation for homebirth. I worked for most of a year to gain access to sites that served underprivileged women and women of color&mdash;groups that have long been excluded from academic and popular representations of motherhood.
