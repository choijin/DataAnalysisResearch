<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh and the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research at Carnegie Mellon University hosted Engineering Sustainability 2011: Innovation and the Triple Bottom Line (ES11) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from April 10-12, 2011. This conference brought together engineers and scientists from academia, government, industry, and non-profits to share results of cutting edge research and practice directed at the development of environmentally sustainable buildings and infrastructure.   The conference, which attracted over 340 attendees, is unique in its focus on environmentally sustainable engineering for the urban environment, and its ability to bring together engineers, architects, economists, and urban planners and managers.  Because we reached out to a broad base of disciplines for speakers, we were able to gain a variety of perspectives on the way that green building research is conducted among various scientific fields. In addition, by engaging different fields, we gained an appreciation for research bottlenecks for creating greener buildings which should lead to new research programs and tangible solutions leading to a more sustainable community infrastructure.  Engineering Sustainability 2011 will further the public interest in sustainable community infrastructure by advancing the state of scientific knowledge on issues affecting human health and the environment.  This conference will also enhance interdisciplinary dialogue on environmental sustainability research with cross-cutting applications in both basic and applied sciences.  Funds from NSF were specifically used to enable the attendance of 40 junior researchers including young faculty, postdoctoral associates, and PhD students to the conference to present their work in both oral and poster formats.
