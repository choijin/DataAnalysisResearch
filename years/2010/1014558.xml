<AbstractNarration>This US-Latin America award will support a workshop that will promote international scientific collaboration for seismological research and hazard mitigation between the Middle America region and the US.  The workshop will be held in October 2010 in San Jose, Costa Rica and will be co-funded by the Division of Earth Sciences and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  The meeting will focus on:  (a) scientific issues that derive from the unique tectonic environment of the region, (b) strengthening the regional infrastructure and academic community for seismological research, and (c) generating products with immediate regional societal benefits.  Participants will include researchers from universities and geophysical observatory networks, students, national policy experts, and emergency planners from the US, Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean.  The workshop will be organized by Dr. Ray Willemann from Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) in collaboration with Drs. Marino Protti, Richard Robertson, and Gerardo Suarez from the Universidad Nacional in Costa Rica, the University of the West Indies in Trinidad and Tobago, and the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma in Mexico, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activity will bring together a diverse community of researchers, graduate students, practioners, and policy makers from the United States and Latin America.  Outcomes from the workshop will lead to new insights regarding developing hazard mitigation systems, seismograph networks, and data sharing mechanisms in the region.  Additionally, new interdisciplinary projects of interest to NSF, USAID, and the participating countries are expected outcome of this workshop.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Geophysical Hazards and Plate Boundary Processes in the Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean: A Workshop to Build Seismological Collaboration and Capacity Outcomes Report  On October 24-28, 2010, over 90 scientists, educators, students, policy makers, and experts in hazard mitigation and development planning gathered in Heredia, Costa Rica to lay the foundation of a collaborative structure whose mission is to enhance seismological and geodetic research and to reduce vulnerability to earthquake, volcano, and tsunami hazards within the region.  The workshop opened with an evening session welcoming participants and outlining the goals of the meeting.  The evening program highlighted the prominence of policy attention granted to the Workshop and included a Special Address from H.E. Anne Slaughter Andrew, U.S. Ambassador to Costa Rica, followed by a Welcoming Address by IRIS President, David Simpson, and the Keynote Address delivered by Acting Science Adviser to the U.S. Secretary of State, Andrew Reynolds.  During the course of the following three days, individuals from diverse disciplines from over twenty countries analyzed the regional needs and resources available for seismological research, for mitigation of earthquake, tsunami and volcano hazards, and for addressing key science questions regarding tectonic processes in the region. U.S. scientists outlined successful examples of facilities, data sharing, and educational exchanges, and a panel of experts in science and development programs explored options for funding future international initiatives.  The workshop culminated with a final day of plenary discussion leading to the ratification of a statement of recommended actions for all nations in the region to reduce their exposure to earthquake hazards, and a resolution of support for Haiti as it recovers from the January 12, 2010 earthquake.  The overall sense of the meeting was that the best means of fostering regional collaboration and carrying forward workshop goals was to work together on specific scientific projects.  A microzonation study in the Dominican Republic was identified as a particularly high priority.  Five working groups were formed to organize these effort and other future projects. Since the 2010 workshop, the chairs of the working groups and other interested scientists have met again and are currently pursuing support for these important international initiatives.  Detailed accounts of the workshop outcomes is available at: http://www.iris.edu/hq/middle_america/       Last Modified: 10/28/2011       Submitted by: Olga A Cabello]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
