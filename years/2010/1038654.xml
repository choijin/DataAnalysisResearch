<AbstractNarration>This proposed Communicating Research to Public Audiences (CRPA) project outlines a pathway for communicating how climate change can affect a watershed area that supplies water for a specific region. The educational platforms will address the geology of the Caldera along with meteorology, ecology and hydrology. The project will focus on the ongoing scientific research processes and the impact of climate change to the physical system as well as to the citizens who depend on this resource. Partners in this endeavor include New Mexico EPSCOR, the University of New Mexico, the Valles Caldera National Preserve, the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, Santa Fe Productions and Tim Aydelott Productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team will create a PBS television documentary in English and Spanish, including a Native American Jemez Pueblo storyteller who will describe the natural environment of the Caldera. The team will also create a YouTube channel with updatable clips, a Facebook fan page, and a climate change exhibit. The evaluation will include front-end and summative components, and will be conducted by Minnick &amp; Associates and Elsa Bailey Consulting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intended impact of this CRPA is to educate the public about the importance of the Caldera in securing the region's water supply and how climate changes could impact their lives. Further, aspects of the multidisciplinary science used in this research will be described with the goal of encouraging more young people from the region to choose STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A one-hour documentary, Valles Caldera, A Grand Land Experiment, airing on public television stations takes viewers to a unique landscape in New Mexico to explore the geology and ecology of the Valles Caldera National Preserve.    This journey to a super volcano explores the five-part mandate preserve managers must follow to ensure the continued preservation of this landscape.   The VCNP managers balance multiple mandates to:  Protect the environment Serve the public with recreational programs Conduct quality ecosystem research Run a working cattle ranch Be self-sustaining   The documentary highlights the biological, ecological, environmental, and geophysical research activities that have taken place at the Valles Caldera.  It will also demonstrate the value of such a unique system as an outdoor laboratory for training the next generation of scientists.    The production is currently scheduled for public television broadcasts on 58 channels in 15 states, with potential to reach nearly 57 million viewers of all ages.
