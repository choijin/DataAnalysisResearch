<AbstractNarration>Lake-effect snowstorms are a key source of wintertime precipitation and high-impact weather over the Great Lakes region.  These storms typically evince one of two contrasting morphologies: Wind-parallel roll circulations in which elongated precipitation features are preferentially oriented along the prevailing low-level flow (and accompanying vertical wind shear), versus long lake-axis parallel (LLAP) precipitation bands that are typically more intense with a preferred mid-lake location.  LLAP-type storms are more common over the Eastern Great Lakes (viz. Erie and Ontario), but have been studied far less than wind-parallel bands.  This exploratory project will field a newly polarized single "Doppler on Wheels" (DOW) mobile radar to observe LLAP-type snowbands.  These data, which will be collected during a five-week period during winter 2010-11, will be complemented by mobile rawinsonde-derived thermodynamic profiles obtained both within and external to these bands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this effort centers on improved specification of the mesoscale morphology, evolution and precipitation mechanisms within intense LLAP-type lake effect snowbands.  In view of this first-ever deployment of a polarized DOW in a cool-season setting, attention will be directed to a critical evaluation of polarization quantities and hydrometeor classification output from this recently upgraded platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts will accrue through support of research at a primarily undergraduate academic institution and via direct involvement of a group of undergraduate students in both the collection and analysis of this exploratory dataset.  Results will be disseminated via conference presentations and formal publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lake-effect snow causes much disruption to the public, especially transportation downwind of the Great Lakes.  These storms form in narrow bands (~10 km wide) and can produce very heavy snowfall rates (e.g., &gt; 5 cm/hr).  Most lake-effect storm research has been done on the Western Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan, and Huron) where the bands are typically in a multiple configuration.  The storm bands which form downwind of Lakes Erie and Ontario are commonly singular, but more intense than their western counterparts.  Hence, we wanted to study them in more detail.  This grant was an exploratory project, a proof-of-concept showing that a mobile radar (Doppler on Wheels; DOW) can sample the low-levels of lake-effect storms in the hilly terrain (with lots of trees) of upstate New York.  We were very successful in doing so, sampling seven events over a 2-month period (15 December - 15 February 2010-11).  Some of the results are shown in Steiger et al. (2013) and in the associated images here: hook-echoes in the plan view indicate many areas of rotation develop within the bands, the vertical cross-sections show complex structure, including horizontal vortices.  This project was completely run by undergraduate students (mostly of junior and senior status, but even one freshman was involved) attending the State University of New York at Oswego (SUNY-Oswego) and the University of Illinois.  This is rare in most field projects, but was proven a success here.  Ten SUNY-O students participated in the collection of data while four were involved in the analysis and publication portion of the grant.  They were dependable and very enthusiastic.  I firmly believe the experience helped to propel some of these students into graduate school.  Hence, this project was successful in showing two exploratory actions as part of this grant: high quality (and quantity of) data were collected by the DOW, and undergraduate students can be counted on to run a sophisticated project.  Finally, the successes of this project have led to the awarding of grants for an upcoming major lake-effect project called the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) project, which will involve many more facilities (e.g., three DOWs and aircraft) to more thoroughly study these storms over Lake Ontario during the winter of 2013-14.
