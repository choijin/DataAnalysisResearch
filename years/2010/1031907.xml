<AbstractNarration>Current mobile technology offers the key to enabling a host of new wireless devices, protocols, applications, and services using location awareness, environmental sensing, personal-area networks, and intelligent energy management. This area of research pushes the boundaries of existing technologies taking a broad systems perspective rather than focus narrowly on low-level components to explore and gain insight into investigating the next generation of mobile systems. In 2008, the first Phd Forum on Mobile Systems Applications and Services held in conjunction with MobiSys provided a friendly and supportive environment for doctoral students to present and discuss their dissertation research. The forum succeeded on all accounts, bringing together future researchers with their peers and with a panel of experienced researchers from academia and industry. In addition to providing feedback and advice, this forum provided an opportunity for students to network as well as to practice presenting their research clearly and concisely. The MobiSys 2010 PhD Forum workshop will be organized entirely by PhD students and recent graduates?providing valuable experiences reviewing submissions, fund raising, and hosting events.  Support of this activity enables the participation of graduate students who would otherwise be unable to attend the MobiSys 2010 PhD Forums.</AbstractNarration>
