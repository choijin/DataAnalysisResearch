<AbstractNarration>It is commonly accepted that there is a crisis in education in the US. There are too many struggling learners, too many students who cannot read or do basic arithmetic, let alone advanced mathematics. What is not commonly accepted is what to do about this crisis. The researchers at the Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center (TDLC) believe that part of the current crisis in education is the lack of scientific understanding of how the brain learns, and the lack of translation of this scientific understanding to the classroom. An essential, yet understudied, component of learning that could have a strong impact on education is the role of time and timing in learning. TDLC brought together an interdisciplinary team of over 40 investigators from 16 different research institutions in order to focus research energy on this goal. TDLC's purpose is to achieve an integrated understanding of the role of time and timing in learning, across multiple time and spatial scales, brain systems, and social systems, to 1) create a new science of the temporal dynamics of learning; 2) to use this understanding to transform educational practice; and 3) to create a new collaborative research structure, the network of research networks, to transform the practice of science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why study timing? Timing is critical for learning at every level, from learning the precise temporal patterns of speech sounds, to learning when to give feedback in the classroom, to the optimal frequency and timing of studying new material. Moreover, a decade of neuroscience research demonstrates that the intrinsic temporal dynamics of the brain itself also reinforce and constrain learning. For example, work at TDLC has shown that measurements of the brain waves of a toddler-the temporal dynamics of thought - can predict how well that child will perform at language tasks years later. This provides the possibility that early intervention could overcome these difficulties, demonstrating the usefulness of studying temporal dynamics. A research program of this size and scope is clearly only possible through the Center Funding model, in order to provide resources at the scale necessary to coordinate the large team of researchers. The work is organized by dividing the personnel into four research networks, where researchers from multiple disciplines are interested in common questions, and who synchronize their research around experiments that can be carried out in humans, animals, and computational models, allowing unprecedented convergence of techniques on a single question.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center (TDLC) founded in 2006, focused on the role of time and timing in learning. We had a broad mandate, working at many levels of scale &ndash; from the 10s of milliseconds scale at which brain cells learn, to the scale of months and years, the scale most relevant for the classroom. This required bringing together researchers from psychology, neuroscience, computer science, engineering, physics, and robotics. As such, TDLC was the largest of the six Science of Learning Centers funded by NSF. We were comprised of 40 PIs from 18 institutions in 4 countries (the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK). To organize this huge effort, we created a network of research networks. Each network was comprised of about 10 researchers from different fields. The idea was that 10 people with 3 of their trainees each could all sit around a U-shaped table, at network meetings, so everyone had a &ldquo;seat at the table.&rdquo; The trainees were strongly affected by this experience &ndash; learning to talk across disciplines, and getting feedback on their work from experts from outside their home field. A common problem in competitive science is that researchers are like the blind men and the elephant, each seeing a problem from their point of view. Our research network organization promoted <em>cooperative science</em>, where researchers could see the whole elephant.&nbsp; This organization produced a spirit of collaboration that pervaded the Center.
