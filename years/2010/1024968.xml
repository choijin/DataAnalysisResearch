<AbstractNarration>The recent housing foreclosure crisis has had devastating impacts on individuals and their communities. To mitigate some of these impacts a number of community-based organizations are acquiring foreclosed properties in efforts to support neighborhood stabilization and revitalization. Examples of actions taken on these foreclosed properties include: land-banking, rehabilitation, demolition and re-sale or/re-rental. These actions have the potential to minimize blight, reduce unanticipated housing mobility, and provide affordable housing opportunities. However, the cost of pursuing any or all of these strategies to their fullest extent far exceeds the resources available to typical community-based organizations. In this research project, the PIs will develop decision support tools to assist community based organizations in identifying the subset of available foreclosed properties to  acquired for the purposes of neighborhood stabilization and revitalization, determining  which actions should be undertaken with respect to which properties, when the actions should be taken and to what degree?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the policy/decision models developed will yield acquisition policies that are, relative to current operations and procedures: (1) more efficient, i.e. they make better use of organization resources and social subsidies, (2) more effective, i.e. they help organizations make more rapid progress towards social goals related to affordable housing and community development, and (3) more equitable, i.e. they ensure that stakeholder groups and the communities see the foreclosure acquisition process as more transparent, consistent and fair.</AbstractNarration>

With four co-principal investigators and three graduate research assistants from across the University of Massachusetts system, the team  designed multiple models and applications to support the efforts of community-based organizations to design localized responses to residential foreclosures. These solutions embody key principles of CBOR: they reflect multiple academic disciplines, use qualitative and quantitative data and analytic methods, reflect an ethic of participatory community engagement, and address the needs of neighborhoods that are diverse according to demographics, urban form and housing market characteristics.  Our project incorporated findings and community partner relationships from an antecedent pilot project. Our team developed relationships with four community development corporations: one in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, another in the ægatewayÆ cities of Chelsea and Lowell  and the last in the twin cities of Fitchburg and Leominster (see Figure 1). Each region contained distressed neighborhoods that had low measures of housing market strength and high measures of foreclosure risk (see Figure 2). Each partner CDC was engaged in intensive efforts of foreclosure response, including acquisition and redevelopment of foreclosed housing at particular risk for neighborhood blighting influences. We found that our decision modeling solutions, and the use that our partners made of them, reflected their organizational capacity, mission, and neighborhood characteristics.  Using KeeneyÆs (1992) value-focused thinking decision analytic method, we were able to develop values structures linking core or fundamental values that define an organizationÆs mission to means/ends objectives more closely associated with decision problems of immediate concern, to specific decision alternatives. These values structures, reflecting concerns of CDCs in Chelsea, Lowell and Fitchburg/Leominster, provided valuable insights into the nature of decision aids for community development broadly, not just foreclosure response (see Figure 3).
