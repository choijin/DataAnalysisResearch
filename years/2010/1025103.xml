<AbstractNarration>Doctoral Dissertation Research in Economics:&lt;br/&gt;Risk Sharing Over the Rwandan Mobile Phone Network&lt;br/&gt;Objectives and Methods&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research investigates the economic impacts of mobile phone use in Rwanda, focusing particularly on the use of Me2U, a new system that enables interpersonal transfers of money over the Rwandan mobile phone network. Taking advantage of a unique dataset obtained from the country's primary mobile phone operator, the researchers will develop an understanding of what causes these transfers, and whether these transfers have an effect on the economic lives of the Rwandan populace. The research questions of primary interest are:&lt;br/&gt;1) How does the structure of a person's social network affect his ability to use and benefit from mobile-phone based financial services?&lt;br/&gt;2) Are phone-based transfers used as a mechanism for informal insurance and risk sharing?&lt;br/&gt;3) How do these new services affect and interact with traditional institutions for credit and insurance?&lt;br/&gt;Empirically, the analysis will combine three datasets: (i) a log of all interpersonal monetary transfers that occurred in Rwanda during the period 2005-2009; (ii) demographic and socioeconomic information collected in phone surveys by the researchers in 2009 and 2010; (iii) third party data on agricultural prices, weather, and household demographics. By matching data on phone usage to corresponding spatio-temporal economic data, the research will shed light on the correlates, causes, economic consequences of mobile-based financial services in Rwanda.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This research makes two primary intellectual contributions. First, it elucidates the economic impacts of mobile phones in the developing world. The relevant economics literature has largely focused on the role of phones in reducing information asymmetries in agricultural markets; the proposed research thus adds a new perspective on the direct impacts of mobile phones and mobile-based financial services. Second, it develops new methodological techniques for the analysis of mobile phone data in Economics research. Datasets of this nature are becoming increasingly available, and can help answer many questions of economic interest. However, economists interested in development rarely use such data, and the sheer size of the datasets precludes the use of standard statistical packages. By combining quantitative methods from Economics and Computer Science, the researchers will develop analytic techniques that can make this type of data more useful in future economic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Operationally, the proposed field study will involve ten university students from the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology in Rwanda. These students, who have very limited exposure to scientific research, will be trained as surveyors and will learn the fundamentals of quantitative research. More broadly, given the rapid growth of mobile phone networks in the developing world, it is important to build a better understanding of the economic impacts of mobile phones and mobile-based financial services. Phones are commonly touted as a transformative force in international development, but little is known about whether and how phones actually improve economic outcomes and promote human wellbeing. This research investigates three different mechanisms by which mobile phones can improve the lives of those with access to the technology, and helps inform the larger debate about the role of information and communications technologies in global economic development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In times of urgent need, friends and family often rely upon each other for immediate support.  While social networks can help people deal with hard times, when an entire community is affected by a massive shock, local social networks are often unable to cope. This research documents how a new mobile phone-based technology is being used to allow people to share risk quickly over relatively long distances.   Using detailed data obtained from Rwanda's main phone service provider, we study how people are helping each other using a basic form of "Mobile Money."  Mobile Money is a phone-based electronic currency akin to PayPal in the U.S., which is becoming wildly popular in developing countries, where billions of people have mobile phones but very few have access to brick-and-mortar banks.   The first thing we noticed is that after major shocks like earthquakes and natural disasters, individuals in Rwanda send a significant volume of Mobile Money to the people affected by the shocks.  In this video (www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uShJaGOkc4), you can see how dramatically a large earthquake in 2008 affected patterns of mobile phone traffic in the country. Using econometric models, we quantified this response.  Following this particular earthquake, 85 dollars was sent to the earthquake victims over the mobile phone network.  Moreover, because of increases in adoption over the past few years, we estimate that roughly $30,000 would be sent in response to a current-day earthquake.  In a small country where most people earn only a few dollars a day, this is a sizeable amount of money.   Perhaps more importantly, when we analyze the dynamics of the social network captured in the billions of phone calls and transfers in our dataset, we find that the pattern of activity is most consistent with a model of risk sharing, where people give to each other based largely on quid-pro-quo.  In other words, John helps Jane when Jane is in trouble because he expects Jane to reciprocate in JohnÆs time of need.  In places like Rwanda where banks are rare and people typically donÆt have much in the way of savings, such risk sharing can make a major difference in keeping individuals insured against income volatility, and protected against the "poverty traps" that prevent poor people from moving out of poverty.   This is good news for those advocating for the expansion of mobile networks and mobile services in developing countries.  To the extent that Mobile Money facilitates risk sharing, these results indicate that the technology can be a positive force for economic development.  However, not everything is positive.  We observe that it is chiefly the wealthy mobile phone owners, and the ones with the strongest social networks, who receive the lionÆs share of the risk sharing transfers.  Taken together, the results indicate that the mobile network can improve the welfare of some but, absent intervention, the benefits may not reach those with the greatest need.   These results also lead to insights that can help shape public policy.  The airtime transfers we document were from private individuals. Only a small proportion of affected individuals benefitted from them. We therefore recommend setting up an emergency program whereby, in the immediate aftermath of a major disaster, a small amount of airtime or mobile money would be sent automatically to all phone numbers associated with cell towers in the affected area. For this to be possible, an emergency assistance system must be anticipatively set up in collaboration with phone providers.   Setting up this emergency program is of interest to all countries where phone owners rely on pay-as-you-go, and is thus particularly relevant for all developing countries, especially those affected by earthquakes or tsunamis. If adopted, the program is expected to save lives in a simple and cost effective way by enabling people to call for help if trapped under collapsed buildings or surrounded by water. It should assist emerge...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
