<AbstractNarration>The Colorado State University Herbarium is the oldest and third largest herbarium in the Southern Rocky Mountains.  The herbarium is a major depository of collections made by the Colorado Natural Heritage Program, the Nature Conservancy, the Colorado Natural Areas Program, and the National Parks Service units in Colorado.  All 94,420 specimens will be imaged and databased.  Specimens will be made publicly accessible online with the Deep Zoom format for seamless viewing of high resolution images in Microsoft Live Labs Pivot.  Species and specimen attributes will be added to the interface so that the general public may use it in the manner of an interactive key for the Colorado flora together with magnified images of microscopic traits necessary for species identification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The herbarium's collections have been systematically annotated as part of an upcoming state-wide flora and are an ideal reference collection.  Together with the flora, the Pivot-based interface will enable students, the general public, land managers, researchers, and botanists to more effectively and efficiently identify vascular plants in Colorado.  The database will document current floristic diversity and help track changes caused by development, climate change, and/or introduction of new species.  The Pivot-based interface with Deep Zoom will be generally applicable, and made accessible to other natural-history collections.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Colorado State University (CSU) Herbarium is the oldest and third largest herbarium in the Southern Rocky Mountains.  The CSU Herbarium is a major depository of collections made by the Colorado Natural Heritage Program, the Nature Conservancy, the Colorado Natural Areas Program, and the National Parks Service units in Colorado.  The collections include specimens that formed the bases for two currently out-of-date floras of Colorado.   For this project we have completed the following three objectives.  First, all specimens in the CSU Herbarium prior to a private gift of  about 20,000 specimens in 2013 &ndash; 2014 have been databased, barcoded, and imaged, including 170 type specimens and a reference collection of the Colorado flora.  Additionally, we have databased and imaged about half of the private gift.   Second, our specimen database and images are available online at both http://herbarium.biology.colostate.edu/collection/specimens/ and http://www.swbiodiversity.org.  For the former we have implemented the Deep Zoom format so that users may seamlessly zoom into the image from a thumbnail up to a full resolution photo.  Users may easily use these images in the same manner as an online reference collection, with one representative example of each family, genus, and species available for viewing at each of the different taxonomic levels.  Species names are also linked to Species 2000 (http://www.sp2000.org/) and the ITIS Catalogue of Life and the Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org).  Taxonomy searches can be made at the family, genus, and species level. As the user starts typing, an auto-completion set of candidate names are displayed. Searches can be for either scientific or common names.   Third, to help members of the general public who have little botanical experience identify plants within Colorado, we have scored 16 traits (e.g., habit, leaf arrangement, leaf margin, flower color, number of petals, flower symmetry) for 55% of the Colorado vascular-plant species, subspecies, and varieties, and are actively working to complete the rest.  At https://herbarium.biology.colostate.edu/collection/specimens/ users may click on the particular traits that apply to their plant, and then see images of all groups of species that match their description for interactive species identification.   The data generated for this project were used as a primary basis for Jennifer Ackerfield, the CSU HerbariumÆs collection manager, to complete her book that is entitled Flora of Colorado, which was published in May 2015.  The Flora of Colorado contains species descriptions for 3322 species, subspecies, and varieties, in addition to county distribution maps, flowering times, elevation range, and habitat descriptions.  It is 818 pages, and also contains 75 color plates with 12 images per plate totaling 900 images.  As part of this project, Jennifer Ackerfield trained one graduate student, nine undergraduate students, and one high-school student in natural-history-collections-management techniques, including databasing, barcoding, imaging, and filing specimens.  The undergraduates trained include four members of underrepresented minorities.  Three students also participated in scoring the 16 traits cited above.  Jennifer Ackerfield presented findings from this grant to several school groups through tours of the CSU Herbarium, including Future Farmers of America high-school students from rural eastern Colorado; a group of elementary students representing primarily underrepresented minority students from Pueblo, Colorado; tours for botany classes at Rocky Mountain High School in Fort Collins, Colorado; and tours for herbal classes offered through the Golden Poppy Herbal Apothecary in Fort Collins, Colorado.   Jennifer Ackerfield also presented the findings from this grant as the keynote speaker at the annual Colorado Native Plant Society meeting in 2012.  She gave presentations at the Denver Botanic Gardens in 2014, the Boulder Chapter of the...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
