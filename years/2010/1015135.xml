The polymer industry has not been immune to such scrutiny. Conventional methods for polymer processing are undesirable as often, toxic solvents and high-energy methods are employed resulting in gross waste production. Consequently, tremendous amounts of research from the scientific community are in place to probe alternative, environmentally friendly technologies. One such novel route is the utilization of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) as "green" solvent for polymer processes.
