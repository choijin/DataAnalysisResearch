<AbstractNarration>This project establishes a partnership between the Universidad Metropolitana (UMET), the Institutos Tecnologicos de Puerto Rico (ITPR) and representatives from businesses in Puerto Rico with a need for employees with 2-year and 4-year technical degrees in instrumentation, automation and control.  The project is improving the science and mathematics education on two campuses of ITPR in order to produce more qualified instrumentation technicians for local industry and to facilitate the matriculation of ITPR graduates to four-year programs at UMET.   The laboratory facilities on two ITPR campuses are being upgraded and the faculty are receiving professional development in math and science content and modern pedagogical techniques.   UMET is implementing a new bachelors of science degree in instrumentation, automation and control.  The curriculum of the new degree is being developed in conjunction with ITPR and includes articulation agreements.  The new degree makes extensive use of a state-of-the-art instrumentation and process control laboratory.  The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an independent evaluator.  The project results are being disseminated through conference and journal publications with a targeted effort to reach other Hispanic serving institutions.</AbstractNarration>
