<AbstractNarration>Science, Policy and Crime: A Case Study&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the historical construction of the sex offender category through the interplay between crime control and the science of mental health. By analyzing discourses from the legislative, legal, and scientific domains from the late 1960s through the 1990s, the research examines categorization as both the condition for and the effect of the registration of offenders, as enacted in the 1990s in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit &lt;br/&gt;The dissertation examines the following three questions: (1) what constitutes the offender category and how has it changed?; (2) what are the means by which facts constitutive of the target category have been established?; and (3) how did politics and knowledge interact to make possible the operation of offender registries as a significant security measure? The dissertation draws on (1) governmental documents regarding regulations, and major materials produced by non-governmental organizations and individuals involved in the policy processes; (2) the work of psychiatrists and psychologists who have been active and influential in the academic and policy areas; and (3) court opinions and related documents for significant criminal cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact &lt;br/&gt;This project contributes to our understanding of  offender regulation by examining the category as at once a bearer of civil rights and a threat to public safety. Results will be shared with those in the policy and legal areas, victim and offender advocates, and mental health professionals, in order to facilitate reflection.</AbstractNarration>

This project investigates the historical construction of the sex offender category through the interplay between the political field of crime control and the scientific field of mental health. By analyzing discourses produced in the legislative, legal, and scientific domains from the late 1960s through the 1990s, the research examines categorization as both the condition for and the effect of the registration and indefinite commitment of sex offenders, as enacted in the 1990s in the United States.

Intellectual Merit  This project contributes new knowledge to the field of science, technology, and society by examining the role that the human sciences have played in constituting social categories pertaining to crime control.

This approach offers an empirical study of the ways in which modes of scientific knowledge production take shape in particular socio-political settings.     Broader Impacts  In the field of law and social sciences, a number of commentators have pointed out that sex offender regulation has been driven by the aim of punitive, expressive justice.
