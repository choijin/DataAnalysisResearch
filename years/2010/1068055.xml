<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Identification Technology Research (CITeR)" with a focus on technologies of human measurement, identity, and intent that rest on firm pillars of trust, privacy, security, and reliability. The lead of the proposed Center will be Clarkson (CU) with site locations at the West Virginia University (WVU) and the University of Arizona (UA). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technologies to measure, monitor, identify humans and human intent are needed for a broad range of commercial and security applications. The use of technology to both improve performance (e.g. as minimizing false alarms for a given desired positive detection rate) or improving user interface (e.g. speeding lines through airports) will have a strong benefit to society. The proposed center will seek advanced theoretical and analytical techniques for developing algorithms and assessing performance of tools and systems that for human and intent identification. Such tools are needed for a variety of applications, and the current state of the art provides significant room for advancement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center builds upon the past success of an existing center that has been in operation since 2001. West Virginia University and University of Arizona have been the key players in CITeR since its inception, while others such as Michigan State have made notable contributions in areas such as image processing. In this proposal, Clarkson University as the lead institution adds complementary Center capabilities for measurements and signal processing to identity humans and human intent, and expands the center in an important way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research plan represents an appropriate set of projects for comprehensively addressing needs in this area. The investigators are well-qualified to carry out the research, and many have a significant, well-respected research track record in their fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CITeR will focus on research, education, and technology dissemination. CITeR's leadership with Clarkson to develop the Diversity 2050 Initiative program is an active program to identify and address educational needs of next-generation professionals in the identification technology arena, and is likely to lead to a broad-reaching and positive impact to higher education in these areas. The proposal lays out a clear plan for engaging the other CiTER sites in this effort. The proposed and re-organized CITeR will extend its research core while building on the solid foundation of the past. The proposed program builds on an existing center that has had great success since its inception in 2001, with more than 80 projects that have involved 22 faculty and 130 students.</AbstractNarration>

Your identity is what allows you to have a job, maintain a bank account, and drive a car.

In particular, CITeR is focused on providing technology for providing, confirming, and determining identity.  CITeR?s core research focuses on automated decisions surrounding the use of data collected from individuals and resting on firm pillars of trust, privacy, security, and reliability.   Broader Impacts  CITeR faculty are actively engaged with outreach, recruitment, and retention programs at Clarkson. Undergraduate students play an active role in the data collection, research, and implementation of the software competitions. While students may at some point become associated with a research community at the university, we recognize the need to engage students earlier (e.g., freshman year). The data collection and competitions are an excellent mechanism to recruit students early (as freshman &amp; sophomores) giving more time for engagement in the laboratory such that as juniors and seniors they are playing an active role in the research in the laboratory.   Over 30 undergraduate students have been engaged in CITeR research.  CITeR is active in outreach to K-12.  We hosted STEM outreach activities,  e.g., for 600 grade school students (from pre-K to 3rd grade) and for high school students concurrent with a CITeR meeting where affiliates participated on a panel on careers.   Outcomes  Research results were included in courses offered for both on-campus students and distance students. Datasets and software tools were released to other researchers through the website. In addition, CITeR hosted a webinar series with 8-10 lectures per semester. The results of this research are provided in regular webinars advertised to the CITeR community and beyond.  Last, CITeR, being an NSF I/UCRC, naturally meets some of the broader impacts including "increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others" and "increased economic competitiveness of the United States" with transition of research through center operations and licensing/start-up events.  In additional, CITeR?s focus on identification technology impacts "improved national security" by meeting the research needs of DHS, FBI, and DoD.  Site specific examples of impact of CITeR research includes a university spin-out, patents, datasets and software tools.  Two software tools have been created:  the first open biometric cryptosystem tool for maintaining biometric privacy and development of face image quality framework on a GPU system.  A few outcomes are featured below.  IP License and Startup: Given the world-wide visibility of Apple products, it was not long before it was demonstrated that the iPhone could be "spoofed" with a fake fingerprint.
