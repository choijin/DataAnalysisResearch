<AbstractNarration>Experimental evidence supports the idea that seed oil composition, the relative proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in seed oils, has adapted to temperature such that the melting point of the seed oil is lower in plants that live in colder climates. The aim of this research is to determine the genetic basis of adaptive differences in seed oil composition and tie them to specific ecological selective pressures. Using genetic and molecular techniques, the individual genes underlying the variation in this complex trait will be identified and the adaptive value of different alleles tested. This project will be one of the first to identify the genetic variation responsible for the evolution of a complex trait.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plant oils are one of the most energy rich forms of organic carbon; they are widely utilized for human nutrition, industrial products, and biofuels. Understanding how oil composition has evolved in response to temperature may help us engineer oil composition for industrial purposes such as improving cold temperature performance of biodiesels and reducing unpalatable fatty acids in food products. Evolutionary knowledge of seed oil composition led to the discovery of low saturated fat wild sunflowers, which were used to produce commercially available low saturated fat sunflower lines. This project will provide undergraduates with research opportunities in evolutionary genetics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Seed oil composition, the relative proportions of the fatty acids in seed oils, determines the melting point of the oils.  Seed oil melting point may affect the way a seed germinates under different temperatures, which in turn could affect the relative fitness of the plant, particularly if it is in strong competition with neighbors.  One hypothesis suggests that during competition at different germination temperatures, a trade off exists between total energy stores in a seed and the rate at which that energy can be used.  Saturated fatty acids provide more total energy per carbon to the seed but increase the melting point of the oil, so they should be favored at higher germination temperatures.  In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids have less energy per carbon but should be more readily accessed at lower temperatures due to their lower melting points.      As predicted by the hypothesis, seed oil composition varies geographically; seed oils for plants at higher latitudes where it is cooler have lower melting points&mdash;primarily from increasing their proportion of unsaturated fatty acids&mdash;than oils for plants from lower latitudes. This geographic pattern, which has evolved independently multiple times, provides evidence that seed oil composition is under constant and consistent natural selection for a locally optimal melting point.     The aim of this project was to determine the underlying genetics of the adaptive differences in seed oil composition and relate the identified genes to their effects on germination timing. Using modern genetic techniques and statistics, dozens of genes were found that have allelic variants associated with differences in the melting point of seed oils.  A big evolutionary question is whether adaptation proceeds through changes in the amounts of certain proteins (gene regulation) or changes to the proteins themselves.  Our results show that for the evolution of seed oil composition, both factors are in play.  The genes identified in this study encode proteins previously known to be involved in the synthesis of seed oils and also genes that affect gene regulation. Current research is being conducted to determine whether turning these genes off will affect seed oil melting point and germination timing in the expected way.  Seed oils provide one of the most energy rich forms of food available from nature and are used for human nutrition, industrial products and biofuels. The genes identified in this study will improve our understanding of the regulation of seed oil composition and may provide information that can be used for genetic engineering or breeding to optimize seed oils for these economically important uses.     Several undergraduate students received research training in plant biology, genetics, and evolution while working on this study. Three of these students are using the skills acquired through this research to further their own careers in science and medicine.                      Last Modified: 08/29/2012       Submitted by: C.
