<AbstractNarration>The University of Tulsa Cyber Corps Program is adding three new cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students to their existing Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program in Information Assurance (IA). The program is graduating skilled information assurance and forensics professionals with strong leadership skills and a commitment to public service. Students are engaging in an intense program of study to prepare them for careers in intelligence, research and development, operations, project management, enterprise security, or law enforcement. All participants are spending a summer term as interns with federal agencies and, upon graduation, are assuming fulltime positions with the federal government. Students earn up to five CNSS information assurance certifications and select from several tracks. The "MacGyver Track" includes hardware, software and foreign language courses for students intending to join the intelligence community. Other tracks are preparing students for careers in research and development, operations, and project management. A unique aspect of the program is using government experts as student mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is having an immediate impact on the information assurance and forensics capabilities of the federal workforce by providing graduates with general computing and security skills. A number of innovative approaches are implemented to achieve a successful placement of students in federal government including arrangements with several agencies to take groups of students for summer internships with the possibility of subsequent fulltime employment. Strong mechanisms exist to attract and engage non-traditional students and members of underrepresented groups. Several scholarship slots are reserved for high achieving students from community colleges with large populations of female, minority and low-income students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF Cyber Corps Program has enabled America's best and brightest computer science and engineering students to heed the call to serve. Hundreds of Cyber Corps graduates are conducting cyber operations, supporting vital e-government operations, helping secure critical infrastructure assets or investigating electronic crimes.  Many are actively involved in the war against terrorism.  The University of Tulsa Cyber Corps Initiative -- Training the Next Generation of MacGyvers, which was supported by NSF Grant DGE 1020876, has made significant contributions to the national effort. The 61 Tulsa Cyber Corps Program completers are highly-skilled professionals with solid backgrounds in computer science and engineering, strong specializations in cyber operations, information assurance and digital forensics, and a deep commitment to federal service.  All of them have gone on to make a difference in their professional careers.  Upon completing their programs of study, the 20 current students will join their colleagues with the federal government or other NSF-approved organizations, and also go on to make a difference in their careers.  In a tight fiscal environment, the Tulsa Cyber Corps Initiative has provided exceptional value.  Budgeted for 32 students, the grant has partially or completely supported 81 participants (153% extra students) by conserving NSF funds, accelerating student graduation and using private scholarships and research grants to support students, while ensuring that they are well placed in fulltime positions and that they satisfy their scholarship obligations.  The Tulsa Cyber Corps Initiative has had excellent success recruiting and maintaining a diverse student body.The 81 participants -- drawn from 25 states -- include 27 members of underrepresented groups (33.3% of the total), 18 non-traditional students (22.2%) and three veterans (3.7%).  In addition, 18 participants (22.2%) are former community college students, many of whom who joined the Cyber Corps Program as a result of NSF ATE supported educational pathways from community colleges through baccalaureate universities to the University of Tulsa for undergraduate or graduate studies in cyber security.  Finally, NSF support has contributed to the creation of sophisticated laboratories that support education, research, operations and public service efforts.  Most notable are the collaborative activities with the Tulsa Police Department, Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Intelligence Community, Oklahoma state and local agencies, and several private sector companies.  These activities enhance the educational and professional development opportunities available to Tulsa Cyber Corps students while contributing to national defense and homeland security efforts.
