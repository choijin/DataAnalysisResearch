<AbstractNarration>As the recent history of earthquakes in Indonesia, China, Haiti and Chile has demonstrated, subduction zones generate the largest earthquakes.  Earthquakes occur where the rock is brittle and stresses are high enough to overcome friction.  The friction depends on the properties of the rock and water content, and whether the water is free to exert pore pressure, or is crystallographically bound in metamorphic rocks.  Released water causes explosive volcanism. Understanding the forces and earthquake mechanisms is important for estimating hazard. In particular, we seek to use seismic and interdisciplinary data to understand how dehydration takes place in the Peru subduction zone, its effect on friction, rheology and volcanism.  The work is important both to estimate the earthquake and volcanic hazard of major cities in the region as well as understanding past tectonics, and the processes that led to the tectonic structure and the mineralization of continents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peru is an excellent place to study the relationship between the pathways of water, earthquakes, seismic coupling and volcanism.  In particular, in southern Peru the slab has a steep dip and volcanoes occur above it where the slab reaches depths of about 100 km.  In contrast, further north the slab dip is shallow and there are no volcanoes, but deep earthquakes occur at depths of ~600 km, some of the deepest in the world. Seismic array deep-sounding is the premier method to infer properties deep in the Earth. The goals are to investigate the contrasts in the properties of the crust and mantle, and contrasts in earthquake activity across the transition from non-volcanic flat-slab to volcanic steep-slab subduction and to infer the water pathways.  Water has a major effect on friction, seismic velocities, Q, metamorphic changes, melting, and the generation of earthquakes. Seismic tomography and seismicity will be used to map these effects in 3D.  Our seismic array experiment involves a broadband network in Peru comprised of 4 linear networks. Line 1 consists if 50 stations that run from the coast near Arequipa to Lake Titicaca across the steep slab.  Line 3 is parallel but runs further north through Cusco above the flat-slab region.  Lines 2 and 4 are connecting lines along the Andes and the coast respectively. The four lines form a box-shaped network of 125 stations spanning the transition.  Each line is comprised of twenty five to fifty broadband seismic stations at 6-12 km spacing and will record for one to two years to give an unprecedented coverage of the structures and seismicity of the region.   We would like to answer fundamental questions on the mechanics and mineralization of  subduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our experiment involves many Peruvians both professionally in universities and institutes and the general population who host our stations.  Peru is threatened by large earthquakes, such as the recent Pisco 2007 devastating earthquake and the 2001 event demonstrated. Tsunamis are also a threat. The more educated are the local population the better prepared. We will make the data available to the community through IRIS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the Geophysics Program and the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome for Peru Seismic Experiment (PERUSE)  The major objective of PERUSE was to image the sub ducting Nazca oceanic slab (Figure 1) as a step to understanding the process of flat-slab subduction and the generation of earthquakes.  Subduction beneath Peru is enigmatic for several reasons.  (1) In northern Peru seismicity indicates the subducted plate remains flat at a depth of about 100 km beneath the Andes before becoming steep and plunging to 660 km (Figure 2).   In southern Peru the slab is steep right from the coast. (2) In the north very deep earthquakes occur at depths over 500 km but earthquakes are shallower to the south, at less than about 400 km.  (3) It was not clear whether the flat to steep transition was associated with a torn or stretched slab.  (4) Another question was what holds up the Andes, thickened crust or low-density mantle - whereby delaminated crust had been replaced by hot mantle asthenosphere.     Geophysics groups from UCLA, Caltech, U. Arizona, Yale and North Carolina were involved in several projects, (of which PERUSE was one) that had the joint objective of using temporarily installed broadband seismic stations throughout Peru to examine these phenomena.  Tomography and receiver functions studies showed that the crust was thick under the Andes (Figure 1) suggesting that was responsible for their elevation, not mantle upwelling. The seismic results have shown that, in contrast to, for example the Mexico flat slab transition, the Peru slab transition appears to be continuous in that the slab is stretched, not torn.  Thermal modeling suggests that the deep earthquakes occur in slab that is sufficiently cool (Figure 3) to fail by the brittle-frictional process associated with earthquakes.  This is in contrast with most of the Western Pacific plate margin (except Northern Chile) where plates are too hot to have deep earthquakes, whereas in the East where slabs are older and cooler, deep earthquakes are ubiquitous.  A limiting temperature ratio, TH less than 0.55, was found above which earthquakes are unlikely to occur, where TH is the ratio of temperature to melting temperature.  The associated rheology was found to be consistent with that determined from the flexure of seamounts showing that above the limiting temperature rocks fail by aseismic creep.
