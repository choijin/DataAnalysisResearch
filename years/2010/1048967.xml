<AbstractNarration>In the past, land use predictions have been based primarily on population and socioeconomic development scenarios, and have been provided to climate prediction models as an external driver.  The role of climate as a major biophysical driver for land use changes has not been adequately considered.  Using West Africa as an example, this project will address the overarching question of whether there is a strong need to include land use predictions as an integral component of Earth System Models.  The objectives of the project are: (1) to predict future climate and land use considering the interaction between climate and land use; (2) to evaluate the roles of greenhouse gas emissions and land use in driving regional climate changes in West Africa; and (3) to understand the impacts of biophysical and socioeconomic factors on land use changes.  Based on a proposed modeling framework that links a cascade of five models, i.e., a regional climate model, a dynamic vegetation model, a crop growth model, an agricultural economics model, and a land use allocation model, the principal investigators will study the impact of both socio-economic and biophysical factors on human land use. This project will shed insights into whether and to what extent, climate-land use interactions in earth system models influence predictions of future climate and future land use.   &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are high.  Climate change and its adverse impact on food security are a major concern for West African countries and international organizations.  Results from this project will provide scientific foundations for food policy and targeted investment in climate change adaptation.  In addition, this project will promote teaching and learning in a broader context, as well as increase the participation of underrepresented groups, especially women, in geosciences research.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project supports a collaborative effort among three institutions including the University of Connecticut, Loyola Marymount University, and the International Food Policy Research Institute.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Here are the major findings/outcomes of this project:  (1) As climate change continues into the future food security is projected to become more volatile in West Africa: Our study found not only a general decrease of mean crop yield for all major crops in the region but more important a significantly increase of inter-annual variability of crop yields. The dramatic increase of year-to-year fluctuation of major crop yields poses enormous challenge for international aid planning and other regional mitigation and adaptation efforts.  (2) Significant expansion of agricultural land, driven by both reduced crop yield and increased food demand, may cause complete loss of drought deciduous tree coverage in West Africa by mid-century.  (3) Climate-induced crop yield change, a factor not considered in the development of future land use scenarios for CMIP5 by Hurtt et al. (2009), has a more significant impact on agricultural land use expansion than the projected increase of food demand.  (4) The impact of land use changes on regional climate is much smaller than the impact of CO2 concentration increases. However, this preliminary finding may change as we are working on improving the phenology representation for crops in the model (which is expected to have a major influence on  climate seasonality in this region).  (5) Dust emission is found to be an important factor influencing regional climate, and is expected to enhance the impact of land use changes on regional climate.        Educational andTraining Activities:  1) The project has supported the training of one PhD graduate student (Kazi Ahmed) at UConn. The student has passed his PhD qualify exam and made major progress in research.
