<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project analyzed KoreaÆs two-vote legislative system in comparison to that of both its East Asian counterparts (Taiwan and Japan) and those outside of the region (e.g. Germany, New Zealand, and Bulgaria). Mixed electoral systems containing both single member districts (SMDs) and seats delegated by proportional representation (PR) have become increasingly popular. While the global trend has been towards more proportional electoral systems, Asian governments have chosen increasingly majoritarian designs, with five (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, and Thailand) enacting strikingly similar mixed majoritarian systems.  While some suggest this indicates the emergence of a unique Asian model of democracy where party system stability and the concentration of political power are established through electoral reform. Defining and empirically testing this alternative model and why it appears to diverge from traditional models however remains unexplored.  This project analyzed the institutional effects on mixed systems on election outcomes, legislator behavior, and public perceptions. Using previous data collected on Taiwan and other mixed systems, this project collected data on Korea at multiple levels.  First, election outcomes at the national and district level suggested that only at the latter do the East Asian cases appear to deviate from other mixed systems.

Lastly, national level surveys show evidence of both a high percentage of the Korean public believing they do not understand the two-vote system, yet paradoxically high levels of strategic voting which would suggest a high level of understanding. From this I develop a theory to explain this divergence&mdash;namely that existing polls asking about understanding are really tapping into expectations.  Based on the evidence in Korea, and combined in a comparative framework with Taiwan and Japan, this project has produced to date three working papers and conference papers, all which should be published within the year.
