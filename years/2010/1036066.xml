<AbstractNarration>1036066&lt;br/&gt;Ahlen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support an R&amp;D program leading to large-area multi-wire proportional chambers containing a neutron converter in the form of a thin Li-6 metal foil.  The intended goal of the program is to use these new detectors in place of He-3 detectors in Radiation Portal Monitors (RPMs). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes the training of post-docs, graduate and undergraduate students in detector simulation, design, fabrication, and characterization. It will help develop the human capabilities for future development of nuclear detection systems.  The proposed detector system could help fill an existing gap in our nation's defense against illicit nuclear materials brought about by the shortage of He-3 for traditional neutron detectors.</AbstractNarration>
