<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to hold a Workshop on Nanocontacts and Nanointerconnects on April 5, 2010, in San Francisco, California, preceding the 2010 Material Research Society (MRS) Spring Meeting.  The purpose of the workshop is to communicate the latest research on Nanocontacts and Nanointerconnects technology and to identify the key scientific and engineering challenges and opportunities to capitalize on nanostructures such as nanodots, nanowire, nanotubes and nanocables array integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together several national labs, industries and university faculties in a format that allows the widest participation for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and would serve as a meeting to help and enhance faculties' and students' understanding of Nanocontacts and Nanointerconnects and will open opportunities for cooperative research between industries, national labs and universities. The workshop will provide excellent opportunities for students to find out what industry is interested and the industry participants get first-hand knowledge of the technology that are being pursued in the research community.</AbstractNarration>
