<AbstractNarration>Doctoral student Michael Kohut (Vanderbilt University), supervised by Dr. Norbert O. Ross, will undertake research on science education.  The focus of the research will be on the relationship between new evolution curricula and the social, religious, and cultural contexts in which those curricula are being enacted.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will take place at multiple field sites, comprising communities in middle and eastern Tennessee, as well as teaching colleges and state government offices.  Data will be gathered to document 1) stakeholder beliefs, as those beliefs relate to evolutionary theory; 2) stakeholder conceptions of education, science, and evolution teaching; 3) interpretations of evolutionary theory; and 4) the relationships between these beliefs, attitudes and interpretations and the teaching of evolution. The researcher will use a combination of cognitive and anthropological methods, including structured and semi-structured interviews, informal conversation, ethnographic observation, card sorting tasks, and cultural consensus analyses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is important because it will help social scientists understand the cultural and social grounding of beliefs about educational policy and practice, considered through the relationships among schools, colleges, and state government, as well as churches, communities, teachers unions, and business leaders.  For policy makers, the research will help to elucidate the disjunctures between cultural understandings of the scientific status of theories and science standards policies. Funding this research also supports the education of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funds provided by a NSF supplemented funding for an ongoing project to understand the effects of Tennessee evolution standards in classrooms in middle and eastern Tennessee. Specifically, the guiding research question was how teachers respond to the standards and how students respond to teachers covering evolution.  Outcomes of the grant include a dissertation which is being defended in Fall 2013, and will be on file in the library at Vanderbilt University. The grant was used to interview students and teachers in 8th grade science and high school biology in two districts in Tennessee. Participating schools were compensated for hosting the interviews, and research results deemed most relevant to the teachers and administrators at these schools were presented to them upon completion of the project.

State-Level  The development of the state science framework was reconstructed, with specific focus on coverage of evolutionary theory was concerned. This framework is a guide for teachers regarding what to teach, and it is the basis for state standardized tests, as mandated in No Child Left Behind. It was found that a small number of citizens were able to apply political pressure effectively to dilute coverage of evolution in the standards despite willingness among state-level bureaucrats to strengthen such coverage. The most substantial example of the results of this political pressure is that, in middle school grades, the term "evolution" was replaced by "change over time" in the final draft.  Teacher-Level  It was found that middle school science teachers had relatively poorer understandings of evolutionary theory than high school biology teachers. In participating school districts, which were biased toward greater support for evolution education (administrators who were against it, chose not to participate), half of 8th grade science teachers preferred creationism to evolution. Furthermore, many 8th grade science teachers did not interpret the state science standards to include evolution, despite the intentions of the authors of the standards. It was unclear whether this was due to the absence of the term "evolution," to poor understanding (e.g. not realizing that natural selection, adaptation, genetic mutations, and fossil evidence for change over time are all components of evolutionary theory), or to willful misinterpretation in order to avoid teaching about evolution.  High school biology teachers were more supportive of teaching evolution and had noticeably better understandings of the theory.
