<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop thin-film high-temperature superconductors (HTS) with superior properties that do not degrade in high magnetic fields for applications as high-performance sensor coils in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The superconductor structure will be engineered at nanoscale with the controlled distribution of impurities that act as flux pinning sites that reduce the MRI radio frequencies (rf) loss at high fields.   A series of HTS thin films with different layer parameters will be grown. The films will be characterized by rf measurements on resonator structures patterned on the films. The planned product is a high-performance HTS MRI sensor coil that operates in high magnetic fields with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 5 to 10 times higher than that of present HTS coils, and 15 to 30 times higher than that of copper coils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to address the MRI market needs of shorter scan time and increased resolution as MRI systems migrate towards higher magnetic fields. This will lead to improved patient comforts, clinical diagnoses and drug discoveries. The current addressable market size for MRI sensor coils is about $88 million per year in the Unites States and $183 million per year worldwide.</AbstractNarration>
