<AbstractNarration>The Pacific Undergraduate Research Experience in Mathematics (PURE Math) is a dual-tiered, academic mentoring program targeting U.S. Pacific Islanders and other underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences. This collaborative 5-year MCTP program will be housed at the University of Hawai?i at Hilo (UHH) and administered, staffed, and managed by 4 faculty members at UHH and Sam Houston State University (SHSU).  PURE Math will have a lasting, positive impact on 114 STEM undergraduates interested in the mathematical sciences and several junior faculty members who wish to engage students in research.  PURE Math has two primary goals.  The first is to increase the number of native Pacific Islanders earning degrees and pursuing careers in the mathematical sciences; PURE Math will focus on mentoring these students through their transition from computational problems to more theoretical concepts.  The second goal is to provide valuable and lasting mentoring experiences to junior faculty at UHH, who will be trained in directing undergraduate research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURE Math will offer an innovative, two-tiered advanced mathematics program over five summers that consists of an Interns program and a Residents program.  The Interns program is a 5-week advanced mathematics workshop in which 60 lower-level undergraduates will discover topics not typically included in an undergraduate mathematics curriculum.  The Residents program is an 8-week summer undergraduate research experience introducing 54 upper-level undergraduates to active fields of mathematics led by seasoned researchers.  These summer experiences will allow PURE Math student participants to transition effectively from lower-level computational work to upper-level abstract work, and from undergraduate research to graduate work.  PURE Math will ultimately encourage a lasting environment of undergraduate mathematical research in the Pacific Islands.  Furthermore, it will add to the growing infrastructure of research and atmosphere of mathematical collaboration between undergraduates and faculty.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Pacific Undergraduate Research Experience in Mathematics (PURE Math) is a collaborative effort between the University of Hawaii at Hilo and Sam Houston State University to provide pre-research and research training to over 100 undergraduate mathematics students.  This two-tiered program focuses on students transitioning from computational mathematics to proof-based mathematics (in the Interns program) and on mathematics majors at the beginning stages of research (in the Residents program).  In total, 108 undergraduate students and 8 graduate students participated in the Hilo-based program.   Intellectual Merit: The research experiences for the two tiers of undergraduates produced several impressive results, mostly in the areas of Computational Algebraic Geometry and the Factorization Theory of Monoids.  Students used recent computational techniques in algebraic geometry (e.g., Grobner Bases) to solve various applied problems in the theory of central configurations.  In factorization theory, students produced several results on factorization invariants in numerical monoids, block monoids, and arithmetic congruence monoids.  In total, over a dozen published papers have their origin in PURE Math with numerous undergraduate co-authors.   Broader Impacts: Almost all of the undergraduate and graduate students that participated in PURE Math credit the summer experience as being transformative in their mathematical careers.  For various Interns, the PURE Math program was their first taste of upper-level Mathematics and solidified their desire to major in Mathematics.  For the residents, many of them used their research experiences as stepping stones into graduate schools across the country.  For the graduate students, their experiences as teaching and research assistants were heavily cited in applying for their postdoctoral positions.
