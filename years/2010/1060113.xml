<AbstractNarration>The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is implementing an S-STEM project that builds a direct bridge to the Ph.D. for outstanding undergraduate engineering and computer science students.  The objectives of the project are to (a) increase the number of senior engineering and computer science students, in particular those of Hispanic background, who are encouraged to pursue a doctoral degree at UTEP; (b) to provide advising and mentoring opportunities that will enable S-STEM scholars to transition smoothly into Ph.D. programs; (c) to offer a professional development of S-STEM scholars that will help provide the tools necessary for a successful doctoral career; and (d) to systematically track progress made by S-STEM scholars toward degree completion.  To address the project goals and objectives of the project, UTEP is utilizing a very experienced team of administrators, faculty, and professional staff who are in charge of integrating advising, mentoring, and professional development in a way that allows students and faculty to work toward a productive doctoral experience within a well defined timeline for degree completion. The project has the potential for locally broadening STEM participation by directly increasing the number of advanced degrees awarded to Hispanics in a relatively short period of time. Furthermore, this mentoring model is replicable and has the potential for a broadening impact in the way many other institutions approach issues of recruiting, retention and graduation at the graduate level in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most colleges of engineering, government, industry organizations, and academic and professional societies in the United States recognize that in order for our nation to retain its global competitiveness, and in order to replace an engineering workforce that is reaching retirement, it is imperative to recruit and retain more Hispanic and female students in engineering colleges and to encourage them to pursue post graduate degrees. In fact, several studies indicate that Hispanics students and female students are an untapped resource that could help reduce the shortage of engineers in the United States.  With NSF S-STEM program funds the College of Engineering at The University of Texas at El Paso developed a graduate bridge program with two main goals: 1) Recruit and graduate an increasing number of domestic doctoral students that have the ability to direct research and product development programs in industry and academia across the nation and 2) Contribute to the diversity of the engineering and computer science faculty and researchers of the future.  The specific project objectives were: 1) To increase the number of senior engineering and computer science students, in particular those of Hispanic background, who will become motivated to pursue a doctoral degree; 2) To provide advising and mentoring opportunities that will enable the S-STEM scholars to transition seamlessly into Ph.D. programs; 3) To offer a professional development program for S-STEM scholars that will provide the tools necessary for a successful doctoral career; and 4) To systematically track progress made by S-STEM scholars toward degree completion.  The number of students that participated in the program was 36.  Nineteen (53%) scholars were female and seventeen (47%) were male. Most (91.7%) of the scholars were from the El Paso region and of Hispanic Ethnicity. As a group, the scholars earned 27 Bachelor of Science degrees in engineering and computer science fields, 17 Master of Science degrees in engineering or computer science and 3 Ph.D. degrees in engineering during the duration of the program. At the end of the program, there were nine students still pursuing Master of Science degrees in engineering and five pursuing Ph.D. degrees in engineering.  Students had the opportunity to participate in internships at government organizations and industry.  Some of them also had an international experience through the international faculty-lead courses offered by engineering faculty at UTEP.  The program has helped to increase the percentage of Hispanic and female engineers that will help to address the local global engineering challenges of this century. The participating scholars will eventually help to narrow the existing gap in female and Hispanic faculty in engineering colleges of the continental USA.
