<AbstractNarration>Four middle and upper atmosphere lidar groups collaborate to unify the scientific and technological applications of resonant lidar systems now at the University of Illinois, the Alomar Observatory in Norway, and at Colorado State University. The consortium structure coordinates simultaneous performance of the lidar systems and the sharing of existing data, coordinates data taking strategic planning within the upper atmospheric lidar community, facilitates more rapid dissemination of technical lidar advances, and coordinates education, training, and outreach activities. The consortium establishes a Technology Center that focuses on unified establishment of robust and stable lidar operation, the exploration of advanced laser and optical technologies, and the expedition of technology transfer within traditionally isolated and competing lidar groups. The initial goal of the consortium is to make regular nighttime and daytime measurements of temperatures and winds in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere commonplace and consistent at the three primary lidar sites.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Reports for USU/CRRL  The Na lidar operations at the Center of Atmospheric and Space Science (CASS) at Utah State University are supported under an umbrella of Consortium of Resonance and Rayleigh Lidars (CRRL) within the NSF Geospace Facilities Program. This advanced laser-ranging system was designed to measure atmospheric temperature and winds over a critical altitude range, from 80 to110 km, crossing the boundary between upper earthÃ†s neutral atmosphere and the electrically charged geospace environment, where important dynamical and chemical processes are known to occur.  Earlier research using this lidar had previously been conducted from Colorado State University (since 1990) before the system was successfully relocated to USU during the summer 2010. The measurements are made at USU campus, which is located at a similar latitude and experiences a like geophysical environment to CSU. Our new observations are improving and building on this long-time series of lidar soundings, which is one of the most complete and comprehensive temperature databases for upper atmosphere in the world.  These data are important for determining possible impacts of global climate change on the upper atmospheric environment, and studies  based on the lidar measurements from 1990-2007 indicate a ~1.5&deg;C per decade cooling near 91 km and a slight warming trend (~2&deg;C per decade) near 105 km.  More recent studies using coordinated lidar and other atmospheric measurements available at USU over the first two years of observations have focused on measuring the impacts of frequent and strong disturbances arising in the lower levels of the atmosphere (manifested as waves, tides and sudden warming events) on the ionized upper atmosphere.  We have used the motions of the high-altitude neutral sodium layer as a tool to study the effects of these disturbances and their seasonal variations.  These results reinforce earlier investigations by clearly determining the signatures and effects of the atmospheric waves on the ionosphere.   Our lidar studies have also revealed a concurrent large cooling in the upper atmosphere at mid-latitudes, due to a strong warming event originating at polar latitudes. All of these outcomes strengthen the importance of further understanding the coupling processes that occur within the different atmosphere layers.  This research program has a strong education and research experience impact on graduate and undergraduate students, broadening their knowledge of science, which is an equally important priority of this program. Over the past two years eight students from either the Physics Department or the Aerospace Mechanical Engineering Department at USU have been employed to work on this system. Their outstanding efforts have been presented at national meetings, and this research has been summarized in 10 publications since 2010.
