<AbstractNarration>Development of a respiratory neural circuit: Ontogeny of respiratory drive &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breathing is driven by the need to expel carbon dioxide (CO2), and CO2-sensitive neurons in the brainstem are critical to this drive. Identifying breathing-related, CO2-sensitive neurons in the central nervous system and characterizing their location, development, phenotype, function, and plasticity will be a major advance in basic understanding of breathing and its neural control. Dr Taylor's research will identify neurons and mechanisms that underlie CO2 sensitivity by investigating a developing neural circuit that controls breathing. Her research will elucidate development of CO2-induced respiratory drive in an organism whose transition from aquatic to terrestrial life may reflect evolutionary changes common to vertebrates, including humans. The frog is an ideal research model organism because its isolated brainstem provides, at any stage of development, the intact and functional brainstem circuit that controls breathing, and it allows long-term investigation of central respiratory CO2 responses under normal physiological conditions. No other vertebrate model offers this suite of advantages. Dr Taylor's research will transform current thinking about developmental change in central CO2 sensitivity, emphasizing that it is not a predetermined neurodevelopment but a dynamic, and potentially harnessable, neuroplasticity. This provocative line of research will characterize the development and plasticity of respiratory drive.  The intellectual merit of this project is the identification of specific, multiple mechanisms of CO2 sensitivity in the brainstem. The project has broader impact in providing students at all academic levels the opportunity to participate actively in neuroscience research. Dr Taylor's home institution, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and its Institute of Arctic Biology have a well-established culture of research-based teaching and experiential learning in life sciences. Already 6 high school, 21 undergraduate, and 5 graduate students have participated in this research - and this includes several Alaska Native and other diversity students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Respiration is key to life; it brings O2 into the body and carries CO2 out. This exchange of gases sustains metabolism and all activities of the body.  Respiration, or breathing, is controlled by a neural network in the brainstem.  In terrestrial animals, breathing is driven most urgently by the need to rid the body of CO2; taking on O2 is essential, but the need to exhale CO2 arises first under the vast majority of situations.     The results of NSF project IOS-1022442, Development of a respiratory neural circuit: Ontogeny of respiratory drive, have strengthened the view that the CO2-sensitivity of the brainstem neural network controlling breathing arose early in the evolutionary history of vertebrates, before the evolution of lungs.  The locations, neuron types and neurotransmitters of this network show evidence of this long-standing homology across disparate groups - lampreys, frogs and mammals. The frog is an ideal over vertebrate model as from which a functional and stable breathing control network can be isolated and investigated independent of other neural inputs. We have confirmed that the CO2 response of individual neurons and the intact network that controls breathing can be recorded simultaneously.  Such recordings of respiratory neurons, together with the network in which they are embedded, have not be reported previously for any vertebrate.  CO2-sensitive neurons in the frog brainstem include CO2-on and CO2-off neurons whose activity may be coupled with any of the networks outputs.     A developmental increase in respiratory CO2 sensitivity is considered a conserved element the development of limbed vertebrates; however, it has been convincingly demonstrated only in rats. Observed increases in CO2 responses may not reflect a neurodevelopment that enhances CO2 sensitivity, but rather a plasticity that allows neural networks to compensate for a deficiency. In amphibians, air breathing increases becomes essential when gill-bearing tadpoles become frogs with lungs, but respiratory CO2 sensitivity is consistent across development. The bullfrog breathing control network responds to increased CO2 inside the body by increasing the frequency of lung breathing rather than the size of breaths. Furthermore, this response is an all-or-nothing response to increasing CO2 &ndash; it is elicited when internal CO2 reaches 3.5% and is consistent to 10% CO2 when neural activity breaks down.     Our research has: 1) confirmed the existence of three CO2-sensitive sites; 2) identified the neurotransmitters GABA, serotonin and acetylcholine as being involved in CO2 sensitivity; and 3) demonstrated a developmental plasticity in the breathing control network. Chronic exposure to ethanol impairs the CO2 sensitivity of early-stage tadpoles (although breathing continues in a normal fashion), but when this toxin is removed from the water, CO2 sensitivity returns.     Thus, this NSF-funded project supports that CO2 sensitivity is a function of the neural network that controls breathing.  The network has been evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates, and frogs and mammals are similar in that CO2 sensitivity is a property of similar multiple sites in the brainstem, communicated by multiple neurotransmitters that are again similar.  These sites and neurotransmitters are consistent throughout lifespan from tadpole to frog. The project has produced these interesting findings about the evolution and mechanisms of the breathing control network, and it also validates the use of the isolated tadpole brainstem as a model for the breathing control network common to all vertebrates.  Future studies looking into mechanisms of pathologies associated breathing will be able to use the isolated tadpole brainstem preparation as a research tool.
