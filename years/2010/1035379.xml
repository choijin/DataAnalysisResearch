<AbstractNarration>Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors who would not otherwise consider a career in precollege science and mathematics teaching are entering a Master in Teaching (MT) program.   Preparation of science and mathematics secondary teachers is via graduate level programs only.  The MT program serves as a fifth year program open only to candidates completing the B.S. degree in a STEM discipline with an education core.  Partnerships with the Midlands and Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical Colleges enhance the effort to interest freshmen and sophomore STEM majors in undertaking a course of study leading to a STEM degree with teaching certification.  Lower division seminar courses for prospective teachers are offered at both the university and the two-year schools.  Summer internship opportunities to work with Noyce program faculty in an established summer professional development program for mathematics and science middle school teachers and students are available to STEM majors at all the partnership institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MT program expects to be graduating up to forty one Noyce scholars over the course of the five year project.  The resulting highly qualified science and mathematics teachers are committed to teach two years in a high needs school district for each of up to three years of scholarship support received.  Five high needs school districts are participating in the project; these are the: Calhoun, Lexington 2, Orangeburg 5, and Richland 1 and 2 County School Districts.</AbstractNarration>
