<AbstractNarration>Microbes affect many aspects of daily human life, from health to agriculture.  Despite such large influence, understanding of the ecology of microbes and their interactions is still in the early stages.  This project will advance understanding of microbial interactions through study of one microbe, the eukaryotic social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, and its primitive agricultural association with bacteria.  About one third of wild-collected Dictyostelium clones have the beneficial symbiotic behaviour of farming to facilitate future growth, and study of the variable symbiosis between Dictyostelium and bacteria can advance understanding of the ecology and evolution of microbial interactions.  This project will apply the tools of experimental evolution and a suite of cellular and molecular analyses to this newly discovered novel symbiosis between a social amoeba and bacteria to elucidate the origins and maintenance of cooperative lifestyles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also will foster integration of research and education to train undergraduates. Two female undergrads will be mentored and trained in field collection and cellular and molecular techniques and will develop substantive research projects.  Undergraduate research assistants will participate in a bi-weekly seminar about the research questions addressed in the lab and their relevance to science and society.  Additionally, the PIs will offer a freshman seminar to engage students' interest in and understanding of biological research.</AbstractNarration>

These students presented their work at the Rice Undergraduate Research Symposium in the spring of 2010 and the spring of 2011. We also conducted an undergraduate bi-weekly seminar for a group of eight undergraduates working in our lab to educate them about the questions we are addressing and their relevance to science and society.
