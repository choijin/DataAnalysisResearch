<AbstractNarration>This project concerns the mapping class group, which is the group of isotopy classes of homeomorphisms of a surface.  There is particular emphasis on the Torelli group, the subgroup consisting of elements that act trivially on the homology of the surface.  We take a three- pronged approach, on the homological, dynamical, and group-theoretical properties of mapping class groups.  The techniques include methods from combinatorial Morse theory, Teichmuller theory, and geometric group theory.  In joint work with Bestvina and Bux, we aim to determine the homological finiteness properties of the Torelli groups; in particular to answer the famous question of whether or not they are finitely presented.  With Farb and Leininger, we work on understanding the structure of all low entropy pseudo-Anosovs; in particular to address the Symmetry Conjecture, which asserts that all such pseudo- Anosovs are obtained as the product of a rotation with a map supported on a subsurface of uniformly bounded genus.  With Brendle, we study the group structure of the hyperelliptic Torelli group, in particular focused on the conjecture of Hain, which states that the group is generated by Dehn twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project is the mapping class group, which is the   collection of symmetries of a surface, such as a sphere or a torus. This is a central object in mathematics, with connections to algebraic geometry, hyperbolic geometry, and dynamics.  Discoveries in this area have had influence on fields outside of mathematics, such as string theory and cryptography.  With my collaborators, I have made progress on decades-old questions about the global structure of mapping class group, and this project is dedicated to answering some of the most important remaining questions.   The techniques involved in this study are wide-ranging, from combinatorial, to algebraic, to topological, to dynamical, and the proposed work has applications to algebraic geometry, 3-manifolds, and group theory.  I will work on the research aspects of the proposal with several collaborators and with students at various levels.  In addition, I will host a workshop for young researchers in topology, with the aim of training and cultivating future researchers and educators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Significant progress was made on all three major research goals from the proposal.  Fifteen refereed research articles were produced, a survey article was completed, an advanced undergraduate textbook was written, and a professional development workshop was run three times.  The PI gave lectures at 24 conferences, 8 of which were international.  The PI also gave 17 seminar talks.  Four Ph.D. students and one postdoctoral researcher were mentored.  Fourteen conferences were organized.   The research goals centered around the study of surfaces, specifically, Torelli groups, stretch factors, and braid groups.  Braids are fundamental in science because they describe the possible motions of a set of points in a plane; the points can be physical particles, the zeros of a polynomial, or robots moving on a factory floor.  Given a braid, there is a natural way to associate a matrix (the so-called integral Burau representation).  One of the main results is a structural theorem for the set of braids associated to the identity matrix (1?s on the main diagonal and 0?s elsewhere).  This result answers a basic question coming from algebraic geometry.     Given a mixing pattern of, say, a vat of fluid, we can quantify the amount of mixing being achieved; the resulting number is called the stretch factor of the system.  A second set of results describes the mixing patterns where the stretch factor is very small.  For instance we give precise asymptotics on the number of mixing patterns with small stretch factor and also describe the size of the small stretch factors, given algebraic restrictions on the mixing patterns (action on homology).   An undergraduate textbook called Office Hours with a Geometric Group Theorist was completed.  This will serve as an introductory textbook on the subject, suitable for advanced undergraduates.   The PI coordinated a summer workshop - the Topology Students Workshop - at Georgia Tech in the summers of 2012, 2014,and 2016.  All three were highly successful.  In the 2016 edition, there were sessions on networking, etiquette, self care, giving lectures, and career choices, for example.  Many participants praised the workshops.  One participant described the workshop as "basically life changing."  The Topology Students Workshop has inspired several other similar workshops and seminars, for instance at Georgia Tech, Bryn Mawr, Purdue, and Imperial College London.   One outgrowth of the Topology Students Workshop is the Topology Students Resource, a web site containing many links for professional development resources; so far this web site has over 3400 hits.
