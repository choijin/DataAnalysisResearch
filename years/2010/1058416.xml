<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funds to support a national workshop on next-generation optical fiber technology. The workshop will be held in Cocoa Beach, Florida, on October 17-19th, 2010. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The conference will assemble key leaders in the field, including international experts, to present recent advances in optical fiber technology, and will discuss future developments as they relate to diverse novel applications. The goal of this meeting is to produce a development roadmap that will support the disciplines that would benefit from this research, by bringing together researchers from the multiple fields of applications and defining the new fiber requirements. The workshop will probe novel materials development, future directions in fiber manufacturing and new application areas.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact:&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has a confirmed list of key speakers, active experts in the field, and is conducted by a team of professors with a strong and diverse background in fiber optics. The location, close to Orlando, will facilitate participation from international speakers as well as US researchers and students. The agenda offers a dynamic platform conducive to interaction, solving interdisciplinary problems and identifying novel directions.</AbstractNarration>
