<AbstractNarration>The supported research will determine characteristics of atmospheric turbulence unique to near-surface airflow interaction with plant canopies, and in-turn identify mechanisms controlling the release and transport of small particles (e.g., pollen grains, spores, seeds, etc.) within such canopies.  Dynamic interactions will be represented by a combination of field-observations, laboratory water-channel experiments and high-resolution numerical simulations advance the prediction of particle transport in boundary layers beyond current models, which represent turbulent transport via steady, homogenous diffusion coefficients.  In this way, the role of individual coherent flow structures in releasing, capturing and transporting particles will be quantitatively determined.  This research will combine flume experiments with artificial canopies under controlled laboratory conditions, field experiments in the context of actual crops (as facilitated by Pennsylvania State University's Rock Springs Farm research facility), and numerical experiments using large-eddy simulation (LES) models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this effort derives from improved understanding of vegetation-atmosphere interactions involving turbulent processes generated by agricultural crops typical of those across the Midwestern U.S., which has relevance both to atmospheric behavior and biological processes within plant canopies.  Broader impacts of this research will center on improved representation and prediction of modes of atmospheric turbulence generated within and above plant canopies, and will involve strongly interdisciplinary work at the interface of the atmospheric and biological sciences.  A variety of graduate and undergraduate educational opportunities will be provided within diverse field-experiment, laboratory and numerical analysis settings, and will include student participation in an Aerobiology Field Course to be conducted at the PSU field research facility.</AbstractNarration>

This project can help to reduce this loss by providing new physical understanding of and new tools for predicting the spread of pathogen spores, which could guide the development of practical management strategies to mitigate plant disease epidemics. Within a crop canopy wind speed is reduced and the physical obstruction provided by the plants restricts particle movement and facilitates deposition with the canopy. However, if particles escape the canopy, they are subjected to wind of much higher velocity that can transport the spores far downwind, infecting additional fields. To forecast the spread of disease from one field to another, it is essential to understand the mechanisms that control the probability of particle escape from the original canopy. The main contributions of this project will facilitate more accurate prediction of particle escape. First, the project developed a new, physically-based model for describing the velocity and turbulent diffusion within a crop canopy based on a set of easily measured input parameters, including canopy density, canopy morphology, canopy height, and wind speed. The model does not require detailed, a priori measurements of turbulence, which has been a limitation of previous models. Importantly, the new model captures the influence of the turbulence generated in the wakes of individual plants within the canopy and the turbulence generated in the region of velocity transition at the top of the canopy. This is the first model to capture these details of spore transport. Second, the new description of velocity and diffusion has been incorporated into a particle-tracking model developed to offer a simple and efficient tool for predicting escape based on the simple inputs of canopy morphology, canopy height, wind speed, and spore settling velocity. This model can provide input to long-range disease transport models used in Integrated Pest Management. Third, a combination of physical experiment and modeling has revealed significant differences in particle escape between regions close to and far from the leading edge of a canopy. Specifically, at the leading edge flow is deflected away from the canopy, which is a region of high flow resistance, and in a wide canopy (canopy width &gt;&gt; canopy height) this creates a vertical updraft. The updraft carries particles released near the leading edge directly out of the canopy, so that escape fraction is much higher near the leading edge than within the interior of the canopy. A practical implication of this result may be that producers could preferentially treat the edges of the field to kill plant pathogens and reduce the prophylactic use of fungicide in the field interior. This also suggests an advantage to larger field sizes, which reduces the fraction of crop influenced by the leading edge. The outcomes of this project are also relevant to other environmental systems in which particle transport plays a role in ecologic function. For example, in aquatic systems the transport and retention of particles within vegetated regions determines the health and expansion of important vegetated landscapes, such as salt marsh and mangroves, which play important roles in coastal defense against storms. The recruitment of larvae to aquatic grass beds, an important step in the shellfish life cycle, is controlled by the physics of particle transport.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/11/2016<br>      Modified by: Heidi&nbsp;M&nbsp;Nepf</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
