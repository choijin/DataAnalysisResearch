<AbstractNarration>Because climate and land use strongly affect ecosystems and the services that they provide to society, understanding of both individual factors and their interactions is integral for developing effective environmental management and policy. Cross-scale interactions, wherein a factor at one scale interacts with a factor at another scale, are of particular interest, given their complexity and lack of study. The main goal of this research is to develop tools to measure and understand how climate and land use, by themselves and as interacting factors, affect lake ecosystems across scales of time and space, even as these factors are themselves, changing. Lakes are unique study systems to address questions of cross-scale interactions; for example, agricultural land use in a surrounding lake watershed can interact with the climate of the region in which the lake is located, leading to situations where lakes in different climatic zones may respond differently to similar surrounding environmental inputs, such as nutrient inputs from agricultural land use in their watersheds. This project will identify and measure the most important cross-scale interactions that control lake nutrients and water quality and will be guided by a landscape limnology conceptual framework. A collaborative team from three universities will collect a large dataset on lakes, nutrients, and watersheds, including over 5,000 lake ecosystems in 11 U.S. states spanning up to 30 years. Several new and innovative statistical modeling approaches will be used to detect and model cross-scale interactions, including Bayesian hierarchical modeling (a statistical method for learning and modeling complex relationships in data). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identifying the conditions or the environments prone to cross-scale interactions is needed to forecast, manage, and restore ecosystems, such as lakes, responding to change operating at local to regional scales. The research framework, design, and analysis of this work provide an innovative approach that has the potential change the conduct of research on large-scale, living systems, beyond the lakes under study. Additionally, because commonly-measured lake water quality variables used in water resource policy will be used in this analysis, results from this project will directly inform state and federal agencies responsible for lake and water management. Finally, several undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral researchers will be trained as a result, helping to foster a new generation of biologists with skills in tackling broad-scaled research and policy problems.</AbstractNarration>

Cross-scale interactions are one of the major knowledge gaps in macrosystems ecology (study of ecological phenomena at regional to continental scales and their interactions with phenomena at other scales), and in this case, limit our understanding of how lake water quality will respond to interacting pressures of human activities, land use, weather patterns, and geology.

A brief summary of major findings resulting from this research follows.  Counter to current evidence, high concentrations of nitrogen, in particular nitrate, can produce lakes that have surprisingly low amounts of algae (measured as chlorophyll) and are relatively clearer than would be expected based on nutrient concentrations. High nitrate concentrations may lead to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species that burst algae cells in the water column, thereby increasing water clarity. This threshold relationship between chlorophyll and nitrogen was not widespread in agricultural regions of the Midwestern United States, but was limited to two of the most intense agricultural regions studied that had some of the highest nitrogen levels. Although nitrogen stress effects on phytoplankton were rare, interactions among land use, weather patterns, and hydrogeology will likely make these relationships more common in the future. Across diverse regions, algae abundance (measured as chlorophyll) increased nonlinearly as a function of increasing limiting nutrients (phosphorus) rather than increasing at a constant rate as previously described. Additionally, the form of these relationships varied for different regions, with pasturelands and wetlands influencing the shape of the response curve. Across large geographic areas using citizen science data, lakes showed differing temporal trends (increase, decrease, no trend) in water clarity, which is often used as a measure of lake water quality. Although most lakes across eight states did not show changes through time, lakes further south tended to show more negative long-term trends and greater variability within years than northern lakes, and the ability to detect long-term trends was influenced by the duration of monitoring data.

Carbon dioxide levels in lakes were largely influenced by alkalinity and algae where precipitation was low and agriculture was high, whereas they were largely influenced by algae and water color where precipitation and wetlands were high.
