<AbstractNarration>We seek a better understanding of the behavior of decentralized systems such as markets (economic and electronic) and traffic networks, through the study of effective resource allocation and price determination for these systems. For network traffic, we seek to understand the impact of selfish network users on system behavior and study methods to control this. For markets where there is an accepted ordering of the desirability of goods (such as ad slots on web pages, quality-of-service customer classes, and network routes with known delays), we seek to design fast algorithms to match buyers and sellers so that all profit from the exchange. For decentralized networked markets, we seek to understand the convergence properties of local price update algorithms. These problems have implications for Internet and transportation networks, networked market economies, and online advertising markets. We will also design and offer new undergraduate courses that introduce both computer science majors and nonmajors to these important issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project resulted in three journal publications, six conference publications, and two unpublished manuscripts.  These advance the understanding of several problems that arise in communication networks and online commerce.  This includes 1) better models (and corresponding analyses) for uncoordinated traffic in networks, such as arises in transportation or communication networks; 2) new models for modeling privacy and how to compensate database entrants for use of their private information; 3) new mechanisms for multi-level marketing, useful in online social networks, that protect against strategic users; 4) new characterization and algorithms for routing in graphs; 5) new algorithms for scheduling with incomplete information; 6) new algorithm for generating an order to list products in online retail; 7) a new characterization for the class of networks in which a well-studied property ("the cut condition") satisfied by the network and the routing constraints implies feasibility of the corresponding routing problem.  This project also supported the education and training of numerous graduate students and two postdocs.  The students and postdocs learned about design and conducting research, paper writing, presentation preparation and delivery.  Each student and postdoc involved with the project was an author on at least one published paper.  Students and postdocs also travelled to conferences and gave presentations on their research.
