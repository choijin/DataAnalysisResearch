<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Rebecca Braslau of the University of California at Santa Cruz will study heterogeneous nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization (NMRP) in super-critical carbon dioxide and will synthesize well-defined stimuli-responsive materials.  This project is a three-way international collaboration with Prof. Fawaz Aldabbagh of the National University of Ireland in Galway and Prof. Carlos Elvira of the Institute of Polymer Science &amp; Technology in Madrid, Spain. Nitroxide-based initiators bearing polar or fluorophilic functionalities (perfluoroalkyl and polysiloxane groups) on the nitroxide moiety will be synthesized.  During polymerization this nitroxide moiety will be used to control the partitioning of the growing polymer in super-critical carbon dioxide, such that both monomer and alkoxyamine initiator are initially soluble but the polymer precipitates at a critical degree of polymerization. The addition of a stabilizer will permit control of the final particle size. The development of polymeric alkoxyamines that possess dual initiator and stabilizer capabilities for dispersion NMRP in super-critical carbon dioxide will be explored. Thermal or pH-responsive polymers will be developed for applications such as drug-delivery, non-viral gene vectors and surface coatings for cell manipulations. These designed materials will be examined in biocompatibility studies, complexation studies with DNA, as well as plasmid transfection levels using different cell lines.  The broader impacts include training graduate students and enhancing infrastructure for research and education through the establishment of a trilateral international collaboration.  The synergistic interactions between the American, Irish and Spanish groups will further broaden the training of these students, introducing a multicultural enrichment while promoting learning, teaching and training of young scientists in an international, collaborative environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide further scientific understanding about using green polymerization conditions for industrial synthesis.  Carbon dioxide is a ubiquitous atmospheric gas, and its use as a solvent for plastic material manufacturing could lead to a reduction in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.   The project would also further our understanding of the basic design principles for polymers used in biomedical applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Polymers are long molecular chains that are commonly produced using free radicals (reactive molecules with an unpaired electron) to stich together small "monomeric" starting materials.  The use of "nitroxides," a special class of isolable organic free radicals, results in long polymers of controlled length and composition.  In this grant, we have utilized the "green" solvent super-critical (pressurized) carbon dioxide to carry out controlled polymerizations, with the aim of making highly tailored materials for biomedical applications.  This work entailed collaboration between our research laboratory at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the Aldabbagh laboratory at the National University of Ireland in Galway, and the Elvira laboratory at the Institute of Polymer Science and Technology in Madrid, Spain, and involved student exchanges between these labs.  Our lab synthesized nitroxide-based initiators with various degrees of fluorine-substitution to vary the solubility of the initiators (and growing polymers) in super-critical CO2, to determine how to best control the length of the final polymers.  We learned that many more fluorine atoms are needed on the initiator than we originally expected to enhance solubility of the polymers and thus provide the control desired in designing the final materials. The polymerizations in super-critical CO2 were carried out in the Irish lab where they have the appropriate high-pressure equipment. A comparison of polymerizations carried out under traditional organic solvent conditions (a non-green approach) verses the super-critical CO2 method has been published.              One graduate student from UC Santa Cruz worked in the laboratory in Galway, and one graduate student from Madrid worked in our laboratory in California, resulting in an enhanced exchange of knowledge, culture and international understanding. A visit by the Principle Investigator Braslau to both Ireland and Spain early in the project facilitated the collaboration, and initiated an additional collaboration beyond the scope of this grant.  The Braslau laboratory is continuing to explore the synthesis of heavily fluorinated initiators beyond the timeline of the grant funding, in a continued collaboration with the Irish laboratory.  The work supported by this grant has helped to train a number of graduate students as well as first time undergraduate researchers in synthetic organic chemistry and polymer chemistry at the University of California Santa Cruz. Two of the undergraduates engaged in this research are now pursuing graduate studies following their Bachelors degrees at top level universities, and a third has decided to pursue teaching organic chemistry at the junior college level in the future.              Outside of the specific project, Professor Braslau has delivered a number of presentations on the history, social implications, and green developments in the field of polymers to educational institutions and environmental organizations, to educate the public on the contributions, challenges and promises of plastics on modern society.
