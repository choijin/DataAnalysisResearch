<AbstractNarration>With NSF support and collaboration among researchers at the University of Maryland and Gallaudet University, doctoral student So-One Hwang will examine the perception and production of American Sign Language (ASL) as compared to spoken English, in order to investigate the contribution of modality and linguistic representations in language processing. Psycholinguistic experiments will be conducted to investigate the effect of visual processing in determining the time windows of integrating linguistic information, using behavioral methodology similar to that used to study speech. Although processing speech often feels like a seamless, continuous experience, studies have shown that the acoustic input is actually analyzed piece-meal, according to time windows that are closely linked to linguistic units. This has been shown by the cognitive restoration of locally-reversed speech, where sentences that are distorted in small chunks still remain intelligible. This phenomenon has provided insight into the temporal integration windows and the limits of the auditory system for language processing. Because signs in ASL take longer to produce than words of spoken English, and because the visual system can be more resilient to temporal distortions than the auditory system, it is hypothesized that significant differences will be found for the perception of ASL as compared to speech. The intelligibility of distorted ASL sentences will be determined by asking deaf participants to sign back what they can understand, and accuracy will be measured. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second part of this project, archived recordings of ASL and English will be used to compare production rates of languages that use different articulators. Using the most current understanding of the features of linguistic units in ASL and English, this study will lead to a better understanding of the differences and similarities in the production rates of languages using different modalities. In addition to contributions based on its findings, this research promotes multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at two institutions, and will lead to an increased awareness of the importance of diversity and cross-modal approaches in language and cognitive science research.</AbstractNarration>
