<AbstractNarration>1043517/Clark&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to develop a better understanding of the response of the WAIS to climate change. The timing of the last deglaciation of the western Ross Sea will be improved using in situ terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (3He, 10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl) to date glacial erratics at key areas and elevations along the western Ross Sea coast.  A state-of-the art ice sheet-shelf model will be used to identify mechanisms of deglaciation of the Ross Sea sector of WAIS. The model results and forcing will be compared with observations including the new cosmogenic data proposed here, with the aim of better determining and understanding the history and causes of WAIS deglaciation in the Ross Sea. There is considerable uncertainty, however, in the history of grounding line retreat from its last glacial maximum position, and virtually nothing is known about the timing of ice- surface lowering prior to ~10,000 years ago. Given these uncertainties, we are currently unable to assess one of the most important questions regarding the last deglaciation of the global ice sheets, namely as to whether the Ross Sea sector of WAIS contributed significantly to meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A), an extraordinarily rapid (~500-year duration) episode of ~20 m sea-level rise that occurred ~14,500 years ago. The intellectual merit of this project is that recent observations of startling changes at the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets indicate that dynamic responses to warming may play a much greater role in the future mass balance of ice sheets than considered in current numerical projections of sea level rise. The broader impacts of this work are that it has direct societal relevance to developing an improved understanding of the response of the West Antarctic ice sheet to current and possible future environmental changes including the sea-level response to glacier and ice sheet melting due to global warming.  The PI will communicate results from this project to a variety of audiences through the publication of peer-reviewed papers and by giving talks to public audiences.  Finally the project will support a graduate student and undergraduate students in all phases of field-work, laboratory work and data interpretation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Future melting and retreat of grounded ice in Antarctica has the potential to cause significant sea level rise. One sector of the Antarctic Ice Sheet in particular is undergoing drastic thinning and accelerated flow, the eastern Amundsen Sea Embayment in West Antarctica, and is currently the largest Antarctic contributor to global sea-level rise. In this region, two major glaciers (Pine Island and Thwaites) drain large basins of the West Antarctic interior, flowing into the ocean and becoming afloat in ocean depths of several hundred meters. There is a recognized danger of much faster runaway ice retreat and sea-level rise in future centuries, if the location at which the ice becomes afloat (the grounding line) begins to retreats inland. This is because the bedrock on which the ice currently sits deepens into the West Antarctic interior, and ice discharge to the ocean is very sensitive to ocean depth at the grounding line. If runaway retreat into the West Antarctic interior occurs, previous studies have shown it would cause ~3 meters of global-mean sea-level rise in hundreds to thousands of years.   To better understand and predict these scenarios, numerical ice-sheet models are needed. These models first need to be adjusted to agree well with modern and past observations (calibration and validation), and then run forward into the future. To date most ice-sheet models applied to the Amundsen Sea sector have used fine spatial resolution and sophisticated dynamical treatments of ice flow. While they capture observed modern details well, their large computational expense limits their calibration to modern conditions and decadal trends.   As a complementary approach, we use a somewhat simplified ice-sheet model that still captures the basic physics, yet can be easily run over tens of thousands of years for the whole West Antarctic region. This means that:  1)  we can simulate the last deglacial retreat of ice since the Last Glacial Maximum about 20,000 years ago, when grounded ice extended hundreds of kilometers further seaward than present, and thus calibrate and validate the model vs. the considerable body of relevant geologic data.  2)  we can perform Large Ensembles (LEs) with the model, i.e., several hundred runs with systematic variations of selected model parameters. By comparing each run with past geologic data and modern observations, statistical analysis of the LE results yields rigorous ranges of best-fit model parameter values, and meaningful envelopes of uncertainty for future predictions. The calibration against the broad sweep of the last deglacial retreat (100's kilometers, 1000's years), and the more thorough exploration of parameter space provide by the Large Ensembles, increases confidence in the model results for long-term and large-scale future West Antarctic retreat.   Following other recent Antarctic-wide studies, we use a basic statistical method of calculating a model-data-misfit score for each LE run, and averaging results over the LE weighted by the scores. In collaboration with statistics specialists in another NSF-funded project, we also use more advanced Bayesian statistical techniques including emulation, probability models and Markov Chain-Monte Carlo methods, which are new to this area of ice-sheet modeling and provide more robust and meaningful results.  The main results of the project are:  Results from the basic statistical method, used in most ice-sheet LE studies to date, agree reasonably well with those using the more advanced techniques, at least for Large Ensembles with dense sampling of parameter space. Consistent with trends in recent Antarctic modeling studies, the greater total Antarctic ice amount at the Last Glacial Maximum is less than previously thought, equivalent to about 5 to 9 meters of global equivalent sea level below modern (see Figure 1). This suggests that Antarctic expansion is insufficient to explain the "missing ice" problem, i.e., the total volume of reconstructed ice...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
