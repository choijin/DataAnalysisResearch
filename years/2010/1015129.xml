As my host, Professor Kuo, became more familiar with my research experience and skill set he suggested that I join a team with two of his students doing research on femtocell deployments in LTE data networks.  I agreed, changing my summer research project from "Protecting Web Servers by Web Robot Detection" to "Traffic and Performance Modeling for LTE Femtocell Interference Avoidance".  LTE is the newest standard in wireless networks designed specifically for highly mobile computing that is expected to supersede the current 3G standard. Major telecommunications companies across the world, including AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, and China Mobile have already announced plans to convert their current EDGE and 3G networks to LTE (marketed as 4G).

While the researchers at the DDSN laboratory had developed a novel approach towards mitigating interference in LTE networks with Femtocells, they lacked the background necessary to develop and assess performance by a mathematical model.

The approach also introduced the use of new modeling techniques that have yet to be applied in the context of wireless networks. This new approach improved the accuracy of the model, is easily extendable, and has been iterated upon since the conclusion of the fellowship. The creation of these models is a key step in making the promise of having a high-speed, reliable LTE connection avai...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
