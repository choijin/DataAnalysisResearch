<AbstractNarration>With this award, co-funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Richard Holz from Loyola University of Chicago will acquire an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer equipped with low temperature liquid helium capabilities and an X band cavity operational in both perpendicular and parallel modes. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as investigations of metallohydrolases and metallohydratases, biologically relevant metal centers, catalytic role of the dinuclear metal binding site in ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase, electronic and catalytic properties of the dinuclear active site of Aminopeptidase P, Mn(II) and divalent VO metal substituted derivatives of alpha subunits of guanine nucleotide binding proteins and copper, zinc superoxide dismutase and applications of X band EPR at low temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument will be an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Departments of Chemistry at Loyola University Chicago (LUC), Roosevelt University (RU), and Northwestern University (NW) and the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry at the Loyola Stritch School of Medicine (LSSM) purchased a Bruker EMXplus electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer with low-temperature liquid helium capabilities and an X-band cavity operational in both perpendicular and parallel modes (ER 4116DM).  All six projects outlined in the original proposal have greatly benefited from the acquisition of this EPR spectrometer.  The instrument has been a primary tool postdoc, graduate and undergraduate researcher's to analyze the electronic structures and catalytic properties of several bioinorganic catalysts and also to conduct experiments on small molecule transition metal catalysts.  Some of the data obtained during the three year period of this project (October 2010 &ndash; September 2013) have:  a) allowed the elimination of three of the four possible catalytic mechanisms for Nitrile hydratases (NHases, EC 4.2.1.84).  NHases catalyze the hydration of nitriles to their corresponding amides under ambient conditions and physiological pH and have attracted substantial interest as biocatalysts in preparative organic chemistry.  b)  provided insight into the observed mechanistically important allosteric effects in the potato tuber ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADP-Glc PPase).  This enzyme is responsible for controlling the synthesis of starch in plants and glycogen in bacteria.  c)  afforded information on metal binding to the alpha subunits of guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins.  These proteins play important roles in relaying extracellular signals to intracellular sites.  D) allowed a method to be developed to detect trivalent chromium in samples at very low concentrations.  Since this method is insensitive to hexavalent chromium, it is ideally suited for human body fluid analysis.  In addition, over 60 undergraduate students have gained hands-on experience with this instrument each year in undergraduate chemistry laboratories.  The EPR spectrometer has also been used as a platform to increase the participation of women and classically underrepresented groups in scientific careers in biophysics, chemistry, and biochemistry.  For example, LUC hosted Emerging Chemists Workshops for local minority high school students who performed "hands-on" experiments with the EPR spectrometer.  In addition, two ACS Project SEED summer high school students utilized the EPR spectrometer during their summer research experiences.  Finally, the EPR spectrometer has significantly enhanced the research enterprise at LUC as it has been made available to all faculty in the biology and chemistry departments at LUC as well as the molecular and cellular biochemistry department at the LSSM and research teams at NW, RU, and the University of Chicago to support their research.
