<AbstractNarration>Now that experiments on quantum computing have reached the level of about ten qubits or more (at least for experiments using ions and photons), data analysis becomes an exponentially hard task, and this forms a serious (computational, not experimental) bottleneck. As a solution to this problem, information criteria will be used to determine the simplest model (containing the minimum number of parameters) that describes the data statistically correctly. Entanglement or other quantum properties of one's system can then be analyzed much more efficiently within that model. Moreover, the few parameters thus identified will reveal what the main noise and decoherence mechanisms are. In summary, one will attempt to quantify how much information a finite amount of data provides about entanglement of N qubits, and so answer the questions (1) what information can a finite amount of data provide about entanglement of N qubits?, and (2) Is it possible to design an efficient entanglement verification method which does not need a number of data that exponentially grow with N?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves two graduate students, both of whom happen to be female. One of these students will participate in an outreach program organized by the Optics Center at the University of Oregon, a science camp, which aims at introducing girls in middle school and high school to science (this summer, 15 girls participated). Moreover, the same student has entered the GK-12 program this year. The PI is involved in the Oregon SciencePub program, explaining his work to the local community.</AbstractNarration>
