<AbstractNarration>Santa Clara University, in partnership with Santa Clara School Districts, proposes to extend the reach of the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) course developed in Los Angeles into high schools in northern California. ECS was designed to be an engaging introduction to computing that is contextualized to be socially relevant and meaningful for diverse student populations. It covers a variety of topics, including problem solving, programming, Web design, data modeling, human computer interaction, robotics, ethical and social implications, and career opportunities. This project will demonstrate how the course can be replicated throughout California and other states. It will develop a course implementation package that includes alternative curriculum units expressly written for students from different cultures and with different life experiences, and materials that facilitate the successful engagement of administrators, the recruitment of students, the preparation of teachers, and additional course support. This work is part of a much long-term effort to work with local schools and their teachers, as well as organizations such as NCWIT and CTSA, in providing a comprehensive approach to increasing participation in computing in Silicon Valley.</AbstractNarration>
