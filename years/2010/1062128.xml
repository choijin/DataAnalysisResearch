<AbstractNarration>The NSF-REU Site in Extremal Graph Theory and Dynamical Systems at RIT will engage ten students in each of the summers 2011, 2012, and 2013 in a research experience in mathematics. The students will work directly with RIT faculty for the entirety of the program and will receive mentoring in mathematical research practices, as well as in written and oral communication. Research will be disseminated through publications in refereed journals, as well as in presentations at national and regional mathematical meetings, and at their home institutions. Students will be encouraged to pursue graduate studies and employment in the mathematical sciences. During the program students will participate in an Ethics in Science Workshop. The REU program will intersect with RIT's Summer Mathematics Institute where each of the REU students will present to nearly 100 mathematics and computer science high school teachers from New York State. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Our recruitment efforts will target students from universities, liberal arts colleges, and community colleges. We aim to have 80 percent of the participants from outside of the host institution, with an emphasis on drawing students from colleges without Ph.D. programs and extensive research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The NSF-REU Program in Extremal Graph Theory and Dynamical Systems at the Rochester institute of Technology included 30 undergraduate students and 7 faculty. Research projects encompassed many areas including theoretical and applied graph theory, mathematics and neuroscience, mathematical biology, and dynamical systems. Below is a sample of projects.  (i) Efficiency of star-like networks and the Atlanta subway network (ii) Community identification in networks (iii) Graph Ramsey numbers (iv) Vertex ranking of graphs (v) A phenomenological mathematical model of a cardiac action potential with intracellular calcium cycling (vi) Bifurcation scenarios of compound laser mode solutions of delay-coupled lasers      Broader Impacts:  Participants gained valuable presentation experience by presenting their research in a special session at annual Joint Mathematics Meetings.  Our program included a "Researcher in Residence" where Dr. Rigoberto Florez from the Citadel visited our program to work with students and give a presentation on his own research.  Our program had an impact on high school mathematics teachers as all undergraduate participants talked about their experiences in high school mathematics at RIT's Summer Mathematics Institute.  A collaboration with the Rochester Center for Brain Imaging at the University of Rochester provided the opportunity to apply our graph theory research to study functional connectivity of the human brain.
