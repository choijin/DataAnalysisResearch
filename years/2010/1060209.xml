<AbstractNarration>The ELF (Experiential Learning Fellowship) program is providing financial resources to increase the number of students successfully completing undergraduate and graduate degrees in STEM disciplines while also civically engaging them in relevant science service within their community. The scholarship support provides the financial means to finish their academic career while also providing time and access to an unparalleled learning experience and timely mentors for research. The program encourages cross-disciplinary interaction between students and faculty during the earliest academic years and strongly promotes peer learning and mentorship across the academic spectrum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participating scholars are first introduced to research by means of seminars, field trips to community research and development sites, and laboratory visits within the university. Subsequently many scholars choose to join a community service research team and participate in the investigative process. After making progress on research goals, the teams cooperatively work toward an in-depth report of their findings and make oral and written presentations to all interested parties. When appropriate, the findings are presented at conferences and submitted to peer-reviewed publications for dissemination. In addition to increasing student learning and retention, the ELF Program has the broadening impact of building bridges between the local community and university. This fosters better relationships between the two entities and facilitates the recruitment of minority and first generation students to the university and STEM disciplines. The interactive research experience of these funded scholars is highly sought by potential future employers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Arkansas Delta region is among the most educationally and financially impoverished regions in the United States, and this area needs a well-educated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce.  The Experiential Learning Fellowship (ELF) Program at Arkansas State University was designed to enhance and encourage STEM education by supporting students with scholarships, academic mentoring, professional development seminars, research experiences, and opportunities to present and publish research results.  In the six years of the program at Arkansas State University, 29 undergraduate and 9 graduate students participated in the program, and all of these students participated in research experiences with a faculty mentor studying natural history collection digitization and patterns of botanical diversity, plant defenses against insects, how insects impact stored products such as rice, butterfly specimen curation, water quality in agricultural landscapes, or the chemistry of air and water pollution.  Graduate students directed research projects and served as mentors for undergraduate students.  Most students received scholarship funding for multiple years, and 74% of the students completed the program by either receiving the maximum scholarship amount or graduating.  Research conducted by students resulted in 70 presentations at university, state, regional, national, or international scientific meetings.  Moreover, 14 scientific publications have been produced so far with ELF recipients as lead authors or co-authors.  The majority of students who have graduated (64%) are working in STEM fields.  One goal of the project was to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, and ELF succeeded with the inclusion of 71% female participants and 40% underrepresented minority participants in the program.  Another important component of the program was the development of community-based engagement among the participants.  Again, ELF accomplished that goal.  Each year students presented research outcomes, hands-on laboratory activities, or STEM tutoring services to K-12 students in area schools or community groups.  Overall, most students reported gains in their understanding of civic engagement, with 75% saying they made good or great gains.  In addition, the vast majority of students reported an increase in understanding how the topics covered in ELF help people address real world issues, with 86% reporting they made either good or great gains in such understanding.  As one student said, "Before, I thought civic engagement involved ?important people? working together to help the community, but now I know that it involves everyone."  Another student said that because of ELF "I have a greater understanding of the importance of STEM subjects.  I did not realize the huge impact that they have on our everyday lives and future careers."  Programs like ELF can serve to enhance STEM engagement in colleges and universities by broadening student interest and understanding while encouraging greater participation in STEM fields.
