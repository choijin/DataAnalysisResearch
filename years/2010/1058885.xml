<AbstractNarration>Professor Jason McNeill of Clemson University is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program in the Division of Chemistry to develop conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) for sensing and high resolution fluorescent imaging and tracking applications. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) to use dopants to increase the stability and brightness of CPNs; (2) to characterize the nanoscale photophysics of excitons and charge carriers in CPNs and optimize the photoswitching and sensing properties of CPNs; and (3) to use high resolution imaging to observe CPN motion and polaron dynamics within CPNs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate objective is to create new imaging and sensing capabilities with innovation in nanomaterials, fluorescence and biomolecular dynamics. If successful, the proposed research will result in important advances in imaging with nanometer resolution, thus positively impacting nanotechnology, chemistry, biology and the health sciences. Students and other participants in the project will be provided with valuable training in nanoscience, advanced imaging and sensing technologies.</AbstractNarration>
