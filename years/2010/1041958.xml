<AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports Jason Spruell of the University of California - Santa Barbara as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.   Dr. Spruell will work with Prof. Craig Hawker to synthesize and study a series of block co-polymers which will self-assemble into nanoparticles of varying size, shape, internal morphology and constitution.    In particular, the research will focus on developing methods which are efficient and scalable.  Polymer nanoparticles will be synthesized that can be further processed, through mineralization, and further self-assembly at the mesoscale.   The work will be carried out in collaboration with scientists at the Molecular Foundry at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.   For his plan for broadening participation, the PI will develop hands-on science activities and other curriculum materials to be used in local-area elementary schools -- schools with significant numbers of underrepresented groups.  Successful materials will be more widely disseminated to a larger audience through TeacherTube and Facebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Spruell is aimed at developing better methods for synthesizing nanoscopic materials.  In particular, the research carried out with support from this award will enable chemists to make polymeric nanoparticles with unusual, interesting and potentially useful internal structures.  Results from research like that supported here will lead to better materials with potential applications in medical diagnosis and treatment, electronic chip manufacture, and other applications.   The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Spruell are aimed at encouraging young people, especially those from groups underrepresented in the sciences, to engage in interesting and exciting science activities, at the earliest stages of their educational careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the reporting period research has been funded and carried out to develop new types of chemistry that are mild, efficient, and versatile.  These types of chemistries are ideally suited to prepare well-defined nanostructures that may be used in such industries as electronics, medical, or energy.  While the final types of products are important, the focus of this grant has been on the developmental stages, focusing on the chemistry.  With that in mind, we have developed two new types of chemistry that are effective in condensed polymer phases in the presence of oxygen and/or water.  Both of these bond-formation protocols are versatile and may be used to both to crosslink as well as functionalized polymer structures.  We have used these chemistries to prepare designed crosslinked surface coatings as well as crosslinked hydrogels.  Further research into these avenues should yield new materials properties through an easy fabrication strategy that will lower production costs and give new capabilities to consumer products.     This grant also facilitated the education of many students.  Two undergraduate students, three graduate students, and four postgraduate students directly participated in or benefitted from the grant funds.  The project was used as a training tool to develop new scientists and engineers whose skills will go on to increase the productivity and profitability of the U.S. economy.  Additionally, a great deal of effort was devoted to exposing younger students to science and engineering.  Specifically, science teachers were equipped with training modules to be used in their classes through workshops at the University of California Santa Barbara.  Additionally, local elementary and middle school students were brought to the University to perform hands-on science demonstrations.  These efforts are targeted at increasing the interest of U.S. students in science and engineering in order to maintain the U.S. competitive advantage in technology.
