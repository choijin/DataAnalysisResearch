<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop an improved Open-Path FTIR Spectrometer for monitoring of atmospheric gases over extended distances.  This will be achieved by developing a high-brightness infrared source that is heated to 2000 K by means of a diode laser.  This will enable the instrument to be less bulky and expensive, and will have improved monitoring range over current systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to provide a solution that will reduce several limitations that are found in current OP-FTIR technologies, namely, elevated capital costs, size, power requirement, and/or sensitivity.  The approach will broaden the use OP-FTIR for monitoring atmospheric gases by EPA and ASTM methods, and these benefits may help implement this technology and make it applicable for other applications such as closed path FTIR systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Open-Path Fourier-Transform-Infrared-Spectroscopy (OP-FTIR) is a valuable technique for monitoring area emissions and movement of atmospheric gases. It is an accepted EPA method for long-range integrated monitoring of atmospheric gases and pollutants, and has military and homeland security applications as well.  The basic principal of OP-FTIR is to measure the absorption of infra-red  (IR) light by the gas under test.   In order to make the measurement, a beam of infra-red light traverses the region under test, and the absorption of the beam, as a function of itÃ†s wavelength (color) is measured by comparing the signal at the detector, to a reference measurement.   Therefore, a critical component of an OP-FTIR system is the source of IR light.     Existing IR sources are typically required to operate at a relatively low temperature (~ 1000 C) because they are a complex structure that is resistively heated, and the connections to the resistive material cannot tolerate higher temperature.  Signal levels at the IR detector are critical to making an accurate measurement.   In order to collect enough photons for a measurement, large and heavy optical systems are typically required, both to collimate the beam from the source, and to collect it at the detector.   Griffiths and co-workers [1]generally review the advantages and drawbacks of modern OP-FTIR instruments.   The fact that the equipment is bulky and heavy and requires two people to set it up is, they claim, a roadblock to applying this technology more generally.   In their words, "However, a reduction in size and weight would probably lead to a reduction in the optical throughput and hence a degradation in performance. We know of no simple solution to this problem." Although they do not explicit state the reasons for the size and weight, it is clearly due to the need for large-diameter optics, arising from the weak IR source that is used. A brighter IR source would allow for correspondingly smaller transmit and receive optics.  Our approach to this problem was to develop a novel IR source.     Energetiq Technology, Inc. invented several years ago a new high-brightness lamp technology, and we have successfully commercialized this technology with a product line that produces extremely bright optical output from the UV into the NIR spectral regions.  In an NSF Phase I submission, Energetiq proposed to similarly advance infrared light source technology.   High temperature refractory ceramics are becoming available which can tolerate temperatures approaching 3000K or higher.  Fundamentally, we proposed to heat an appropriately engineered sample of refractory material to a temperature at least twice that routinely used in FTIR spectrometry, thus at least doubling the achievable spectral brightness available at the longest wavelengths, with much greater increases at the shorter wavelengths.  Our results, in summary, were these.  After preliminary tests of several materials, we selected two materials for detailed measurements.   We found that with these materials, our source can achieve temperatures in excess of 2500C at powers of less than 22 watts; it is likely that a product running at 10 watts is feasible.   Direct comparison with a standard source shows an improvement in signal amplitude of between 2 and 10 (depending on wavelength)  and signal to noise measurements imply an improvement in detectability of from 1.5 to about 6 can be demonstrated even with our unstabilized prototype.
