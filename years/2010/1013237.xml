<AbstractNarration>This proposal "A Mentoring and Networking Workshop for&lt;br/&gt;Junior Women Faculty in the Big 10" is to address and overcome some of the barriers to the broader participation of women in&lt;br/&gt;the engineering academy. This proposal will develop and present a networking&lt;br/&gt;workshop for approximately 45 women assistant professors of engineering at ten&lt;br/&gt;similar, large engineering schools in the upper Midwest. The workshop is designed to provide the assistant professors information critical to early success in their career paths. Also, this workshop will generate a multi-university regional support system for these women faculty to counter isolation and lack of networking opportunities. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, this workshop will disseminate best practices from the four NSF-ADVANCE programs at the represented schools. The proposal also includes a plan for participants in this workshop to continue collaborations via travel to one anothers institutions following the workshop. This networking will provide the participants with opportunities to collaborative on future research topics of interest to the participants. &lt;br/&gt;The budget request for this workshop proposal is an amount of $49,031. This proposal is exempt from external review in accordance with the PAM, Chapter V.B.2.m.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:1013237 PI Name:Tilbury, Dawn&lt;br/&gt;Printed</AbstractNarration>

There were three purposes to the workshop: to provide a professional networking opportunity for junior women, to cultivate peer collaboration and mentoring relationships, and to foster interactions with senior engineering faculty role models. The workshop was attended by 39 junior women, 20 senior women, and 6 deans. Funding was received from NSF, the Big 10 Deans, and Rockwell Automation.     The senior women faculty contacted about the workshop almost unanimously gave their immediate and enthusiastic support. They recognized the importance and value of the networking and mentoring themes of the workshop, and helped encourage the junior women from their universities to attend. The attendance of six deans also helped convey the importance of the workshop topics.     One significant outcome of the workshop was that the junior women who attended reported an increased awareness of the importance and value of networking and mentoring. Specifically they recognized the need for a group of mentors rather than a single mentor in order to be successful. Many junior women were able to identify both peer and senior mentors at the workshop, and received helpful advice from the deans, panelists, and other participants.      Several important themes for the retention of junior women faculty emerged at the workshop. First, many junior women had dual career issues. Both trailing or leading partners indicated that the specifics of their (or their partnerÃ†s) situation continued to be a factor in departmental and college discussions. Several junior women have partners that are either un? or under?employed, or working in a different city, creating stress in their home lives. Second, many junior women appeared to lack vital information &ndash; not knowing what they could or should request or negotiate, and not recognizing the value of the unique contributions they were making to their departments and colleges.     The post?workshop survey helped quantify the success of the workshop. The peer mentoring "critical friends" sessions were most?highly rated, with an average score of 4.88 out of 5. The other highly?ranked sessions included "Balancing with Kids," "Big Life, Big Stage, Big 10," "Deans Panel", and "Finding Mentors."     Post?workshop travel grants were awarded to ten of the junior women to support invited seminars and/or research discussions.     Our recommendation, based on strong support from junior participants and senior mentors alike, is to hold a similar workshop every two years.
