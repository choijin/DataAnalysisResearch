<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Collaborative Research award is to develop capabilities for machining structural biological composites such as bone and nacre with minimal surface damage. These biological composites exhibit many levels of hierarchical structures from macroscopic to microscopic length scales, and novel structural mechanical properties. The research approach will utilize novel diagnostic instruments for studying deformation/fracture in biological composites and high-resolution optical techniques for analysis of deformation in machining. Modeling structured around finite element analysis and moving heat source theory will be used to predict the thermomechanical state of the composite surfaces created by cutting. Model predictions will be compared with the experimental observations. By integrating these results, recommendations will be developed for improved cutting procedures that will minimize surface damage in this class of structural bio-materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the broader impact of the results will be new cutting methodologies for the bio-inspired structural materials of the future, and improved procedures for surgery that minimize damage to bone and tissue. The results will be of value also in understanding deformation and cutting of complex bio-inspired (structural) materials of the future and soft matter, and for continued development of diagnostic instrumentation for biological composites. Complementing the research is an education and training program that includes development of a bone cutting test-bed for practitioners and interns, student internships, seminar series webcast, and a modest focus on fostering entrepreneurship in graduate study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the study of machining operations (e.g., cutting, drilling and sawing) involving hierarchical biological composites such as bone.  These operations are integral to procedures involving knee and hip replacements, bone grafting, and orthopedic surgery involved in repair of fractures and installation of prosthetic devices.  Fundamental research is critical to develop and refine these operations, and pursue a basis for the machining of complex bio-inspired materials of the future.  Cortical (also known as compact) bone from the equine third metacarpal was used as the principal model system for project study.  Cortical bone is one of the two osseous tissues that constitute bones, and in structural mechanical terms, bone can be considered to be a prototypical biological composite material with orthotropic anisotropy.  Project outcomes and findings centered on modeling and analysis of indentation and cutting induced deformation in bone, characterizing surface and near-surface damage and fracture with further use of novel instrumentation and atomic force microscopy.  In particular, work composed of modeling, analysis, and experiment focused on the behavior of bone under different material states (hydrated versus dry) and under different types of indentation and cutting, with work utilizing novel instrumentation and high speed video capture of fracture ahead of wedge indentation in cortical bone. The wedge indentation work produced results showing the influence of hydration and submersion on fracture behavior in cortical bone, along with the effects of varying the indenting wedge sharpness upon fracture progression.  Additional work examined indentation fracture patterns and their dependence on cortical bone microstructural orientation.  Finite element analysis techniques able to capture the complex fracture phenomena under indentation in bone were developed and showed promise when compared with experimental observations, while development of novel fixtures necessary for viewing fracture in bone while completely submerged made large strides, making new findings possible, and enabling further indentation studies on completely hydrated cortical bone.   This work on cortical bone helped to establish a foundation of basic research on the new Reference Point Indentation Instrument. This instrument shows promise for clinical applications: specifically measuring the Bone Material Strength of the bone in patients.  Further, our research on wedge indentation may assist in development of optimized drilling and cutting protocols and procedures that may reduce bone damage during surgery.  Wedge indentation under plane strain conditions on cortical bone showed results in exploring the fracture behavior in cortical bone at the near surface.  This displays the relevance of classical indentation mechanics research to biomedical materials and technology.  Surface damage in bone was quantified with the use of the dynamic bone indentation device, and further, relevant handling and testing protocols for equine bone samples were developed.  Further experiments and modeling added to the understanding of damage in bone under machining operations, such as the behavior of fracture during cutting, along with that occurring under dynamic indentation, with extension to other hierarchical biological composites possible as well, including wood.   The fundamental understanding of damage processes during machining of bone will help improve orthopedic surgery techniques for animals and humans.  Greater understanding of the behavior of bone under indentation may improve biomedical diagnostic instruments. Analysis of the natural mechanisms in bone providing defense against crack propagation may provide insight into the design of new damage resistant composite materials.  The development of optimized cutting procedures for hierarchical biological materials may prove helpful in the areas of natural materials harvesting and processing.  This project supported two Ph.D. students in their graduate studies, with one, Connor Randall, finishing his Ph.D. degree in August 2016 and beginning a job as a project engineer in the motorsport industry, and a second, Kevin Hoffseth, planning to finish in the spring of 2017.
