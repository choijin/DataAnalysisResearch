<AbstractNarration>Volcanism is one of several important processes that form and shape the surface of the Earth. Melts that are erupted from explosive volcanoes such as Pinatubo or Mt Saint Helens, and from the vast system of mid-ocean ridges. Lavas erupted at the surface are known to originate from the Earth?s mantle as partial melts, i.e., small fractions of melt in mostly solid rock, but how melts move through the host solid is poorly understood. Melts are thought to be driven by both stress (pressure) and chemical reactions, and this experimental study has the aim of investigating how these two processes interact to channelize and transport melts at high temperatures and pressures. In addition to contributing to our understanding of fundamental processes, broader impacts of this study include research experience for undergraduates, training for a graduate student, and development of new experimental techniques</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For this research, we studied the physical and chemical processes that are important in transporting melt from deep within EarthÆs mantle to the point of eruption at EarthÆs surface.  We explored the roles of two specific phenomena that allow very rapid movement of melt.  First, we demonstrated that, as a rock containing a small amount of melt is deformed, the melt spontaneously segregates into melt-rich channels through which the melt is able to move very quickly.  These channels permit the melt to be moved over a distance of 100 km so quickly that it does not equilibrate chemically with the rocks through which it is traveling.  In addition, these melt-rich regions are shear zones that may are an important ingredient in plate tectonics.  These shear zones provide a mechanism by which large tectonic plates can decouple from the rocks beneath them, thus allowing the plates to move across EarthÆs surface.  Second, we developed a technique to study how melt reacts with the rocks that surround it.  The result is an instability by which melt forms finger-like structures that eat into the surrounding rock.  These fingers or reaction instabilities are very rich in melt and thus permit the melt to move quickly through them.  Similar structures are observed in exposed sections of EarthÆs mantle in regions called ophiolites.  In ophiolites, it is clear that both deformation to form shear zones and chemical reactions to form melt-rich channels are essential in enabling fast transport of melt though EarthÆs interior.  Thus, there is a direct link between large-scale geological formations observed over 100s of kilometers on EarthÆs surface and micro-scale physical processes that form them and that can be studied in a laboratory.  This link between laboratory measurements and geological structures help us develop a physical sound understanding of how melt can be transported quickly through the Earth to result in volcanic eruptions.
