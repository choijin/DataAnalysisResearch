<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program and co-funding from the Office of International Science and Engineering, Prof. Murray Loew of George Washington University and Drs. John Delaney and Suzanne Lomax at the National Gallery of Art are undertaking studies aimed at developing in situ methods capable of comprehensive examination of entire artworks, providing images, or media maps, of the pigments used, which in turn provide insight into the artistic working method.  Specifically, the team is constructing an infrared imaging spectrometer capable of standing off from and scanning an entire painting, with high spatial and spectral resolution.  The scans will be analyzed to provide maps of the composition of the binding materials used in the paints. That knowledge will help historians to better understand, and conservators to better restore, important works of art.  It will help art conservators and historians understand how evolutionary changes can influence an artist's painting technique and style.  It will clarify how painters worked to alter the appearance of painted surfaces by experimenting more with the binders than with the pigments alone.  Finally, for the conservator, finding regions of common binders is important for determining treatment approaches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new instrument is likely to have utility beyond the field of art conservation; there are challenging material-identification problems in both biomedical imaging and homeland defense to which the standoff, high-sensitivity, high-resolution capabilities would be directly applicable.  The work will provide hands-on experience to graduate and postdoctoral students by making clear the value of analytic techniques from chemistry and engineering in art conservation.  Students will join collaborators in Perugia, Italy, for several months, learning their approaches to the issues and conducting some of the benchmarking, calibration, and new-sample-library studies.  That exposure should be invaluable because it will make clear the similarities and differences of various points of view that are present in this interface, and force the students to examine problems from multiple directions.  There also will be benefit from cross-cultural exposure and understanding.  Results will be disseminated broadly, such as by publication in scientific and popular journals and by Web sites and exhibits at both George Washington University and the National Gallery of Art.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research objective was to design and build a spectral imaging camera, and the supporting computer software, to identify and map different paint binding media in fine-art paintings using light in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, at wavelengths between 1000 and 2500 nm. The NIR region is bounded at shorter wavelengths by the visible region (400-750 nm) and at longer wavelengths by the thermal (heat) region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Thus, this new and novel camera was designed and constructed from state-of-the-art optical and electronic components, including a light-dispersive transmission grating (i.e., a prism), a custom relay lens, and a cryo-cooled infrared camera. The camera has a highly sensitive indium antimonide (InSb) detector array of 1024 by 1280 pixels and operates at 70K (Figures 1,2).     Spectral analysis tools (both commercial and custom software written during the grant period) were used to capture and process the image data collected. The resulting three-dimensional image-data cubes (2-D spatial and 1-D spectral) contain the NIR reflectance spectrum at each pixel in the image. The reflectance spectrum contains information about the chemical bonds and functional groups of a material that can be used in its identification. The data cubes also allow for mapping the spatial distribution of artistsÆ materials, including pigments and paint binders (Figures 3,4).     Key to the material identification process was the development of a library of reference reflectance spectra of artistsÆ paint binders, including whole egg, egg white, animal skin glue, drying oils, wax, alkyd resin, and acrylic.  The painted test panels and reference spectral measurements were made by undergraduate chemistry students as part of the outreach and training components of the grant. The data from the test panels allowed identification of unique spectral features that could be used to identify and map the various paint binders used by artists (Figure 5).     An example of the mapping and identification of specific paint binders includes the analysis of one of Jackson PollockÆs most famous drip paintings, Number 1, 1950 (Lavender Mist), in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. The hyperspectral NIR reflectance imaging revealed that Jackson Pollock used at a minimum oil-based paints and alkyd resin-based paints to make Lavender Mist.  The results also showed that he chose two off-white paints having similar color but different drying properties to make his famous "drips" at different stages of the painting.  This can be seen in the image maps of the two binders in Figure 6.  These results show the earlier "drips" were done with the faster drying alkyd paint and the final "drips" done with the slower drying oil paint.     The research project involved supporting and training a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student in the George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science.  Also, undergraduate chemistry students from two colleges (GW, Washington and Lee) participated in this interdisciplinary research project and had the opportunity to travel and work with scientists in Italy.  This NSF grant has resulted in 12 published papers to date, some of which document new findings related to paintings or works of paper in the National Gallery of ArtÆs collection. Several invited lectures were presented at national and international scientific and conservation science meetings. In addition, the first-ever international meeting about chemical imaging of works of art was organized and held at the National Gallery of Art in September 2015.
