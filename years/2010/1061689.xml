<AbstractNarration>The project will investigate whether the compound-specific isotope signature of amino acids in deep-sea proteinaceous corals can be used to interpret changes in the upper ocean ecosystem and its biogeochemical cycling. As these corals feed on particulate material (POM) derived from the surface they potentially can be used to deconvolute the factors that combine to drive bulk isotope change, and may provide an important expansion of proxy tools for examining longer-term changes in ocean productivity and particulate production and cycling. It is hypothesized that the compound-specific analysis can indicate both the average trophic position of exported POM as well as original signature at the base of food webs, creating independent records of both factors. Additionally, it is proposed that the results will allow a measure of relative microbial alteration, and a direct record of the average C signature of exported production. An archived set of proteinaceous coral (Gerardia) samples from contrasting regions of the subtropical North Pacific Ocean  will be analyzed and the information used to construct records of trophic structure, and C and N signatures at the base of the food webs over 100-2000 years. Such information will allow examination of the validity of current interpretations from bulk isotope records, as well as provide additional details. The research will develop and validate a potentially important paleoceanographic tool using proteinaceous coral archives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific merits and broader impacts of the project are clear and far-reaching, and will impact not only Chemical Oceanography but also the other branches of the marine community. The approach could be generalized and used to understand different processes and ecosystems once it has been properly demonstrated.  The project will train a graduate student and will involve additional training of undergraduates and has an additional outreach component.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The subtropical gyres are approximately 40% of the oceanÃ†s surface, and the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) represents the largest gyre in the world and one of the largest contiguous biomes on Earth (fig 1).  Historically gyres have been perceived as desolate deserts due to their remoteness and low dissolved nutrient concentrations. However, the last three decades of detailed ocean observations have lead to a re-evaluation of this historical paradigm, showing that gyres are far more dynamic systems, in terms of nutrient dynamics, export production, and ultimately the role of oligotrophic gyres on ocean biogeochemistry and the carbon cycle. Further, although the overall primary productivity (how much inorganic carbon is converted to algal/carbon biomass, and ultimately removed from the atmosphere) is lower than coastal regions, the sheer size of the ocean gyres means that they are main components of global new production, and also the transport and remineralization at depth of carbon and other nutrients.  While we now know the ocean gyres are not only critical to global balances, and also rapidly changing, a major challenge is moving beyond the limits of the "instrumental period" (today to the late 1800s), to understand how these systems have been changing over much longer timescales.  To do this requires data that can only be derived from natural archives. Sediment cores provide long records, however in the central ocean basins there is a major problem: temporal resolution is limited by both bioturbation and low sedimentation rates. This means we cannot use sediments in most the gyres to understand changes in the last few hundred to thousand years- a critical period in planetary change.  This project was focused on developing a new way to reconstruct detailed gyre changes:  using long-lived proteinaceous corals as detailed biogenic "archives" in the deep sea, to determine centuries to millennia variability, at very detailed resolution. Kulamanamana haumeaae is a cosmopolitan colonial zoanthid that forms tree-like structures with heights of several meters and basal attachment diameters up to a few 10s of cm (fig 2). They have radial growth rates of &lt;100&mu;m-yr-1 and can attain Ã¦life spansÃ† of centuries to millennia.  Isotopic analysis of the polyps, the animals that compose the colonial organism and make the skeleton, indicate that these organisms feed primarily on marine snow &ndash; sinking phytoplankton detritus and fecal matter of surface dwelling zooplankton.  The chemical and isotopic information is then locked into the skeleton. Proteinaceous corals thus essentially act as "living sediment traps," recording POM fluxes from the surface over centennial to millennial time scales.  We collected a small number of live Ku. haumeaae and a larger number of fossil specimens from the main Hawaiian Islands (Oahu, Big Island) and heading out towards the Northern Hawaiian Islands (French Frigate Shoals) using DSRVs (http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HURL/) (fig 3).  We sectioned them into disks a centimeter thick.  Just like with a tree, the outermost edge of the coral skeleton is the most recent and the innermost portion is the oldest, and we sampled them in that way. To put our data on a timescale we determined used radiocarbon (14C) (https://cams.llnl.gov/).    We have developed detailed bulk and compound-specific amino acid 15N and 13C records over the last ~ 1200 years which have lead to the following two key findings:  1) The instrumental observations (last few decades) which document an increase in nitrogen fixation in support of primary production, and an expansion of the NPSG respectively, are really part of a much longer centennial scale trend that began at the end of the Little Ice Age (~1850), and which may have accelerated during the industrial era.  2) Our results reveal two major regime shifts in plankton community composition over the past millennium, broadly corresponding to large-scale northern hemisphere clima...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
