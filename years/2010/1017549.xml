<AbstractNarration>The anticipated opening up of white space by the FCC for unlicensed&lt;br/&gt;use has created exciting new opportunities.  It also presents unique&lt;br/&gt;challenges: (i) it requires accurate wide-band spectrum sensing&lt;br/&gt;technique to avoid interfering with primary users, and (ii) it needs&lt;br/&gt;dynamic spectrum sharing in heterogeneous setting both within networks&lt;br/&gt;and across networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a holistic approach for spectrum sensing to&lt;br/&gt;address spatio-temporal variability and spectrum sharing among&lt;br/&gt;multiple secondary users and networks in white space.  In particular,&lt;br/&gt;it first develops efficient and accurate spectrum sensing techniques&lt;br/&gt;that simultaneously exploit time- and frequency-domain features,&lt;br/&gt;sparsity in active transmitters, and temporal and spatial locality in&lt;br/&gt;the transmissions. Second, it studies the cost and benefits of sharing&lt;br/&gt;network state in a heterogeneous network where different nodes have&lt;br/&gt;different information views. Third, it studies spectrum sharing across&lt;br/&gt;networks (e.g., CSMA/MaxWeight, TDMA/CSMA co-located networks). It&lt;br/&gt;develops algorithms and studies performance and fairness both with&lt;br/&gt;implicit sharing (i.e., no state-exchange) and with explicit sharing&lt;br/&gt;of information across networks. Fourth, it proposes a ground-up design&lt;br/&gt;for white space that leverages random CDMA-like codes for spectrum&lt;br/&gt;sharing with an OFDM physical layer that leads to a new efficient&lt;br/&gt;architecture for sharing across users and networks in white space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms, techniques, and software resulting from this research&lt;br/&gt;will help enable effective communication in white space, create new&lt;br/&gt;wireless network technologies, and deepen our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;wireless networks. The research results will be incorporated into&lt;br/&gt;networking courses and widely disseminated through conference/journal&lt;br/&gt;publications and software distribution.</AbstractNarration>
