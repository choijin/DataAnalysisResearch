<AbstractNarration>GeoGebra is free, open source dynamic mathematics software that joins interactive geometry with algebra and spreadsheet features that have striking potential for transforming STEM education in schools, mathematics and engineering departments. While GeoGebra has received several educational software awards in Europe and the USA, it has not reached its full potential for transformative influence on the American K-16 mathematics education community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, led by mathematics faculty at Ithaca College and an international group of collaborating planners, provides partial support for the First North American GeoGebra Conference, GeoGebra-NA2010, to be held July 27-28, 2010 at Ithaca College. The global mission of this conference is to build a community of mathematicians, mathematics educators, and classroom teachers who can develop the potential of GeoGebra and other similar software for transformation of mathematics instruction and curricula through creative development, practical experimentation, and research.</AbstractNarration>

The missions of these Institutes is the coordination of efforts to  improve K12 STEM education by continual professional development of local school teachers and by community building among education researchers, teachers, and mathematicians.   Following the conference, it has become clear that the professional development of teachers needs to be aligned with the new Common Core State Standards.    The conference was designed around the following themes that support innovative and effective ways of integrating GeoGebra as a free and powerful tool are planned:  Innovative Technologies for Building Models and Modeling with GeoGebra GeoGebra in the Classroom &ndash; Building and Maintaining a Resource Base of K-12``Teacher-Ready'' GeoGebra Dynamic Worksheets and Constructions  Improving GeoGebra Communicating Effective Ways of Teaching and Learning Dynamic Mathematics -Building and Maintaining a ``Community of Practice/Inquiry''   At GeoGebra-NA2010, particular emphasis was paid to the active recruitment, attendance and involvement of K-12 teachers as vital and intrinsic participants to ensure that the conference has a real and useful connection to the actual STEM education process.  Principle features of this conference was (a) the organization of discussions, demonstrations, Q\&amp;As that combine the above themes and (b) publishing these results online in an interactive wiki. The goal was to establish and maintain a continual collaboration with respect to effective practices and new ideas between K12 teachers and the designers and developers of educational materials.  Through these interactive sessions and by establishing a wiki site (geogebraithaca.wikispaces.com/) for all, the broader impact of the conference will be significantly increased so that the professors of math and math education will establish meaningful connection with teachers, all of whom will gradually integrate the new insights into their practice to enact and sustain reform in mathematics educations.  This interaction remains robust almost one year after the conference, with several (virtual) meetings having occurred.    In summary, the following outcomes were realized:  establishment of a network of K-12 teachers, professors of mathematics educators, and mathematicians via the conference wiki training more than 60 K-12 teachers in the u...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
