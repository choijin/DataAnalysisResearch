<AbstractNarration>1005303&lt;br/&gt;Mustain &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to test the hypotheses that: i) alkali earth oxides with the pyrochlore structure can selectively reduce O2 and atmospheric CO2 to CO3-2 in an alkaline electrochemical reactor; ii) operating the reactor with carbonate anions reduces the degradation of stateof- the-art anion exchange membranes compared with operation on the hydroxide cycle; and iii) H2 and methanol can be electrochemically oxidized on Pt surfaces with carbonate anions. These fundamental discoveries will allow for the development of a room temperature electrochemical reactor operating on the carbonate anionic cycle with reduced cost and increased durability compared to both the proton and hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells. In addition to producing energy, this cell also acts as a CO2 ?pump? and purification device. The anode effluent CO2 and water can be separated and either utilized in chemical processing or sequestered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this work, three pyrochlore structured (A2B2O7) oxygen reduction electrocatalysts will be tested: Ca2Pt2O7, Ca2Ru2O7 and Ca2W2O7. A calcium-based oxide was selected due to the known surface basicity of its root oxide, CaO, which will allow for the preferential adsorption of CO2 over H2O on the catalyst surface. The pyrochlore structured oxide avoids common pitfalls of alkali earth oxides, including low electronic conductivity and the formation of surface passivating species. Pt, Ru and W ?B? metals will be investigated because of their ability to activate molecular oxygen in alkaline media. The resulting catalysts will be fully characterized by SEM/EDS, XRD, BET and XPS. Pt electrocatalysts will be investigated at the anode, where two common fuels, H2 and CH3OH, will be oxidized and their kinetics examined. All electrochemical measurements will be conducted in a custom-built three electrode cell. Finally, the chemical stability and ionic conductivity of six commercially available anion exchange membranes will be investigated in the presence of both concentrated KOH and HCO3-/CO3-2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will yield information regarding surface adsorption and electron transfer behavior of the cathode oxides, information regarding electrochemical reactor design, specifically the construction, maintenance and stabilization of the electrochemical interface. Also, the PI will use the individual components to construct a laboratory scale, 5 cm2 electrochemical reactor operating on the carbonate cycle and demonstrate its performance under various operating conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational objective is to establish a teaching and learning chain related to electrochemical science and engineering within the PI?s group at the University of Connecticut. This will: i) involve an undergraduate student in the research activities; ii) train a graduate student; iii) permit hands-on research in the PI?s laboratory for a Hartford Public School secondary school teacher through the NSF-sponsored Joules-Fellows program at the University of Connecticut; and iv) disseminate the scientific advances in archival journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and educational activities will enhance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning across multiple levels. Also, the results could have far reaching impact on many important systems including: fuel cells, batteries, heterogeneous transesterfication of oils for biodiesel, electrochemically assisted carbon sequestration, reduction of nitrous oxides in automotive pollution prevention and water treatment and electrolysis. Success in this regard could catalyze a transformative shift in philosophy regarding electrochemical energy generation devices, renew public, private and legislative support for alternative energy technologies and yield a cost-effective, environmentally green energy source with the potential for a net negative CO2 footprint for the 21st century and beyond.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Objective  The overall goal of this project was to demonstrate operation of a brand new type of fuel cell, the Room Temperature Carbonate Fuel Cell.  The operating principle of this device is shown in the attached figure.  This fuel cell was designed to address the limitations of existing fuel cell types, namely by: i) reducing cost through the use of non-Platinum catalysts and off-the-shelf membranes; and ii) increasing performance durability by eliminating common degradation mechanisms, which was achieved by reducing the system pH.     Intellectual Merit  In short, this project was successful in each of its planned tasks and contributed to the broader scientific community in several ways.  First, a brand new catalyst material, Ca2Ru2O7, was invented, which is able to convert O2 and CO2 into CO3-2 at room temperature with high efficiency (&gt;90%); this is the first time this has ever been shown.  To make this material a new synthesis method was also developed.  This study also showed that the carbonate anions provide a very stable environment for the commercially-available membrane electrolytes, which led to stable fuel cell performance.  Finally, oxidation of hydrogen with carbonate was studied and shown to be even more efficient than processes and a fundamental mechanism for this phenomenon was proposed.      Broader Impact  From an educational perspective, the results of work yielded several tangible products.  First, this work is featured in several peer-reviewed articles and has been shared publically at several national and international conferences.  In fact, this work won first prize in the Materials poster session at the Annual Meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in 2010.  Also, 2 Ph.D. students and 6 undergraduate students at the University of Connecticut were trained through this grant.  Finally, in Summer 2010, our group housed a local high school teacher whose experience was transitioned into a classroom module for his students, which included hand-on experience and a video.  From a scientific perspective, the findings of this work are directly applicable to the fields of materials science, CO2 capture and sequestration, energy and green technology development, environmental engineering and catalysis, to name a few       Last Modified: 08/30/2011       Submitted by: William Mustain]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
