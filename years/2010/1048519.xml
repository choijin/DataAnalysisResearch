<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Directorate for Education and&lt;br/&gt;Human Resources Programs and the AAAS International Office are proposing to implement a&lt;br/&gt;project call Mentoring Women in International Research Collaborations (MWIRC) in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to foster the participation of U.S. female scientists and engineers&lt;br/&gt;in international science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research and&lt;br/&gt;education collaborations. This project will increase the knowledge and understanding of&lt;br/&gt;STEM faculty and their mentees in regards to developing, implementing, and planning&lt;br/&gt;international research and education collaborations. In particular, this project will help STEM&lt;br/&gt;faculty better understand international research priorities, resources for planning and&lt;br/&gt;developing international research collaborations, and guidelines for U.S. STEM researchers&lt;br/&gt;traveling and conducting research abroad.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) developed and implemented a project with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) "Mentoring Women in International Research Collaborations (MWIRC) in STEM". The project aimed at fostering participation of U.S. female scientists and engineers, from Minority-Serving Institutions, in international science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research and education collaborations. The project provided fifteen travel awards allowing participants to complete research in STEM, with collaborators from a variety of countries. Research projects engaged multi-disciplinary teams, several collaborators from United States and foreign countries, and both graduate and undergraduate students.  The project responded to the critical need for providing U.S. female faculty and students in STEM, at Minority-Serving Institutions, with international research opportunities because of the fact that most problems we are trying to solve as a nation have global implications and lessons-learned.   Intellectual Merit  The project aimed to increase the intellectual merit of US researchers through their collaboration with international partners on problems that are global in nature and to provide an understanding of challenges and solutions from the knowledge of researchers in other countries. The project provided funding to Minority-Serving Institutions to support U.S female Faculty, who are typically underrepresented in their opportunity to establish international research collaborations. Believing that many solutions will come from international STEM research collaborations the project also aimed to increase interest in global research. Participants were required to engage graduate students and/or post-doctoral scholars, and they were encouraged to include multiple collaborators from United States and foreign countries. Participants benefited also from activities and resources addressing topics of planning and implementing international collaborations. The project provided unique opportunities for collaborating and sharing knowledge and lessons learned in international research.  Broader Impacts  The entire project was aimed at broadening the participation of people not usually given the opportunity to complete international research collaborations in their fields of study. The activities included:  travel awards for female STEM faculty at Minority-serving institutions online activities and resources focused on international collaborations online platforms dedicated to international research for awardees, their students and collaborators recruitment strategies to reach underrepresented minority female faculty, researchers and students.   An external evaluation indicated the direct positive impact of international research collaborations on the career advancement of female faculty and their students. It also highlighted the important impact of international research on student commitment to STEM research careers. Further it provided an opportunity to create sustainable international collaborations between institutions in United States and other countries in order to advance research outcomes.  The project allowed all participants and collaborators to substantially increase their understanding of the benefits of doing international work. Feedback from the evaluation indicated that the grantees accomplished the following:     a high number of co-authored publications in U.S. and foreign journals additional funding acquired to support research projects new patents enrichment and creation of curricula and seminars based on collaboration outcomes development of exchange programs creating sustainable collaborations building the skill-set of grantees through providing the opportunity and assistance to solve the unexpected consequences of collaborating internationally creating better faculty providing students with research collaboration opportunities   Overall, the project enhan...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
