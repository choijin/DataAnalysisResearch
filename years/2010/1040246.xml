<AbstractNarration>1040246&lt;br/&gt;Fini&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding for a high pressure reactor, a pressurized blister test and an optical Wilhelmy device to produce bio-adhesives through chemical modification and polymerization of bio-oil obtained from hydrothermal processing of swine manure. Swine manure will be converted to biomonomers by hydrolysis and then further converted by chemical synthesis to biodegradable polymers like polylactic acid. Preliminary results showed hydrothermal processing of swine manure can be used to produce bio-adhesive; however, due to its low viscosity and shear modulus, the resultant adhesive can only be used as partial replacement for petroleum based adhesives. To engineer bio-adhesive to be used as a stand alone adhesive further processing is needed. To do so, vacuum distillation and chemical processing followed by polymerization of bio-adhesive will be used to develop adhesives with desired mechanical and rheological properties for applications in construction and packaging industries. Therefore, the 5.3 million tons of swine manure produced in the U.S. annually can supply around four million barrels of bio-adhesive to be used in construction of joints in concrete panels, adhesive anchorage systems, highway and airport asphalt pavements, roofing, industrial carpeting, packaging, installation of highway delineators, and soil stabilization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As part of the project a bio-adhesive technology was developed to convert swine manure to a construction adhesive for use in pavement and roofing applications. The study results showed that a bio-adhesive with specific rheological and adhesion characteristics could be produced which is very durable and environmentally friendly.  Use of the bio-adhesive in conjunction with bituminous asphalt in paving construction for instance showed pavement resistance to low temperature cracking and water damage could be improved.  Another significant observation was that the introduction of 5% bio-adhesive allowed as much as a 30% increase in use of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) from old road pavements (allowed for increase of RAP percentage from 15% to 45%) without compromising cracking resistance, as evidenced by nearly the same fracture energy in both of the aforementioned scenarios. When 10% bio-adhesive was introduced, the performance of a mixture with 45% RAP was nearly as good as the virgin mix. These in turn can lead to significant savings in pavement construction cost while reducing pavements carbon footprint.  Accordingly, the project outcomes offer a unique approach to develop a renewable construction adhesive, sequester carbon which otherwise will be released in form of methane when manure decays in lagoons and storage facilities while creating a source of revenue for farmers and create new jobs for production and application of bio-adhesives.
