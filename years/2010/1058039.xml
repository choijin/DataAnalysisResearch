<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to implement a scholarship program to benefit students majoring in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Engineering, Physics, Mathematics, and Geological Sciences. It is increasing the retention of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students through completion of an Associate of Science degree and entry into the workforce or transfer to a four-year institution.  Cohort based special activities, faculty mentoring, and focused counseling help students succeed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to provide: &lt;br/&gt;(a) Scholarships for students who demonstrate academic potential and financial need. &lt;br/&gt;(b) Cohort-based enrichment activities for scholarship recipients to increase engagement in introductory science and math coursework and subsequent retention in a STEM major. &lt;br/&gt;(c) Scholarship recipients with counseling, faculty mentoring, and referrals to tutoring, transfer services, career guidance, and other services as needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The program includes an emphasis on mentoring and enrichment activities for participating students, particularly focusing on increasing mathematics skills and helping students connect mathematics skills to other STEM disciplines. The program facilitates stronger relationships between faculty and students, providing faculty with student feedback to improve teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The scholarship program is providing an economic resource for STEM students at the college, of whom 83% are Hispanic, 40% are women, and 75% are economically disadvantaged. These students often struggle to maintain full-time enrollment and complete their studies. This program provides students with financial and academic resources to help them succeed.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In Fall 2011, the El Paso Community College (EPCC) &nbsp;S-STEM program was awarded a total of $596,546.00 from NSF to provide financial support for students in the form of scholarships where students could take advantage of services such as Career Counseling/Job Placement, Community Building, participation of STEM related Professional Meetings/Conferences/Seminars, field trips, and mentoring opportunities to enhance and promote student interest and success in the Biology, Physics, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics fields.</p> <p>The EPCC S-STEM program originally planned to provide at least 24 scholarships for a maximum of two years per student for a period of 5 years. These scholarships had a maximum of $8,400.00 per year, subject to the student participant's financial needs among other requirements.</p> <p>With a one-year no cost extension, during the 2016-2017 cohort, the EPCC S-STEM program concluded by designing semester-long projects and activities such as cleaning of the Rio Grande River in coordination with the IBWC (International Boundaries of Water Commission) in a water conservation and research study, El Paso POWER Program (Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization), Web Designing and programming in collaboration with the Programming and Information Technology (IT) department from EPCC, Water Desalination and Renewable Energy project in coordination with the New Mexico State University (NMSU) department of Waste Management Education and Research Consortium &amp; Institute of Energy and the Environment (WERC/IEE), a Biology Sustainability Program from EPCC, a Programming and Robotics project in collaboration with University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), a Biodiversity, a Physics and Chemistry project designed to spike student interest in related fields. &nbsp;With contributions from our institution and a total cost of $618,909.00, the EPCC S-STEM program served a total of 79 students from which 49&nbsp;took advantage of services throughout their 2-year student life.</p> <p>The EPCC S-STEM program is proud to report that participating students received course tutoring and focused counseling, found employment opportunities or internships with local companies, other nationally recognized organizations such as NASA and Boeing, and/or successfully transitioned to various 4-year colleges, earning other scholarship opportunities due to learned skills, leadership, and networking
