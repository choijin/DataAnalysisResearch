<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funding to the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) to support the attendance of students and postdocs in geosciences, engineering, computer science, physics, chemistry, ecology, biological sciences, and social, behavioral and economic sciences at the SACNAS National Conference. The conference will take place in Anaheim, California, September 30- October 3, with a central theme of "Science, Technology and Diversity for a Sustainable Future." The conference is in partnership with the Society of Mexican American Engineers and Scientists (MAES). There will be over 30 scientific symposia and more than 35 professional development sessions. At the conference, students and postdocs will be able to interact with role models and mentors, participate in professional development activities, network, and develop leadership skills. One of the central activities of the conference is the presentation of research projects. Prior to the meeting, students submit abstracts that describe their investigations and these abstracts are reviewed by scientists who provide constructive criticism. At the meeting, the presentations are judged by professionals who provide input on the investigation itself and the quality of the presentation. Another important component of the SACNAS conference is mentoring of the students and postdocs by scientists and professionals. Mentors from different disciplines are recruited prior to the meeting; at the start of the conference, there are mentoring orientation sessions; and during the conference there are structured opportunities for the mentors to interact with the students, like conversations with scientists and networking lunches. Student and postdoc participation at the SACNAS National Conference will contribute to the goals of the organization: to foster equal participation in and benefit from STEM research across all segments of the population including members of underrepresented groups, and to faciliate adequate supply of STEM researchers to meet the needs of a nation whose workforce is becoming increasingly diverse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by contributions from the Office of Integrative Activities, Directorate of Engineering, Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, Division of Environmental Biology, and Division of Earth Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
