<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12) "Threading Flavones through the Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratory Curriculum" is a project led by the Georgia Institute of Technology in collaboration with a variety of other colleges and universities to develop a model for the integration of learning across the chemistry laboratory curriculum.  A set of interconnected learning activities called "threads" are being developed and implemented in laboratory courses from the sophomore to senior levels. Flavones are the central class of molecules for this proof-of-concept study because students can learn about their chemical diversity, relevant synthesis, biological reactivity, and interesting chemical properties in appropriate laboratory courses throughout the curriculum. This project is testing the hypothesis that teaching undergraduate chemistry using "threads" will promote: (i) retention of key concepts throughout the curriculum, (ii) critical thinking, (iii) technical skills development, (iv) collaborative problem solving, and (v) appreciation of the relevancy of chemical concepts to human health. Incorporation of "threads" throughout the curriculum is placing the practice of science in a new perspective for many undergraduate students, allowing them to retain more content from previous classes and improving their overall engagement in the learning experience. Two of the major benefits of this project are the preparation of a database of educational resources, particularly for institutions that lack costly, major instrumental facilities such as mass spectrometers and NMRs, and three faculty development workshops to aid in the dissemination of this project to other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

In the Threading Flavones project, six experiments were adapted and implemented into three upper division laboratory courses: Synthesis Laboratory I (CHEM 2380, a sophomore-level organic synthesis course), Synthesis Laboratory II (CHEM 3380, a junior-level organic and inorganic synthesis course), and Biochemistry Laboratory II (CHEM 4582, a senior-level biochemistry course). Flavonoids that were synthesized by undergraduates in the sophomore and junior level courses were tested by students for their structure and chemical properties including mass, melting point, IR spectrum, and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of the dry product. Student-synthesized flavonoids were then donated to seniors in Biochemistry Laboratory II for testing their biological activity. Specifically, students investigated the impact of commercial vs. student-synthesized flavonoids on the activity of a signal transduction enzyme called Protein Kinase C (PKC). (Elevated levels of PKC are indicators of cancer.) Students also docked structures of flavonoids into PKC using free software (AutoDock Vina) in order to hypothesize structure-function correlations.
