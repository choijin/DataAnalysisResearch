<AbstractNarration>This program will study quasar outflows to test the evolutionary paradigm that links quasars and supermassive black holes to their host galaxies.   This will be accomplished via observational and theoretical work on quasar accretion disk outflows that will derive the kinematics, densities, ionization levels, and driving mechanisms of the flows.    Elemental abundances in quasar environments will also be addressed, as will the relationship between quasars and host galaxy evolution via use of submillimeter-wavelength measurements.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include research training of undergraduate and graduate students, implementation of a clicker system of classroom response for introductory classes, and public lectures.</AbstractNarration>
