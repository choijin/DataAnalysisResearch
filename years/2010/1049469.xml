<AbstractNarration>This project provides partial travel fellowships to students enrolled in U.S. &lt;br/&gt;universities in order to facilitate their attending the 2010 International &lt;br/&gt;Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) held November 7-11, 2010 in Shanghai, China. ISWC &lt;br/&gt;is a major international forum where visionary and state-of-the-art research on &lt;br/&gt;all aspects of the Semantic Web is presented. Priority will be given to students&lt;br/&gt; selected to participate in the doctoral consortium, followed by students who are &lt;br/&gt;first author on a paper accepted at the conference, followed by students who have &lt;br/&gt;other authorship on a conference or related workshop paper. The purpose of this &lt;br/&gt;project is to allow students to share their research ideas, receive constructive &lt;br/&gt;feedback, and develop connections that will enhance their research careers. The &lt;br/&gt;project is expected to support between 10 and 15 students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information can be found at the web page:&lt;br/&gt;http://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/travel-awards</AbstractNarration>
