<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a program to utilize uranium tetrafluoride (DUF4), a processed byproduct from the creation of nuclear energy, to create SF4, SF6, and NF3.  SF4 and SF6 would be created by mixing DUF4 with sulfur oxides and halides (and oxygen for SF6) at varying temperatures, pressures, and stoichiometries.  In addition, the generated SF4 would be mixed at varying temperatures, pressures, and stoichiometries with NOF to try to create NF3.  A two-step process to create NF3 with SF4, NH3, and fluorine will also be performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project will be the expansion of a market for nuclear waste by-products that is currently insufficient to utilize the existing supply of nuclear waste.  By expanding the market, the potential to expand the nuclear power industry might be more palatable.</AbstractNarration>
