<AbstractNarration>With more than 300,000 species found across almost every life zone on Earth, plants play a pivotal role in the lives of all organisms on this planet. However, the vast majority of plant species are only found in Earth's equatorial belt. This phenomenon, known as the latitudinal diversity gradient, is poorly understood although recent investigations have identified several key hypotheses. In this project, the PI's will employ direct tests of the main prediction from these hypotheses:  that rates of species diversification differ predictably with distance from the equator. This hypothesis will be tested using an exceptionally diverse and ecologically significant group of plants: the sedges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will address how interactions between diversification, geographic contingency, and ecological adaptation have generated current patterns of diversity in plants. This research has the potential to dramatically change the way that society thinks about the evolution of biodiversity, and the conclusions will substantially advance understanding of the processes that generate it. These results will have tangible scientific value to all researchers studying biodiversity, evolutionary ecology, or any aspect of sedge biology. The PI's will also promote teaching, training, and learning in the public community at large during the course of this research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, researchers from Washington State University worked to better understand how species diversity is distributed across the continents - particularly between the tropics and temperate zones.  This research used the large family of palnts known as sedges (Cyperaceae) to study these patterns using a novel method for gathering data from public databases to create large diagrams of evolutionary relationships, a method known as supermatrix phylogeny reconstruction.   There are three primary directions in which this work has significant impact on the scientific community.  First, the researchers have developed considerably better supported phylogenies of sedges that have been previously published. These data will be of high utility to any taxonomists working within this globally diverse and important family. These impacts are straightforward: improvements to our understanding of evolutionary relationships allow interested researchers to take advantage of our findings in order to develop better hypotheses about the processes that underlie sedge evolution. In addition, these phylogenies are of high utility for downstream evolutionary analysis addressing community composition, the evolution of regional floras, and inquiry into geographic processes of plant diversification, particularly because Cyperaceae constitute a diverse component of a majority of the planet's regional floras.
