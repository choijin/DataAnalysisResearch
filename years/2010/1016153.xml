<AbstractNarration>This project will provide a more comprehensive description of the structure, characteristics, and development of the stable boundary layer (SBL) and transitional atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).  Both conceptual and computational challenges inherent in the proper representation of SBL conditions will be confronted.  Researchers will use a combination of large-eddy simulation (LES) computer models, virtual and real wind profilers, and virtual and real sodars.  Specific foci will include the transition from nighttime to daytime boundary layer conditions, generation of turbulence near the surface, and formation/development of low-level jets.  The modeling and observational tasks will encompass (1) modifying an existing LES code to include the appropriate subgrid closure schemes to simulate stably stratified SBL conditions and transitional (morning and evening) regimes in the ABL; (2) developing a virtual sodar capable of probing the output fields of the LES and generating realistic data streams suitable for algorithm development and testing relevant to actual sodar operations; (3) integrating data from LES and targeted radar/sodar observations in order to systematically study and characterize stable boundary layer flows and the transition to other ABL regimes; and (4) using data from in-situ sensors, a radar wind profiler, and a sodar to further adapt the LES code for SBL and transitional ABL cases and validate performance of the virtual sodar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this effort lies in the improvement of simulations of the stably stratified boundary layer and transitional flow regimes, which are not as mature as simulations of the convective boundary layer (CBL).  Complementary wind profiler and sodar measurements make it possible to comprehensively capture the development of the boundary layer, and when combined with LES modeling will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the effectiveness and applicability of both LES and other means of characterizing the CBL, SBL and transitions between the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work include the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, including a connection to an existing Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU-Site) program at the University of Oklahoma, with emphasis on student exposure to modern instrumentation.  Improved techniques for observing and simulating atmospheric conditions in the lowest layers of the atmosphere will potentially benefit user communities in agriculture, civil and commercial aviation, and renewable energy generation.  Enhanced exchange between scientific (e.g., meteorological) and engineering (e.g., instrument design) disciplines will be promoted.</AbstractNarration>

Simulation of the unstable convective boundary layer (CBL) and neutral boundary layer has definitely been a success story.   The accurate simulation of the atmospheric SBL, on the other hand, is still associated with significant conceptual and computational challenges.  Conditions associated with the SBL and its transition from night-time to daytime conditions (ABL transitions) are closely coupled to the transport, mixing, and formation of atmospheric pollutants, the formation of low-level jets (LLJs), and similar phenomena. See Fig. 1 for a depiction the ABL and its transitions.  This project has focussed on the systematic investigation of the SBL and ABL transitions through coupled numerical and observational techniques.  In particular, the study has facilitated an examination of the turbulence structure of the atmospheric flow near the surface, dispersion under stable and transitional conditions, and the formation and development of LLJs in the ABL.  To realize these goals we have adopted an approach that combines sodar (acoustic radar), unmanned aerials systems (UAS), capable of monitoring the atmosphere, and numerical LES.

Both virtual instruments produced simulated data streams based on atmospheric parameters taken from the LES. A representation of the sodar simulator can be seen in Fig. 2. Sample wind fields along with the sampling domain from the virtual sodar are shown in Fig. 3.  The sodar was deployed at the University of Oklahoma (OU) Kessler Atmospheric and Ecological Field Station (KAEFS) for routine monitoring of the atmosphere. During a few targeted experiments, the UAS was operated the OU KAEFS site. The LES was initialized and run to produce kinematic and thermodynamic fields corresponding to those periods. This allowed us to cross compare observations from the real and simulated sodar and real and simulated UAS and check how well they corresponded to the underlying "truth" data from the LES.  This allowed us to develop new methods of measuring atmospheric turbulence and validate some of the fundamental theories related to acoustic scatter and it relates to sodar observations.  Similarly the sodar was deployed at the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in Lamont, Oklahoma for two extended field experiments called Lower Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment (LABLE).  The UAS was not operated. The DOE ARM SGP site hosts an array of atmospheric sensors, which were used during the study.

The consolidation of LES and sodar and UAS approaches has provided a unique opportunity to investigate the effectiveness and applicability of both LES and various other means of characterizing the CBL, the SBL, and transitions between the two.  These findings are anticipated to have significant impacts on SBL/CBL studies. The study has also helped to usher in improvements to LES code for stably stratified boundary layers and extend our understanding of low-level jets and interactions between the shear and buoyancy turbulence generation/suppression mechanisms in the ABL.
