<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to answer the question of why some groups are chronically under-represented in engineering degree programs.  To address this issue the PI will use narratives to understand how under-represented engineering students describe interactions with their educational institutions and what institutional factors affect persistence and success.  The project will develop and then disseminate tools based on "personas" and "informance" to help policy makers learn how institutions can evolve to better address and support the experiences of under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to provide new insights into the perplexing and persistent program of low representation of some groups in engineering degree programs.  The PI plans to focus on both primarily white institutions and also minority serving institutions to address questions on structural differences using a narrative approach.  Should the project be successful, it will inform policy decisions within engineering schools and potentially at other higher education administrative level as well.  The project thus has potential broad impact both on the knowledge base used to make decisions and practice.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>American organizations, from the federal government down to individual companies, universities, schools, and service organizations, have been concerned about how women and men of color and white women participate in engineering in smaller proportions than they are in the general population.&nbsp; There is a considerable amount of research that investigates why this continues to be the case but focuses on what so-called "deficiencies" these populations exhibit compared to the majority population of engineers, white men. This existing research is problematic for multiple reasons. First, it does not sufficiently incorporate existing theory about the concepts of gender and race themselves (including intersectionality theory, which says one has to study the experience of gender and race together, not as independent variables but as integrated identities). In part, this is because the numbers of people of color are so small and most research uses statistical measures, which require larger numbers to make conclusions. Second, it directs our collective attention away from how gender and race can be "baked in" to the structure of institutions themselves and focuses our attention on changing minoritized populations to behave more like majority populations. This perpetuates a cultural sense that being "male" and "white" is the default and normal and that minoritized populations must shed their other racial and gender identities to be able to become successful engineers.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project instead focused on engineering education contexts to help researchers learn from small numbers of study participants. Finding ways to learn from small numbers is important as small numbers of white women and women and men of color is what we have in undergraduate engineering education. To this end, we developed a method of interviewing that allowed us to hear participants' stories of how they came to be "where you are" in their undergraduate engineering education in their own words and delivery, and also allowed us to learn about how gender and race structure the "ruling relations" of institutions. Ruling relations is a concept borrowed from sociology that says that the social relations that allow people to function smoothly in a given institution (like "higher education" rather than a specific organization, like a specific university) are structured in ways which primarily serve the institution's interests over those who participate in them. The stories we collected were rich, detailed, full of emotion and lessons learned, and helped the research team see how 4-year universities subtly maintain their engineering programs as white, male spaces. The stories also prompted us to learn how to systematically analyze transcripts other than by coding them in two ways. First, we developed experience in narrative methods to learn from both <em>what</em> participants tell us and <em>how</em> they tell it to us. Second, with other researchers, we developed the concept of "ethical validation," a way that assessed interpretive research quality which allowed us to improve the quality of the research we were doing while "doing justice" to the data participants shared with us. We strived to make data do as much work as they could on behalf of participants, and we have catalyzed a discussion on alternative ways to publish and present the results from narrative studies in engineering education.</p> <p>Despite the completion of funding, the project is still in the process of producing research findings. A key concept is how designing institutional structures from more people's shapes of lives than just white men's lives will also make minoritized engineering student more successful in undergraduate engineering programs.
