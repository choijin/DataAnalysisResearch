<AbstractNarration>This is a CAREER award supported by the Petrology and Geochemistry, Geophysics, and Education and Human Resources programs from the Division of Earth Sciences in cooperation with the Americas Program of the Office of International Sciences and Engineering.  This proposed CAREER research and education project is focused on advancing our understanding of eruption dynamics using novel seismological modeling and data-acquisition approaches and by tasking middle-school and undergraduate students, working in conjunction with graduate students, into the data acquisition aspects of the research. The principal objectives of this study and professional goals of the PI are to: 1) accelerate the adaptation of advanced seismological source modeling by researchers and monitoring networks through improving model verification and statistical analysis; 2) train a new generation of volcano seismologists who are not only proficient with fundamental seismological theory and tools, but also adept at using diverse multidisciplinary data to guide models of volcano-seismic signals; and 3) promote quantitative skills and the use of interdisciplinary data to solve problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Seismological recordings of volcanic processes are both the most abundant and the most widely data sets used by volcano monitoring agencies for real-time assessment of the volcanic hazard. But, except for only a very few cases, seismic data are underused. Advanced waveform-modeling tools have been available for decades and are in use by only a small group of volcano seismologists because of some specific challenges. The use of waveform modeling will benefit from comprehensively and systematically exploring the effects of small-scale structure and attenuation on synthetic Green?s functions and source inversions derived from them. The investigator will build on his recent experience in monitoring open-vent volcanic processes in Guatemala (Fuego and Santiaguito) that indicate that coupling measurements of tilt along with broadband seismic data allows for determining the effect tilt, especially on very-long-period waveforms. Moreover, simultaneously collecting infrasound data and monitoring SO2 emissions for will allow for joint interpretations of multiple data sets that have not been possible before. Ultimately this work will push waveform modeling of volcano seismic signals into wider use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research advancements will be made in conjunction with educational activities that will enhance the teaching and learning skills of a spectrum of students involved in this work, ranging from middle-school science students, undergraduates and Ph.D. and M.S. students. This work will promote increased interdisciplinary volcanological knowledge, especially among graduate students and foster the use of quantitative data in eighth grade Earth science curricula at 6 schools. This project will use active recruitment and mentoring activities to enhance the participation of minority undergraduate students in both volcano seismology and earthquake seismology research. This work will also enhance the hazard mitigation capacity of developing countries. The scientific advances will influence not only volcano seismology, but also the field of earthquake seismology, where some of the same obstacles to source modeling exist.</AbstractNarration>
