<AbstractNarration>This project will improve computational methods for studying variations in transit lightcurves in exoplanet systems. A planet is said to transit its host star when it passes in front of the star as viewed from the Earth. Transits manifest themselves as small, periodic reductions in the brightness of the star. In this project, Dr. Nesvorny will explore two types of transit lightcurve variations (TLV), including variations in the central time of the transit lightcurve (TTV, or transit time variation), and in the duration of the transit (TDV, or transit duration variation). Such studies can in principle reveal perturbations to the observed transiting planet caused by other planets in the system. TLV programs are a promising way of detecting planets not easily seen by any other planet-detection techniques, including Earth-like planets. Dr. Nesvorny will develop a new planet-detection method that has a capability of significantly advancing exoplanet detection. The new method relies on monitoring TLVs of known transiting exoplanets. Additional planets can be inferred from TLVs by their gravitational interactions with the transiting planet. He will use the new method to: (i) identify the detectability limits of planets from TLVs; (ii) estimate the measurement precision required for unique characterization of planetary systems; and (iii) determine the optimal observing strategy for transit observations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method developed here can be used to search for planets through TLV signals, estimate the measurement accuracies needed for such detections, and to determine the best observational strategies. The proposed work will thus increase the scientific outcome from satellite projects such as CoRoT and Kepler. Dr. Nesvorny also plans collaborations with staff at Denver Museum of Nature and Science to distribute the results from this study to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ More than a 150 years ago, before Neptune was ever sighted in the  night sky, French mathematician Urbain Le  Verrier predicted the planet's existence based on small deviations in  the motion of Uranus. In a paper published in the journal  Science, a group of researchers led by Dr. David Nesvorny  of Southwest Research Institute has inferred another unseen planet, this   time orbiting a distant star, marking the first success of this  technique outside the solar system.  Using a laborious computational method to assess the effects of  gravity, known as gravitational perturbation theory, Le Verrier argued  in  favor of Neptune's existence and predicted the position of this hidden  world to within an arc degree, as later detected directly by Johann  Galle of the Berlin Observatory.   Download Image  Using Kepler Telescope transit data of planet "b",  scientists predicted that a second planet "c" about the mass of Saturn  orbits the distant star KOI-872. This research, led by Southwest  Research  Institute and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, is  providing evidence of an orderly arrangement of planets orbiting  KOI-872, not  unlike our own solar system.         "Today's telescopes are detecting planets around distant stars, and  NASA's Kepler Telescope, launched in 2009, is a champion among them,"  says  Nesvorny.  It finds planets by continuously monitoring the brightness of  more than 150,000 stars, searching for brief periods of time, known  as transits, when a star appears fainter because it is obscured by a  planet passing in the foreground. But there's a twist.  "For a planet following a strictly Keplerian orbit around its host  star, the spacing, timing and other properties of the observed transit  light   curve should be unchanging in time," said Dr. David Kipping of the  Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and second author of the  paper.   "Several effects, however, can produce deviations from the Keplerian  case so that the spacing of the transits is not strictly periodic."  A hidden planet, for example, can distort the sequence of transits if  it gravitationally pulls on the transiting planet and delays some  transits relative to others.  As part of the Hunt for the Exomoons with Kepler (HEK) project, the  team analyzed recently released Kepler data and identified systems with  transiting planets that show transit variations indicative of hidden  companions, such as unseen moons or planets. The team identified the  Sun-like star known as KOI-872 (KOI stands for Kepler Objects of  Interest) as exceptional in that it shows transits with remarkable time  variations over two hours.  "It quickly became apparent to us that a large hidden object must be  pulling on the transiting planet," says Nesvorny.  "To put this in  context, if a bullet train arrives in a station two hours late, there  must be a very good reason for that. The trick was to find what it is."  Using Le Verrier's perturbation theory to speed up time-consuming  computer calculations of many possible configurations of planetary  orbits,  the HEK team showed that the observed variations can be best explained  by an unseen planet about the mass of Saturn that orbits the host star  every 57 days. According to the analysis, the planetary orbits are very  nearly coplanar and circular, reminiscent of the orderly arrangement  of orbits in our solar system.  The team's claim will be put to the test by Kepler's new  observations, which will track dozens of new transits of KOI-872,  comparing their  timing to published predictions.  "Whilst the principal goal of the HEK project will continue to focus  on searching for moons, this first planetary system discovered by HEK  demonstrates the unexpected discoveries possible with transit analysis,"  said Kipping.  This research was funded by the National Science Foundation.The paper,  "The Detection and Characterization of a Nontransiting  Planet by Transit Timing Variations" by Nesvorny, Kipping, La...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
