<AbstractNarration>Filters for astronomical imaging have typically admitted more or less uniformly all of the light between two wavelength extremes. However, there are instances where more complex transmission functions are highly desirable.  One such case is in the near-infrared, where terrestrial atmospheric emission arising from the molecule OH occurs in narrow bands.  Here, the background for imaging with a broadband filter could be reduced by a factor of two if the molecular lines could be selectively blocked.  Until recently, custom "tuning" of filters was not possible.  However, it is now not only practical but also a compelling technique for improving the speed of near-IR surveys.  Compared to other methods of enhancing efficiency, there is every reason to believe that such innovative imaging filters should also be inexpensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. James Rhoads of the Arizona State University proposes to carry out the development of custom infrared imaging filters, working with commercial vendors in their design and characterization for a variety of applications in astronomy.  Among the research areas that will see a qualitative benefit are a) finding the earliest galaxies and quasars, b) discovering high-redshift supernovae and characterizing dark energy, and c) identifying the lowest-mass brown dwarfs through the development of a special filter tuned to its unique near-IR spectrum. The PI will oversee the design, construction, and evaluation of these filters, and in addition provide functioning optics for use by the public on instruments operated at the National Optical Astronomy Observatories.  Furthermore, the filter prescriptions will be publicized for duplication by the entire observational astronomy community.  Funding for this work is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we set out to explore the value of innovative multi-band filters for astronomy.  Most astronomical filters are essentially pieces of colored glass, designed and built to transmit a particular color of light.  Color images of astronomical objects a are usually made by taking pictures through several such filters and combining them in software to create a color representation of the subject.  Color of light corresponds to its wavelength, and a traditional filter can be described fairly well by just two numbers, which are the wavelengths of the bluest light that the filter transmits, and the wavelength of the reddest light that the filter transmits.   Recent developments in optical coating technology have made it possible to devise filters that transmit more than one color simultaneously, while blocking the transmission of other, intermediate colors of light.  These are called multi-band filters, and an early widespread application of this technology was for fluorescence microscopy at optical wavelengths. Describing such filters requires multiple pairs of bluest and reddest wavelengths, one for each color band that the filter transmits&mdash;  up to five bands and ten numbers in the work we have done.   There are several potential astronomical applications of these technologies, but the most promising of these involve near-infrared light, and place more exacting demands on the choices of transmitted and blocked colors than the established optical microscopy applications required.   We therefore undertook to specify carefully the requirements for a near-infrared application astronomical application of these filters.  Working with an industry partner, we both specified and procured prototype near-infrared filters with five distinct transmissive bands, carefully placed between 1.0 and 1.3 micrometer wavelengths.  The bands were selected so that wavelengths where the Earth?s night sky glows brightly are blocked by the filter, while wavelengths where the night sky is comparatively dark are transmitted.   We tested these filters on two telescopes at Kitt Peak, Arizona (the NOAO 2.1m telescope and the Steward Observatory 90 inch Bok telescope), and compared the performance with a more conventional filter that spans a similar range of near-infrared wavelengths, but does not block the wavelengths where the night sky is bright.   We found that our custom filter transmitted successfully reduced the brightness of the night sky by a factor of 30, although it did so at the cost of reducing the signal from astronomical sources by a factor of about 4-5.   Analyzing spectra of the night sky taken through our filter, we believe that an even greater reduction in the night sky brightness may be possible in future.     Thus, most of the development challenges outlined in our proposal were successfully met.  We showed that a technology previously developed for optical wavelength microscopy can be transferred to the near infrared, where multi band filters can be manufactured to sufficiently exacting specifications for astronomical work.  Such filters can be included in future astronomical observatories, potentially ranging from small facilities operated by individual universities to the next generation of giant ground-based telescopes or future international space observatories.   This project afforded significant training opportunities for a diverse group of young researchers, who are now pursuing astronomy teaching and research careers in at least three different time zones.   Experience that they gained in the course of the work has also been applied in developing other astronomical filters, including one that is being used at a US telescope in Chile to identify some of the youngest galaxies yet discovered in the early history of our Universe.
