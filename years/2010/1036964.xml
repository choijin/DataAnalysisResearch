<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will increase the enrollment and retention of wounded, injured, and ill veterans in engineering programs.  Multiple interventions are planned and the project is based on social cognitive theory.  The proposed program additionally takes into account needs assessments and prior knowledge from other model programs.  The project is comprehensive; students will be exposed to role models, resources, and support systems, and additionally have a chance to explore myriad engineering career options.  If successful, this project will provide a valuable data point in characterizing engagement and retention of participants who have a strong personal stake in the careers and technologies their education program is preparing them for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project lies in its great potential for improving the accessibility of engineering and technology degree programs for wounded veterans.  The program will provide numerous opportunities for veterans that would not otherwise be available and additionally provide broad insights on effective means of engaging this group.  If successful, this project may engender systematic changes in the ways universities engage and support wounded veterans as well as the educational preparation they receive for future engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcome:  Veterans participating in the Experiential Learning for Veterans in Assistive Technology and Engineering (ELeVATE) program continue to serve our Nation by engaging in research in assistive technology and rehabilitation engineering that produces improvements in the quality of life of people with disabilities.   Impact/ Benefit:  ELeVATE students designed, prototyped, and tested a number of assistive technology devices, all of which will lead to improvements in the quality of life of people with disabilities.   Explanation:  ELeVATE is a transition program for veterans interested in pursuing post-secondary education in science, technology, and/or engineering.  Through participation in research activities, ELeVATE students have been able to contribute to a number of projects that aim to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities.  Engaging in physical activity is essential to an individualÆs well-being. ELeVATE veterans with disabilities worked on projects designed to encourage people with disabilities to be more physically active. The Throwing Chair and the Physical Activity Monitoring SystemÆs Wheel Rotation Datalogger (PAMS-DL) are two examples of such projects.  An Army veteran with a disability worked alongside his mentors to design, prototype, and test the Throwing Chair, a highly versatile assistive technology device designed to accommodate athletes with disabilities competing in events that involve throwing action (e.g., shotput, discus, javelin). The Throwing ChairÆs highly adjustable features (seat height, seat locking swivel, handle location, backrest height, leg rest location, etc.) can accommodate athletes with impairments ranging from Spinal Cord Injury, Traumatic Brain Injury and amputations. The Throwing Chair is equally suitable for novice and Paralympic athletes and can maximize performance for people of all abilities and body types.   An ELeVATE team comprised of a Marine Corps veteran with a disability, a graduate student, and an undergraduate student tested the performance of a gyroscope-based wheel rotation monitor in estimating speeds and distances travelled by manual wheelchair users and handcycle users. The team successfully demonstrated that the device can be used to monitor mobility characteristics in manual wheelchair users and thus provide feedback which can lead to a wheelchair userÆs adoption of a more active and healthy lifestyle.
