<AbstractNarration>The Center for Agricultural Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology (CABPN) will focus on developing nanotechnology platforms that can be applied to three substantially important topics requiring strong industry/academic partnerships: Agriculture, Pharmaceutical Research, and Biomedical Applications. The proposed center will be a single-university center located at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal touts advances in health care and agriculture at the confluence of biotechnology and nanotechnology in a "convergence of frontiers." The emphasis will be on taking bio-nanomedical developments from the bench to benefit agriculture and healthcare. Advances in this center are anticipated to enhance the development of vaccines for food animals, and safety of the food supply, monitoring patients in intensive care and tools to make pharmaceutical research more effective. The proposed center will enable assembly of a cohesive University0Industry alliance that will enable Industry participants to communicate their research needs to academia, to facilitate collaboration between companies in different market spaces, and to train graduate students as effective future leaders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fostering cooperation between the hard core nanotechnology practitioners (mostly coming out of electronics and materials departments) and those in agriculture, biomedicine, and pharma could provide a cross-discipline platform on which to stir the intellectual melting pot and generate innovative solutions. Should CABPN succeed in transitioning the tools of nanotechnology to commercial use in these unrelated fields while gaining synergies from their interaction at the center, it could be a real driver for commercial innovation. Success could produce jobs and improve the life of the nation. CABPN has planned an active role in mentoring students and has incorporated them into its overall plan. The proposed Center has a system for outreach to minorities to foster training in nanotechnology to the widest group of individuals possible, and plans to have meetings within the I/UCRC framework to widely disseminate the technologies within the staff of the I/UCRC as well as partnering organizations. Publication of works is also planned and the PI has a path to publication that takes into account the commercial interests of the partner organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Center for Innovative Instrumentation Technology has connected nanotechnology-based sensing techniques to catalyze groundbreaking advances in biomedical, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and food industry sectors.  Biomedical advances include point-of care monitoring for intravenously delivered drugs, gene delivery, and integrated-circuit microfluidic biosensors for point-of-care blood analysis.  Pharmaceutical advances developed by the center include counterfeit drug detection using an inexpensive smart phone cradle, which is being deployed in Africa where 25% of drugs are counterfeit.  Agricultural advances include real-time analysis of soil conditions and rapid measurement of soybean protein and oil analysis, which may lead to a shift in soybean commodity pricing, based on quality and not just weight.  Food safety advances include a microfluidic chip developed to determine if live bacteria exists in chicken wash.  The application of low-cost, highly accurate nanotechnology-based biosensing tools, when combined with mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets, will transform medicine, food science, and agriculture.  Several critical prototype systems were successfully developed and tested by a joint team of faculty, students, and industry members of the Center for Innovative Instrumentation Technology.  Collaborations initiated by this center have resulted in commercial product development which will have an important positive impact on the health and wellbeing of an increasingly globally connected world.
