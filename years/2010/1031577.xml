<AbstractNarration>This workshop is intended to overcome current limitations with regard to the documentation, analysis, advocacy and communication concerning mass violence.  Traditional sources of information concerning mass violence have been found inadequate by scholars.  For example, media reports depend on reporter acess.  Instances of political violence go underreported in certain situations.  Non-traditional sources such as those from HRDAG have their own limitations.  While thorough, they also suffer from the problems of convenience samples.  Also, many researchers seem unaware of these traditional sources.  At the same time, human rights groups and policy makers seem unaware of theoretical work in this area from which they might benefit.  The purpose of this workshop is to bridge this gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regards to intellectual merit, this workshop will highlight new and exciting sources of data.  It will also consider the limits to these new sources of information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regards to broader impacts, policy makers and non-governmental organizations will be made aware of current theoretical work in these areas. This would, hopefully, result in them using this work in develop their policies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A goal of this project is to revolutionize how conflict and violence data is created as well as evaluated by refining methods that can be used throughout the social sciences to develop and analyze event data - especially that concerned with political violence/conflict.   Our project is associated with efforts to catalog large scale violations of human rights. The Kosovo data for example and its examination are being used by individuals to better understand as well as memorialize the violence that took place there. More recently discussion of data from Syria, commissioned by the UN, was discussed in the New York Times. These will eventually also shape public opinion through establishing the definitive accounting of what took place.  For this project, two workshops were held to discuss strategies how researchers could overcome current limitations with regard to the documentation, analysis, advocacy and communication involving mass political violence.  Strategies are needed because historically different groups have not been coordinating their efforts in an efficient and appropriate manner and/or they have been working at cross purposes.   At the first workshop, approximately 25 individuals (researchers as well as members of a human rights NGO &ndash; the Human Rights Data Analysis Group or HRDAG) came together in order to discuss what data was compiled by the former and what could be done with such data (provided by the latter).   This was deemed more of a background/informational session: 1) where researchers could familiarize themselves with the work of HRDAG and the technique referred to as Multiple Systems Estimation (MSE). MSE allows individuals to utilize different lists of events (across actor, action, time and space) and use the partially overlapping lists to generate an estimation of what likely took place; 2) where HRDAG was introduced to various concepts and theories in political science as well as sociology for the development of research collaborations. In the second workshop, a smaller group of 13 individuals came together to present the findings from the collaborations that were formed at the first meeting.  These efforts resulted in the communication regarding how data collection and analysis could be improved.  In addition, written materials are currently under review and some are being developed that will be placed on webpages, used to develop other workshops and short courses. Indeed, one outgrowth of the workshops is a broader collaboration whereby HRDAG is partnering with the University of Michigan and Florida State University.
