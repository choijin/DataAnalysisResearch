<AbstractNarration>This project is expanding the work of the award-winning "On the Cutting Edge" program, and is continuing to provide a comprehensive, discipline-wide professional development program for current and future geoscience faculty. It is attempting to engage, through participation in face-to-face or online Cutting Edge workshop experiences, about half of the total number of US geoscience faculty in order to achieve a widespread and sustainable impact. It is expanding the segment of the faculty population who have had a first workshop experience, and is also providing geoscience faculty with advanced opportunities for learning that are also encouraging repeated participation in Cutting Edge activities, enabling ongoing learning, and resulting in increased changes in teaching practice among participants. The project is continuing an annual series of face-to-face workshops and is adding six virtual or hybrid workshops or other virtual events. It is introducing a number of new elements including 1) a stronger focus on improving introductory geoscience courses and increasing participation of faculty from two-year colleges, 2) revising the project website to include expanded community-authored and community-reviewed resources as well as improved methods for searching and obtaining previously submitted materials, 3) developing structured activities aimed specifically at enlarging and improving accessibility to the website, 4) incorporating a full research and evaluation program that not only is providing formative feedback to improve the program, but also is extending evaluation to assess the effect that the program has on teaching practice and student learning among the broader geoscience community. In particular, the project is attempting to determine what impact repeated participation in geoscience professional development has on individual teaching practice and on geoscience education nationwide, and what impact participation in an innovative and research-based community of geoscience educators has on faculty teaching effectiveness.  The project is developing and disseminating best practices for the geosciences, however, many project activities are also being transferred to other STEM disciplines through publications, presentations, workshops, and through collaborations developed with SENCER and other organizations.</AbstractNarration>

The project immediately changed the face of geoscience  professional development in two major ways. It created a comprehensive  professional development program spanning many of the needs of  geoscience faculty and a collection of web-based resources that extended  the reach of workshops far beyond the participants. The workshop design  emphasized modeling effective practices, learning from one another, and  leaving workshops with practical ideas that could be used immediately.  In addition to face-to-face multi-day workshops, the program offered  short workshops and sessions at national meetings, virtual workshops,  webinars and journal clubs. Faculty taking advantage of the workshops  report and have been observed as a group to use more engaged teaching  methods than non-participants. Subsequent grants supporting the program  focused on building a culture of sharing, continuous learning, and  communal improvement in support of undergraduate geoscience teaching.  The Cutting Edge community has contributed and peer-reviewed more than  1500 teaching activities and established ongoing research teams studying  geoscience teaching and the program&rsquo;s impact. It is part  of a larger suite of professional activities for geoscience education,  many of which share its underpinning philosophy and workshop design.  Over 4000 educators have participated in this exponentially growing  community that was launched by On the Cutting Edge. Beyond Earth Science undergraduate education, on the Cutting Edge has contributed to the larger goal of achieving excellence in STEM education through collaborations with similar programs in sister disciplines, and has been a leader in promoting discipline-based education research through seminal work on assessment of student learning, the role of the affective domain, and using metacognition to improve students' learning of science.&nbsp; Key scholarly contributions include:&nbsp; Macdonald, R.
