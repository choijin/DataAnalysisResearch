<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID project will augment an extensive field experiment aimed at identifying and quantifying lateral mixing and dispersion on the inner (coastal) shelf. In their funded experiment, Monismith, Stacey, Powell, and McManus (Project title: Collaborative Research - Lateral mixing and dispersion on the inner shelf) are focusing on the physical vertical and horizontal mixing processes that drive horizontal transport in the surface and benthic mixed layers, and the midwater, highly stratified layer, where thin layers of biological material can accumulate. Through a combination of moored, autonomous and towed instrumentation, their experimental design is focused on the fine vertical (cm-m) and horizontal (m-100's m) scales through measurements of vertical and horizontal velocities, temperature, salinity and density fields, as well as optical (and acoustic) properties aimed at identifying plankton distributions (both phyto- and zooplankton). While the primary focus on their work is physical, the PIs have an explicit interest in the biological ramifications of the development and horizontal dispersal associated with the various layers of the inner shelf. This RAPID award supports  added capacity to the experiment from the perspective of the biological communities likely to be impacted by the mixing and dispersal properties under study. By adding sampling with our In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS), the planktonic community will be visually resolved to key taxonomic levels due to the very high optical resolution capabilities of ISIIS. Never before has there been such an opportunity for coupling very fine-scale physical mechanistic measurements with comparable biological measurements. Moreover, the sampling capabilities of ISIIS will allow the fine-scale scale focus of this work also to be placed into a submesoscale (~ 10-15 km) spatial scale perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this RAPID project consist of image analysis and digital archiving that will generate a permanent, digital recording of planktonic specimens with their associated environmental data. Availability of such a resource of data will increase the capacity to share information among the scientific community. Images collected during the course of this study will be available to the science and education community through access to the a database held at the UM CSS (via communication with the lead PI and a Website (ftp) link) to be developed. With respect to educational value, the PIs will train one doctoral graduate student with a focus on interdisciplinary research: integrating marine science, computer science, and engineering. Other graduate and undergraduate students will have the opportunity to utilize ISIIS data for specific research projects relevant to biological oceanography in association with the PI's lab.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This one year study was focused on the formation, extent, dispersal and biological composition of thin layers. Thin layers are vertically concentrated (cm &ndash; m) regions of high biomass of phytoplankton, in other words as one moves down through the water column, the concentration of phytoplankton is found to be highest in a very thin layer. Early work using acoustics has identified the occurrence of zooplankton and biological aggregates in the presence of thin layers of phytoplankton, likely in response to there being a localized (and concentrated) food source. Since the interactions of the zooplankton with the phytoplankton can drive important ecological processes (including predation, growth, dispersal), the mechanisms driving the coherence of these layers have important implications to the ecology of nearshore planktonic populations and communities.  Historically, one of the key limitations in dissecting out the response of plankton to thin layers (and other concentrating mechanisms), let alone examining even basic fine scale distributions of plankton, has been sampling capabilities of available technology (i.e. nets and acoustics have not been able to resolve the organisms at the very fine scales). This sampling resolution issue renders nets generally ineffective at adequately resolving plankton distributions (especially the rarer meso-plankton) in association with such fine scale features as thin layers in the vertical and the small scale mixing features associated with horizontal dispersion and along frontal features in the horizontal direction.  We have been addressing these sampling problems with technological advancements of the last decade in both digital imaging and computing.  Specifically, we have built a towed camera system capable of imaging large volumes of water with very high resolution to quantify zooplankton in situ.  Specifically, we used the In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS) to extend the scales of resolution of the planktonic biological community throughout the water column, with particular focus on thin layers.  Specifically, we:  i)              Provided direct identification and quantification (size frequency and concentration) of the plankton field in and about the experimental array.  ii)             Provided the spatial context for fine scale study (cm-100Æs m) through simultaneous sampling of a larger spatial field (100s &ndash; 1000s m)  Over the June 28-July 7, 2010 field effort, we recorded imagery of extremely dense particulates in the water column. These were densest at the depth where we measured the highest amount of chlorophyll and particularly under conditions associated with thin layers. Of interest, the particulates were predominantly flocculent material associated with very dense bloom of the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia spp. (see Figure 1), a known æHarmful Algal BloomÆ (HAB) organism from coastal waters. The vertical, horizontal and temporal extent of these flocs, as well as common zooplankters (i.e., copepods, appendicularians, and six gelatinous taxa) varied considerably. Based on these observations, we examined the relationship of the distribution of these organisms within the overall context of the biological and physical settings through time.  In addition to the high density of flocs and associated Pseudo-nitzschia diatom aggregates, ISIIS also imaged a variety of gelatinous zooplankton (ctenophores and medusae or jellyfish &ndash; see Figure 2).  Our results show strong variation in the distribution of three separate trophic levels including phytoplankton, primary consumers, and gelatinous zooplankton, with &gt;2 orders of magnitude difference between surface and 15m depth concentrations in the latter category (see Figures 3 and 4). Overall abundances were most affected by the effect of sampling date, but all gelatinous taxa were more likely to occur in high abundance at greater depth. Bolinopsis spp. ctenophores underwent an apparent "bloom" on July 5 and were th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
