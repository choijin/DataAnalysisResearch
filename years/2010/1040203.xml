<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop multidimensional spectrometer in terahertz frequency range. Multidimensional spectroscopy is a family of nonlinear spectroscopic techniques that can map out the correlation, coherence or interaction among different electronic, vibrational or other elementary excitations. The approach is to use recently developed intense (&gt;1MV/cm) and broadband (&gt;10THz) terahertz radiation field from laser induced plasma, computer controlled multiple Terahertz pulse trains, and broadband terahertz detection using terahertz intereferometer. &lt;br/&gt;The development of multidimensional spectrometer in THz frequency range expands the utilities of THz spectroscopy and its contribution to the materials research. Many of phonons, mechanical resonance mode in nanoscale materials, and molecular vibrational modes of chemical and biological materials fall into THz frequency range. The examples of research area which would be impacted by the THz multidimensional spectroscopy include: (1) Nanoelectronics (2) Nanomolecular layers/interfacial materials, and (3) Dynamics and structures of proteins, and biological materials. &lt;br/&gt;The development of such unique equipment will cultivate new opportunities of collaborative research within Rensselaer community and with other institutions. Center for THz research at RPI has an established relationship with Morehouse College, Atlanta, GA, a historically black university. Each year, 2 or 3 students from Morehouse visit RPI during the summer semester, and are involved in THz related research projects. Summer students will be involved in this project during the grant period. Undergraduate students will be involved in the software development of this project through REU program at RPI.</AbstractNarration>
