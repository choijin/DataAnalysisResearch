<AbstractNarration>Many invasive species have strong negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function and attempts to control or reverse their spread can be costly and require coordination among multiple institutions. This project integrates biological, mathematical, economic and political science tools to answer several critical and interrelated questions surrounding the invasive and high impact Eastern Smooth Cordgrass, Spartina spp, in San Francisco Bay.  Two ways in which human intervention can mitigate the impact are to eradicate the invader and to restore the habitat.  This is a complex problem with spatial linkages arising from the biology and impact of Spartina, and the spatial mosaic of governing agencies and responsible authorities.  The project will focus on three questions: 1) What are the dynamics of eradication of an invasive species and subsequent restoration?  2) How can a program of eradication of an invasive species and subsequent restoration be designed taking into account both economics and ecology? 3) How do eradication and restoration policies depend on collective action on the part of multiple governmental and non-governmental stakeholders?  This project will develop general models that will apply to a wide range of systems where an invasive species can have long lasting effects on the biotic and abiotic environment and to a much wider range of natural systems which are affected by humans and in which potential irreversibilities can occur.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eradication of invasive Spartina is one of the top priorities recently identified in the West Coast Governor's Agreement on Ocean Health, which provides a mandate for its eradication from the Pacific Coast by 2018.  The project will provide specific guidance for control and restoration efforts in San Francisco Bay, and in other west coast estuaries, and will provide interdisciplinary research training for several graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral scholars.  Outreach will provide information to the public about Spartina and invasive species more generally.  The tools developed and lessons learned can be applied broadly to the wide range of ecosystem management projects with feedbacks between natural and human systems, including invasive species management, fisheries, endangered species protection, forest management, and the provision of ecosystem services more broadly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project used a multi-disciplinary approach to study the eradication of an invasive salt marsh cordgrass, a hybrid of Spartina alterniflora and Spartina foliosa, in San Francisco Bay as well as issues of restoration following removal.  We worked closely with the group, the Invasive Spartina Project (ISP), that has been managing control efforts in collaboration with the multiple local agencies responsible for managing land along the San Francisco Bay shoreline.  The problem was complicated by the presence of an endangered species, the Ridgeway rail, that uses Spartina as habitat, which meant that mature native or invasive Spartina must be maintained at a sufficient density.  Our most important result concerns management in the face of these multiple, potentially conflicting goals: removing an invasive that does have an economic impact while maintaining sufficient habitat for an endangered species that uses the invasive for habitat.  We developed both a general approach and applied it specifically to this system.  As is typical for invasive species problems, the economically optimal approach is to spend as quickly as possible at the beginning to remove the invasive, but then the presence of the endangered species means that spending should be slower while the native is planted and allowed to grow to form habitat for the endangered species.   The importance of taking into account time scales this way is novel, and the approach for dealing with multiple goals is general.  Overall, the eradication effort has been successful in San Francisco Bay.  Using survey approaches, we showed that the success of the overall eradication effort was greatly facilitated by having a single organization (ISP), serve as a focal point for both information and resources.  This result can be used to help design other successful management efforts that cross jurisdictional boundaries.  Our efforts at following dynamics after removal of invasive Spartina show that the system does recover and begin to return to a natural state is a key step as following up on eradication efforts and asking how systems recover is important.  The results from this project have implications for the management of invasive species, for understanding the impact of invasive species, and for the more general issue of managing ecological systems with multiple, potentially conflicting, goals.  We provided general information to the public through the UC Davis Arboretum and Public Garden including outreach materials and a demonstration table at May plant sales (attendance between 800-1,000).  In addition to the demonstrations at plant sales, the Arboretum and Public Garden developed four permanent interpretive signs related to different invasive species topics, as developed in the grant, seen by the hundreds of thousands of visitors to the Arboretum and Public Garden each year.  Finally, at the very end of the grant, we hosted a conference/workshop at UC Davis, Anticipating and Resolving Conflicting Management Goals: Invasive Plant Eradication and Endangered Species Recovery in Coastal and Aquatic Systems, in September 2016.  Here, we examined the broader conflicts created by management programs aimed at eradicating invasive species and those trying to recover populations of endangered species.  The subject of the grant, the conflict between eradication of invasive hybrid Spartina and endangered Ridgway Rail in San Francisco Bay was the focal issue, but similar issues in other systems were discussed.   There were 12 speakers and over 80 participants from academia, state and federal resource agencies, NGOs, and the general public so the results of this project were widely disseminated to interested parties.
