<AbstractNarration>The Hi-TECH Scholars program is providing scholarships to increase recruitment, retention, on-time graduation rates, and diversity in three science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree programs. The targeted programs are Automotive Technology (AUT), Computer Technology (CPT), and Engineering Technology (ET). The Hi-TECH Scholars program has three main objectives: &lt;br/&gt;1. Award 130 scholarships over four years to financially needy and academically talented students. &lt;br/&gt;2. Award 65 scholarships to underrepresented students. &lt;br/&gt;3. Graduate 100 Hi-TECH scholars with an associate degree within their two-year scholarship period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: These objectives are being accomplished by leveraging a network of existing student support services and resources and implementing new and expanded initiatives that help retain STEM students. The Placement and Transfer offices at the college provide scholars with career guidance. Recruitment initiatives target students currently enrolled in Hi-TECH programs, students at area high schools and career centers, incumbent workers or career change seekers from the community or business and industry, and students enrolled in one or more  STEM developmental courses at the college. The selection process focuses on academically talented but financial needy students entering AUT, CPT or ET programs. A GPA of 3.0 or higher is required of entering secondary students or currently enrolled college students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project is designed to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in Hi-TECH programs and increase the number of Hi-TECH graduates completing their associate degrees in two years. The comprehensive, data-driven management plan allows for broad dissemination of best practices and lessons learned.  Successful strategies developed through the project serve as models in other areas of the college and for the nation.</AbstractNarration>
