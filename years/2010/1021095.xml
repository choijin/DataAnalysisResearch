<AbstractNarration>Upscaling measurements of ecosystem function from leaf to region to globe, and downscaling remote sensing observations and global model output to spatial scales of meters to kilometers, remain grand challenges in Earth system science. The overarching goal of this project is to improve estimates of carbon sequestration and surface-atmosphere water flux at higher spatial resolutions than have been possible in the past, namely the spatial scales at which land surface processes vary on the order of a tree or vegetation patch.  In this project, satellite remote sensing data, measured carbon fluxes, and earth system models will be scaled to higher resolutions using techniques from the field of information theory. The approach will apply acknowledged mathematical approaches that have been used successfully in disciplines that range from astronomy to population ecology in a novel way to address questions of global importance: how are vegetation, carbon and water cycles linked across landscapes?  High-resolution data sets from arctic and Great Plains ecosystems will be used to validate the scaling techniques and link high-resolution vegetation function to coarser-resolution satellite imagery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project can be used by scientists from a wide range of disciplines. The resultant algorithms, code and analysis programs will be made publicly available via university websites and open-source code repositories for broad dissemination. Lesson plans will be built into existing upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses. These teaching tools will likewise be made available over the web for students and practitioners. An overarching goal of this research is to improve estimates of carbon and water cycling from space.</AbstractNarration>

We demonstrate how approaches that arise from Information Theory can be used to improve our understanding of the complex dynamics of ecosystems across space and time. An analysis of the relative entropy of remote sensing data products demonstrates that hydrological variables share information with surface-atmosphere carbon and water flux at time scales between weeks and months, and at time scales greater than a year. An analysis of twenty ecosystem models at ten research sites distributed across North America demonstrated that models match measurements poorly at these time scales, suggesting that improving carbon-water coupling is a logical step to create ecosystem models that replicate the variability of ecosystem functioning across multiple time scales. Further results demonstrate that the scaling relationship among remote sensing data that is related to vegetation structure and evapotranspiration differs among different satellite data products, suggesting that researchers should be cognizant of relationships developed using different satellite sensors. An analysis of an area of pronounced permafrost thaw demonstrated that certain thaw features are responsible for most landscape level methane release, but also that remote sensing products struggle to observe changes in these landforms because they are slightly smaller than the resolution of the satellite data. Results did show changes along the edges of lakes, demonstrating a dynamic landscape that must be further studied to capture changes that are related to methane release. Granger causality and spectral Granger causality were used to explore how information is passed between ecological variables and carbon dioxide flux, often with an associated time lag.
