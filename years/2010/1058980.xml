<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Alexandru Asandei of the University of Connecticut, for the development of novel gold-based organometallic polymerization catalysts. The goal of this work is to understand the balance of ligand properties surrounding gold in various oxidation states needed to effect addition, condensation, coordination and free radical polymerizations. Possible substrates include diynes, dienes, and dicarbonyls. The nature of this research is that of a survey, taking a "broad strokes" approach to ligand design, catalyst properties, and the desired polymerization reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, much of this research is uncharted territory in terms of chemical reactivity and has the potential to lead to many new and interesting materials. The proposed investigations concern a comprehensive but rational approach to finding opportunities and applications of gold catalysis in polymer chemistry, based on knowledge emerging from current organic/organometallic Au chemistry developments, and from established polymerization principles. Professor Asandei has the general goal of being able to "tune" material properties with appropriate catalyst design. The work is amenable to undergraduate research, and there will be significant outreach to the community through workshops in local high schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Contrary to jewelry-inspired popular perception that gold is a chemically inert, unreactive metal, the last decade has seen an exponential increase in gold related research in organic and organometallic chemistry but remains ignored in polymer chemistry.  Thus, the main goal of this grant was to perform a broad, but in-depth study of the possible applications of gold catalyzed reactions in polymer chemistry.  The proposed researched included the evaluation of the Au coordination to multiple C=C or C=X bonds and their activation towards addition of nucleophiles for polycondensations reactions, as well as the study of  Au-mediated coordination, anionic, cationic and radical polymerizations of alkenes, and of the ring opening polymerizations of heterocycles.  These studies have all included an in-depth evaluation of all reaction parameters (reaction mechanism, effect of monomer nature, Au, ligand, solvent, temperature etc).  The outcomes of the research provided a series of unexpected, but positive results, demonstrating that gold catalysts have a great potential in mediating polymerizations by most known mechanism, but with dramatic increase in rates and efficiencies, while also being used at very low loadings.  In brief, due to the activation of C=O bonds, Au complexes proved very efficient in low temperature polyesterification reactions, and especially in the ring opening polymerizations of cyclic esters such as caprolactone.  Likewise, their Lewis acidic nature enabled very fast cationic polymerizations of alkenes or vinyl ethers.  Finally, the most interesting and unexpected results were obtained for radical and coordination polymerizations, especially those of fluorinated alkenes, where due to the vast increase in rate afforded by gold catalysts, and by contrast to the typical high-temperature, high pressure polymerizations of such gaseous monomers (e.g. CH2=CF2, -84 C), polymer could be obtained at room temperature, in low pressure glass tubes.  Furthermore, gold catalysis subsequently enabled the synthesis of well-defined fluorinated block copolymers.  However, some of these reactions remain unusual and mechanistically very complex. Thus, additional understanding is in progress.  Nonetheless, the broader impacts outcome of the research forms the basis of several patent disclosures, of future contributions at national and international conferences and of high impact articles in preparation. As importantly, these research efforts served in the education and mentorship of graduate and undergraduate students towards fulfilling their higher education aspirations, and becoming the best scientist they can be.
