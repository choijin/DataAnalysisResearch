<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Judit Puskas of the University of Akron will develop strategies to quantify the formation of natural rubber, a polyterpenoid, from isoprene and to characterize the microstructure of the polyisoprene formed. The idea of the project is to gain a fundamental understanding of the reversible equilibria involved in terpenoid biosynthesis and to optimize their production from isoprene, an abundant substrate than can be obtained from renewable resources.  The approach is to monitor the kinetics of monomer conversion in the presence of selected enzyme cocktails using high resolution size exclusion chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and in situ infrared and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The production of natural rubber from Guayule and Russian Dandelion will also be investigated following the same strategy.  The exact structure and molar mass of the obtained isoprenoids will be determined using a variety of analytical techniques, and the data will be used to reconstruct the biosynthetic reaction pathway. The project will be performed in collaboration with Alain Deffieux, University of Bordeaux, France, and Manuel Rodriguez-Concepcion, Centre for Research on Agricultural Genomics (CRAG), Spain. The broader impacts involve developing infrastructure for research and education through establishing multilateral international collaborations as well as promoting teaching, training and learning of graduate students through this project and its international dimensions. The project will encourage students to think "green," finding ways to emulate natural chemical pathways and contributing to sustainable materials development for future generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isoprene and terpenoids are produced by all living things: plants, microbes and animals. They have essential functions in life processes such as respiration, photosynthesis, the regulation of growth and development, and others. They are also used to make important elastic materials that are used in a range of industries, such as automotive, apparel, and medical equipment.  This project will contribute to a better understanding of the biochemistry of terpenoids and lead to green processes to access these chemicals.</AbstractNarration>
