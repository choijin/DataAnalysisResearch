<AbstractNarration>An anthropomorphic robot arm and a human capture system enable the  autonomous performance of assembly tasks with significant uncertainty in problem specifications and environments.   This line of work is investigated through sequences of manipulation actions where the guarantee of the completion of task-level objectives is rooted in the discovery of the semantic structure of human manipulation.  New research directions in anthropomorphic robotics are explored including programming by demonstration, activity recognition, control and estimation and planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motion grammar laboratory infrastructure allows a great opportunity for research and education.  New classroom experiences for undergraduates and graduates provide practical experience in robot human interaction and activity process sharing.  This opens possibilities for human training and rehabilitation, as well as assistive personal robotic, and opens the door to a host of technological innovations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this grant was to provide infrastructure support for studies of how grammatical models can be use as a high-level description of physical processes and how such grammatical model also can be used for synthesis of physical motion as typically seen inmotion planning.  Intellectual Merit  The grant was used to organize three physical setups.   Motion grammar laboratory: a bi-dexterous manipulation system for  studies of grasping and manipulation of objects. The laboratory has  state of the art facilities for studies of grasping and new methods  for planning in the context of manipulation. An excellent example of  how these facilities can be used is the Amazon Pick  Challenge. Another example is the study of assembly for  manufacturing processes such as automotive Another setup was devoted to air-ground coordination between  unmanned vehicles. Management of a large swarm of robots is a  challenge and there is a need to utilize high-level models to manage  the complexity of interaction with and within a group of platforms.  These capabilities have in turn enabled in a number of different  projects, focusing on Human-Swarm Interactions and Heterogeneous  Robot Teams. The research has been widely published as listed below. Finally a setup was organized to study human-robot interaction to  allow modeling of human activities as a sequence of skills/tasks  that can be modeled using a grammar.    Broader impact  The infrastructure grant has enabled a broader set of studies related to how grammars can be used for modeling of tasks and synthesis of motion planning across multi-robot coordination, manipulation of everyday objects and studies of human-robot interaction. The infrastructure grant has been utilized in a number of spin-off projects. The equipment has also been used in a large number of demonstrations to high school students to inform them about opportunities and challenges in STEM. More than 1,000 students have seen the systems in operation.           Last Modified: 05/29/2015       Submitted by: Henrik I Christensen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
