<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a set of active-learning, finite element analysis based course modules with commercial software for use in a variety of undergraduate courses at a diverse set of nine universities across the nation.  The effectiveness of the modules is being assessed by faculty and students with student learning experience progression, learning styles, and personality types being taken into account.  The project advances active-learning techniques in undergraduate engineering education utilizing the finite element method for modeling and analysis of complex engineering problems in eight areas.  The project provides a quantitative measure of how well the modules enhance learning equitably across different student demographic variables.  The project results are disseminated in various ways, such as via an internet website and faculty workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Collaborative Research: Improved Learning for Undergraduate Engineering Programs Using Finite Element Learning Modules  Intellectual Merit  This project provided an innovative method to teach undergraduate engineering students across diverse universities basic Finite Element Analysis (FEA)  and the ability to correctly  use commercial FEA software to solve engineering problems. The assessment strategy allowed us to measure student learning improvements using a quiz on the new FEA  material before administering the FEA learning module and the same quiz after the students taken the FEA learning module. We did effectively measure student competency versus  different student demographic variables,  Broader Impacts  The project used  17  new FEA modules to teach engineering concepts and FEA theory to 751 undergraduates in  a broad  range of undergraduate  courses. These hands-on modules provided active learning  through interactive analysis using perturbation studies  and computer visualization of typical engineering problems. These 17 new  FEA  modules were added to existing  12 FEA modules from our CCL Phase 1  grant on our GOOGLE website to share these modules with educators across the globe.  Specific Objectives  The overall project goal was two fold: 1) to use active-learning techniques to increase learning  of difficult engineering design concepts in broader areas of undergraduate courses and 2) to provide undergraduate engineering students with a basics knowledge of finite element analysis (FEA) theory and design experience along with  the ability to apply commercial FEA software to solve typical engineering problems and analytical or experimental methods to verify these results.  Significant Results  Over 751 undergraduate engineering students were administered seventeen finite element active  learning modules at eight  engineering colleges and universities over five years. Quizzes on the basics of using FEA to analyze engineering problems were given to the students prior and  after the FEA modules with measured improvement in knowledge of 30% and above for these FEA modules.  Key Outcomes or Other Achievements  The students were able to use these new engineering  FEA skills to design their senior  projects for their senior capstone engineering courses in most instances. Many students included these new FEA skills  in their senior vitae to assist them  obtaining engineering jobs in very competitive fields upon graduation.  Oppotrunities for Faculty and Graduate Student  Professional Development  This project has provided faculty training and professional development to 12 engineering faculty, These faculty were able  to teach  the finite element method to undergraduate engineering students using these active learning  modules.This project also provided graduate student training and development to 5  graduate students  in the correct analysis of student quiz data using software subroutines while working under faculty direction.
