<AbstractNarration>This MRI-RAPID project is in response to events subsequent to an explosion on the British Petroleum (BP) Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana.  A Submerged Oil Detector using UV Fluorescence (SODUF) deployable at variable depths up to 6000 ft will be assembled, tested, and deployed in the Gulf in a timely manner consistent with RAPID funding requirements. The project has six phases: 1) modify a UV fluorescence hydrocarbon detector for rapid deployment on ships of opportunity operating in the Gulf of Mexico; 2) integrate the UV detector into a geo-referenced drifter; 3) retrofit an undulating tow-body for deepwater profiling in the Gulf; 4) integrate UV hydrocarbon detector into deepwater undulating tow-body; 5) modify UV hydrocarbon detector for deployment on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV); 6) integrate UV detector into AUV. Phases 1, 2, 4, and 6 will involve field scale testing of the newly assembled sensor/sensor platform in the Gulf Oil spill to determine the efficacy of the instrument in locating&lt;br/&gt;submerged oil. The goal is a solution to detection and tracking of submerged oil plumes using the RAPID MRI mechanism to enable the assembly and field testing of SODUF. Phases 3 and 5 will involve mostly bench testing at our Shoreline Environmental Research Facility (SERF) located in Corpus Christi, Texas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[? POTSDAM, NY -- Clarkson University researchers James S. Bonner and Temitope O. Ojo have acquired an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from YSI, Inc. The EcoMapper AUV is equipped with sensors that are capable of detecting and tracking plumes of hydrocarbon in the aftermath of an oil spill.  The instrument, which will aid emergency response activities in the event of an oil spill, was obtained through use of a $200,000 MRI-RAPID grant from the National Science Foundation for their research "Development of Surface and Submerged Oil Detector using Fluorescence and Laser Light Scattering." Bonner is the Shipley Center for Innovation fellow and a professor of civil &amp; environmental engineering. Ojo is a research assistant professor of civil &amp; environmental engineering.  Speaking at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History during a panel presentation titled "One Year after the Gulf Oil Spill" Bonner, a leading expert in oil spill response and countermeasures research said the technology integrates sensors into a robotic vehicle which gives us expanded capabilities in terms of rapid deployment.  According to Ojo, this technology has been evolving over the last decade and continues to do so at a rapid pace and this acquisition will tremendously increase our capacity to conduct scientific surveys in aquatic systems. As part of this development, the team extended the capacity of their existing underwater tow vehicle to go into deeper waters which gives them an additional platform for sensor deployment. Unlike the AUV that is completely autonomous and self-propelled, the undulating tow body is tethered to a boat and derives propulsion and control from the parent vessel. This is the culmination of several years of research into oil spill countermeasures and detection technologies involving extensive lab-scale and meso-scale research into various methods of in situ detection of oil including fluorescence (excitation/emission spectral analysis), backscatter (optical, acoustic), particle characterization (laser scattering, imaging).
