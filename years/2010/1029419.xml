<AbstractNarration>Street trees exist within the blurred private-public space of the right-of-way and represent a highly managed landscape feature of urban socioecological systems. Although they are an important part of the urban forest landscape and provide valuable ecosystem services, the biophysical characteristics of the right-of-way and actions of human and non-human management agents have resulted in an uneven spatial distribution of street trees within many cities. There remains a knowledge gap in our understanding of how the social, built and bioecological interactions in the public right-of-way impact urban environmental change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral student Shawn Landry under the guidance of Professor Jayajit Chakraborty in the Department of Geography at the University of South Florida will investigate the socioecological determinants of street tree distributions in urban residential neighborhoods in order to understand how household decisions and multi-scalar management agents shape urban forest change and the environment within the public-private space of the right-of-way. The research addresses three primary questions: Are recent changes to the spatial distribution of street trees explained by socio-demographic household and neighborhood characteristics? Which management agents are the strongest predictors of recent changes to street tree distributions and how does the contribution of these agents vary in relationship to socioecological patterns within a city? To what extent are household street tree management decisions related to the built and bioecological material characteristics of the public right-of-way? Multi-method empirical analyses will be conducted in a study area in and around Tampa, Florida, that includes single-family residential areas characteristic of a typical Sunbelt city. Urban remote sensing and land cover change analysis, combined with geospatial analytical techniques will be used to examine broader socio-demographic patterns associated with recent changes to street tree distributions. Household survey and semi-structured interview techniques combined with assessment of biophysical growing conditions will be used to examine the relative contribution to street tree distributions by specific agents and the socio-spatial determinants of household public right-of-way landscape decisions. This study will extend a research framework designed to capture the complexity of human ecosystems to reveal poorly understood aspects of urban forest change, such as how historical legacies affect adaptive management options associated with the right-of-way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project synthesizes theory and methods from urban forestry, spatial sciences, environmental equity, and urban ecology to contribute new insights on environmental change associated with spaces characterized by complex social, built, and bioecological interactions. The findings from this study will inform and guide urban environmental management and policy decisions associated with the public-private space of the right-of-way. Research results will be presented in formats useful to local and national urban forest practitioners and through outreach efforts such as presentations and symposia with residents, neighborhood associations, elected officials and public agencies in the local municipalities. Through these channels, this project will increase knowledge and understanding of factors influencing urban forest sustainability and broadly extend societal impacts beyond the academic community.</AbstractNarration>
