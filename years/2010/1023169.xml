<AbstractNarration>This project funds 10 US-based graduate students to attend the 8th USENIX Symposium on File and Storage Technology (FAST), in February&lt;br/&gt;2010. FAST is a leading forum for innovative research in storage systems, bringing in researchers and practitioners from both industry and academia. &lt;br/&gt;Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work. This project enables participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend, including women, African-Americans and Native Americans.</AbstractNarration>
