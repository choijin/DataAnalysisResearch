<AbstractNarration>Los Angeles Southwest College is developing a 2+2+2 model for its new Associate of Science program in Environmental Science and Technology that is focused on sustainability and alternative energy. This project primarily impacts high school and two-year college students and faculty members. LASC is partnering with local high schools, regional universities, labor, businesses, and regulators to build capacity in the fields of Sustainability and Environmental Science and Technology. The project has several objectives: 1) Strengthen partnerships with industry and businesses to develop programming that integrates industry standards and workplace competencies and addresses the growing regional demand for a trained green/sustainability workforce; 2) Offer an Educator Training Institute for secondary and post-secondary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educators; 3) Develop seven courses for an Environmental Science and Technology Associate Degree program and incorporate sustainability into existing STEM curriculum; 4) Partner with local high schools and regional universities to articulate courses and develop career pathways to support the transition of students across the education and career advancement continuum; 5) Develop a Community Outreach Plan that increases participation of high school students and adults, particularly those from under-represented groups, in STEM and the field of Environmental Science and Technology; and 6) Evaluate the program model, disseminate project deliverables regionally, and encourage replication.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTRODUCTION  The objectives and purpose of this project entitled "A 2+2+2 Model for an Environmental Science and Technology Program Focused on Sustainability and Alternative Energy" are shown below:  The original intent when the grant was received was to house the program in a new building that was scheduled to be completed in the 2012/2013 academic  year to house the Career and Techical Education department at LASC.  The building has been delayed, and is now scheduled for completion in the 2014/2015 academic year.     Objective 1 &ndash; Industry Partnerships:  Strengthen partnerships with industry and businesses todevelop programming that integrates industry standards and workplace competencies and addresses the growing regional demand for a trained green/sustainability workforce.    Outcome -- LASC has worked with two local environmental firms to identify what types of skills would be needed by graduates who are looking for jobs in the green economy.  The initial focus has been on training for energy auditing and solar technology.  The companies have provided input on what the curriculum for certificat programs should look like. In addition, the CTE division holds regular meetings with local businesses, Worksource Centers and service groups to update the community on what the college is planning, and to solicit input on what these entities see as community needs  Objective 2 &ndash; Professional Development:  Offer an Educator Training Institute for secondary and post-secondary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educators.    Outcome -- LASC held the Educator training Institute in Summer and Fall 2012.  Participants were drawn from  K-12 schools in LASC's service area, as well as LASC Faculty.  The topics covered included:  Water Resources and Sustainability in Southern California  Overview of solar technology An overview of resource use in the developed countries Sustainable Development Sustainable Works Green Living Workshop Southern California EdisonÆs Green programs  Use of Technology tools in Instruction  Cybersecurity &ndash; How to protect yourself in a connected world     Each topic area was evaluated by the participants to provide the instructors with feedback on the effectiveness of the program. A certificate of completion was availble to those faculty needing proof of attendance at the Institute.  Objective 3 &ndash; Curriculum Development/Modification:  Develop seven courses for an Environmental Science and Technology Associate Degree program and incorporate sustainability into existing STEM curriculum.    Outcome -- Seven courses have been developed for the AA degree program, and the core of two certificate programs have been developed.  The implementation of the program has been delayed because of the delay in getting the CTE building completed.  Objective 4 &ndash; Coordinate Educational Institutions:  Partner with local high schools and regional universities to articulate courses and develop career pathways to support the transition of students across the education and career advancement continuum.    Outcome -- LASC has identified Environmental Science/Environmental Studies programs at  California State university Long Beach and California State University Dominguez Hills that the AA degree program can articulate into.  LASC's articulation officer will work with the repective California State schools to ensure that students graduating from LASC's program can enter the programs at these schools.  Objective 5 &ndash; Recruitment:  Develop a Community Outreach Plan that increases participation of high school students and adults, particularly those from under-represented groups.   Outcome -- LASC offered classes in Environmental Science and Environmental Studies to  students from high schools in its service area.  Schools included, Middle college High school, Washington Prep high school, , Locke High school and Jordan High school.  These classes were held from Fall 2010 to Fall 2013, and...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
