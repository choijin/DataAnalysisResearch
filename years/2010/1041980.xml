<AbstractNarration>In this Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Eisenthal from Columbia University will measure affinity constants between biomolecules by the application of nonlinear spectroscopic techniques. Affinity constants are used to characterize the strength of interactions from biomolecule to biomolecule. The new non-linear optical method responds to changes in electric charge in the solid/water interface when free biomolecules from the solution complex with biomolecules that are bound to the solid side of the interface. The proposed technique may provide a new path in the search for novel drug therapies.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We have developed a radically new method to investigate the interactions of biomolecules with other biomolecules such as genetic molecules (DNA), proteins, sequences of amino acids strung together, and drugs that are anti-cancer, antibiotic, and anti-viral.
