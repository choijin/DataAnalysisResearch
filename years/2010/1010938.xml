<AbstractNarration>"Saving Species" will engage large and diverse public audiences in inquiry-based learning and environmental stewardship through a system of exhibits at zoos and other informal science education institutions throughout the U.S. The exhibit system will include more than 70 touch screen interactives and related technological infrastructure being created by Project Dragonfly at Miami University (Ohio). Project partners include the Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden, Brookfield Zoo, Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, Columbus Zoo &amp; Aquarium, Denver Zoo, Liberty Science Center, Louisville Zoological Garden, New York State Zoo, Oregon Zoo, Pittsburgh Zoo, Riverbanks Zoo, Santa Barbara Zoo, Shedd Aquarium, Toledo Zoo, The Wilds, Woodland Park Zoo, and Zoo Atlanta. Touch screen exhibit components will be designed for specific programs at partner zoos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partner institutions in this consortium are establishing exhibits nationwide linked to one of three Saving Species campaigns: 1) the Great Ape Campaign allows families to conduct research on captive ape populations and to help save wild apes by joining the work of experienced field researchers; 2) the Wild Cat Campaign focuses on endangered cat species and allows families to join in conservation efforts along with professionals; 3) the Sustaining Life Campaign builds on widespread interest and growing exhibitry in environmental stewardship, renewable energy, and climate change. The consortium includes a shared library of public inquiry and public-action tools (e.g., cell phone recycling), as well as remote monitoring capabilities that provide real-time measures of station success, facilitating the development of variations of exhibit interactives across the country. More than 500 staff from informal science institutions are participating in "Saving Species" professional development through workshops and graduate courses in major cities and conservation sites worldwide. The formal educational opportunities include two new Master's degree programs co-delivered by Miami University and informal science institutions: (1) the Advanced Inquiry Program, and (2) the Global Field Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategic partners include the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums, public television, Conservation International, and the Society of Conservation Biology. Project evaluation by the Institute for Learning Innovation includes specific assessment protocols that are identifying patterns of engagement by gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic class so that disparities can be addressed across these demographics. A planning study and front-end evaluation will inform the future development of personalized, post-visit engagement opportunities on social networking platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Saving Species" will achieve broad impact nationally, reaching millions of visitors to the participating institutions annually during the funding period and beyond, fostering the relationship between science inquiry and public action, and building multi-institutional partnerships committed to sustaining life on our planet.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Project <em>Dragonfly</em> at Miami University, the Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden, a national consortium of leading zoos and aquariums, and field scientists worldwide, established Saving Species to deepen community engagement in science and conservation while improving zoos as learning institutions.</p> <p>We wanted to support learning among the millions of families who visit zoos every year by providing tools for collaborative inquiry and action. At most zoo exhibits, visitors tend to stop, look at the animals on display, perhaps (but often not) read a sign or two, and move to the next exhibit. We felt this common pattern represents a missed opportunity for deeper science learning among large and diverse public audiences. Based on previous work, we believed we could build on the observations, questions, and desire for connection inherent in the zoo experience to enable families to create new knowledge and to act to protect endangered species.</p> <p>Saving Species established and assessed a national network of family research stations at popular zoo exhibits. The iSaveSpecies Stations include touchscreen interactives that enable visitors to make and test predictions, directly collect data on live animals, view results (their own and that of all participants), and share findings. In addition to these inquiry interactives, exploratory play interactives provide families with fun ways to explore key topics such as animal communication. Using a conservation action interactive, families can create their own conservation posters on large 32&rdquo; touchscreens, choosing themes, graphics, words, and sounds, and email their poster to family and friends with prompts for environmental action at home. iSaveSpecies Stations were installed at the Boonshoft Museum of Discovery, Brookfield Zoo, Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden, Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, Columbus Zoo, Oregon Zoo, Pittsburgh Zoo, Riverbanks Zoo, Santa Barbara Zoo, Toledo Zoo, and Zoo Atlanta. The technology behind iSaveSpecies allows us to track station-specific data and adapt interactives to each participating institution.</p> <p>Project evaluation by the Lifelong Learning Group revealed that zoo visitors who interacted with iSaveSpecies Stations (relative to visitors who did not) are significantly more likely to report practicing core inquiry skills such as making a prediction, gathering data about an animal, and comparing research results with others. Visitors who interacted reported being more knowledgeable about how to study an animal; understood animals better; might like to study animals; and could investigate animal behavior. Visitors who engaged also reported they could protect the animal&rsquo;s environment, and share a conservation message with others. Saving Species demonstrated that families in free-choice zoo environments will not only conduct scientific inquiry and take conservation action, families prefer inquiry-enhanced exhibits over traditional exhibits. By supporting active roles for visitors, zoos can more deeply engage their audience and become stronger science learning institutions.</p> <p>Perhaps the most significant long-term accomplishment of Saving Species has been the development of the Advanced Inquiry (AIP) and the Global Field Program (GFP). Co-created by Project <em>Dragonfly</em> and its institutional partners, the AIP and GFP are national and global graduate degree programs that have served more than 1,500 working professionals, including staff from zoos and other informal learning institutions, K-12 teachers, and business professionals. These graduate programs now operate with course sites in 8 U.S. cities and 16 countries.</p> <p>The AIP is a master's degree with a mission, audience, partners, collaborative web platform, delivery method, instructional model, and curriculum devoted to community engagement in science and environmental stewardship. The AIP combines web-based instruction from Miami with experiential learning, internships, and field study at leading zoos. Current AIP Master Institutions are the Bronx Zoo, Brookfield Zoo, Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden, Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, Denver Zoo, Phoenix Zoo, San Diego Zoo Global, and the Woodland Park Zoo. AIP Master Institutions in development, pending action from Miami, are the Audubon Nature Institute, Dallas Zoo, Missouri Botanical Garden, National Aquarium, North Carolina Zoo, and the Saint Louis Zoo.</p> <p>The Global Field Program--a sister program to the AIP--brings working professionals to global conservation hotspots to work alongside leading field scientists and community leaders in Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. Promoting global understanding and the development of new approaches to pressing social and ecological issues, the GFP includes field courses such as Steppe Ecology and Civic Media (Mongolia); Wildlife and People in Integrated Landscapes (Kenya); Local Wisdom and Conservation (Guyana); and Species, Deities, and Communities (India).&nbsp;</p> <p>All work by Saving Species builds on the participatory science approach of Project <em>Dragonfly</em>, which began in 1995 with the launch of the NSF-funded <em>Dragonfly </em>magazine, the first national magazine to feature the research and discoveries of young investigators. Through the subsequent development of DragonflyTV (the Emmy-Award-winning PBS television series produced by TPT television), public exhibits, graduate programs, and global field partnerships, Project <em>Dragonfly</em>&nbsp;has remained committed to advancing inquiry-driven education to improve social and ecological communities.</p> <p>Project <em>Dragonfly</em> is part of<em> </em>the Biology Department at Miami University.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/14/2016<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;A&nbsp;Myers</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1010938/1010938_10021210_1471162661124_iSSp.Example.Interactive--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1010938/1010938_10021210_1471162661124_iSSp.Example.Interactive--rgov-800width.jpg" title="iSaveSpecies Conservation Poster Interactive"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1010938/1010938_10021210_1471162661124_iSSp.Example.Interactive--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="iSaveSpecies Conservation Poster Interactive"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Creating a personal message to save gorillas at the iSaveSpecies Conservation Station at the Santa Barbara Zoo.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Chris Myers, Lynne Born Myers</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;A&nbsp;Myers</div> <div class="imageTitle">iSaveSpecies Conservation Poster Interactive</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1010938/1010938_10021210_1471162996029_Borneo.Fieldcourse.Sreenshot--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1010938/1010938_10021210_1471162996029_Borneo.Fieldcourse.Sreenshot--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Example field course (website screenshot)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1010938/1010938_10021210_1471162996029_Borneo.Fieldcourse.Sreenshot--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Example field course (website screenshot)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Field courses create direct link to critical conservation worldwide.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Chris Myers, Lynne Born Myers</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;A&nbsp;Myers</div> <div class="imageTitle">Example field course (website screenshot)</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1010938/1010938_10021210_1471163446366_Gorilla.Inquiry.Example.Sceen--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1010938/1010938_10021210_1471163446366_Gorilla.Inquiry.Example.Sceen--rgov-800width.jpg" title="iSaveSpecies Inquiry Interactive example"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1010938/1010938_10021210_1471163446366_Gorilla.Inquiry.Example.Sceen--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="iSaveSpecies Inquiry Interactive example"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Through this interactive, families take data on gorillas in real time to test their predictions about daily behavior patterns.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Chris Myers, Lynne Born Myers</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;A&nbsp;Myers</div> <div class="imageTitle">iSaveSpecies Inquiry Interactive example</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1010938/1010938_10021210_1471163696655_Conserv.Poster.Exp.Screen.2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1010938/1010938_10021210_1471163696655_Conserv.Poster.Exp.Screen.2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Conservation Poster Interactive--orangutans"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1010938/1010938_10021210_1471163696655_Conserv.Poster.Exp.Screen.2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Conservation Poster Interactive--orangutans"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">iSaveSpecies Conservation Poster interactives enable zoo visitors to create their own conservation messages, including the theme, pictures, words, and sounds, and send their posters to family and friends.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Chris Myers, Lynne Born Myers</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;A&nbsp;Myers</div> <div class="imageTitle">Conservation Poster Interactive--orangutans</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
