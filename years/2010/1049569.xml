<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the Division of Chemistry and the GOALI program of the Engineering Directorate and will support the research program of Prof. Edward Rosenberg of the University of Montana. Prof. Rosenberg and his students, in collaboration with a local company, Purity systems Inc. has developed a novel class of amorphous silica-polymer composite materials that are being commercially produced and are being used in the mining and remediation industries. In this project, Prof. Rosenberg and his students will synthesize luminescent silica polyamine composite nanoparticles and use them as luminescent probes for metal cations.  The luminescence response of these particles is based on resonance energy transfer (RET) between the luminescent silicon core of the silica polyamine composite nanoparticles and surface bound ruthenium complexes. The luminescent particles will be incorporated incorporate into water filtration membranes and used to monitor metal binding to these membranes when placed in contaminated water samples.  Silica polyamine composite nanoparticles will also be used novel catalysts in heterogeneous hydrogenation reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new class of luminescent nanomaterials will be used widely in critical environmental applications like drinking water purification and waste water treatment.  Commercialization of this technology will have a significant impact on the mining and metal processing industry.  The research program will provide excellent training opportunities to students in the area of composite materials who seek research and development careers in industry. Prof. Rosenberg will involve undergraduate and graduate students, including Native American students in the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This GOALI project had significant outcomes in the areas of tecnology transfer, human resource devlopment (education), international collaborations and new fundamental knowledge. The outcomes from these areas are outlined below.  Technology Transfer The research conducted under the GOALI grant esulted in the award of three patents.  The technology described in these patents has been licensed by Johnson Matthey Ltd (JM) and the silica polymane composites that are the subject of these patents are being manufactured by JM and used in industry for remediaiton of process waters and clean-up of poluted surface waters.  JM has an IP agreement with the University that has generated significant royalties for the University.  Human Resource Development In addtion to the PI and the two co-PIs the project has had 13 researchers participate in the project.  Five graduate students have received advanced degrees during the last funding period (4 Ph. D and one Masters).  Three undergraduates received training under the grant that prepared them to pursue advanced training in graduate programs and in medical school.  In addtion, the PI has been very involved in community outreach.  One high school teacher and two high school students from one of the local high schools participated inthe project.  Both high school students are pursuing or plan to pursue degrees in scince or engineering.    International Collaborations The technology developed under the GOALI grant has been disseminated to interested parties at national and international venues.  As a result of this dissemination four international collaborations have been developed with the Russian Federartion, South Africa, Chile and Italy.  The collaborations have involved personnel exchange and joint research projects that have resulted in joint publications in peer reviewed journals. All of these collborations are centered on the technology devloped with NSF support.  The PI has visited all these contries and the collaborations are ongoing.  New Fudemental Knowledge Although the target goals of the project have a significant applied component the research also added to new fundemental knowledge in the ares of surface chemisstry, the relationship between photophysical properties and environment of light emitting molecules and the dfferences in catalytic and adsorptive properties of composite materials made on the micro- and nano-scale.  This new knowldege is summarized in eleven publications in peer reviewed scientific journals.       Last Modified: 04/08/2015       Submitted by: Edward Rosenberg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
