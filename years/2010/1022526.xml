<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to obtain new insights into elasticity and dynamic properties of the protein elastin, using solid-state NMR. Elastin is comprised primarily of long hydrophobic chains interspersed with alanine-rich cross linking regions.  Elastin has a complex makeup and there is limited information to link its molecular-scale structure and dynamics to its elasticity. The very nature of this protein precludes the use of high-resolution structural tools, such as X-ray crystallography and solution-state NMR. In this project the PI will utilize solid-state NMR and related methods to provide an integrated and detailed picture of the dynamics and structure of native elastin. This project also includes the first characterization of elastin fibers in native like conditions, using innovations in sample preparation and probe design. This is the only solid state NMR-focused research program with a dedicated, long-standing interest in the molecular-scale characterization of elastin. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide an excellent training opportunity to students at all levels.  The PI will train postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary research project at the interface of chemistry, physics and biology.  In addition, the PI will provide research experience to future high school teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award supported the biophysical studies of elastin, which is a protein found in the tissue of vertebrates. Elastin is similar to rubber, with properties of extension and recoil, but it is very different from petroleum-based elastomeric hydrocarbons in its complexity. Models that describe rubber fail to adequately describe elastin, so this project focused on the characterization of its molecular-scale structure and dynamics with the intent of defining a basis for this protein's properties with spectroscopic data.  The primary tool for the detailed characterization of this important protein is solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy. SSNMR spectroscopy is a  non-destructive method that is used to obtain information about the environment around elastin's nuclei (structure) and how it changes with time (dynamics).  The project used a synergistic approach to characterizing this complex protein, with multiple collaborations, unique samples of varying complexities, and a novel and unique method for their preparation. Particularly with the latter, this group is the first to adopt this method of protein expression for the production of isotopically-enriched elastin, so considerable investments of time and effort were made to optimize conditions for selective, strategic incorporation of stable isotopes.  This project has yielded numerous manuscripts in print and in preparation that describe elastin's structure and dynamics with a level of detail that had not been previously seen with this system. Furthermore, this NSF-supported project has allowed us to pursue new strategies and approaches that will assist future explorations of elastin and other systems with similar levels of complexity.  Broader impacts are relevant to the science itself, but they also extend to the excellent, collaborative, and cross-disciplinary training and research environment for the involved scientists and students.
