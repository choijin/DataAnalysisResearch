<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The second workshop on Cybersicene Grand Challenges and Implications for Cyberinfrastructure was held in May 2010 in Arlington, Virginia with leading figures in the U.S. computational science and engineering community in attendance. The ultimate outcome of the workshop was a report identifying and articulating the critical impacts of the scientific Grand Challenge problems of the coming decade on future cyberinfrastructure.  In particular, a set of recommendations on ideas for new programs to more tightly couple advanced problem-solving in science and engineering with continuing investments in cyberinfrastructure were produced. The interests of all of the Cyberscience Task Forces were represented in this set of recommendations.  The workshop resulted in a much broader impact that articulated on the original projectÃ†s specific goal. A detailed report identifying and substantiating the critical impacts and needs of next-generation cyberscience on cyberinfrastructure was produced. The report contained specific recommendations for developing and deploying the next generation advanced hardware, networking, storage, visualization, and software resources for the national computational science research community, thereby impacting a very broad community of faculty, students, and research staff who depend on this cyberinfrastructure.  Beyond the recommendations for enhancements to traditional cyber infrastructure, crucial interdisciplinary computational methodologies and tools needed to support scientific Grand Challenge problems of the coming decade were also identified.  Finally, another broader impact of the workshop was the conclusion that serious changes in undergraduate and graduate educational programs are needed to prepare students for the new landscape of interdisciplinary computational science research.
