<AbstractNarration>This project entails the design of a new computational framework based on music compositional process and sketching to map and identify  patterns in large-scale complex scientific data sets. This research project will be undertaken at the California NanoSystems Institute AlloSphere, University of California, Santa Barbara. The Allosphere is one of the largest 3D immersive display devices in the world for scientific visualization and artistic instrumentation. Leveraging mathematical concepts and constructs for binding structure and information flow in scientific and artistic research, the computational framework will incorporate a three-dimensional hierarchical sketching system that will be the basis for structural representation. Sonic marking of patterns in large datasets and techniques in music composition will be explored as ideal methods to identify complex integrated layers of data as music carries meaning on several time-scales, from individual timbres and pitches to short melodies and rhythms all the way up to large-scale form and structure of a work, each engaging distinct perceptual and cognitive processes.  Real-time, interactive representations of the data in the AlloSphere will allow researchers to rapidly prototype parametric systems for more time-consuming and resource-demanding simulations and experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representing complex scientific data through large-scale immersive 3D audiovisual data representation will facilitate understanding to a wide audience, from advanced researchers who will be able to communicate across disciplines, to the general public. The AlloSphere will motivate dissemination of engineering and science research to wide audiences in education and society, through this new software platform that will allow a broader public to comprehend science that would be out of their reach of understanding.  The AlloSphere Research Facility has its own formal outreach initiative that services the CNSI's Professional Outreach Program, that coordinates research interns, undergraduates and high school students through programs such as; (1) The after-school LEAPS (Let's Explore Physical Science) program works with eighth grade students and plans to start an independent research project option for high school seniors; (2) The INSET (NSF Internships in NanoSystems Science, Engineering and Technology) program recruits students from largely underrepresented groups from California community colleges for eight-week summer internships; (3) The Apprentice Researchers program engages high school juniors in individual laboratories at UCSB.</AbstractNarration>
