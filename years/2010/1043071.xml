<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18 June 2010&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1043071&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI)&lt;br/&gt;PI:   D. Fisichella&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests operational funding to support the UNOLS East Coast Winch Pool in CY 2010.  The equipment pools support scientific operations aboard vessels in the US academic research vessel fleet as well as other federally-supported science projects aboard US government and non-government research vessels.  The types of winches available (or soon to be available) through the pools include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Light-duty direct pull winches&lt;br/&gt;2.  Medium-duty direct pull and traction winches&lt;br/&gt;3.  Heavy-duty traction winches (JASON winch)&lt;br/&gt;4.  Mooring recovery winches&lt;br/&gt;5.  Specialized handling systems such as GEO Traces and Long Core&lt;br/&gt;6.  Portable cable spoolers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These winches and handling systems support a wide variety missions on all UNOLS vessels.  The UNOLS East Coast Winch Pool, and corresponding West Coast Winch Pool at Scripps, will also serve to ensure that the equipment meets current UNOLS standards, provides commonality of design, and provides proper maintenance, administrative and logistical support to the academic fleet and the science community at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed UNOLS East Coast Winch Pool.  The shared-use equipment purchased, and the administrative structure established to support the equipment, will provide improved services to both the vessel operators and the scientific community.  The Winch Pool structure will also ensure proper maintenance of equipment, commonality of design, compliance with current standards, and efficiencies to NSF with regard to logistics, tracking and oversight of certain shared-use assets.  The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit.  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute participates in a large number of outreach programs including web broadcasts from vessel while at sea, open house events, and other initiatives such as ?Dive and Discover? with the submersible ALVIN.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The UNOLS East Coast Winch Pool provides over boarding systems, wire spooling, wire lubrication and engineering support of the highest quality to the scientific community and UNOLS fleet.  Our specific objective is to provide over boarding systems that meet the demanding needs of researchers which are in excellent condition for worry free operation even in the harshest environments. In the event that there is an issue with equipment we provide, the staff works around the clock to insure that there is as minimal of an impact to the scientific goals as possible.  Requirements of science groups for portable winch systems can sometimes exceed the original design specifications. Our objective is to adapt our systems to meet the needs of the community by utilizing in house engineering and fabrication solutions. This reduces the need for purchasing expensive new equipment by adapting our current systems to meet those requirements.  We also want to insure that each user of equipment has been trained in its safe operation.  The winch pool has seen a vast improvement in the quality of portable winches being delivered to vessels in support of field work. We have added numerous blocks, slip rings and other support items to our inventory. Shop tools and equipment have been updated, staff training has increased and an increase in request for non NSF projects has reduced the direct cost to NSF.  As word of the ECWP has spread, more groups are contacting us for engineering advice. This will lead to more uniform practices across the fleet as to how winches are operated and also improve safe operating procedures.  We have experienced a significant improvement of system reliability through regular testing and maintenance programs. Our inventory has also increased not only in winches but in other over boarding necessities such as slip rings and blocks.  Since the inception of the ECWP, winch days at sea have increased every year as well as the number of winch request.  The ECWP has also improved on its relationships with other groups throughout the scientific community including the wire pool and the various marine operations offices.
