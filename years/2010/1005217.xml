<AbstractNarration>This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site focuses on nanoscience and microsystems. Transforming nanoscale science into systems is the unifying theme, with technical thrusts on: (1) nanoscience of biosystems, (2) nanomaterials for energy conversion and (3) microsystems. A diverse range of projects provide unique research experiences for twelve undergraduates each summer. The interdisciplinary environment brings together faculty from six departments on campus and includes student mentors from nearby Sandia National Laboratories. Students also participate in a series of seminars that include faculty, national lab and industry speakers, as well as a series of seminars that addresses the role of ethics in the modern research environment. Field trips to Los Alamos National Laboratories and to local industries enhance the students' exposure to career opportunities and exciting research problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The synthesis and processing of materials for the 21st century requires a new paradigm where chemistry, physics, biology, engineering and computational modeling come together.  The unique aspect of our REU site program is the interdisciplinary environment, which is an essential component of materials research.  We accept students majoring in materials science, ceramics, chemistry, physics and chemical, mechanical, civil and electrical engineering.  They work with faculty and research mentors in a collaborative environment that is designed to enhance interaction among the research groups.  This interdisciplinary team approach reflects the environment these students will encounter as they transition to their careers in industry, academe or in national labs.
