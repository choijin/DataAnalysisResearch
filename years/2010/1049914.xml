<AbstractNarration>Recent studies with invasive species have revealed that evolution plays an important role in the successful invasion of new habitats. For plant species involved in continent-wide invasions, the expectation is that the well known north-south increase in the number of herbivore species should favor the rapid evolution of increased resistance to herbivores at lower latitudes. This prediction will be tested using the common reed, Phragmites australis. The common reed is widely distributed across European and North American marshes; in the past 100 years a European variety of this species has invaded and rapidly spread throughout North America. The first objective is to test whether the common reed has undergone rapid evolution to form a north-south gradient in traits associated with anti-herbivore defense. The second objective is to quantify differences in plant defenses between native and invasive varieties of the common reed that occur together in the same marshes and on separate continents, and to evaluate how these differences may affect invader success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be the first study to test whether herbivores influence the evolution and the invasion success of invasive species at the scale of whole continents. This research will provide invaluable data regarding the potential negative effects that the invasive common reed variety is having on the less common varieties that are native to North America. The PIs will provide research experience, mentorship and training for two graduate and up to four undergraduate students. The PIs will also participate in a variety of programs that promote undergraduate research and public awareness of the detrimental effects of invasive species.</AbstractNarration>

Interestingly, the difference in herbivory between native and invasive reeds is much greater at southern latitudes suggesting that if herbivores are important to the survival of these plants, as the data suggests, then invasion success is likely to be greater in the south than the north. In corresponding garden studies, invasive reeds show evidence of being adapted to the environmental conditions associated with the latitude from which those plants were collected. This finding demonstrates that invasive reeds have evolved in the roughly 150 years since arriving in NA in response to the latitudinal variability in herbivore pressure and/or the local environment. Furthermore, replicated studies in Louisiana and RI gardens indicate that genotypes of invasive reeds are more flexible (plastic) in response to changes in the environment (e.g., different garden locations) than genotypes of the native reeds. Being flexible in response to different environmental conditions is thought to be a characteristic of a good invader. Overall, the findings from this study suggest that 1) large-scale geographic variation in plant-herbivore interactions is common; 2) managers of invasive species need to consider that invasion success can depend on geography; 3) invasive species can evolve rapidly in response to geographic variation in the environment; 4) invasive success of European reeds in North America is potentially due to escape from herbivores and that this escape is greater in the south than the north, and because they are more flexible i...]]></DRECONTENT>
