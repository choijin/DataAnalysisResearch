<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) to establish an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) program. The program will provide one-year research experiences in quantitative biology and informatics to four cohorts of scholars, starting in the summer of 2011 and continuing through 2015. Each cohort consists of seven students who will explore problems using integrative quantitative inquiry.  This program seeks to enhance the pool of multicultural and multidisciplinary workforce of scientists and professionals by offering experiential learning opportunities in computational and wet laboratories, as well as academic and career development activities, to community college students. Recruitment will be through collaborating Hispanic-serving institutions. The program will also provide long-term mentoring and will encourage family support and participation.  Students will be able to select from topics in plant and animal bioinformatics, quantitative genetics and plant breeding, statistical genomics, architecture of complex traits, food nanotechnology, biological system modeling, and statistics for agriculture. Students will participate in (1) a 12-week, summer, intensive research immersion experience, (2) mentor-guided academic year research, and (3) an optional second summer internship experience.  The research will be complemented with academic and career advancement, network development, and support activities. Project evaluation will assess the quality of research, oral presentations, and student and mentor interactions, as well as skills assessment using pre and post test instruments and student feedback on the program.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>BACKGROUND: The generation of large biotechnology and omic data sets has the potential to revolutionize biology and agricultural research. However, a limited number of individuals possess the quantitative and informatics background, combined with a firm grounding in biology and agricultural sciences, necessary to make full use of these large datasets and enhance agricultural sustainability and community wellness. The participation of students from underrepresented groups and women in these fields is even lower. For example, Illinois holds the fifth growing Latino population of the country (19% of the population) while there are not enough minority students in higher education (8%), let alone at Illinois universities and the life and information sciences. By 2030 and nationwide, there will be 65 million citizens of Latino origin. This population must contribute to the expanding workforce. The lack of diversity of the workforce is acknowledged by NSF with the strategic priority of taping the talents of all our citizens, especially those underrepresented in the science and research enterprise. The challenge is how to fulfill this priority without sacrificing the strategic priority of quality. The <em>University of Illinois at </em><em>Urbana-Champaign</em> (UIUC) has invested considerable effort in trying to increase the number of successful minority graduate students in the biological sciences with limited success. For example, there is need of triplicating the number of Latino students registering for careers in STEM an increasing the representation of women in fields such as genomics. The main goal of our <em>Undergraduate Research Mentoring in New Biology</em> (URM-NB) program include increasing academic, leadership and scientific preparation by providing opportunities to minorities and women and enhancing the quality and diversity of the workforce of scientists and engineers needed for the new disciplines and approaches unfolding in the life sciences.</p> <p>STRATEGY AND INTELLECTUAL MERIT: We promote quality education and extend the boundaries of biology to new frontiers with effective academic and internship experiential opportunities in quantitative biology and informatics at UIUC. The focus of our program is the &lsquo;new biology&rsquo; of the late Carl Woese, an appreciation that major challenges in biology cannot be tackled without integrating mathematics, physics, engineering, and information sciences. The overarching goal is to establish an &lsquo;engagement pipeline&rsquo; that would increase recruitment of minorities and women interested in STEM into higher education while engaging them in undergraduate research experiences, priming them for graduate careers, and establishing student-mentor relationships that would facilitate their graduate college experience and would span lifetimes. The URM-NB program we established provided year-round experiences to 4 cohorts of 7 undergraduate students recruited from the State of Illinois, immersing them in the world-class academic and research environment of our university and providing them with academic and career development opportunities. These experiences enabled experiential learning in several areas of inquiry, including plant and animal sciences, food science and human nutrition, agricultural engineering, and agriculture and consumer economics, areas represented in five participating departments of our College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences.</p> <p>FINDINGS: We matched students and mentors for their year-long undergraduate research experience. We also offered: (i) intensive graduate-level coursework on Applied Bioinformatics every day for four weeks of the first summer; (ii) academic and career advancement activities during the rest of that summer; (iii) a GRE Institute that prepared them for the standardized test via an intense two-week program during the second summer, and (iv) a campus-wide Illinois Summer Research Symposium where cohort participants presented their research as posters and oral presentations. We founded i-ALAS, a faculty group that follows a grassroot model of student engagement. i-ALAS gained considerable extramural funding with the goal of a sustainable engagement pipeline.</p> <p>BROADER IMPACTS: The success of the URM-NB program can be appreciated by the impact it had on the careers of its students. Our 4-cohort program recruited 28 Illinois students, 60% of which were minorities mostly of Latino origin and 68% were women. By the end of 2016, 61% URM-NB fellows entered graduate school.

Almost all students of the last cohorts have already applied and some have been accepted to graduate school.
