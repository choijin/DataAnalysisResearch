<AbstractNarration>CNS - 1004409  &lt;br/&gt;REU Site: Digital Forensics Research In Rhode Island&lt;br/&gt;Wolfe, Victor    &lt;br/&gt;University of Rhode Island&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a renewal proposal with the main topic of digital forensics  ?  the relatively new science of examining evidence in digital form, such as that which exists on storage media and is communicated in network activity.  The project continues to be a cooperative project among researchers and faculty in the Computer Science Department The University of Rhode Island.  It aims to bring six to ten undergraduate students to computer forensics research during a 10-weeks REU site.   The goals of the project include higher computer science retention rates, greater numbers of students who are women and from minority groups who will continue in computer science and related majors.  It also aims to increase recruitment of graduate programs, and to develop skills which will prepare students in a variety of occupations.</AbstractNarration>

Undergraduate student participants engaged in self-contained research projects that were part of URI faculty projects funded from the U.S National Science Foundation, the U.S. Dept. of Justice, and the U.S. Dept of Homeland Security. These projects were in digital forensics &ndash; the science of examining evidence in digital form, such on hard drives and in network activity; and in cyber security &ndash; which involves protecting information systems from unauthorized access.   Each student: undertook a seminar series to assist them in understanding the research process; chose a research project; prepared a research proposal that was peer reviewed by their colleagues and mentors; implemented the research project that they proposed; developed an oral presentation of their work; developed a written presentation of their work as a poster and a research paper; and several disseminated their research results through publication and presentation in Computer Science academic venues.     Of the 25 students that participated in the REU site over its three years, there were primarily students from four-year undergraduate programs who would not normally be exposed to research, including students from typically under-represented groups.
