<AbstractNarration>The current state of knowledge in the area of complex networked systems lacks formal theories that can accurately predict, and hence help control the behavior of such systems. The scientific objective of this project is to develop a theoretical basis to understand, analyze, and control emergent behavior in complex systems operating in uncertain environments. In order to validate the theoretical ideas, the project specifically considers complex swarm robotic systems and aims to apply the proposed analytical framework to such systems. The central approach uses the mathematical framework of stochastic differential equations wherein the swarm is treated as a dissipative Hamiltonian system coupled by nonlinear interacting potentials. In this framework, the influence of uncertainties (noise) is treated mathematically using both the discrete and continuum formulations to be obtained from a Fokker-Planck approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research is the development of a theoretical basis for modeling of complex systems and their analysis based upon given control inputs and inherent system uncertainty. This framework facilitates modeling the complex interactions, higher-dimensionality, nonlinearity, and uncertainty in complex systems as well as the control of desirable emergent behavior. Potential future applications of this research include power grids and communication networks. Furthermore, this project has broader impacts that include promoting teaching, training, and learning; broad dissemination to enhance understanding; and involvement of the underrepresented groups. Undergraduate and graduate students are mentored and trained via courses and involvement in research and outreach activities. Broad dissemination is achieved through special sessions, workshops, and tutorials at conferences that target both the dynamic systems and control as well as mathematics communities. Participation of undergraduates and students from underrepresented groups is facilitated via summer projects, summer camps, and other programs such as Women in Science and Engineering and Emerging Ethnic Engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research laid down a mathematical framework for the analysis and design of a system of interacting entities, such as a swarm robotic system, operating in a dynamic and uncertain environment with an emphasis on characteristics such as stability, robustness, and emergent behavior. The research focused on three areas: i) a new theoretical model for an ant foraging system based on bacterial chemotaxis models; ii) development of control laws for a swarm robotic system engaged in cyclic pursuit behavior; and iii) development of distributed optimization methods for complex networked systems.  Intellectual Merit:  With respect to the first topic, the research developed a novel, continuous time reaction-diffusion model based on the Keller-Segel model of bacterial chemotaxis. The model encapsulates the coupled dynamics of ant population density with that of pheromone laying, following, and evaporation in a 2D environment. In addition, the new model accounts for trail formation as an emergent phenomenon arising from discrete behaviors exhibited by ants such as stochastic search for food sources and ferrying food back to the nest. It was demonstrated via numerical simulations that the model could account for recent experimental observations related to adaptive behaviors seen in some species of ants. The model and the results are expected to contribute to building engineered complex systems such as robotic swarms that can mimic the remarkable, adaptive characteristics exhibited by biological systems.  The second area relates to the development of control laws for a robotic swarm engaged in cyclic pursuit behavior. Using double integrator dynamics, the research developed two control approaches. It was shown through analysis and simulations that the proposed pursuit models with homogeneous controller gains converged to stable configurations while starting from very general conditions of arbitrary initial configuration of agents.  Finally, the research developed a distributed optimization technique for application in complex networked systems such as smart grids and cloud computing. The high dimensionality and the dynamic and uncertain nature of operation of these complex networks make the optimization problem very challenging. The research developed techniques based on the market framework which can be implemented in a distributed domain, and evaluated the techniques via extensive simulated scenarios of smart grid and cloud computing.  Broader Impacts:  The fundamental research carried out as a part of this project also impacts applications in a number of areas such as the engineering of complex systems inspired by the dynamics of biological systems, search and rescue operations in large-scale disasters, wildfire monitoring, and oil spill surveillance. Similarly, the market based techniques have great potential for application in real-world resource allocation problems in complex networked systems. PIs have been utilizing these results in some of the applications such as resource allocation in power grids, cloud computing, and missile defense.  The research involved training one senior research associate, two graduate students, and nine undergraduate students. The project also organized the Robotics Module in the 5-week long Summer Institute program in 2011 at the University of Cincinnati where approximately 25 students from under-represented groups were given an exposure on various concepts of robotics.
