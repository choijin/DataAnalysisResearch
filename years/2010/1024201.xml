<AbstractNarration>Dr. Karen Brison (Union College) will undertake research on international social and cultural networks outside the United States and Europe that may exhibit features of autonomous global systems independent of economic and political forces. The focus on the research will be international religious connections, one of the most significant areas of international connections, although not one much studied by social scientists. In particular, the researcher will focus her investigation on Fijian Pentecostals, and collect information on ties between Fijian Pentecostals and Pentecostals from other non-Western nations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data collection will focus on two populations: (1) missionaries from an independent Fijian Pentecostal church who work in Tanzania and Kenya, as well as with diasporic communities in the United States and the United Kingdom; and (2) missionaries from African and Korean independent churches work in Fiji. She also will examine the interaction among Pentecostals from around the world who attend conferences in Fiji. The researcher and two American undergraduate students will conduct interviews and collect life history narratives. They also will analyze the content of sermons, testimonies, conversion narratives, prayer meetings and weekly cell group meetings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the research are: i) to delineate the extent and influence of a particular area of international cultural flows -- the transnational Pentecostal community; and  ii) to examine the visions of personal, cultural, and global identity that emerge in this community and the extent to which these visions influence or are influenced by world religious, political, or economic forces.  The research also will further the National Science Foundation's goal of integrating research and education by giving undergraduate students opportunities to participate in the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project analyzed ties between Pentecostal Christian churches in the global south, focusing on an independent Fijian Pentecostal church, referred to as the Harvest Ministry, which sends missionaries to East Africa, Papua New Guinea and other areas of the Pacific, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere.    The specific objectives were:  1) to assess the degree of shared "kingdom culture" among Pentecostals from the global south; did Pentecostals associated with the Harvest Ministry in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and East Africa identify primarily as born again Christians rather than as members of their specific nations and groups? Did they share a common worldview and values? Did they see themselves as different from Euro-American Pentecostals and were their values and beliefs distinct from those of Euro-American Pentecostals? Did Pentecostals from the global south promote cross-cultural dialog on Christianity and questioning of entrenched world inequalities?  2) to look at the appeal of the "prosperity gospel" to Christians in the global south.  The prosperity gospel, which is promoted by the Harvest Ministry and its affiliates, promises "health and wealth" to those who give money to support the church and its many projects including sending missionaries to the "unreached people" of the world. The research assessed people's reasons for belonging to prosperity churches: did they seek material wealth? Did prosperity churches promote free enterprise and consumerism over communal loyalties?     The research revealed:  1) there was no special solidarity among Pentecostals in the global south.  Colonization and post colonial experience differed greatly in Fiji, Papua New Guinea and East Africa leaving Christians from these areas with no special ability to understand each other.  In each area, local identities and loyalties remained strong and each group was strongly influenced by Euro-American ideas.  Each group embraced ideas that highlighted their own special contribution to world Christianity.  2) Fijians, Papua New Guineans and East Africans did not focus on gaining material wealth. Nor did the prosperity gospel appear to erode loyalty to communities. The prosperity gospel appealed to an emerging Pacific middle class that sought to create new kinds of communities and identities that in many ways resembled traditional ones but gave middle class professionals autonomy from rural elders. They also sought ties to a larger world community, where they had many relatives living in diaspora. Prosperity theology created a sense of pride and optimism among Pacific Islanders living in diaspora and at home and reinforced their sense that they were already prosperous and were now poised to contribute to a world community and to take on leadership roles at home.  Church members continued to contribute large sums of money to rural relatives and to church causes so the prosperity gospel did not appear to promote consumerism over communal ties.  In the wake of significant economic collapse in the wake of World Bank structural adjustment policies, East Africans looked to churches to create networks to help build self sufficiency and to build ties to the outside world.   Intellectual Merit: Scholars and the general public have predicted that the base of world Christianity is shifting rapidly to the global south but it is not clear whether Pentecostals in the southern hemisphere have introduced new ideas to Christianity or challenged entrenched world inequalities. The research revealed no substantial shared vision in the global south where different colonial and postcolonial experiences hindered understanding between people from different nations. The research also examines the appeal and impact of the prosperity gospel, an important and growing type of Pentecostalism in the southern hemisphere. The research revealed that the prosperity gospel did not generally promote economic individualism and consumerism and people did not join prosperity churches to get...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
