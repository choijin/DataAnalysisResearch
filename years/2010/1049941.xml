<AbstractNarration>This research project is tackling challenges associated with migrating enterprise applications to the cloud, including (i) models to predict the impact on performance; (ii) methodologies for assurable policy reconfiguration; and (iii) architectures for cloud data-centers that can provide quality of service guarantees. This project is exploring how GENI can help validate our research, and will use resources including ProtoGENI, Planetlab, and Openflow.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Evaluations using a realistic environment such as GENI will (i) aid in determining models for predicting application performance that make an appropriate trade-off between accuracy and complexity; (ii) enable evaluation of designs for cloud data-center architectures; and (iii) lead to insights on principles for architecting cloud data-centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  If successful, the project will have a transformative effect on IT organizations by enabling them to migrate to the cloud. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students on the use of GENI.</AbstractNarration>
