<AbstractNarration>The Grand Valley State University Mentoring, Academic Support, and Scholarships for Science Students program supports academically talented, innovative, and creative students with demonstrated financial need.  The program recruits transfer students from nearby Grand Rapids Community College. Scholarship students are selected based on a personal statement, letters of recommendation, a plan of study, and academic accomplishments. The program provides 30 scholarships per year. The disciplines supported are: biology, cell &amp; molecular biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geology, integrated science, information systems, mathematics, physics, and statistics. Students selected to participate in this program progress through the program as a cohort, both as a collective group and as smaller discipline-specific groups. Each student is matched with a faculty mentor who is an advocate throughout his or her academic career. Scholars are supported from admission through graduation.</AbstractNarration>
