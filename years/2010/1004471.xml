<AbstractNarration>Project Summary: This REU site project focuses on the Social Psycho-physiology of Compassion (SPC) within the Department of Psychology. It builds upon a successful legacy of prior REUs by providing research experiences for Native American, Hispanic, African American, Native Alaskan, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students, including first generation college/university students who are disabled, female, White, and Veterans. Each undergraduate student participating in this project conducts research focused on Compassion, under the guidance of active Psychology Department researchers. A similar program (on a reduced scale) in the Northern Arizona University's Psychology Department was partially funded by the NSF during Summer 2008 and was highly successful. This REU site enhances that successful program with a new thematic focus, on Compassion research, directed at minority students and particularly at Native American students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. This research internship addresses eight important intellectual components: (1) Direct, closely supervised, hands-on original research experiences in individual faculty laboratories provided by an experienced, productive, and stimulating faculty research mentor, (2) Faculty seminars on various aspects of scientific research, (3) Professional, educational, cultural, and career development seminars, (4) Weekly noon science symposia, (5) A variety of unique educational, cultural, environmental, and social activities, (6) Student presentations at a local professional REU conference, (7) Presentation of research outcomes at national professional conferences, and (8) Co-participation of Psychology REU students with REU students from other programs in seminars, lectures, and local research presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. This program has far-reaching implications for both the expansion of scientific thinking and inquiry and the advancement of society. (1) Direct recruitment of underrepresented minority students via live campus visits and presentations, innovative college liaisons toward increased engagement of under-served minorities in research, and on site research and educational collaborations of minority students and faculty greatly broadens participation of under-represented minorities in social science research. Specific tangible research outcomes, student presentations at professional meetings, research mentoring, and collegial group sharing of the research process developed over a summer session give each student a sense of ownership in a scientific project and process, and a personalization of the experience to facilitate continued careers in science. (2) Intensive collaboration with dedicated career academic researchers and teaching during weekly seminars by undergraduate students from diverse cultural backgrounds is very likely to instill a lasting excitement for science in general and for the SPC specialty areas in particular, thus advancing creative discovery while simultaneously promoting cross-fertilization of scientific exploration, knowledge acquisition, skills training, and a commitment to the art of teaching and research. (3) Utilization of existing educational training facilities for summer research internships enhances the university's research and educational infrastructure. (4) Participation of interns and mentors in interdisciplinary seminars, workshops, research, education, and national conferences broadens dissemination and enhances interdisciplinary scientific understanding. (5) The planned innovative and comprehensive analysis of this REU site program allows for a yearly evaluation and fine-tuning to better achieve objectives and to improve the future identification, training, and development of behavioral research scientists in this country. Most importantly, and perhaps most uniquely for this REU site program, (6) the planned research projects and thematic focus on compassion offers important answers to probing societal questions and ultimate benefits to society, and the development of a generation of young researchers whose careers are dedicated to the understanding and creation of the expression of compassion, the easing of suffering of others, and the promotion of a more compassionate world.</AbstractNarration>

Highlights of these outcomes are summarized below.             After receiving initial funding in 2010 only 3 weeks before our application deadline, we attracted over 160 applications for our 8 intern positions.  Our applicant pool far exceeded the 2011 DOE distribution of minority students enrolled in degree-seeking institutions.  Over the succeeding 2 years of funding, we accelerated this recruitment program, not only increasing the number of applicants to ~250/year, but in many cases further meeting or exceeding these guidelines.  Furthermore, our accepted interns were all under-represented minorities, with our targeted Native American applicant pool as high as 14 times larger than the national average and with an average over the 3 years of 8.4 times larger.              Programmatically, our REU was very well received by our interns.  On a scale from 1-5 (5=most positive), ratings ranged from a low of 2.75 to a high of 5.00, a perfect rating by all interns.  Averages across the 3 years indicated some particularly excelling components of the program, like internÆs relationships with their mentors, excitement with Compassion research ideas, cultural experiences offered, quality and breadth of the research conducted, research preparation, satisfaction with research outcomes and especially with the opportunity to present those outcomes, among others. Furthermore, our interns felt that their REU experiences prepared them very well indeed for graduate school and for careers in science (average ratings = ~4.70), and with an average likelihood of pursuing a career in science of 4.68.  Furthermore, all of our interns planned on continuing their education on to graduate school and most into careers in science.              Analysis of questionnaire data revealed rather consistently increasing scores from pre- to post-internship. Our interns tended to shift their style of learning toward a more thinking style.  They also moved their work and family orientation more toward an active persistence and mastery of tasks.  The perceived likelihood of future employment in a psychology-related field also significantly increased.  And career interest in and perceived usefulness of psychology in science careers significantly increased. Attitudes toward science changed significantly toward the perception of scientists as more healthy, toward science as more fun, and toward the pursuit of careers in science.  All of these changes were in the desired directions, but the latter, and one of the programmatically more significant changes, is directly supportive of the purposes of NSF-REU programs, to stimulate careers in science!             Furthermore, regarding productivity, each intern produced a tangible research outcome from their internship, prepared and presented a poster and an oral presentation at our Annual REU Research Conference in Flagstaff, and each went on to present their research at a regional and/or national conference.  A total of 18 professional poster sessions, 15 formal oral presentations, and 6 manuscripts published, submitted, or in preparation have been generated.  Additionally, 6 of our 2011 and 1 of our 2010 interns journeyed to Orlando, Florida to present 7 oral papers and 7 posters, and 6 of our 2012 interns journeyed to Honolulu, Hawaii to present 7 oral papers and 7 posters, both at the prestigious Annual Conventions of the American Psychological Association (APA), the largest...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
