<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to conduct observations in the near-infrared part of the spectrum to obtain light curves for a sample of 100-200 Type 1a Supernovae in order to investigate cosmic acceleration and dark energy.    The program will extend work done over the past several years to greater distances (redshifts of 0.03 to 0.08) using a new, high-throughput camera to be built for the du Pont 2.5 m telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.  The resulting data set will serve as the definitive low-redshift reference for future rest infrared observations of supernovae at high redshifts with the James Webb Space Telescope and/or JDEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate students (including Chilean students) and a postdoc, and outreach to underserved elementary school students.  Carnegie also conducts various public outreach programs in astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In the 1920s, Edwin Hubble discovered that the spiral nebulae &ndash; what we today call galaxies &ndash; were outside of our own galaxy at huge distances, fundamentally changing our concept of the size of the Universe. Hubble also discovered that the Universe was expanding &ndash; i.e., that the galaxies were moving away from each other &ndash; leading to the idea that the Universe was born in a giant explosion (the &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo;) billions of years ago. Allan Sandage carried forth Hubble&rsquo;s legacy, devoting much of his career to measuring the current rate of expansion of the Universe, or what we call the &ldquo;Hubble Constant&rdquo;. While measuring the speeds of the galaxies was relatively straightforward using spectroscopic techniques, determining their distances required the use of &ldquo;standard candles&rdquo;: objects whose intrinsic brightness is known and can be compared to the brightness measured in the telescope. The dimmer the object, the farther away it must be.</p> <p>In the 1930s, Walter Baade and Rudolph Minkowski showed that certain supernovas &ndash; the violent deaths of stars &ndash; displayed remarkably similar light curves and spectra. Based on these findings, Olin Wilson suggested in 1939 that these supernovas &ndash; which we call &ldquo;Type Ia&rdquo; today &ndash; could be used to measure distances to galaxies and determine the expansion rate of the Universe. More than 50 years passed before this suggestion became a reality when the first precision measurements of the Hubble constant were made using Type Ia supernovas. Around the same time, two teams attempted to go one step further: to measure the rate of deceleration of the expansion of the Universe using Type Ia supernovas. They wanted to answer the question of whether the expansion would continue forever, or if gravity would eventually cause the Universe to re-collapse in a &ldquo;Big Crunch&rdquo;. To their great surprise, in 1998, both teams discovered that the expansion of the Universe is not slowing down, but is actually speeding up, implying the existence of a mysterious repulsive force we now call &ldquo;dark energy&rdquo; that works against gravity and accounts for approximately 70% of the total energy in the Universe today.</p> <p>Understanding the nature of dark energy will require an accurate and unbiased measurement of the Universe&rsquo;s expansion history. In 2003, the Carnegie Supernova Project (&ldquo;CSP&rdquo;) was initiated to test the ultimate precision of Type Ia supernovas as standard candles. The CSP monitored the brightness of more than 300 Type Ia supernova explosions on approximately 2,000 nights with telescopes at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. The main goal of the CSP is to use the combination of infrared and visual wavelength observations to improve the precision of distant measurements with Type Ia supernovas to better than 5%.

Today, the CSP observes the velocity versus brightness of much brighter, and hence more distant, standard candles &ndash; the Type Ia supernovas (blue points). Each point in the Figure represents a single supernova that exploded in a host galaxy. By measuring the spectrum of the galaxy and making use of the Doppler effect (objects speeding away from us have their spectra shifted to the red by an amount proportional to the speed), we can determine how fast the galaxy is receding from us (the value on the vertical axis).
