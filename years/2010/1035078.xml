<AbstractNarration>The Paleontological Research Institution (PRI, located in Ithaca, NY) is helping educators from informal, formal, and nonformal (Cooperative Extension) settings to collaboratively toward outreach on energy development, environmental impacts, and climate change. PRI is providing professional development to educators in (especially rural) communities, who are developing presentations and resources that focus on: 1) the Earth system science of their communities; 2) environmental perspectives ranging from local to global; 3) learning within and networking among communities; and, 4) effective non-confrontational communication strategies. The project is being implemented in an area of active and potentially active shale gas drilling (Pennsylvania and the Southern Tier of New York State) that is underlain by the Marcellus Shale. Many communities are debating the pros and cons of gas drilling in their neighborhoods, in some cases resulting in polarized debates around speculative or biased Earth system science information. In some areas, wind farms and biofuels agriculture are also under development. The professional development is designed to proactively help educators talk to their communities about energy choices, provide outreach before polarization occurs, and respond quickly with high quality science education and vetted information resources when controversy arises.</AbstractNarration>
