<AbstractNarration>This work will provide the first continental-scale sample of taxonomic, genetic and&lt;br/&gt;functional diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi from pine ecosystems. These fungi form symbiotic relationships with the roots of dominant forest plants, and provide them with nutrients and water in exchange for photosynthetically-fixed carbon. Despite the importance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in global nutrient cycles, little is known about large-scale patterns of fungal community structure relative to plants, animals, or even bacteria. This project will establish patterns of gene flow and selection for multiple ectomycorrhizal fungi across North America, use a hierarchical phylogenetic sampling design to measure variation in functional enzyme production across individuals, populations and species, and use RNA based metagenomics to measure functional trait expression on mycorrhizal root tips. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a large, open access database of taxonomic barcode and functional genes that can be used by researchers to generate predictive models of fungal ecosystems. It will include training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in cutting-edge techniques in an understudied field, will result in outreach activities targeted toward the general public, and will include activities for K-12 students and educators designed to foster early student interests in fungi.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF-sponsored project addresses the genetics of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), a keystone group of soil fungi associated with conifer forests across North America. EMF provide their plant hosts with necessary soil resources such as nitrogen, phosphorous, and water, in exchange for photosynthetically fixed carbon, and are emerging as a model system for understanding linkages between microbial communities and ecosystem function.  Despite the importance of EMF and other soil fungi for global nutrient cycles, we still know little about the molecular basis of functional diversity among different EMF species that associated with different pine hosts.  This project has addressed the taxonomic, functional and genetic diversity of EMF at multiple spatial scales through the use of nextgen sequencing, enzyme assays, metatranscriptomics, and population genomics.    The Vilgalys lab (Duke University) role in this study has been to develop metagenomic approaches to assess genetic activity and identify key functions of different microbes in natural soil including conversion of carbon and the regulation of plant access to nitrogen and phosphorus.   We have developed new methods for metatranscriptomic analysis of interactions between EMF) and their pine hosts in both native and experimental forest soil systems.  These studies are providing new insight into fungal functioning within natural forest soil ecosystems.  Using soil metatranscriptomics, the activities of dominant EMF could be identified and assigned to specific individual fungal species.   These approaches permit us to analyze nutrient cycling gene expression patterns for conserved and unique soil enzymes at a fine dimensional scale.
