<AbstractNarration>Phaeocystis antarctica is capable of forming blooms that are denser and more extensive than any other member of the Southern Ocean phytoplankton community.  The factors that enable P Antarctica to dominate its competitors are not clear but are likely related to its colonial lifestyle.   The goal of the project is to map all the reactions in metabolic pathways that are key to defining the ecological niche of Phaeocystis antarctica by developing a Pathway/Genome Database (PGDB) using Pathway Tools software.  The investigators will assign proteins and enzymes to key pathways in P. Antarctica, continually improve and edit the database as the full Phaeocystis genome comes online, and host the database on the BioCyc webpage.  The end product will be the first database for a eukaryotic phytoplankton genome where researchers can query extant metabolic pathways and place new proteins and enzymes of interest within metabolic networks.  The risk is that a substantial percentage of catalytic enzymes may belong to pathways that are poorly characterized.  The science impact is to link genomes to metabolic potential in the context of Phaeocystis life history but also in comparison to other organisms across the tree of life.  The education and outreach includes work with a high school teacher and intern and curriculum development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proliferation of genomic sequence information has provided unprecedented insight into the myriad ways that a diverse array of organisms adapts to their respective environments.  We constructed a Pathway Genome DataBase (PGDB) from the basic and high salt/super-cooling transcriptomes (a list of all the genes that were transcribed by the organism) of the Southern Ocean Haptophyte Phaeocystis antarctica, in order to mine the available data and study specific adaptations of this organism to living in the polar marine environment.  Understanding how genes regulate different biochemical pathways in marine phytoplankton is instrumental for predicting their response to environmwntal changes. To improve our understanding, we produced a KEGG map by combining our control and supercooling transcriptome libraries with 12 other libraries we constructed in the related NSF funded project "Phaeocystis antarctica adaptive responses in the Antarctic ecosystem", which is a collaboration between Dr. Anton Post from Marine Biological Laboratories in Woods Hole and Prof. Kevin Arrigo from Stanford University.  This KEGG map is a first attempt at actually constructing the PGDB for P. antarctica. Even though most biochemical pathways are incomplete, it is clear that this PGDB will focus our further annotation efforts.
