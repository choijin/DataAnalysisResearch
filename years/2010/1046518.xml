<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on development of materials for production of energy from biomass. Liquid fuels and hydrogen can be produced from biomass, promoting energy independence and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. New catalyst materials that are resistant to contaminants found in biomass are needed to make these processes more economical and efficient. In this project, new materials will be fabricated, studied, developed, and then tested in simulated process streams. Effects of process conditions on catalyst performance will be studied and used to produce high-performing materials. The end goal is development of catalysts that can operate in the full range of contaminants found in biomass sources, reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of fuel production from biomass.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are related to reduced dependence of the United States on fossil fuels, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions while promoting energy independence. Unlike fuel crops, biomass is a waste product that has no use for human consumption, so the technology does not compete with food sources. The technology being developed could have application to a wide range of other catalytic reactions as well.  The work being carried out during this project will improve understanding of catalyst deactivation from contaminants. Overall, the project will contribute novel results to the body of literature in catalysis and materials development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Liquid fuels and hydrogen can be produced from biomass, promoting energy independence and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  New catalyst materials that are resistant to sulfur found in biomass are needed to make these processes more economical and efficient.  During the Phase I program, pH Matter identified a class of catalyst materials that demonstrated sulfur tolerance (in the form of hydrogen sulfide, H2S)  in the range commonly found in biomass feed stocks, while still maintaining activity for the water gas shift reaction.  The Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction is an important step in the production of hydrogen from hydrocarbons. Since commercial catalysts are not available for these levels of sulfur, the biomass gas stream must either be cooled to remove sulfur then reheated, or methane is reformed to increase the hydrogen content.  Both approaches hurt efficiency and add capital cost to the process, so novel catalysts are currently being sought by the industry.  The production of energy and liquid fuels from biomass will have a number of beneficial societal impacts.  Biomass gasification processes are carbon neutral, since it uses CO2 that was captured from plants; therefore, biomass gasification will replace energy production from fossil fuels, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Unlike fuel crops, biomass can be garnered from second generation sources like waste products that have no use for human consumption, so the technology does not compete with food sources.  Further, using biomass as a source of liquid fuel will reduce the dependence of our nation on foreign sources of energy.  The technology during the Phase I NSF SBIR program could have application to a wide range of other catalytic reactions as well.  Potential applications include: lean burn diesel engine exhaust treatment, hydrocarbon reforming for fuel cells, electrode materials in fuel cells, and gas-to-liquid processes.  Overall, the project will contribute novel results to the body of literature in catalysis and materials development.       Last Modified: 02/03/2012       Submitted by: Chris Holt]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
