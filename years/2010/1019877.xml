<AbstractNarration>Understanding the formation of the continental crust is key to unraveling earth history and determining the distribution of mineral and material resources within the earth. The continental crust of the southern Rocky Mountain region of the southwestern United States was formed between 1.8 billion and 1.6 billion years ago. The formation of this crust resulted in one of the largest additions of rock material to the North American continent, and produced a large mountain belt similar in scale to the modern Himalaya. Existing age determinations of rocks using radiogenic isotopes have not uniquely determined the time of mountain building and crustal formation.  These researchers will use recently developed techniques to determine the age of the mineral garnet, which is an important rock-forming mineral that is diagnostic of metamorphic conditions during mountain building. Determining the ages of garnet therefore provides the opportunity to better understand the timing of mountain building, and therefore processes of crustal formation in the southern Rocky Mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These scientists will attempt to determine the timing of amphibolite facies metamorphism in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico by directly dating garnets by the Lu/Hf and Sm/Nd methods. The ages should provide robust constraints on the timing of garnet growth and therefore the timing of metamorphism because much of the orogenic belt experienced peak metamorphic conditions between 500 and 650 degrees Celcius; this is well below the closure temperature for the Lu/Hf system in garnet. In regions where temperatures exceeded 600 degrees Celcius, the difference between the Lu/Hf and Sm/Nd ages may indicate the duration of the high temperature metamorphic event. For key samples, we will also date accessory phases using the U/Pb isotopic system, including monazite, xenotime, and zircon. The dating will be tied to detailed studies of porphyroblast matrix relationships in order to directly link deformation to metamorphism. A variety of geothermobarometers will be combined with isochemical phase diagrams, petrogenetic grids, and metamorphic textures to determine the burial and exhumation histories of the dated samples. These data are essential to fully understand the tectonic and geodynamic evolution that led to the formation of the southwestern portion of the North American continent.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The continental crust is a key component of the solid Earth system. The continents are a major source of natural resources, they interact with EarthÆs oceans and atmosphere, and they preserves the record of the evolution of life on Earth. An understanding of the growth of the continents also gives insight into the physical and chemical evolution of the Earth as a whole. North America is considered the classic example of a continent that grew by progressive horizontal attachment of newly created material to the continentÆs margins. Southwestern North America is currently thought to represent one of the largest additions of young crust to the continent in the Precambrian. Recent debate in the geology community has focused on when this new crust was added to the continent and became stable and whether this process involved two or three episodes of mountain building ("orogeny") over hundreds of millions of years. This project sought to constrain the timing of those mountain-building episodes as recorded in the metamorphism and deformation in the Precambrian rocks of the southwestern U.S. We approached this problem by employing lutetium-hafnium ("Lu-Hf") garnet geochronology, a relatively new radiometric age-dating tool for determining the age of metamorphic mineral growth in rocks.  Currently accepted models for the development of the region suggest that newly formed material was added to North America between 1.8 and 1.6 billion years ago, during what is known as the Yavapai and Mazatzal orogenies.  In contrast, our results demonstrate that parts of the southwestern U.S. were not incorporated into the North American continent in their present geometry until 1.4 billion years ago, during the newly recognized "Picuris orogeny".
