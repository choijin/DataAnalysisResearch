<AbstractNarration>1067208&lt;br/&gt;Thompson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several factors such as formation of scar tissue, inadequate removal of inhibitory myelin, cell death and lack of a permissive substrate or growth factors limit the ability of neurons to regenerate after an injury. The guiding rationale is that a tissue-specific biomaterial designed for both resident neural (sensory and motor neurons) and resident non-neural cells (Schwann cells and endothelial cells) of the peripheral nervous system combined with the appropriate soluble factors can serve as the foundation for a superior nerve guidance channel to address these challenges. Rational and combinatorial design strategies for the discovery of synergistic extracellular matrix proteins and soluble factors combinations generating a tissue-specific biomaterial for regenerating axons and support cells will be applied in a physiologically-relevant 3-dimensional environment. The objective is to systematically screen a large subset of matrix proteins, base scaffolds and soluble factors combinations to rationally design composite biomaterials for the peripheral nervous system. The long-term goal is to engineer a biomaterial for treatment of large-gap peripheral nerve injuries. Novel high throughput screening platforms, such as those proposed in this study, will accelerate the discovery of therapeutically relevant biomaterials for large-gap injuries of the peripheral nerve. This flexible platform can be further extended to screen for materials optimal for spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and cell-based therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: If successful, the proposed research will (1) develop a new framework to examine a prohibitively large experimental space for possible combinations of proteins, scaffolds and soluble factors that by conventional methods due to the time, effort and cost (2) identify cell-specific, novel biomaterial that will serve as a basis of a guidance channel to both promote neuronal growth and/or the migration/re-population of non-neuronal cells relevant to peripheral nerve injury, (3) translation of biomaterials relevant to large-gap peripheral nerve injury to injuries in the brain or spinal cord and (4) apply this high-throughput screening platform rationally generate biomaterial candidates for other target tissues of interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: If successful, (1) the proposed research will develop a biomaterial to support nerve repair. (2) The research will include the participation of both high school students and undergraduate researchers. (3) Research findings will be broadly disseminated at national/regional meetings, manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals, and invited lectures.  (4)  Both Principal Investigators and graduate students funded by this project will volunteer by presenting short workshops broadly based on neural engineering to encourage K-12 interest in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Medicine (STEM fields).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal sought to identify cell-specific matrix materials and soluble factors critical for nerve repair, and present these materials in a physiologically-relevant 3D context to generate a composite tissue-specific biomaterial. All possible combinations of matrix proteins, 3D scaffolds and soluble factors are prohibitively large to be tested by traditional methods.   We developed a high throughput platform for generating combinatorial libraries of biomaterials. Our high throughput system comprises of fluid handling elements that create combinatorial libraries by mixing individual components at desired composition and concentration.  In collaboration with the Center for Automated Technologies and Systems at Rensselaer,  a combinatorial mixing system was developed to print primary neurons, glia and endothelial cells.  We describe our approach for evaluating cell responses using a high throughput fluorescent flatbed scanner and an image processing method for analyzing images obtained from scanner. As described in Dumont et al 2014, significant differences were found between both positive control (collagen-matrigel) biomaterial and negative controls (collagen only) with respect to spreading and migration.  However using the cellomics cell array, the ability to analyze the 3D spinning disk confocal, displayed a significantly greater sensitivity to cell response to the biomaterial.  To demonstrate proof of concept,  we investigated mouse brain endothelial cell responses (mbEC) to composite collagen and matrigel biomaterials and determined endothelial cell number and spreading is modulated by both collagen and matrigel concentrations. Cell responses obtained from biomaterials fabricated by combinatorial printer correlated well with control biomaterials printed manually. Taking cues from peripheral nervous tissue microenvironment, we rationally selected candidates for base scaffold, matrix proteins and soluble factors for high throughput combinatorial screening experiments. HTS platform identified ælead synergistic biomaterialsÆ from combinatorial library fabricated from fibronectin, laminin and collagen I. We also evaluated the responses of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to collagen matrigel composite biomaterials. The screening results revealed addition of matrigel did not improve HUVEC response and collagen I is the key protein regulating HUVEC responses.

Indicating the inclusion of resident cells may promote Confocal reflectance microscopy analysis showed length of collagen fibers decreased with increasing matrigel content and collagen started accumulating in distinct pockets within the gel. This indicates mechanical properties of the material is also affected by ECM proteins, which need to be considered. Application of the framework to investigate Schwann cell and neuronal growth was carried out in three thrusts:  1) biomaterial, 2) soluble factors and 3) composite biomaterial.  Using the screen, we rapidly determined the base scaffold concentration and narrowed on the key ECM components that impacted spreading, thus survival.  Migration experiments are in process.  Key soluble factors impacting neurite outgrowth and Schwann cell migration were investigated.  Using the top hits from both the migration and spreading screens, we will determine the optimized biomaterial for co- or tri-culture studies.  These biomaterials, unlike other 3D commercially available scaffolds are defined and can be reproduced.  We would like to investigate if the materials can be produced at a lower cost using synthetic peptides.  To summarize, the high throughput combinatorial screening platform is an "enabling tool" for ratio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
