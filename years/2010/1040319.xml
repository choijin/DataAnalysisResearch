<AbstractNarration>Technical Summary:  Nanoindentation is an advanced mechanical testing technique that probes the surface of a sample to measure material properties at small length scales.  Because of its ability to measure mechanical properties with submicron resolution, nanoindentation has seen growing use in the characterization of advanced engineering and biological materials with relevant structural features at the nano- and microscales.  Testing methods are well-established for stiff, elastic materials such as metals and ceramics.  However, significant research opportunities exist in the application of these methods to complex, composite materials with nanoscale features and in the development of new analysis techniques for testing biological or polymeric materials that are compliant and viscoelastic.  This project involves acquisition of an instrumented nanoindentation system to augment existing materials characterization research in the departments of biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering and biology at Bucknell University, a predominantly undergraduate liberal arts institution.  Specific projects that would be enabled or enhanced by this instrument include: development of new nanoindentation methods for the characterization of compliant, viscoelastic materials such as soft tissues and hydrogels; studying the effects of nanofiller position and orientation on local mechanical property enhancement in polypropylene-graphite nanocomposites; studying the effects of particle size and processing parameters on the mechanical properties of the surface layer of cold spray tungsten carbide-cobalt nanocomposite coatings; and assessment of variation of the material properties of turtle shell bone to investigate the evolution of turtle shells and improve computational models of their structure.  The requested nanoindentation system will foster multi-department and multi-institutional collaborative faculty research opportunities, provide hands-on nanomechanical testing experience for undergraduate and masters students through courses and research projects, and be utilized in outreach programs to increase the exposure of pre-college students to this advanced materials characterization technique.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary:  Nanoindentation is an advanced materials testing technique that measures mechanical properties by pressing a very small tip into a sample of material at precise locations.   Nanoindentation is typically used to test either very small samples (including thin films with thicknesses much less than a human hair) or small regions within larger, complex samples - materials that cannot be testing using traditional mechanical testing tools.  Significant research opportunities exist for using nanoindentation to study composite materials with small-scale features of interest, and for improving nanoindentation methods for testing of soft polymers and biological materials.  This proposal seeks support for an instrumented nanoindentation system to extend existing research programs in the departments of biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering and biology at Bucknell University, a predominantly undergraduate liberal arts institution.  Specific projects that would be enabled or enhanced by this instrument include: development of new nanoindentation methods for testing soft tissues and hydrogels; studying the effects of different manufacturing processes on properties of advanced polypropylene-graphite nanocomposites and tungsten carbide-cobalt nanocomposite coatings with industrial applications; and measuring the material properties of turtle shell bone to investigate the evolution of turtle shells and improve computational models of their structure.  The requested nanoindentation system will support multi-department and multi-institutional collaborative faculty research opportunities, provide hands-on experience for undergraduate and masters students through courses and research projects, and be used in outreach programs to increase the exposure of pre-college students to this advanced materials characterization technique.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanoindentation is an advanced materials testing technique that measures mechanical properties by pressing a very small tip into a sample of material at precise locations.  Nanoindentation is typically used to test either very small samples (including thin films with thicknesses much less than a human hair), irregularly shaped samples, or small regions within larger, complex samples - materials that cannot be testing using traditional mechanical testing tools.  Bucknell UniversityÆs NSF-funded nanoindenter has enhanced the existing materials characterization facilities to facilitate small-scale and multi-scale materials characterization projects.  The nanoindenter has already been incorporated into six multi-disciplinary research projects, with faculty, masterÆs students and undergraduate students completing research projects using the instrument.  This is providing students with hands-on experience using a nanoscale materials characterization tool, and is encouraging faculty to incorporate related topics into courses, thereby increasing student familiarity with the tools and concepts associated with nanoscale materials characterization.  Scientific discoveries being made using the nanoindenter at Bucknell University are helping researchers develop more accurate models for nanoindentation analysis of soft tissues and other soft biomaterials, investigate the effects of different manufacturing variables on properties of advanced polymer-graphite nanocomposites and metallic nanocomposite coatings with industrial applications, study regional variability in turtle bone shells to improve computational models used to study turtle evolution, make more reliable comparisons between experiment and theory in models of compliant mechanisms with robotics applications, and perform more advanced succinic acid particle engineering by facilitating evaluation of internal as well as external morphology of micro-particles (by cracking the particles using nanoindentation).   Although the primary focus of each nanoindentation project was materials characterization, broader applications of the research completed in this proposal include applications in biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, and evolutionary biology.  The validation of nanoindentation methods to provide accurate modulus measurement in soft tissues and other compliant biomaterials provides a new technique for reliable mechanical analysis of tissue engineering scaffolds before and after implantation in small animal models.  The results from analysis of polymer-graphite composites, metallic coatings, and succinic acid micro-particles provide valuable information for optimizing manufacturing techniques, from both mechanical engineering and chemical engineering perspectives.  The results of the turtle bone shell and compliant mechanism studies further demonstrate that nanoindentation can provide accurate modulus values to improve validation and computational modeling studies across a variety of science and engineering disciplines, with applications ranging from robotics to turtle evolution.  Together, these studies demonstrate the utility of nanoindentation as a tool to enhance studies in a range of disciplines by providing accurate materials properties measurements for small or irregularly shaped materials that cannot be measured using traditional macroscale techniques, or by providing a mechanism by which to reveal the internal structures of micro-particles.  The acquisition of a nanoindenter at Bucknell University has greatly enhanced both student and faculty research in soft tissue characterization methods, manufacturing optimization, and computational modeling, with impacts in biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and biology.
