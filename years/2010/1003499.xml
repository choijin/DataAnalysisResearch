<AbstractNarration>This project is increasing the number of skilled biotechnology lab technicians in the Central Kentucky region. The demand for technicians is a direct result of companies locating in the Coldstream Research Park formed by the University of Kentucky. The "Bluegrass Biotech" project is developing certificate and associate degree options in biotechnology; providing professional development for community college faculty and secondary school teachers; building partnerships with business and industry; expanding program enrollment through recruitment activities and dual credit options; and increasing the number of 2+2+2 pathways between area high schools to the biotechnology program at the community college to area four-year institutions.  The activities of this project are being developed through a mentorship funded by the American Association of Community College's Mentorlinks program, and through interactions with faculty associated with the Advanced Technology Education Center of Excellence known as Bio-Link.</AbstractNarration>
