<AbstractNarration>The objective of this EAGER project is to conduct a proof-of-concept study related to the use of inexpensive, abundant and benign bio-based materials to enhance the performance of concrete that is currently used as transportation infrastructure material. In particular, the research will combine wheat fiber and lignin with cement concrete. Lignin acts as a water reducer controlling the water-cement ratio and improving strength and durability. Wheat fiber, on the other hand, acts as a micro-cracking barrier controlling the microstructure crack growth under early age and fatigue conditions. More sustainable concrete, which exhibits higher durability and higher resilience against cracking and fatigue, will be produced by using agricultural waste materials combined with bio-fuel co-products. The proportions of cellulose fibers and lignin, which optimize the performance of the sustainable concrete under short term loading will be determined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is driven by the ultimate goal to benefit the society. Specifically, the use of inexpensive, renewable and environmentally friendly bio-based materials for improved performance, durability and economy of the transportation infrastructure. One M.S. student along with the PI and Co-PIs will be directly involved in the research. The results of the proposed research will be integrated into education through inclusion of various research findings in undergraduate courses. The proposed research will take place in the state of Kansas, an EPSCoR state, thus broadening the participation of geographically underrepresented regions in scientific research and education.</AbstractNarration>
