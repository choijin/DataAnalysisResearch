<AbstractNarration>One of the central problems of low-dimensional topology is the classification of smooth simply connected 4-manifolds. In this direction, a basic question is whether any topological simply connected 4-manifold which admits a smooth structure in fact admits infinitely many. The PI's previous work with R. Stern developed a technique called 'reverse engineering' which can be used to attack this problem. This technique depends on the existence of 'model manifolds' or equivalently the discovery of embedded nullhomologous tori on which surgery can be performed. Until recently, there have been no explicit techniques for finding such tori. However, in the past year, R. Stern and the P.I. have discovered techniques for finding these tori in standard 4-manifolds. This proposal explains how this is done in (2 or more) blowups of CP^2. The embedded nullhomologous tori which are produced can be surgered to create infinite families of homeomorphic but mutually nondiffeomorphic 4-manifolds. The next task is to carry out Floer homology and relative Seiberg-Witten calculations so that our technique can become useful in its most general form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this proposal will address the relationship  between mathematics and theoretical physics, opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in topology, and career  development of postdoctoral fellows. Four-dimensional geometry and  topology has very close ties to physics. For example, the proposer will study geography problems for symplectic manifolds which have been shown to impact physics via the notion of 'superconformal simple type'. Any general results concerning Seiberg-Witten theory hold the prospect of engendering interaction with the physics community, and this will be a basic concern. The search for exotic 4-manifolds has been embraced by the theoretical physics community, and new results on this front will also serve to enhance this relationship. Another basic goal of this proposal is to address 'pipeline issues' in mathematics. Our approach is to to get students and young mathematicians working on interesting problems. A key aspect of this proposal is the development of problems which are accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students. It presents problems which will be suitable thesis problems for students and  research projects for postdoctoral fellows at Michigan State. It also discusses computational problems which are suitable for advanced undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Arguably, the most important result in the topology and geometry of 4-manifolds over the past few years was discovered not by topologists or geometers, but by group representers. This is the result of Prasad and Yeung that there are precisely 50 fake projective planes. A "fake projective plane" or "Mumford plane" is a complex surface with the same betti numbers as CP2. In other words, it is a complex surface which is a rational homology CP2. To this date, there are no geometric (algebro- or differential) or even topological constructions of these manifolds. Algebraic geometers have expended considerable effort on this problem, but without success.   The proposerÃ†s research during this last period has been focussed on constructing these examples as smooth manifolds. As a first stepa few years ago, in joint work with R. Stern, we revisited the construction of exotic smooth structures on CP2#3CP2 in a way that sheds light on the properties that will be needed to be satisfied to construct fake projective planes. This paper is Ã¦Surgery on nullhomologous toriÃ†.   We currently have a construction of a family of manifolds which satisfy all necessary properties. They take the form of a pinwheel which is a generalization of the natural pinwheel structure on CP2, but so that the generator of H2 has (it seems) minimal genus equal to 3 rather than 0. The remaining piece of the argument is to show that these manifolds cannot simply be the connected sum of CP2 with a rational homology 4-sphere. The obvious approach is to calculate the Seiberg-Witten invariants of these manifolds, however, the constructions are complicated enough so that current techniques in Seiberg- Witten and Floer theory do not seem to be sufficient. However, if we are correct, these manifolds must be complex surfaces of general type which are K(&pi;,1)Ã†s. Therefore, they must have a nontrivial small perturbation Seiberg-Witten invariant. We are proceeding in this direction, and also working on showing that our family of manifolds are aspherical.   This problem has turned out to be extremely difficult and remains unsolved. However, we have constructed many other Ã¦fake projective planesÃ† but similarly we are unable to show that they are irreducible. It is a challenge for those working on Floer homology to refine their techniques to the point that they become useful for doing these calculations. In particular, the pinwheels mentioned above provide the simplest examples where bordered Floer homology is required.
