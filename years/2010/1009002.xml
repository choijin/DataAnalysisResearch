<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator and his collaborators study hyperbolic conservation laws, a class of partial differential equations that covers many of the fundamental equations in applied math, and in particular in fluid dynamics. The main lines of current research are: (A) a systematic approach to the study of one-dimensional systems of conservation laws based on geometric properties of their eigen-frames; (B) employing vanishing viscosity approximations to obtain interaction estimates for conservation laws in several space dimensions; (C) radially symmetric solutions to systems of conservation laws, and in particular solutions to the compressible Euler system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the projects are motivated by the need to provide rigorous statements about the properties of physical models that are used by scientists and engineers. The results assess the range of validity of various physical models and will be of use in delimiting and refining existing models. Particular emphasis is put on understanding solutions of complex, nonlinear equations that are used in simulations of e.g. high speed flight, traffic flow, &lt;br/&gt;combustion and detonations.</AbstractNarration>

The project addresses mathematical issues originating in physical models that describe fluid flow, and in particular gas flow. While the basic models have been known since the 1750s, we still lack answers to basic questions related to existence and qualitative properties of the solutions. A mathematical analysis of these issues is a first step toward a proper understanding of extreme regimes of fluid flow that are great practical interest.

A fundamental challenge is to assess the limits of validity of simplified models, and thus be in a position to provide improvements when necessary. What makes the problems mathematically challenging is their non-linear structure. While near-equilibrium situations have been analyzed with some success. However, for large amplitude flows (far from equilibrium) the non-linear nature of the processes becomes dominant and we currently  lack proper answers to even basic questions in such situations. The present project considers a class of models related to gas flow (the Euler equations), as well as systems that, in a precise sense, has a similar structure.
