<AbstractNarration>Consider a moving object whose locations are known at known times. This is the data/process to be studied in the project. It will be called trajectory data. Inherent variability will be assumed making the phenomenon random. The basic process will be assumed to satisfy a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) or a Functional Stochastic Differential Equation (FSDE). In the former case it will be convenient to assume that the object moves in a potential field whose gradient gives the drift term of the SDE. When data are available an approximate likelihood function will be set down for the data. This allows inference procedures such as estimation, simulation and testing to be invoked. The models may be parametric or nonparametric. One or several objects, or particles, may be involved. In the latter case there may be interactions. In the case that explanatory variables are present both fit and predictability may be improved by their inclusion. Practical and theoretical properties of the approach will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Trajectory data appear in many places these days, particularly since the Global Positioning System (GPS) appeared. Locations of individuals of a collection or of just one object are estimated at a succession of times. The times may be equally spaced or not. They may be different for different objects. One object of this work is to develop mathematical and statistical models for the tracks of the objects. These models may be used to examine scientific hypotheses concerning movements as well as to discover novelties. There may be explanatory variables, such as bathymetry, to include in the modeling. The future movement may depend only on the most recent position or it may depend on more past values. The models need to reflect this and allow examination of the assumption. Data from fields including animal biology, marine biology, astronomy, biophysics will be studied as will the implications of unequally spaced data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      "A study of ignitions within perimeters of the 2003 Cedar Fire" (submitted)  Fire perimeters and fire scars are common forms of wildfire measurements. In fact they may be better recorded and described than many other fire characteristics. In the work here it is desired to infer ignition probabilities in cells within a chosen perimeter and time window by fitting a generalized additive model (GAM). The paper provides an analysis of 17 cell perimeters observed for the 2003 Cedar Fire.  The 2003 Cedar fire occurred in Southern California near San Diego. It was and remains the largest fire in California history.  A large data set was created for analytic use by the San Diego community. It was distributed by SAanGIS (2006) and the SDSU San Diego Wildfires Education Project (2003). The latter provided the shape files for the cell perimeters observed by the MODIS satellite at specified times, approximately an hour apart. In the work presented these fire cell perimeters and pertinent explanatory variables, such as wind, are employed to look into a cell, to estimate the probability that a cell has been burnt over, that flames were present in the perimeter interiors at specific time periods.  The paper also presents a description of the contemporary level-set and regularization methods for boundary estimation. They are being applied in many varied situations and in our current and intended future work.  In fact there are many environmental data sets that would appear to benefit from this approach, for example studies of oil spills.  The goal here is to estimate the ignition probabilities for locations within some 17 cell perimeters of the Cedar Fire. Explanatories are available and their individual impacts are of interest and importance. The data are burn scar perimeters, and the time periods the cells were burning. It is also to understand the effects, if any, of explanatories (such as wind speed and wind direction) on the ignition probabilities.
