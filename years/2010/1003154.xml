<AbstractNarration>This interdisciplinary project is designed to increase the number of students pursuing information technology careers by developing a new degree.  Faculty members within Lehigh Carbon Community College's Computer Science and Digital Media departments are developing a two-track associate degree in Computer Game and Simulation Development.  The curriculum is expected to prepare students for immediate employment as technicians as well as for transfer to four-year institutions.  Strategies include learning communities, mentoring by professionals and internships with employers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach activities with high schools including summer camps for students and professional development for teachers enable a 2+2+2 career pathway.  The partnership with employers, secondary schools and four-year institutions will have an impact on regional labor market needs.</AbstractNarration>
