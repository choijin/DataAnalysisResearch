<AbstractNarration>This research will explore the physics related to disorder in condensed matter systems by using ultracold atomic systems as models. Disorder is ubiquitous in real-world materials and often is critical in determining material performance and properties. Understanding the physics of disorder is therefore important to the development of new materials and understanding existing ones. Yet it is challenging because many of the tools of condensed matter physics rely on the periodicity of the underlying lattice structure, which is not the case for disorder.  As a result, many systems that have well developed physical models and solutions become insoluble with disorder present. This work will explore a number of disordered physics issues using model ultracold atom systems using Bose-Einstein condensates. Researchers will investigate disordered two-dimensional systems, which are relevant to many solid-state systems including high Tc superconductors. Using incommensurate optical lattices, research will be carried out exploring the process of quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing.  These topics rely on a system remaining in the lowest energy state even as the system is evolved, which can become hard to satisfy if there are closely spaced energy levels, almost always the case in the presence of disorder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work resides at the intersection of atomic physics, quantum information science, and condensed matter physics. Disorder appears in almost all practical materials, so any further understanding of the physics of disorder will potentially contribute to the development of new materials. The ability to know the system exactly and to have good control over system parameters may allow for more insight into disordered systems than is achievable in solid-state systems. Quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computation are important in the overall development of our ideas about the power of quantum information processing and in general the added utility that a quantum system may have over a classical one.  This work will train postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students to be the next generation of highly skilled workers in the new area of quantum information science and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Much of condensed matter physics concerns itself with ideal systems with periodic order such as crystals.  Yet all real-world materials are imperfect and include some form of disorder, whether it be from impurities, dislocations, domains, or other imperfections.  Often the disorder can greatly modify the properties of the material, making dramatic differences in such things like the ability to conduct electricity.  Disorder is a particularly challenging thing to study in solid-state systems, in that it can be hard to characterize, and may vary from sample to sample.  In this project, researchers create an analog condensed matter system with a gas of ultracold atoms, and controllably add disorder using optical speckle, allowing studies of a disordered system with controllable parameters.  In particular, a two-dimensional system was studied, which is analogous to a thin film superconductor.  In two dimensions, a cold gas of bosons is known to form a Berzinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase, similar in some ways to a Bose Einstein condensate (BEC).  However the theory that applies to this system breaks down in the presence of disorder.  This project explored the phase diagram of this disordered two-dimensional system by loading cold atoms from a BEC into two 2D optically confined planes.  Disorder was added in varying amounts by imaging laser speckle onto the system, and then the atoms were released.  The atoms from the two planes interfered with each other providing a map of the phase of the system.  The main experimental result was the observation that disorder drives phase fluctuations rather than density fluctuations, and is in qualitative agreement with a model developed to explain a superconducting-insulator transition in thin films.  Researchers also observed vortices in the system and some statistical analysis suggests a relationship between vortex formation and strength of disorder.  A new experimental technique to create dynamically controllable planes of atoms with variable couplings was also developed.  This work is an example of atomic physics techniques being used to simulate a difficult condensed matter physics problem, relying on the control and measurement abilities inherent in imaged cold atom systems.
