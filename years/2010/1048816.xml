<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for participants in the Seventh International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS) Conference on Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Wave Phenomena: Computation and Theory," held 4-7 April 2011 at the University of Georgia.  The workshop brings together researchers in theory, computation, and applications of models for nonlinear waves.  The conference program, which includes tutorials suitable for students, is designed to be valuable for young researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will enhance communication among junior and senior researchers in nonlinear evolution equations.  Conference proceedings will be published.  The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, junior researchers, and members of under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  http://www.cs.uga.edu/~thiab/waves2011.html</AbstractNarration>
