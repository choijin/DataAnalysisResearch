<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase II project will develop and commercialize a new energy efficient long-lifed cutting attachment for chipping cellulosic biomass into bio-fuel feedstock while achieving reduced specific energy, significantly longer knife-change intervals, and controllably-fine chips needed by various bio-fuel applications. The innovation involves an adaptation of advanced metal-cutting technology to replace traditional chipper knives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of the project will derive from creating technology to use inexpensive and readily accessible local feedstock for the production of bio-fuels, reducing the cost of feedstock processing upstream of enzymatic hydrolysis.  Energy independence and sustainability along with environmental issues strongly motivate the inclusion of biomass to diversify the national and global energy portfolios.  Cellulosic bio-fuels applications are poised to grow, but exhibit technical and economic challenges, one of which relates to the need for finer feedstock particles and the inefficiencies of increased chipping energy and knife wear that come with finer chipping.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This SBIR Phase-II project set out to commercialize a new longer-life, energy efficient approach to chipping wood for use in biofuel applications.  These applications include micro-chipping for liquid fuel production, and conventional-scale chipping for fueling wood-burning and co-firing furnaces and boilers.  The original focus was on micro-chipping where wood stock, such as forestry trimmings and whole trees or tree tops, are fed into the chipper chute and drum at up to 1/4 inch per knife.  With a market driven move to also allow conventional scale chipping up to 1 inch per knife, space for chips to form and flow, and the ability to withstand the much higher forces, posed a formidable challenge.  A conventional/traditional chipper makes use of one, and as many as three, straight-edged knife blades spaced circumferentially around a drum that spins at around 2,000 rpm.  Each knife is about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, 3-6 inches wide, and has a 45 degree included wedge angle at the cutting edge.  The knives are rigidly attached to the rotating drum with bolts.  Our approach here aimed to extend our expertise in rotating-tooth metal-cutting to wood chipping.  Here, we replace each straight-edged wood-chipping knife with a pattern/series of round cutting teeth that are allowed to rotate as they pass through the wood-stock being chipped.  This rotation allows friction energy to be reduced, hence lowering the amount of energy expended (i.e., chipper fuel burned) per volume of chips produced.  The rotation also allows the entire circumference of each tooth to be used before the need to shut down the chipping operation to change worn-out teeth.  This can reduce shut-down loss of productivity by as much as 75%.  Due to the aforementioned move from micro-chipping to conventional-scale chipping, a fundamentally new approach was needed, referred to as "tangential mount" rather than the usual radial mount used for rotating inserts in metal-cutting  Energy reduction has been shown to fall in the range of 30-45% for both softer and harder hardwoods.  The system also showed potential for similar energy reduction when chopping grassy biomass, such as hay and corn/wheat plants after the grain is harvested.  An additional outcome is the potential to apply the same configuration of round rotating cutting teeth, tangential mount, for a number of metal-cutting applications.  Combined with a more conventional radial mounting of rotating metal-cutting teeth, these tangentially-mounted teeth can provide significantly increased productivity, longer life, and extremely good surface finish as is needed in critical surfaces on metal components that mate with (sliding, rolling, sealing) other surfaces.
