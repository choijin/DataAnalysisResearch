<AbstractNarration>Hampton University, in collaboration with Carnegie-Mellon University, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, the University of the District of Columbia, Norfolk State University, Winston-Salem State University, Morgan State University, Jackson State University, Elizabeth City State University, Duke University, the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa, and the University of Michigan, proposes the ARTSI Alliance (Advancing Robotics Technology for Societal Impact). ARTSI is a consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and major research universities (R1s) working together to increase African American participation in computer science, with a focus on robotics. This extension proposal will expand ARTSI to seventeen Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and roughly 10 major research universities (R1s). Hampton University is the new lead institution; Carnegie Mellon University remains the lead R1 school. The extension introduces three new initiatives that (1) improve the quality and uniformity of robotics instruction by developing robotics curriculum modules specific to the needs of HBCUs, (2) pilot a program to attract STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students to HBCUs by offering robot programming activities in local high schools, and (3) pilot skill-building program for rising sophomores to better prepare them to become involved in robotics research. The extension also includes new collaborations with the Caribbean Center for Computing Excellence (a BPC Alliance in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</AbstractNarration>

The budget for this project was devoted exclusively to the support of these students, allowing them to travel to the University of Michigan, stay in a dormitory, and providing a basic stipend.   Over the course of the project, seven summer internships were provided to six students (one student came for two successive years). During their intensive summer, they pursued research on a range of robotics-related topics such as tracking a robot equipped with special light-emitting-diodes using a camera mounted to the ceiling.  Another group of students helped to develop a small educational robot that we subsequently used in an outreach event at the World Science Festival. This low-cost robot is the first that we know of that can be programmed to navigate a maze by elementary students in under an hour using only a set of knobs and switches on the robot itself (i.e., no typing required).   Ultimately, the project was successful in providing summer research internships, and also successful in encouraging one of the six students to pursue graduate school.
