<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulation of realistic physical phenomena, such as fluid interactions and deformable bodies, has become an indispensable part of both computational physics and computer animation. Such simulations produce stunning visual effects for the entertainment industry but also lead to new discoveries in diverse fields, such as astrophysics, energy production, or understanding the global climate. However, prior to running these simulations on a computer, the mathematical representation of the domain must be discretized in order to minimize computational errors (i.e., to obtain accurate physical results). The increased resolution of modern simulations is making this an increasingly important issue, especially for simulations requiring periodic remeshing or necessitating a fully automated approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current practice in the coupling of discretization and computation has significant weaknesses. The computational tools often demand specific element shapes, e.g. hexahedra, over-constraining the discretization. On the other hand, meshing quality is generally measured by geometric quantities that provide only a limited connection to overall simulation performance. This research is demonstrating a new approach. Theoretical mathematics is used to develop, for the first time, a discretization scheme that is explicitly dependent on the structure of scalar fields generated by the simulation. The key insight is that a topological structure, the Morse-Smale (MS) complex, acts as a natural quadrilateral decomposition of a domain based on a given scalar field, called a background function. The background function behaves as a mechanism for encoding key information from a simulation. The MS complex then acts as a coarse mesh that coincides geometrically with the input domain while aligning itself with simulation properties. Finally, through optimization and subdivision, fine-grained meshes are generated that adapt locally to the resolution needed. This produces a discretization that more accurately follows the target simulations using fewer elements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Exploring Morse Theoretic Tools for   Automatic Mesh Generation and Simulation on Surfaces     Over the course of this project we have developed a method for "skinning," or wrapping surfaces around, particle animations.  Particles are often used in computer animations, but artists often wish to produce an image of a surface.  Our technique (see supporting image 1) generates such surfaces, working on every frame independently without introducing any temporal artifacts or "flickering."  Our technique has already been integrated into the toolset at a major animation studio.   Additionally, we have made initial progress on the central problem described in our proposal: the development of a tightly coupled meshing and simulation system.  We have identified the problem of fluid flows on surfaces as a good testbed for our approach and have nearly completed the simulation system and made progress with regard to automatic mesh generation. In particular, we have worked on automatic and semi-automatic methods for creating high-quality quad meshes from triangulated surfaces. In our work, we follow the premise that topological methods can be used to create quad meshes from the structure of a function on a given 2-manifold, where the function can be generated by a simulation or by a user.  Our quadrangulation framework uses the new notion of Reeb atlas that captures the main features of an input shape, with user prescribed extraordinary vertices and alignment.
