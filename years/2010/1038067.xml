<AbstractNarration>This collaboration among TCUP colleges Cankdeska Cikana Community College Community &lt;br/&gt;College, CCCC, Ft. Berthold Community College, FBCC, Turtle Mountain Community College , &lt;br/&gt;TMCC, and Sitting Bull College, SBC, and North Dakota State University, NDSU, is the &lt;br/&gt;culmination of more than 11 years of active engagement in STEM education on the reservation, &lt;br/&gt;including a year-long academic sabbatical at TMCC by an engineering professor.  It supports a &lt;br/&gt;tribal college vision of expanded life-choices for reservation residents that could provide more &lt;br/&gt;technical competency for tribal decision-making, infrastructure improvement and the &lt;br/&gt;opportunity for personal and tribal advancement without loss of cultural heritage.  For NDSU &lt;br/&gt;the benefits would include expanded participation of culturally diverse students, shared &lt;br/&gt;fulfillment of the 1862/1994 land grant mission, improved faculty-student communication and &lt;br/&gt;interaction and expansion of the talent pool entering STEM professions.  The heart of the &lt;br/&gt;proposal is the interaction of tribal high school, tribal college, mainstream University and &lt;br/&gt;engineering profession stakeholders to facilitate the recruitment, education and support of &lt;br/&gt;tribal students to acquire and hone the skills that will allow them to enter the engineering &lt;br/&gt;profession or contribute in some other fashion to their communities and the nation.  The &lt;br/&gt;proposal will accomplish this vision by impacting students through interactions with faculty/ &lt;br/&gt;staff, curriculum and supporting functions/agencies.  All of this will be accomplished in a &lt;br/&gt;culturally supportive fashion.</AbstractNarration>
