<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: Solids in strong magnetic fields have exhibited an array of exotic phenomena for the past several decades.  A magnetic field produces drastic modifications in electronic energy spectra through orbital (Landau) quantization and spin (Zeeman) splitting.  In particular, quantum-confined semiconductor structures in magnetic fields are ideal for studying non-trivial effects in a systematic manner with fully tunable electron densities, densities of states, and confinement energies.  The proposed research will address fundamental questions related to quantum coherence and interactions in nanostructures such as: How will independent electron-hole pairs develop macroscopic coherence? How stable will one-dimensional excitons be at quantum degenerate densities? and How will resonant electron-phonon interactions modify energy levels of Dirac fermions?  Clarifying these questions will not only advance our understanding of carrier interactions in solids, but also open up new device possibilities for utilizing coherent and many-body effects.  In addition, training undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge projects will produce next generation experts in semiconductor optics.  Finally, through the unique linkage with the PI's NSF Partnerships for International Research and Education grant, a unique opportunity will be provided for alumni of the NanoJapan: Summer Nanotechnology Research Program for Undergraduates to further their research experience with a summer internship at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: Solids placed in super-strong magnetic fields can sometimes exhibit bizarre phenomena, including the quantum Hall effect where the resistance vanishes at special values of magnetic fields.  A magnetic field drastically modifies electrons' energies in solids through orbital quantization and spin splitting, thereby providing a powerful means for controlling quantum phenomena.  In particular, nanostructures in magnetic fields are ideal for studying complicated effects in a highly-controllable manner.  Advances in crystal growth and nanofabrication technology allow one to obtain samples of highest crystallinity with tailored properties.  This project will examine novel magnetic-field-induced phenomena in three prototypical nanosystems -- semiconductor quantum wells, carbon nanotubes, and graphene -- through magneto-optical experiments.  These studies will not only advance our understanding of electron behaviors in solids but also open up new possibilities for optoelectronic devices.  In addition, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in cutting-edge projects to become next generation experts in semiconductor optics.  Furthermore, through the unique linkage with the PI's NSF Partnerships for International Research and Education grant, alumni of the NanoJapan: Summer Nanotechnology Research Program for Undergraduates will be invited to further their research experience with a summer internship at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL).  They will be given strong encouragement to pursue further graduate study and research in this field through the direct mentorship of graduate students and NHMFL researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Modern crystal growth and nanofabrication technologies allow one to create artificial nanostructures with tailored properties.  These structures provide an ideal laboratory in which to study fundamental physics problems in a highly controllable manner.  This project investigated how individual electrons communicate with each other and behave cooperatively in three prototypical nanostructures: semiconductor quantum wells, graphene, and carbon nanotubes.  Short and intense laser pulses combined with high magnetic fields were used to drive, interrogate, and manipulate quantum-confined electrons.  A high magnetic field provides a convenient knob for controlling electron dynamics through the magnetic quantization of the orbital and spin motions of electrons.  Facilities at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, Florida, as well as smaller magnets in the PI's laboratory at Rice University were utilized.  The specific scientific questions addressed during the last three years included: i) How do independent electron-hole pairs develop macroscopic coherence?; ii) How does a collective nature manifest itself in the quantum coherent dynamics of a two-dimensional electron gas?; and iii) How stable are one-dimensional excitons at quantum degenerate densities?  The outcomes of our studies are some clues to these questions, not only advancing our understanding of carrier interactions in solids but also opening up possibilities for new devices utilizing many-body effects.  One of the main outcomes of this project is the observation of the phenomenon of superfluorescence (SF) in a semiconductor quantum well.  This observation advocates the rather counter-intuitive notion that non-equilibrium can be a source of order.  Namely, self-organization in an out-of-equilibrium system can result in the spontaneous appearance of macroscopic order.  Specifically, a giant dipole spontaneously built up from an initially incoherent ensemble of electron-hole pairs and then decayed abruptly, producing intense pulses of coherent radiation.  Overall, the many-body effects in this system are not just small corrections that require exotic conditions to be observed; rather, they completely dominate the electron dynamics and emission spectra.  Additionally, the solid-state realization of SF has resulted in an unprecedented degree of controllability in the generation of SF, opening up opportunities for device applications.  The intensity and delay time of SF bursts are fully tunable through an external magnetic field, temperature, and pump laser power.  In the future, one can make use of advanced semiconductor technology and design compact devices that can produce SF pulses with desired properties even at room temperature.  Eventually, an electrically driven device for producing coherent SF pulses with any desired wavelengths can be developed by utilizing semiconductor quantum engineering.  We broadly disseminated our research results in peer-reviewed journals, including Nature Physics, Physical Review Letters, Physical Review B, and Optics Express.  We also trained undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge techniques to produce the next generation of experts in optical spectroscopy, condensed matter physics, and nanoscienec.  Furthermore, through the unique linkage with the PIÆs Partnerships for International Research and Education grant from the NSF, we provided an opportunity for alumni of the NanoJapan: Summer Nanotechnology Research Program for Undergraduates to further their research experience with a summer internship involving high magnetic fields.  Finally, the PIÆs partnership with the Rice-Houston Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate enabled him to recruit students from traditionally under-represented groups into his research group, contributing to the development of a diverse U.S. science workforce at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
