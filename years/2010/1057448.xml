Four occupations are known from the site (from 13,300 to 10,000 years ago), and it was uncertain which one is associated with the burial.     In summer, 2010, we discovered ancient human remains, designated æXaa Saa CheegÆe TsÆeniin (or Upward Sun River Mouth Child) by local Native Athabaskans, in the Tanana basin, central Alaska.
