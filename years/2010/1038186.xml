<AbstractNarration>This collaboration among TCUP colleges Cankdeska Cikana Community College Community &lt;br/&gt;College, CCCC, Ft. Berthold Community College, FBCC, Turtle Mountain Community College , &lt;br/&gt;TMCC, and Sitting Bull College, SBC, and North Dakota State University, NDSU, is the &lt;br/&gt;culmination of more than 11 years of active engagement in STEM education on the reservation, &lt;br/&gt;including a year-long academic sabbatical at TMCC by an engineering professor.  It supports a &lt;br/&gt;tribal college vision of expanded life-choices for reservation residents that could provide more &lt;br/&gt;technical competency for tribal decision-making, infrastructure improvement and the &lt;br/&gt;opportunity for personal and tribal advancement without loss of cultural heritage.  For NDSU &lt;br/&gt;the benefits would include expanded participation of culturally diverse students, shared &lt;br/&gt;fulfillment of the 1862/1994 land grant mission, improved faculty-student communication and &lt;br/&gt;interaction and expansion of the talent pool entering STEM professions.  The heart of the &lt;br/&gt;proposal is the interaction of tribal high school, tribal college, mainstream University and &lt;br/&gt;engineering profession stakeholders to facilitate the recruitment, education and support of &lt;br/&gt;tribal students to acquire and hone the skills that will allow them to enter the engineering &lt;br/&gt;profession or contribute in some other fashion to their communities and the nation.  The &lt;br/&gt;proposal will accomplish this vision by impacting students through interactions with faculty/ &lt;br/&gt;staff, curriculum and supporting functions/agencies.  All of this will be accomplished in a &lt;br/&gt;culturally supportive fashion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overall the Pre-Engineering Education Collaboration (PEEC) program at Turtle Mountain Community College (TMCC) was a huge success.  Without this opportunity a lot of our students would not have considered engineering and if they did they would have started at a Main Stream University and possibly not succeeded.  Then with that burden they might have moved back and enrolled at TMCC but in a different program of study or opted to just get a job and not get an education.   Our program was able to offer one-on-one help which at times at bigger universities can be a disadvantage.  They were given the opportunity to have an advisor/instructor with an engineering degree available to assist with any questions or concerns they might have provided by the PEEC funding from NSF.  TMCC students were given a small stipend to help with day to day expenses and then when the students transferred to NDSU were given stipends to pay for their education which in turn gave them more opportunity to focus on school work not a job.  The students also had the opportunity to travel to places that they have never been.  Some of our students have never left North Dakota.  They attended National Conferences where they were able to network not only with students but future employers.  Throughout the past 7 years the students also built a network within PEEC program which includes the following tribal colleges Sitting Bull College, Candeska Chikana Community College and Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College and one main stream university North Dakota State University.  They were able to take that network to NDSU and create a support system there for the incoming PEEC students.   TMCC had 33 students take the Intro to Engineering course in the past 7 years of them 33 students 11 of the students transferred to NDSU and 5 of the students are currently enrolled at TMCC.  Two students graduated from NDSU with a Civil Engineering degree and both students chose to continue on to graduate school.  One of the students enrolled in a one-year Master?s program in Hydrology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated May of 2017.  The other student is currently in her final year of her Master?s program in Construction Management Engineering she is set to graduate summer of 2018.
