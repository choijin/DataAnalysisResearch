<AbstractNarration>The intellectual merit of this research is to develop both theoretical and practical aspects of quantum computing with ultracold neutral and ionic polar molecules. General interest in polar molecules is based on the fact that they can be controlled with relatively small external electric fields and entangled by the long-range dipole-dipole interaction. The study will include an investigation of molecular ions trapped near the surface of a superconducting chip considered for quantum information devices. It will also search for effcient ways to form gases of neutral polar molecules with high densities and trap them in optical potentials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this study are in improving knowledge of the molecular properties of neutral and ionic molecules and thereby helping to set up realistic models for the experiments at US universities. These combined efforts will lead to improvement and development of reliable and effcient quantum physical systems for quantum information processing. The outreach of this project will include the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to get experience with state-of-the art computational programs, learning to write research papers, prepare and give presentations at conferences. While participating in the proposed research students and postdoctoral researchers will explore the new and exciting field of quantum information and computational physics at the frontier.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for the award titled ``Ultracold neutral and ionic polar molecules for quantum computingÆÆ                          PI: Svetlana Kotochigova        This research developed both theoretical and practical aspects of quantum computing with neutral and ionic polar molecules.     The three-year research supported by the NSF award has resulted in fifteen publications in major scientific journals among which Nature, Physical Review Letters, and Physical Review A.     The broad impact of this research is gaining accurate knowledge of the properties of ultracold neutral and ionic molecules and thereby helping to setup realistic models supporting experiments at US universities, such as JILA, Yale and UCLA.  These combined experimental and theoretical efforts led to the improvement and development of reliable and efficient quantum physical systems for quantum information processing.     The outreach of this project has included the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to get experience with state-of-the art scientific computational programs, learn to write research papers, prepare and give presentations at national and international conferences. While participating in the research the students and postdoctoral researchers explored the exciting fields of quantum information and computational physics, both at the frontier of modern science.     Firstly, we focused on creating trapping conditions for polar molecules to ensure that detrimental effects of inevitable inhomogeneities across an ultracold sample are significantly reduced. The implications are particularly striking for the use of polar molecules as quantum bits. It was shown that this system is susceptible to decoherence due to intensity fluctuations in the optical trapping lasers, when the dynamic polarizabilities of molecular levels are different as is generally the case.  We showed that this limitation can be removed by adjusting the experimental parameters to guarantee that the dynamic polarizabilities of these states are equal.  In particular, for the proposed quantum bit implementation (where a spatial gradient of an electric field is required, so working at a magic electric field value is impossible) it should be possible to use  light polarized at the ``magic angle'' relative to the static field in order to eliminate this potentially dangerous source of decoherence.     Secondly, we explored the collisional physics of ultracold highly-magnetic dysprosium and erbium atoms and molecules. Highly magnetic particles have been suggested for quantum computing, where qubit states are Zeeman sublevels in a non-uniformed magnetic field. The magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between atoms and molecules allow for entanglement and implementation of a universal controlled-NOT gate with operation times faster than their decoherence time.  However, until recently, the nature of the interactions between such atoms was not known. In our research we determined and explored the large anisotropy in their interactions to control their magnetic properties via tunable Feshbach resonances.     Finally, our efforts have concentrated on properties and quantum behavior of ionic molecules. Contained in ion traps they can form a stable system, called ``Coulomb crystals'', which consists of positive ions held together by external electric fields and repulsive Coulomb forces.  In particular, an array of molecular ions can be a good platform, in which to study entanglement between molecular ions.  To date linear arrays of atomic ions are the best quantum information processors. Molecular ions with large electric dipole moments might proof to be better candidates. For example, rotational states of the molecular ion can be coupled to quantum states of Cooper pairs in super-conducting circuits, another candidate for quantum computing.  Here, we focused on providing accurate information on the molecular potentials and spectroscopic constants, which are important...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
