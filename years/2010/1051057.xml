<AbstractNarration>Geographically isolated populations diverge genetically over time and may ultimately become new species.  Early in the process, when the populations can still interbreed, genetic incompatibilities often result in loss of fitness in interpopulation hybrids. The proposed research uses the marine copepod, Tigriopus californicus, to examine molecular mechanisms underlying loss of fitness in hybrids. Recent work has shown that hybrids are characterized by reduced activity of the electron transport system in mitochondria, the energy producing part of all animal cells. Experiments are proposed to extend our understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction in hybrids using two recently developed molecular tools, RNA interference (to manipulate gene expression) and whole transcriptome sequencing (to obtain a global view of gene expression). Together, these will tease apart changes in gene expression in response to genome hybridization versus changes in response to the external environment.  These methods will be used to compare the responses of natural populations and laboratory hybrids to determine the genes involved in population incompatibility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the proposed work is primarily motivated by questions in evolutionary biology, its focus on mitochondrial dysfunction is of broad interest throughout biomedical sciences, especially in the fields of aging and nuclear transplantation.  The investigations will provide unique training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers seeking to integrate studies of molecular biology, physiology, and genetics to address important questions in biology.  The results of the work (and the methods employed) also serve as starting points for diverse outreach activities including public lectures, curriculum development in molecular ecology, and development of K-12 laboratory activities implemented in public schools by an environmental education organization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  This project explored the outcome of evolutionary differentiation among geographically isolated populations of animals within a species.  Such populations diverge genetically due to mutations, random chance (genetic drift), and the action of natural selection.  When individuals from different populations subsequently come back into contact and attempt to interbreed, the hybrid offspring often show reduced fitness.  The project used natural populations of a small marine crustacean (the copepod Tigriopus californicus) to test ideas about the mechanisms that result in reduced hybrid fitness.  This species was used because many populations can be collected from the field and the animal is easily reared and mated in the lab with short generation times (approx. 3 weeks).  The project specifically tested two hypotheses.  First, previous work has shown that hybrids have altered metabolism.  Here we tested the hypothesis that the changes in hybrid metabolism result in damage to DNA due to oxidative stress.  This was directly tested by comparing levels of DNA damage in hybrids to that in natural populations.  Results showed that hybrids have consistently higher levels of DNA damage, consistent with the hypothesis that hybrid metabolism, specifically in the mitochondria, results in chemical reactions that cause oxidative damage to DNA.  Second, work on other species has suggested that hybrids tend to show altered on and off regulation of many genes and that this might lead to reduced hybrid fitness.  Here the new results were quite unexpected.  In this system, hybrids did not show faulty gene regulation.  In fact, hybrids did show changes but those changes appeared to compensate for altered metabolism; for example, genes with an anti-oxidative stress function were turned on in hybrids and might help reduce the oxidative damage seen in the experiment discussed above.  Finally, a new method was developed to experimentally manipulate gene expression in this species, an approach that may have broad applicability for work on other small crustaceans.  The method allows investigators to turn off the expression of specific genes,so the role of those genes can be determined.  Broader impacts:  Scientifically, this project included work that broadened perspectives on the role of the mitochondrial genome in the evolution of new species.  Previous discussions largely focused on protein coding regions while here attention was drawn to the role of mtDNA in transcription, translation and replication of the mitochondrial genome.  Any of these processes may breakdown in hybrids and indeed such breakdown appears to underlie mitochondrial diseases in humans.  Numerous undergraduates, several graduate students and three postdoctoral fellows were trained in cutting edge technologies.  Outreach involving a hands-on molecular ecology lab reached over 800 students annually in underserved San Diego elementary schools (5th grade).
