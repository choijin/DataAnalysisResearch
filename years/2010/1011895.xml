<AbstractNarration>In this project, supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Sanov and his students will undertake a study of the structure and dynamics of negative ions in the gas phase.  The broad objective of this research is to attain a molecular-level view of chemistry.  As chemical bonding is controlled by electrons, it is their behavior that ultimately controls the outcomes of chemical reactions.  The bonding motifs in molecular and cluster anions will be investigated using experimental techniques targeting electron emission and anionic fragmentation processes.  In particular, a quantum photographic technique - photoelectron imaging - will be used to investigate the limits of through-space and through-bond electronic coherence, which is a cornerstone of many charge-transfer phenomena.  The reactivity of selected neutral radicals and reactive intermediates, as well as the interactions of negative ions and photoelectrons with neighboring molecules in microscopic solvation environments (clusters) will also be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge attained in this research is expected to be relevant to several areas of physical sciences. The properties of negative ions are vital to understanding chemistry of solutions, bio-, environmental, and astro-chemistry.  For example, characterizing several carbon-rich species will shed light on the mechanisms of formation of negative ions in the Universe, while the studies of electronic coherence at the molecular level will help understand the fundamental factors controlling the flow of charges in molecules and devices.  As part of the broader scientific community, the Sanov group will continue advancing the utility of photoelectron imaging in providing conceptual views of bonding structures, which ultimately hold matter together.  The research will also contribute to the development of photoelectron imaging's untapped potential as an effective teaching tool, by providing a pedagogical framework for introducing students to quantum concepts.</AbstractNarration>
