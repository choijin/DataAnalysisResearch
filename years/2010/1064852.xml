<AbstractNarration>Participation in political debate and deliberation is critical to democracy. Browsing political material is a direct way of acquiring knowledge about civic activities, the operations of government, and the issues of the day. This project examines a fast growing, but little understood new type of political participation: online information seeking, deliberation and decision making in the context of Web 2.0 technologies. The research includes three intertwined threads of study: (a) user-centered design of enhancements to a search/browse tool and a cross-application, user-generated interlinkage browser; (b) laboratory studies of how potential voters browse and make decisions in social computing environments; and (c) longitudinal observation of users of novel, socially-enabled political search/browse tools through at least three U.S. election cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The central research question is how exposure to and participation in social networking activities influences information seeking and decision making in politics. An important practical outcome will be search/browse tools for civic participation and political discourse that are integrated with the social networking environments that many people now use every day. The research will contribute to theories of deliberation in the domain of digital politics and to the design of tools for exposing and navigating the structure of online political dialog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Tools and theory developed from this project will provide contexts that broaden opportunities for participation in civic life in the 21st century, thereby helping to bridge the digital divide.  The work will also benefit education through the training of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The use of social media has grown dramatically. One significant use of social media is in politics. Politicians use it to communicate to citizens and citizens use it to communicate with candidates, elected officials, and each other. Social media can be used to enhance public debate and civic engagement, but also to undermine the electoral process with misleading material. This project was designed to help us understand how social media is being used for political discourse. This project looked extensively at user comments on the Facebook newsfeeds of the U.S. Presidential candidates in 2008 and again in 2012.

In some of the first work to examine patterns and content of social media posts in political contexts, we demonstrated that social media users linked to content across multiple platforms, especially video and news blogs, and we found that users were posting evidence for positions, rebuttals, calls for action, jokes, and direct requests or comments to the candidates.  We explored several aspects of social media discourse as they changed over time. We examined "sentiment" ( positive versus negative), "in-group/out-group orientation" (us versus them), and rationality (intellectual versus emotional). Six months prior to an election, comments on politicians? social media sites are overwhelmingly positive, in-group oriented, and rational. As an election approaches, positive comments decrease and negative comments increase ("converging sentiment"), in-group references decrease and out-group references increase ("reflection to selection"), and rational discourse decreases while emotional discourse increases. We theorized that the goals of people involved in social media interaction change from consensus building and group identity formation early in a campaign to framing of the opposition later in a campaign. This is consistent with theories in political science, but had never been demonstrated in the context of social media. We conducted in-depth interviews with social media users. We found that most used multiple platforms with different agendas on each platform. Contrary to studies showing that social media led to polarization, we found that people were exposed to diverse points of view when they skipped across platforms.

A person browsing social media might look at a personal message from a friend, followed by a political news story, followed by social media comments about the news story. This "mixed media" browsing is a new way of consuming political news. We explored how people?s feelings and knowledge about political issues were influenced by exposure to emotionally charged social media information both before and after exposure to news. We showed that social media influences both knowledge and mood in complex ways depending on how it is mixed with political news. When social media was encountered before news about a political candidate, it influenced feelings toward the candidate but did not influence personal mood or perceived knowledge. Many people now use multiple social media platforms simultaneously, and so we studied how simultaneous use of a microblogging site (Twitter) while watching political debates influences voting choice. We found that use of Twitter to augment the experience of watching a debate led to greater civic engagement but also made people more susceptible to social influence. The data we collected on social media use allowed us to produce design recommendations and create a prototype digital environment to support public deliberation. Our prototype, called "Poli," was designed to solve several perceived problems in information seeking and information dissemination.  During this project we used multiple methods to understand how people were adopting emerging social media technologies to participate in the political process. It is important to understand this new "public sphere" and how it changes participation, motivation, engagement, and choice. Social media will continue to play a critical role in civic life. Understanding how it impacts people allows us to design better environments to help people deliberate and to mitigate the influence of false and misleading information.
