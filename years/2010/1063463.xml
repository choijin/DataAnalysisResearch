<AbstractNarration>Measurements of hydrogen peroxide and methylhydroperoxide will be made using a new chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) instrument on board the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V research aircraft during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign in May-June 2012. Measurements of the two peroxides will be made at 10 Hz allowing horizontal and vertical sample resolution on the order of 20 meters and 2 meters, respectively. Through-the-inlet isotopically-labeled standard gas additions will be made continuously to provide coincident calibration for both species under all encountered variations in pressure, temperature, water vapor and other environmental variables. Extensive pre-mission, integration, test fight, and deployment evaluations and comparisons will be made using a ground-based wet-chemical calibration system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DC3 airborne peroxide observations will provide: 1) distributions of these species in and around isolated deep convective clouds, 2) constraining data on odd-hydrogen chemistry in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, 3) constraining data on vertical transport of odd-hydrogen precursors by deep mid-latitude continental clouds, 4) constraining data on the scavenging of soluble species by cloud droplets and hydrometeors, 5) a probe of convected air-mass chemical aging in the upper troposphere with and without lightning-added nitrogen oxides, and 6) characterization of the variance of topics 1-5 across cloud-storm properties such as cloud base temperature, vertical velocity, freezing level and glaciation, and lightning. Results will be significant to tropospheric oxidant and ozone chemistry and their regional-to-global distributions; to heterogeneous gas-aerosol chemistry under cold, low specific humidity, and mixed sunlight conditions; to aerosol chemical evolution and their regional-to-global distributions; and ultimately to air quality and climate. The instrument system is novel and represents a significant advance in airborne peroxide instrumentation. One post-doctoral fellow, one graduate student and one or more undergraduate students will participate in the experiment. Data will be archived at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and results published in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Trace gas measurements of hydrogen peroxide, methyl hydroperoxide, formic acid, and acetic acid were made using a chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) instrument flown on board the National Science Foundation Gulfstream V research aircraft during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign conducted in May and June 2012.  These trace gases are produced in the atmosphere and their measurement provides test points to our theoretical knowledge of tropospheric chemistry.  The overarching objective of DC3 was observing the transport and transformation of trace gases (such as those named above) under the small scale rapid motion, lightning, and cloud conditions associated with thunderstorms.  The chemistry of such environments is difficult to represent in current meteorological and chemical models and observations are needed to improve their simulation.  The aircraft was operated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and was based out of Salina, KS during DC3.  From this operations base, thunderstorms located over three regions could be sampled: Texas-Oklahoma, Colorado-Nebraska and Alabama-Tennessee.  These regions were chosen because of their proximity to state-of-the-art weather radars and the likelihood of thunderstorms, different storm intensities and diverse chemical surface source environments.  Hence, transport and chemical transformation were observed under a range of conditions.  The CIMS instrument used here was novel in its use of 3 different reagent ions: oxygen anion, oxocarbon anion, and iodide anion.  The ions formed molecular clusters with the trace gases named above which were individually quantified.  Measurements of the peroxide and acid clusters were sequential in time with each sampled in approximately two-tenths of a second but only once every approximately 3 seconds.  The response rate of the sampling apparatus and its process cycle was once every approximately 3 seconds.  Through-the-inlet standard gas additions were made for hydrogen peroxide and methyl hydroperoxide.  In addition, a methyl hydroperoxide gas standard labeled with a stable hydrogen isotope was employed.  The in-flight addition system was cross calibrated against a ground based system in the laboratory and in the field during the mission.  The observed ion cluster calibration dependences on water vapor and ambient pressure were more complicated than expected and detailed post-mission calibrations and ion-neutral chemical kinetic simulations were employed to interpret the in-flight calibration data.  The measurements of formic acid and acetic acid were not part of the original proposal.  However, in the test flights conducted pre-deployment to Salina, signals attributed to formic acid and acetic acid were noted and these were recorded though out the DC3 flight campaign as potential measurements of opportunity.  Their signals were calibrated post-mission in the laboratory and the calibrations verified in a subsequent field campaign.  The DC3 airborne peroxide and organic acid observations provided 1) distributions of these species in and around deep convective clouds, 2) constraining data on odd-hydrogen chemistry in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, 3) constraining data on vertical transport of the named species and odd-hydrogen precursors by deep mid-latitude continental convective clouds, 4) constraining data on the transformation and removal of the named species by cloud particles and hydrometeors, 5) probes of convective air-mass chemical aging in the upper troposphere with and without lightning-added nitrogen oxides, and 6) characterization of the variance of topics 1-5 across cloud-storm properties such as cloud base temperature, vertical velocity, freezing level, glaciation, and lightning. Measurements were significant to tropospheric oxidant and ozone chemistry and their regional-to-global distributions; to heterogeneous gas-aerosol chemistry under cold, low specific humidity, and mixed sunlight conditions; to aerosol chemical evolution and their regional-to-global distributions; and ultimately to air quality and climate.  The observations obtained by the PIs and that of the entire science team continue to be used in ongoing analyses by the DC3 team and outside members of the atmospheric science community.  The instrument system was novel and represents a significant development in airborne peroxide and acid instrumentation. One post-doctoral fellow, two graduate students and one undergraduate student participated in the experiment and subsequent data analysis.  Data were archived at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and initial results were presented at national scientific meetings and are published in peer-reviewed journals.
