<AbstractNarration>College of Menominee Nation (CMN), together with the University of Wisconsin Madison and the &lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin Platteville, is applying to the National Science Foundations Science, Tribal &lt;br/&gt;Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) Pre-engineering Education Collaborative grant to strengthen &lt;br/&gt;CMN?s capacity to establish CMN as an Associate Degree granting engineering program of distinction.   . &lt;br/&gt;The CMN PEEC: Providing for the Education of American Indian Engineers collaborative project &lt;br/&gt;proposes the following objectives: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#61607; To build CMN?s capacity and infrastructure to sustain a Pre-engineering Associate Degree Program. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#61607; To implement a Pre-engineering program of distinction. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#61607; By September 2015, to graduate at least twenty students from CMN?s pre-engineering program and &lt;br/&gt;   transition into U.W. Madison?s and U.W. Platteville?s engineering programs. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Project Intellectual Merit:  This project recognizes and embraces diversity and the role Tribal Colleges &lt;br/&gt;play in coordinating demonstrative research on increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities &lt;br/&gt;in STEM fields. Tribal Colleges are key contributors to the body of knowledge on American Indians. &lt;br/&gt;Project research, data, and outcomes focused in the ultimate outcomes of increasing the number of and &lt;br/&gt;performance of American Indian students in engineering, leading to increased numbers of American &lt;br/&gt;Indians in engineering careers, will provide key nationally recognized research. This collaboration will &lt;br/&gt;develop, apply and assess evidence-based practices shown to increase the participation of &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority students in science and engineering. Furthermore, the partnership between &lt;br/&gt;CMN and its UW partners is tailored to establish robust connections between institutions that will serve as &lt;br/&gt;a model for the engineering community in general and other minority-serving institutions as we assess, &lt;br/&gt;document and disseminate the success of this process. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Project Broader Impact: This project will build upon the research of previous STEM activities, continuing &lt;br/&gt;the investigation of essential research in discovering and understanding how Tribal Colleges and the &lt;br/&gt;unique strategies they implement promote education in minority students. The project further advances &lt;br/&gt;the research of American Indian undergraduate education in engineering and contributes to the global &lt;br/&gt;body of knowledge in underrepresented minority engineering education. The short term outcome of this &lt;br/&gt;effort will be to increase the knowledge, understanding and interest in engineering among students in &lt;br/&gt;rural populations, with emphasis on the American Indian population of Northern Wisconsin.  The long &lt;br/&gt;term outcome will be an increase in the participation of American Indian students graduating with degrees &lt;br/&gt;in engineering.  This will ensure that the voices, perspectives and talents of a population that is so &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in engineering have an opportunity to contribute to the development of the engineering &lt;br/&gt;profession.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The College of Menominee Nation (CMN) , a tribal College chartered by the  Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin and located approximately 45 miles nothwest of Green Bay, partnered with the Universities of Wisconsin at Madison and at Platteville in the CMN PEEC Project: Providing for Education of American indian Engineers during the period 2010 through 2015.  Through the NSF PEEC Initiative,  a PhD-level Industrial Engineer joined CMN faculty and with the partners from UW-Madison and UW-Platteville, as well as CMN PhD faculty from Physics and Chemistry, developed a pre-engineering program that aligned with its collaborative partners. Through these efforts, CMN now delivers Associate Degrees Pre-Engineering/General, Environmental Engineering, and Engineering Technology.   NSF's PEEC Initiative also provided funding to build and equip a stand alone Physics/ Engineering Lab on CMN's main campus on the reservation in Keshena Wisconsin.   To ensure that CMN faculty were current, the PEEC Initiative provided a variety of professional development activities for CMN faculty from workshops on robotics and biomimicry through a Great Lakes Teaching Conference to professional conferences such as CEREL Engergy Innovation  and Industrial Engineering Conference.  CMN worked closely with UW-Madison and UW-Platteville to introduce Engineering as a career field to the K16 American Indian and non-Indian student bodies in northeast Wisconsin through a variety of outreach activities from The Science Magician for elementary students to Physics Force performances for middle schoolers to Engineering Expos for High School and College students.  CMN expanded it professional and peer tutoring and supplemental instruction academic support programs.  And further, during this period, CMN developed two scholarship opportunities: one for incoming American Indian freshman, and one for high achieving students.  The collaborative partnership between CMN, UW-Madison, and UW-Platteville has graduated two students with baccalaureates, each of whom is now working for an Engineering firm.  And we have nine (9) students in the pipeline, successfully completing courses at CMN.       Last Modified: 11/23/2015       Submitted by: Diana Morris]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
