<AbstractNarration>This project is developing a team-taught cross-disciplinary course to promote systems thinking as a way to understand the various engineering, design, and economic issues of sustainability. Team projects form the basis of a problem-based learning approach and are drawn from four different colleges: Engineering, Design and Architecture, Education, and Business-Economics. Learning goals for students and faculty include: i) a better understanding of the complex cross-disciplinary socio-technical issues of sustainability, ii) an understanding of and ability to use "systems thinking" approaches to better explore these complexities, and iii) enhanced ability to communicate and collaborate successfully in cross-disciplinary projects. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the co-mingling of disciplinary perspectives that offers students and faculty new and challenging opportunities for learning, communication and collaboration. In addition the "systems thinking" framework enables students to see their learning as integral and functional, rather than as a set of discrete "tacked on" features. Finally, problem-based learning demands active engagement by students in making their assumptions explicit, formulating hypotheses and models, and testing those ideas against those of their peers. The project envisions "Systems Thinking for Sustainability" as a catalyst, first for similar cross-disciplinary courses at the PI's institution and then at other institutions. By developing and disseminating a set of learning outcomes useful in cross-disciplinary courses that bring together core STEM fields with related areas, the project is broadening its impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "Systems Thinking for Sustainability" (STFS)    Sustainable development is a looming issue of great complexity that demands an interdisciplinary approach in education and in research.  Working against that interdisciplinary approach is the inevitable narrowing of perspective as students move deeper into their majors. This narrowing, while useful for depth of knowledge in one area, did not really prepare students for life after graduation working in multidisciplinary teams in industry and government as well as in academic research. Nor was it good preparation for addressing research into sustainability, which necessarily involves the expertise of different disciplines that need to communicate across the multiple vantage points needed to approach the complexities of sustainability issues.   Could we work out a way to better prepare the students for interdisciplinary teamwork?   To answer this question, the STFS project created an innovative team-taught cross-disciplinary course for undergraduates (juniors) as a way to help transform STEM education.    Four different UK colleges were chosen for instructors and students; interdisciplinary student teams tackled projects in a problem-based learning (PBL) approach. The goal was to improve scientific, technical, mathematical and engineering (STEM) education not only for these disciplines, but for all undergraduates. Therefore STFS project design brought together "typical" STEM fields &ndash; engineering and design/architecture &ndash; with a "quasi-STEM" discipline &ndash; education &ndash; specifically, mathematics education &ndash; and a "non-STEM" discipline &ndash; business, specifically marketing.  Sustainability was the ideal interdisciplinary topic and systems thinking was not only useful for approaching sustainability issues but might also provide a common language of "stocks" and "flows" and "feedback loops" that could help the 4 disciplines bridge the communication gaps.   The learning goals for STFS students and faculty included (a) a better understanding of the complex cross-disciplinary sociotechnical issues of sustainability, (b) an understanding of and ability to use systems thinking approaches to better explore these complexities, and (c) an enhanced ability to communicate and collaborate successfully across multi-disciplinary projects. To achieve these ambitious goals, the STFS course topics and learning approaches work seamlessly to be mutually reinforcing. Combining systems thinking and sustainability supports a PBL (problem-based learning) approach that stresses self-reflective learning, team problem solving, communication skills, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. PBL demands active engagement by students, something sustainability provides through "ill-structured" "messy" or "wicked" problems where scientific, technical, cultural and political areas overlap and act upon each other. Students discovered through assignments and project-based teamwork how and why a cross-disciplinary viewpoint is the appropriate strategy for addressing sustainability issues.   The course began with co-lectures to quickly get students up to speed on some basic concepts and tools for systems thinking and sustainability from each of the disciplines that would be useful for the projects to come. With the tools came examples of how they were used by that discipline.  Students were grouped in teams that included at least one from each college to choose a topic from the Umbrella Project.   Umbrella Project. A well-chosen umbrella project was important for unifying the coursework and for motivating the student project teams with real world problems. Working in interdisciplinary teams, the students focused on improving the quality of life on campus through application of sustainability principles. For example, one project identified a problem with traveling across campus inexpensively and efficiently; alternatives (automobiles, campus shuttle service, rental bicycles) were assessed for con...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
