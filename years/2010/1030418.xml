<AbstractNarration>SES-1030418&lt;br/&gt;PI: Stefan Timmermans&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California, Los Angeles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will focus on the different ways by which a growing uninsured population challenges community life in two socio-economically disadvantaged Southern California communities. Based on interviews and historical research, the research will map the decisions of health care providers to serve their communities, examine health care-seeking behavior of both the uninsured and insured population, and review the policy decisions taken by community stakeholders in light of a growing uninsured population. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Documenting hidden social and financial costs for entire communities may show that not expanding insurance coverage has already eroded access and quality of health care for many insured Americans. In addition, examining the ways by which a rise in the uninsured affects communities will give policy makers insight in the broader public benefits and drawbacks of the recently passed health care reform.</AbstractNarration>
