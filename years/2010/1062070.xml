<AbstractNarration>Evidence from experiments on individual decision making reveals that people's choices violate a variety of compelling principles.  For example, while it seems compelling that people's choices should be transitive (e.g., that if a person chooses health plan A over health plan B and B over C, it should be the case that the person prefers A to C) there are instances where this is not the case. One possible explanation is that people's decision making machinery is flawed.  An alternative possibility is that when people make decisions in experimental settings, they are bringing assumptions and inferences into the process that the researcher is not aware of.  This research project explores this possibility.  Specifically, the research re-examines experimental violations of three widely accepted principles of rational choice: joint-separate equivalence, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and transitivity.  A novel "options-as-information" model is developed, spelling out the conditions under which these three principles are, and are not, applicable to the normative analysis of experimental data.  This options-as-information model suggests a revised interpretation of some important findings from the psychological literature: joint-separate reversals traditionally explained in terms of "evaluability", and context effects involving asymmetric dominance.  A series of experiments to test the options-as-information explanation of these effects will be conducted.  The model also generates new choice problems in which transparently "rational violations of rational norms" (including rational intransitivities) are warranted.  These choice problems supply a useful new tool for investigating the benefits and drawbacks of conscious reflection in decision making.  A final series of planned studies tests the prediction that, in these choice contexts, conscious deliberation will sometimes lead to systematically poorer decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the research will help inform efforts to assist people in making better decisions.  If observed violations of normative principles of decision making are "biases," then interventions are in order. On the other hand, if they arise because subjects are answering questions different from what the researcher intends, they may not be.  Understanding which it the case and when is critical to knowing when interventions to assist people in making decisions are in order and what features of the decision problem those interventions should be sensitive to.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        Experimental studies of human decision making have revealed a number of systematic behavioral inconsistencies across different choice contexts, providing compelling support for a "constructed preference" perspective on human decision making (e.g., Bettman et al., 1998; Gregory et al., 1993; Slovic, 1995).  From this perspective, the decision maker (DM) does not possess stable and coherent underlying preferences.  When called upon to make a choice, the DM must construct a preference on the spot, and will often consult features of the environment &ndash; such as the context of available options and the framing of descriptions &ndash; in doing so.  The constructed preference view is widely regarded as a decisive challenge to traditional conceptions of rational choice (Tversky, 1996).        The research funded as "Options-as-Information" has explored subtle and surprising normative dimensions of constructed preference, and their potential descriptive implications.  From a normative perspective, we consider hypothetical rational DMs whose knowledge is limited.  Such DMs must update their beliefs about the world as options are sampled, and these contextual inferences may translate into new preferences.  In short, when knowledge is imperfect, rational choice is a fundamentally constructive activity.  From a descriptive viewpoint, we ask whether the inferences predicted by a rational analysis of constructed preference can help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that underlie widely studied context effects.  While normative and descriptive levels of analysis can come apart, we believe that these levels of analysis can also be mutually illuminating (Anderson, 1991; Griffiths et al., 2010; McKenzie, 2003, 2005; Oaksford &amp; Chater, 1994).        In particular, we have revisited a number of well-known systematic violations of coherence principles derived from rational choice theory.  These coherence principles include procedure invariance, which requires that different methods for eliciting preferences and evaluations should yield the same ordering of options; transitivity, which rules out choice loops; and regularity, which states that adding new options cannot increase the popularity of old options in a choice set.  Apparent violations of procedure invariance (Hsee, 1996), transitivity (Tversky, 1969), and regularity (Huber et al., 1982) have been reported in the experimental literature.  These violations are widely seen as evidence for irrationality in human decision making (e.g., Shafir &amp; LeBoeuf, 2002).        However, the normative validity of these coherence principles depends on implicit assumptions about the information structure of the choice environment.  The options-as-information framework has made these assumptions explicit, and has shown how failures of these assumptions can lead to robust &ndash; and rational &ndash; apparent violations of procedure invariance (Sher &amp; McKenzie, 2014), transitivity (M&uuml;ller-Trede, Sher, &amp; McKenzie, 2015), and regularity (Sher, M&uuml;ller-Trede, &amp; McKenzie, in prep a).        To better understand human behavior, the research conducted under this grant has thus investigated the co-evolution of preferences with beliefs.  This analysis suggests that the dynamics of preferences based on reasonable inferences that participants draw from the options they sample in experimental environments are fully compatible with appropriately nuanced rational choice models.  The human DM, often depicted as a cognitive miser who sacrifices consistency for simplicity (Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991), emerges here as an information scavenger who finds far-reaching meaning in subtle contextual and environmental cues.        These results speak directly to the "Rationality Debate," the controversy -- unfolding within, across, and beyond the social sciences -- about the rationality of human action.  This debate has practical importance in the crafting of effective public policy as...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
