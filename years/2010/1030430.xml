<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided for a two-year study, initially involving a 42-day cruise to collect two high-resolution seismic profiles and near-bottom magnetic field data from the Hawaiian Lineation Jurassic Magnetic Quiet Zone (JMQZ) using an AUV. The PIs plan to obtain 800 km long magnetic profiles as well as local seismic reflection and refraction data using a portable multichannel seismic system and sonobuoys. Seismic data will allow them to evaluate whether the Jurassic crust has been affected by later intra-plate Cretaceous volcanism. This magnetic data will be compared to the previously studied JMQZ data from the Japanese Lineation. The latter reveals rapid reversal and decreasing field intensity as well as a period of apparently incoherent anomalies with short wave lengths and low amplitudes. If real and global (as opposed to a local bad signal) this low amplitude zone represents an very unusual field behavior in Earth?s magnetic field history. The new data from Hawaii and its comparison with Japanese results will allow testing the hypothesis that this unusual field behavior was indeed global, which has important implications for dynamics of the deep Earth and for the construction of a robust geomagnetic polarity time scale for the Mid-Jurassic period.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include discovery while promoting teaching and training at sea for graduate and undergraduate students. Public outreach is also planned through internet and WHOI exhibits. The scientific results could have far reaching implications for Earth dynamics, magnetic field behavior and geomagnetic polarity time scale and useful to other workers in the field.</AbstractNarration>

The marine geophysical survey imaged some of the oldest seafloor on the planet from a region of sparse data.  Shipboard bathymetry and chirp sonar data were processed on board by Kutztown University students who served as geophysical watchstanders. These data, along with other oceanographic data from this remote region formed the basis of research projects on campus which resulted in two presentations at the national meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in San Francisco, CA.   This research represents collaboration between a PUI (Kutztown University) and two R-1 research institutions (WHOI- Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Texas A&amp;M). Cooperative work with major R-1 institutions creates unparalleled opportunities for students at PUIs.

The experiences of the five students on this project inspired scores of additional undergraduates by providing first-hand evidence that students from modest backgrounds can succeed if they apply themselves, resulting in many students pushing themselves harder in their studies and pursuing extracurricular research with faculty.        Exposure to Field Oceanography  One of the major goals of this NSF project was to expose young scientists to field oceanography, providing them with the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research with scientists in all stages of their careers. As a result of this project, students from rural Pennsylvania were exposed to field oceanography, gained experience with equipment and software they would never see on campus, and traveled halfway across the world to study one of the most remote regions of the planet.   All five of the KU students involved in the research cruise continued in their STEM majors (geology or marine science). Four of the students went on to complete independent research projects in their fields resulting in presentations at professional conferences, and the recent graduates are employed in field-related jobs.   Enhancing Scientific and Technological Understanding through Outreach  A further goal of this research was to provide resources for community outreach.
