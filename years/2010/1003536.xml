<AbstractNarration>The Connecticut Pathways to Innovation 21st Century (CPI21) project is preparing students from historically underrepresented urban, suburban, and rural CT school districts and developing workforce skills for STEM careers through the completion of articulated high school and college coursework that leads to two- and four-year STEM college degrees. It is implementing a STEM Academy in 12 urban and 12 suburban high schools to: 1) offer an experiential learning-based curriculum that includes three newly developed digital media elective courses; 2) build teacher capacity to deliver the Academy curriculum; and 3) provide experiences that challenge students to research, develop, design, and present their unique solutions to authentic problems. The STEM Academy enables high school students to earn up to 15 community college credits for courses that are delivered using on-line and in-person instruction. The project's results and educational resources are being disseminated nationally through NSF ATE/ITEST Projects and Regional Centers, educational agencies, consortia, and professional associations; guided by an advisory board consisting of stakeholders from a variety of business, college, K-12, government, and not-for-profit entities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ EDUCATION CONNECTIONÆs Center for 21st Century Skills, in collaboration with Connecticut College of TechnologyÆs NSF-funded ATE Regional Center for Next Generation Manufacturing, the CT Office for Workforce Competitiveness, and a dedicated consortium of school district and industry partners, developed a progressive, evidence-based NSF-ATE Project, Connecticut Pathways to Innovation 21st Century (CPI21).  CPI21 built on the validated success of EDUCATION CONNECTIONÆs prior ATE Connecticut Pathways to Innovation (CPI) Project and scaled up results for national dissemination and replication by creating a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) Academy reaching high school students historically underrepresented in STEM careers from urban, suburban, and rural CT school districts.  The CPI21 STEM Academy developed 21st century workforce skills aligned with the American Competitiveness Initiative, and continues to prepare students for emerging high performance STEM careers through completion of articulated high school and college coursework leading to two and four-year STEM college degrees.      Intellectual Merit - The CPI21 project built on validated articulated coursework and experiential learning activities, and advanced best practices and lessons learned from robust internal and external CPI project evaluation. CPI21 developed field-tested and validated courses, pedagogical strategies for the engagement of students in STEM coursework, and the development of STEM-related competencies and skills for successful transition from high school to college. Courses were delivered in a "blended" learning environment, including online and in-person instruction in the classroom.  As part of the integrated curriculum, high school students and teachers participate in authentic learning experiences in class, on college campuses, and at industry sites to strengthen interest and commitment to pursuing STEM-related college degrees and careers.  A culminating STEM challenge project was evaluated at the annual Student Innovation Exposition. Replicable strategies include the integration of the Academy in high schools serving a large proportion of minority students; ongoing interaction among students, educators, and STEM professionals; the incentive of earning college credit while in high school; and intensive professional development for educators.  Broader Impacts &ndash;Forty CT high schools and 5,000 students participated in the CPI21 Project activities and courses; 40% of students were minority, 48% female. Courses were developed collaboratively by teams of teachers, college faculty, and STEM industry leaders; integrated 21st century workforce standards; and were pilot-tested. Participating high school students had the opportunity to earn community college credits. The CPI21 course model has been endorsed by the CT Department of Education as an exemplar for 21st century high school redesign. The proposed CPI21 project is a significant and replicable response to a critical national workforce need &ndash; a highly educated and competent technical workforce prepared to compete effectively in the global economy.  Consistent with the BROADER IMPACT and INTELLECTUAL MERIT of our Connecticut Pathways to Innovation 21 project, the major accomplishments are:  Curriculum Development: We developed, piloted, and implemented three full-year technology-enhanced blended learning high school as part of the Connecticut Community CollegesÆ College of Technology pathway, including: Digital Media and Movie Making, 3D Modeling and Animation, and Game Design and Development.  Academy Implementation: We implemented the 9-12 "school-within-a-school" STEM "Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences" in 12 diverse high schools across Connecticut.  In addition, we implemented blended learning coursework at a total of 40 schools across Connecticut.  Over the course of the grant, we provided service to approximately 75 teacher and 5,000 students.   Professional Developm...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
