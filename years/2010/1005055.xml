<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, for the summers of 2010 - 2012. This award is supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO) and Engineering (ENG). The program focuses on biological engineering -- the application of engineering principles, analysis, design, and synthesis to modern molecular life sciences problems including those in biotechnology, environmental health, materials synthesis, and ocean ecology. The Department of Biological Engineering (BE), founded in 1998 as a new MIT academic unit, has about 30 faculty participating in the program. There is a wide range of very interesting and exciting projects for the students. Students are expected to do full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and various workshops, such as the responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. Students are also provided tours of local industries. REU students have access to a rich array of individual mentor's facilities as well as many interdepartmental labs and centers with core facilities such as electron microscopy, microarray analysis, surface analysis, etc. The program's multi-phase recruitment effort consists of both traditional "hard copy" formats as well as digital-based advertising. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in biological engineering or quantitative biology. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://web.mit.edu/be/education/reu.htm , or by contacting the PI (Dr. Linda Griffith at griff@mit.edu or the co-PI (Dr. Jacquin Niles at jcniles@mit.edu). General inquiries can be sent to Dan Darling at ddarling@mit.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objectives of this REU site were to inspire and motivate undergraduate students to pursue careers in science and engineering, especially in the emerging discipline of Biological Engineering. Specifically, we aimed to help students make informed decisions about pursuing research careers by instilling in the trainees an appreciation of the research process: problem definition, implementation of appropriate experimental and analytical tools to test hypotheses, and communication of results to the broader community, including translation into industry practice where appropriate. Such experiences provide an essential foundation for decisions about applying to graduate school and in plans for engaging in academic or industry research careers. The intellectual focus of Biological Engineering includes several research themes: Systems Biology, Environmental Health, Biomechanics &amp; Tissue Engineering and Nanotechnology.  We accomplished our objectives as an REU site by integrating participants into BE faculty research groups with an emphasis on defining projects that involve collaboration between scientists and engineers.  This REU Site, located on the MIT campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, provided research opportunities to a total of 33 non-MIT students during the 3-year award period (2010-2013). Among the most important data from the program:  A total of 658 applications were received; 5% of the applicants were accepted.  Eighteen faculty members mentored a total of 33 students, from 27 different universities/colleges and one high school, in 32 different research projects.  The program was successful in involving students typically under-represented in STEM disciplines. Of the 33 students who participated in the program, 48% were female, 27% were Hispanics, and 15% African Americans.  As of April 2013:  Ten technical works were published and presented in journals and technical conferences.  NSF Graduate Research Fellowships were awarded to 8 participants while 4 received honorable mentions.  One participant is now a college freshmen &amp; two are junior year students, 10 will begin PhD programs in the fall 2013, one is pursing a master's degree, 12 are currently pursing a PhD, and six have joined the workforce after receiving their undergraduate degree (of which one started his own company)  To encourage independence, projects were selected that allowed the student to learn a basic set of skills within the first 2-4 weeks of the summer, then apply the skills to develop an experimental or analytical approach to a tractable problem. In this way, the students began to present the results of their project to the research team by mid-way through the project, allowing them to build confidence in scientific discussion with team members and develop a strong final presentation.  To successfully complete the program, all participants:  1. Generated a poster based on their summer research.  2. Presented a "lightning" oral presentation (~7min presentation) based on summer research for fellow participants, lab group members, and faculty.  3. Prepared a mock NSF graduate fellowship proposal based on their summer research.                Last Modified: 04/24/2013       Submitted by: Linda G Griffith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
