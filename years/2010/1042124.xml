<AbstractNarration>The University of Texas at Austin will deploy and support a powerful HPC system that will provide support for a broad range of scientific applications. The system is a 302 TF Dell cluster with 44 TB memory and 1.2 PB disk. This balanced system has 5x the peak performance, and will also deliver 2x the ?real? performance per-core on science applications through much greater memory and interconnect bandwidth than the current system. It also offers 4x the total memory and 10x the disk capacity, with a scalable path to adding more computational and storage capacity.  The system will provide 75 million hours of computer time to the current TeraGrid allocation process and an additional minimum of 15 million hours through the TACC allocation process.  Thus approximately 50% of the system will go to NSF peer reviewed scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

The individual scientific impacts of Lonestar across a wide range of science domains are too numerous to mention, but we would in particular like to highlight the impacts of Lonestar in support of the Life Sciences. Among many other Life Science outcomes, Lonestar was used to find a link between AlzheimerÆs and cancer via a shared pathway in gene transcription, to more expediently sequence plant and animal genomes to meet the growing world-demand for food, to determine anticancer drugs through the study of H-Ras proteins, and for enabling researchers to share and analyze fMRI brain scans in furtherance of understanding the complexities of how the brain functions. All of these examples show the impact NSFÆs high performance computing is having on our health and quality of life.     By all objective measures, the Lonestar project was a tremendous success.
