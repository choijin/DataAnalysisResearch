<AbstractNarration>Ecology is increasingly viewed as a global change science.  Yet, most young ecologists are not aware of international approaches to studying ecological responses to global change, and likewise, they are not familiar with cultural differences that cause scientists and citizens of other countries to respond to climate change in diverse ways.  This project will train U.S. students to meet future challenges in the field of global change ecology through a direct international research experience.  Researchers from Penn State will collaborate with investigators at the Centro Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas and the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid, Spain.  Annually, two graduate students and two undergraduate students will join the Spanish teams and undertake research projects of their own design that integrate climate change, vegetation, and soils.  These projects will take advantage of climate gradient experiments and climate manipulations taking place at the primary institutions involved in the project and will include measurements of plant composition, growth, reproduction, physiology, and soil moisture, nutrient cycling, and biological activity. We focus on diverse ecosystems (northeastern US temperate forest vs. Mediterranean) to identify mechanisms that may lead to a more generalizable understanding of ecological responses to climate change.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This US-Spain International Research Experiences for Students project will train a new generation of global change ecologists and catalyze international networks for the young scientists that will impact their entire careers.  Participants will be recruited from Universidad Puerto Rico Mayag√ºez and Penn State University.  Results will be disseminated through a Penn State general education class in Environmental Sustainability, peer reviewed publications co-authored by Spanish and US students, and presentations by students on campus and at national or international meetings.  Ultimately, this project will provide international training for the students, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, and integrate timely research activities with the education of the broader university community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ US students gained international research experience in the field of global change ecology by participating in an embedded research experience in Spain.  Thirteen US students ranging from undergraduates with no research or international experience to advanced PhD candidates with substantial international experience joined the research groups of Dr. Fernando Valladares at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales and Dr. Fernando Maestre and the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos for 1-2 months.  During their time in Spain, students contributed to projects that included experimental and observational research approaches, as well as data collection techniques to study ecosystem responses to global change, soil nutrient cycling in response to climate change, and arid-land ecosystem responses to climate manipulations.  In addition to their time in Spain, participants prepared for the international trip by taking a course in global change ecology at Penn State and being closely mentored by the two faculty PIs on the project.  Many students followed their time in Spain with research projects in global change ecology at Penn State.  Despite the diverse research backgrounds of the US participants, each one benefited from the experience because they become intimately familiar with global change research approaches used by four groups: the two research groups in Spain and two groups at Penn State.   Research conducted by US participants in Spain has led to two collaborative projects involving Spanish and US researchers ranging in career stages from undergraduate to graduate students, senior researchers, and faculty.  One project documented that temperature warming over the past several decades has positively influenced scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) growth at high elevations, without negatively impact growth at low elevations.  Growth of pines at all elevations was highly sensitive to extreme drought events, such as the one experienced in Spain in 2006.   These results suggest that drought events have strong and negative impacts on scots pine forests, while warming temperatures have neutral to positive effects on pine growth, even for pines in central Spain that are growing towards the southern end of their distribution.  A second project compared root morphology of cork oak (Quercus subur) trees with provenances from across Spain planted in a common garden experiment.   There was a negative correlation between the width of fine roots and annual temperature of source population, suggesting the potential for morphological variability among populations of the species.  The greatest successes of the international research and training program can be attributed to the outstanding research programs of the host institutions in Spain, the caliber of the US students, and the high student-to-faculty ratio of the research training program.  The greatest challenges were the expectation to undertake meaningful research projects within a 1-2 month period in a foreign country, the need to train new participants each year for the embedded research experience, and the challenge in finding participants who are both scientifically suited for the research program and able to communicate in Spanish.  Future international research training programs can benefit from 1) working with foreign researchers that have thriving research programs and are interested in hosting foreign students in their labs, 2) spending time preparing students professionally and personally for their foreign research experience, and 3) having student participants mentored by senior researchers so they become engaged in research science.
