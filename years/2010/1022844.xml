<AbstractNarration>This project is expanding the work of the award-winning "On the Cutting Edge" program, and is continuing to provide a comprehensive, discipline-wide professional development program for current and future geoscience faculty. It is attempting to engage, through participation in face-to-face or online Cutting Edge workshop experiences, about half of the total number of US geoscience faculty in order to achieve a widespread and sustainable impact. It is expanding the segment of the faculty population who have had a first workshop experience, and is also providing geoscience faculty with advanced opportunities for learning that are also encouraging repeated participation in Cutting Edge activities, enabling ongoing learning, and resulting in increased changes in teaching practice among participants. The project is continuing an annual series of face-to-face workshops and is adding six virtual or hybrid workshops or other virtual events. It is introducing a number of new elements including 1) a stronger focus on improving introductory geoscience courses and increasing participation of faculty from two-year colleges, 2) revising the project website to include expanded community-authored and community-reviewed resources as well as improved methods for searching and obtaining previously submitted materials, 3) developing structured activities aimed specifically at enlarging and improving accessibility to the website, 4) incorporating a full research and evaluation program that not only is providing formative feedback to improve the program, but also is extending evaluation to assess the effect that the program has on teaching practice and student learning among the broader geoscience community. In particular, the project is attempting to determine what impact repeated participation in geoscience professional development has on individual teaching practice and on geoscience education nationwide, and what impact participation in an innovative and research-based community of geoscience educators has on faculty teaching effectiveness.  The project is developing and disseminating best practices for the geosciences, however, many project activities are also being transferred to other STEM disciplines through publications, presentations, workshops, and through collaborations developed with SENCER and other organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On the Cutting Edge was a comprehensive, discipline-wide professional development program for current and future geoscience faculty. It aimed to develop a geoscience professoriate committed to high-quality instruction based on currency in scientific knowledge, good pedagogic practice, and research on learning.  From 2002 to 2016, more than 3000 faculty, post-docs and graduate students participated in more than 100 face-to-face and virtual workshops producing a website with more than 9,000 pages of content. This site is visited by more than 800,000 users annually.  This report summarizes the results of the final 8-year NSF grant for the project.     The program improved undergraduate teaching in the geosciences.  Responses to a national survey of geoscience faculty show that Cutting Edge workshop participants are more likely to report engaged teaching practices than those who do not participate in the program (Manduca et al., 2017).  An observation study confirmed the self-reported survey results showing that Cutting Edge workshop participants, as a group, have stronger teaching practices as measured by the RTOP protocol than non-participants (Manduca et al., 2017; Teasdale et al., 2017).  On the Cutting Edge workshops that focused on teaching a specific course within the Cutting Edge offerings (e.g. Teaching Petrology) were particularly effective in transforming teaching practice of faculty teaching that course (Viskupic et al., 2017).        The annual multi-day Early Career workshop and associated web site use a holistic approach to prepare faculty to teach, to conduct research, to make strategic plans, and to manage professional responsibilities in balance with personal lives. Over 1000 faculty members have attended the Early Career Workshop since its origin in 1999.   At the end of the workshop, they report that they have the resources needed to enable them to succeed and are better prepared to move forward with their careers as a result of the workshop. Workshop alumni spend more class time on student activities, questions, and discussion than non-participants and are more likely to feel connected to a national community of geoscience educators than faculty who have not attended. (Beane et al., 2019)  On the Cutting Edge workshops focused on the application of research on learning to geoscience teaching were fundamental in establishing the field of geoscience education research and built connections between this emerging field and psychology, education, and cognitive science.  On the Cutting Edge developed the National Geoscience Faculty Survey (implemented in 2004, 2009, 2012, and 2016) which became a primary tool for research on geoscience teaching and faculty learning at a national scale.  The project also built capacity for geoscience education research through three community-based research teams.  These teams developed new methods and strategies for studying geoscience education at a national scale, and produced research documenting the state of undergraduate geoscience teaching in the United States, evaluating the impact of the On the Cutting Edge program, and shedding light on effective strategies for supporting faculty in their work as educators. The resulting evaluation, research, and project design information has been of high interest to researchers and faculty developers beyond the geosciences.  Nearly one third of the citations of three key papers come from outside the disciplines including three citations in reports from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine.   Lastly, the program produced a large collection of online resources with more than 2000 teaching activities as well as 49 topical collections addressing enhancing your teaching, developing program-wide abilities, designing courses, instructional topics, and managing your career. The project developed a community review process for teaching activities and reviewed the entirety of the collection identifying 386 as exemplary.

The program has been institutionalized within the National Association of Geoscience Teachers who have now run a financially self-sustaining program for three years using a committee management structure that has successfully transitioned leadership.  While the program design has been modified to enable financial self-sufficiency and to adapt to changing technology, culture, and educational context, the program remains committed to the design principles developed by the NSF-funded project and continues to integrate the use of events and the website.
