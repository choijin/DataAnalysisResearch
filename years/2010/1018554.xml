<AbstractNarration>The Semantic Web is an emerging technology that stipulates that the content of&lt;br/&gt;each Internet web site provide self-describing metadata encoded using standard&lt;br/&gt;graph representations, (using the OWL and RDF computer languages). In the&lt;br/&gt;common Internet it is optional for web sites to provide topical descriptions of&lt;br/&gt;their content. Further, the optional methods that are provided simply allow &lt;br/&gt;developers to list keywords.  The methods do not provide a way to detail the &lt;br/&gt;meaning of those keywords, i.e. their semantics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate algorithms that &lt;br/&gt;leverage  the new, semantic aspects of the Internet and make it much easier &lt;br/&gt;to treat multiple web sites and their underlying databases as a single &lt;br/&gt;unified database.  This is distinguished from the existing Internet where &lt;br/&gt;a browser enables people to view documents and data, in the form of &lt;br/&gt;documents, from different web sites in a single place. While the use &lt;br/&gt;of Internet browsers is now endemic and trivially intuitive, creating &lt;br/&gt;computer applications that process data from multiple web sites remains &lt;br/&gt;a highly skilled and labor-intensive process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project comprises two components.  The first component helps create &lt;br/&gt;the Semantic Web by developing methods that automatically map existing &lt;br/&gt;databases to the Semantic Web graph languages. The methods comprise data &lt;br/&gt;mining techniques that discover the semantics already present, but not &lt;br/&gt;explicitly encoded in relational databases and recast those semantics &lt;br/&gt;in graph-based form. The second component comprises the development of &lt;br/&gt;a distributed query execution environment for processing graph structured &lt;br/&gt;queries, expressed in SPARQL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is an invited expert on the W3C working group on standards for &lt;br/&gt;relational database to RDF translation (RDB2RDF), the subject of this &lt;br/&gt;research.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Despite great advances in distributed computing, the skill and labor required to integrate data from different computers is an ever-increasing challenge, a challenge whose importance grows with the Internet itself. Most web sites contain data stored in relational databases (e.g. Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server).  Internet infrastructure has made it easy to exchange messages among any cooperating pair of web sites. Beyond that, only on rare occasion may an Internet user collect and integrate data from two web sites without facing the same labor and requiring the same technical skills faced by a circa 1975 computer science researcher.  That is a user must examine the contents and structure of the data, determine which fields are compatible and write computer programs that combine the data between compatible fields  The Semantic Web is an emerging technology that stipulates that the content of each web site is associated with metadata encoded using a graph-based data structure derived in Artificial Intelligence called a knowledge-graph, also known as an ontology.  Web ontology language (OWL), is used to represent knowledge graphs.   Resource description framework (RDF), is a method for graph representation of data.  SPARQL is the name of the graph-query language.  This research concerns the development of a foundation in the Semantic Web technology stack for algorithms that automate data integration. Our results include algorithms, and the development of systems, where the structure of a relational database is first recast as a knowledge-graph.   Comparing the fields of two databases then becomes a problem of comparing two graphs.   Note that graphs are a rich way to represent the relationships among concepts.  So the methods of graph comparison can consider a larger context than previous systems, many of which simply, in isolation, try to match the names of individual fields    In one such result we showed that even in this richer context the correspondence between elements of the graph, and thus the correspondence of fields in the underlying databases is ambiguous;  that the correct correspondence of fields depends on the questions being asked.  To overcome this we developed algorithms where the question, a graph-based SPARQL query, is represented as different possible paths through the knowledge-graph.  Ultimately the query is executed by adopting the paths with the highest matching score.   Thus, the query itself provides an additional foundation for deciding which databases fields in different databases are important and that correspond to each other.  In a high profile result, our methods were applied in an interdisciplinary effort known as the Constitute Project. The primary result of the constitute project is a web site (https://www.constituteproject.org) whose underlying databases span nearly 200 different sovereign constitutions  such that individual passages are tagged using a knowledge-graph of over 300 concepts.  Constitute has become a critical resource for both academic study and the development of new constitutions.  (see https://www.constituteproject.org/content/testimonials  New constitutions are written every year. The people who write these important documents need to read and analyze texts from existing constitutions. The constitute web site offers access to the world?s constitutions such that users can systematically compare the passages of a set of constitutions across a broad set of topics &mdash; using an inviting, clean interface.
