<AbstractNarration>This Noyce phase I project is a collaboration between UC Davis, three local school districts and four community colleges to recruit and prepare secondary science and mathematics teachers for California's secondary schools. The project's goals are to 1) recruit and retain students in the (undergraduate) Mathematics and Science Teaching program (MAST), particularly underrepresented minorities; 2) increase the overall number of science and mathematics credential candidates in the UC Davis Teacher Education Program by a minimum of 50%; and 3) retain at least 80% of the Noyce Scholars in their school districts for a minimum of four years. Each year, three one-year and one two-year scholarships are targeted for community college transfer students. Scholarship recipients complete their student teaching in schools serving substantial numbers of students who are economically disadvantaged and/or English learners. The program aims to produce sixty six new science and mathematics teachers.</AbstractNarration>
