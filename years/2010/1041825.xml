<AbstractNarration>The investigators will conduct a model-based investigation of the dynamics of a productive pelagic ecosystems in the Gulf of Maine. The middle trophic levels in highly productive marine ecosystems are typically dominated by a few species of pelagic fish, such as sardines and anchovies in upwelling environments or herring and/or capelin in temperate and subpolar regions. These species act as important conduits for energy to higher trophic levels, including larger fish, seabirds, and cetaceans. When abundant, small pelagics can exert significant pressure on their prey, typically large mesozooplankton. Small pelagic fish exhibit complex dynamics and managing these species under an ecosystem approach is challenging. This modeling study will track both the abundance and condition of representative copepods (Calanus finmarchicus, Centropages typicus), herring, and bluefin tuna. The investigators will use a rigorous comparison of conditions from the 1980s and 1990s to develop the model. They will examine the sensitivity of this ecosystem to changes in fishing pressure on the middle trophic levels and to changes in the magnitude and timing of primary production. They will also consider the impact of increased temperature on the ability of C. finmarchicus to accumulate lipids and alter the condition of herring and tuna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will lead to improved knowledge of ecosystems with productive food webs. It will also directly impact address issues related to the management of the herring resource in the Gulf of Maine. The investigators will examine the consequences of ignoring condition of zooplankton and fish, as is the case with the current stock assessment. They will also explore the dynamical properties of the model ecosystem and consider under what conditions it is possible to have both abundant and well conditioned herring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our contribution to the NSF project,  "Using interdecadal comparisons to understand trade-offs between  abundance and condition in fishery ecosystems", was inclusion of  my lab's  (Large Pelagics Research Center) long-term ecological data and information  on Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT),  one of the  top predators in the Gulf of Maine and NW Atlantic ecoystem.  Our data and ecological insights include the availability,  regional distribution, biological condition, trophic interactions, as well as  local and long term dispersal patterns of ABFT. Trophic information from our research included the foraging patterns and predator-prey relationships of bluefin and their principle prey, such as Atlantic herring.  Through the work of several graduate students and postdocs in my lab, including co PI Dr. Walter Golet, and LPRC's life history modeling led by Dr. Erik Chapman,  we helped identify the importance and sources of energy acquisition for top, migratory predators that come to this region to feed, and establish positive lipid stores that fuel migration to spawning grounds and reproduction.  The  ability to put together the story of bottom up  considerations of the GOMaine ecosystem and oceanography against the energetic needs of the consumer species (such as ABFT and cetaceans) is important to the economic well being of the region, and our nation's seafood supply.  This work will  help us understand changes that are occurring, and will continue to happen to this productive region, that supports many US fisheries, in relation to ocean warming, climate change, and human impacts on the ocean.
