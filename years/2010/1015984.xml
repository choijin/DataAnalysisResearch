<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research program is to develop solution methods for&lt;br/&gt;solving magneto-hydrodynamics flows in three-dimensional domains comprising conducting&lt;br/&gt;and nonconducting regions and variable/discontinuous magnetic&lt;br/&gt;permeability.  The method to be developed will be robust enough to&lt;br/&gt;handle High Reynolds flows and high Prandtl numbers. Lagrange finite elements &lt;br/&gt;will be used and novel mathematical formulations will be developed&lt;br/&gt;to make Lagrange finite elements to converge&lt;br/&gt;in non-smooth domains and with non-smooth interfaces. &lt;br/&gt;The code to be developed will be fully parallel.&lt;br/&gt;The applications targeted&lt;br/&gt;are the geodynamo, sea-water/oil separation and liquid metal flows.&lt;br/&gt;The solution strategy to be developed will be&lt;br/&gt;flexible enough so as to be easily modifiable to simulate plasma flows&lt;br/&gt;in Tokamak geometries and thus to contribute to the ongoing global&lt;br/&gt;international effort on magnetic confinement of plasmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the research program is to propose and analyze new&lt;br/&gt;numerical strategies for simulating three-dimensional fluid flows&lt;br/&gt;interacting with electromagnetic fields in heterogeneous media at high&lt;br/&gt;speed. One phenomenon of interest is the so-called fluid dynamo&lt;br/&gt;effect.  The dynamo phenomenon arises in astrophysics. It is&lt;br/&gt;responsible for the magnetic fields that are observed around stars and&lt;br/&gt;planets with liquid cores. This phenomenon arises also in experimental&lt;br/&gt;setups aiming at reproducing the dynamo effect. The fluid may be&lt;br/&gt;plasma in stars and in tokamaks, molten iron in planets, or liquid&lt;br/&gt;gallium or sodium in experimental setups. The dynamo effect may have&lt;br/&gt;undesired consequence on heat extraction processes from fast breeder&lt;br/&gt;reactors. This research will also prepare the ground for further&lt;br/&gt;developments on plasma flows in Tokamak geometries. This research&lt;br/&gt;project will involve large scale parallel computing and will lead to new&lt;br/&gt;numerical strategies to simulate high speed flows interacting with&lt;br/&gt;magnetic fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project the PI and his collaborators have developed numerical methods to solve problems involving the motion of current conducting fluids like liquid metals or plasmas. New mathematical models have been investigated and a numerical code running on massively parallel computers has been written. The code is freely available to the public. One key difficulty addressed in this project was to account for heterogeneous materials in a way that is mathematically sound. This project is concerned with the mathematical and numerical modeling of devices composed of solid parts, conducting fluids (possibly composed of different phases), and non-conducting materials (either air or vacuum).  The main applications for this research are energy related.  For instance the next generation of Liquid-Metal Fast-Breeder Reactors and Tokamaks will need large electromagnetic pumps to move the liquid sodium that will extract the energy from the reactor, and it will be important to ascertain that the motion of the liquid sodium does not produce a dynamo effect that could impair its energy extraction capabilities or antagonize the performance of the pump, see figure 1. (The key advantage of electromagnetic pumps over mechanical pumps is that they have no bearings, no seals, and no mechanical moving parts, which make them significantly safer.)  This project has also application in the emerging technology of large scale liquid metal batteries.  The emergence of renewable energy technologies, such as wind and solar power, has increased the demand for low-cost, long-life, large-scale energy storage devices. Liquid metal battery have the potential to outperform traditional batteries in that they have rapid charge discharge kinetics, they have very long-life, and they can reach very large scales. All these qualities makes them economically attractive for grid-level energy storage.  Mathematical and numerical models have been built in this project to investigate some magnetic instabilities that could be triggered in liquid metal batteries by very high discharge currents, see Figure 2. The software that has been developed can also be used to investigate instabilities of plasmas in magnetic confinement devices (Tokamaks), see Figure 3. Finally this project has applications in Geo-sciences. The numerical code developed during this project can be used to study the generation and the stability of the magnetic field of the Earth. As a illustration of the capabilities of this software, Figure 4 shows a vortex created by the spin-over instability in a spherical body with a liquid core under rotation.  This instability is observed in rotating stars and planets; it is a resonance between inertial waves and the tidal wave.
