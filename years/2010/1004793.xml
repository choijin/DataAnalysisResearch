<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the Center for Plant Cell Biology (CEPCEB) at the University of California-Riverside (UCR) to provide research training for 10 weeks for 12 students, during the summers of 2010-2014.  This award is supported by the Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences. The scientific focus of the program is on the cellular and molecular biology of plants and plant pathogens.  Training will be provided to a broad range of students from both two- and four-year colleges, including those from institutions that offer limited research opportunities and members of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.  The program begins with one week of lectures and exercises that introduce the basics of molecular and cell biology, and topics in plant and pathogen biology.  Each student then spends nine weeks on an independent research project in a faculty laboratory.  Professional skills will be enhanced by a scholarly writing project, a poster session presentation based on the individual student research project, and participation in a seminar series.  Students will also attend workshops that address topics such as how to gain admission to graduate school, scientific ethics and the responsible conduct of research, and career options in various science-affiliated fields.  Participants will learn to work in a professional environment, gain increased confidence in themselves, and improve their skills in communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving.  The program will be evaluated using a common assessment tool, and the career outcomes of participants will be tracked.  Inquiries about the program may be made to Professor Howard Judelson (howard.judelson@ucr.edu, 951-827-4199) or by visiting the program's web site at: http://genomics.ucr.edu/reu.php.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A total of sixty undergraduates (12 per year) were provided with ten weeks of hands-on research experience in a summer residential program.  The students were chosen from a nationwide pool with an emphasis on those with limited access to research experiences in their home institutions.  The student participants worked under the mentorship of a faculty member or other senior researcher on topics related to the molecular and cellular biology of plants and plant pathogens.  Representative topics included "microRNA biogenesis in plants", "Pathogenesis strategies of filamentous plant pathogens", "Spatio-temporal analyses of transcription in plant development", and "Retention of a plant virus in an insect vector".  In addition, participants took part in lectures on topics relevant to their research, such as genetics, molecular biology, genomics, plant biology, and plant pathology.  The students also engaged in weekly professional development activities that included experiences in scientific writing and oral presentations, and workshops on scientific integrity, research ethics, career choices in science, and the graduate school experience.  The students therefore contributed not only to research advances in plant and plant pathogen biology, but obtained valuable exposure to the research enterprise and career options in science.  As a sign of the broad impacts of this work, two-thirds of participants went on to enter graduate school in a STEM field, employment in biotechnology firms, or science teaching.  All participants reported significant gains in their perception of themselves as potential scientists and in their problem-solving and creative skills.
