<AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Christopher Arumainayagam of Wellesley College and his undergraduate students will employ infrared spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and isothermal electron stimulated desorption (ESD) to characterize the effects of low-energy electrons on thin films of halomethanes, methanol and molybdenum hexacarbonyl. The underlying hypothesis of the research is that much of the damage that occurs in materials exposed to ionizing radiation or high energy particles is due to secondary electrons which, while lower in energy per particle, are generated in much greater abundance relative to the primary ionizing photon or particle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will not only advance the specific chemistry field of electron-induced reactions, but will be relevant to other areas of science and technology, including our understanding of radiation damage in biological systems, electron beam lithography for microelectronics technology, new environmental remediation techniques, and atmospheric reaction cycles. Importantly, these investigations will also provide a vehicle for research training of undergraduate scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the interstellar medium, UV photolysis of ice mantles surrounding dust grains is thought to be the mechanism that drives the formation of "complex" molecules. The source of this reaction-initiating UV light is assumed to be local because externally sourced UV radiation cannot penetrate the ice-containing dark, dense molecular clouds. Specifically, exceedingly penetrative high-energy cosmic rays generate secondary electrons within the clouds through molecular ionizations. These cosmic-ray induced secondary electrons excite hydrogen molecules present within the above-mentioned dense molecular clouds.
