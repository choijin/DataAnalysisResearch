<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the REU site in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Toledo.   Undergraduate students have a variety of cutting edge research opportunities in topics including Astrophysics/Astronomy; Atomic/Molecular/Optical Physics; Biological/Health/Medical Physics (at the UT Medical Center hospital); and Condensed Matter/Materials Science Physics (with specialization in thin films, photovoltaics, and photonics).  Opportunities exist in these areas for both experimental and theoretical research. In photovoltaics, the students may have the opportunity to conduct research at local photovoltaic companies and centers, in addition to departmental research. The research projects are chosen such that the students' projects will lead to eventual publication in the appropriate professional research journals.  REU students will be involved in exciting state-of-the-art research in a department that allows individualized attention, yet is large enough to give students experiences in a variety of subfields of physics. A variety of social activities for the REU students are also planned. The REU site is committed to involving students from diverse backgrounds in this research experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             The NSF-REU program in Physics and Astronomy, directed by Dr. Richard Irving and Professor Thomas Kvale, gave enhanced research opportunities to 51 undergraduate students from 28 colleges and universities in 27 states from Summer 2010 through Summer 2012.  Student participants were chosen competitively out of 401 applications from students in 45 states, Puerto Rico, District of Columbia, and two foreign countries.    We entered into collaborations with four community colleges (Itasca, Northwest State, Owens, Terra) to reserve spots for students from each of these institutions per summer.  Itasca Community College collaboration has been very successful and has dependably sent us two students per summer.  They have arrangements with Iron Range Engineering and Minnesota State University - Mankato, and in some cases the students identified themselves with those institutions.  In keeping with the spirit of the proposal, we involved students at other community colleges and/or small liberal arts schools to fill a significant number of positions each year.              Students were required to attend two seminar series during the ten week summer session.  One was an university-wide series (UGR2980) that concentrated on the safe and ethical conduct of research.  Speakers were from the Office of Research Administration, Office of Safety and Health, Honors College, Research Compliance, Writing Center, and other speakers.  The other seminar series was a "Bag Lunch" series that involved physics and astronomy faculty and/or other professionals discussing state-of-the-art research in their fields.              The students conducted meaningful research projects with faculty members in the areas of: atomic physics (both accelerator-based experimental and theoretical atomic structure), low-temperature plasma physics, condensed matter physics, medical physics, and astrophysics.  The student experiences have been very encouraging.  The students were required to give a Mid-term talk, a Final Talk, and a written Final Report.  The benefits of these requirements are manifest in the students being co-authors of at least 16 refereed, archival journal articles and at least eight presentations at conferences in 2010-2012.
