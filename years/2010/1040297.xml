<AbstractNarration>This NSF MRI Award funds the acquisition of a confocal microscope to expand the research capabilities of faculty at University of Chicago and at the Field Museum of Natural History for conducting research in the fields of organismal and evolutionary biology.Topics of study include  examining the functions of ectopic neurons as models for exploring neural circuit evolution in zebrafish, germ band pattern development in flies, the response of plants to bacterial infection and the organization of song circuit neurons in birds. The microscope would provide essential imaging capabilities of cellular and sub cellular structures. The microscope benefits students by allowing them to gain experience in the application of research techniques in classes and independent projects. The results of the research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at&lt;br/&gt;professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This instrumentation grant supported the acquisition of a confocal microscope in a shared research facility. The system, a Zeiss LSM710 microscope and its associated hardware and software, was installed in a centralized space and made available for general use.
