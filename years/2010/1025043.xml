<AbstractNarration>This research considers systems that combine social networks and sensor networks with complicated interactions involving hierarchical structure. To design and analyze such complex distributed systems, information-theoretical methods will be combined with advanced Bayesian and non-Bayesian statistical techniques such as spatiotemporal nonlinear estimation and prediction, advanced changepoint detection and estimation methods, and multihypothesis decision-making strategies. Advanced data fusion methods at different levels will be proposed and tested. Distributed networks will be modeled by quite general coupled fractional hidden Markov models adapted to allow for nonlinear prediction and detection-classification.  The spaces in which estimation, prediction, and classification are performed may be both metric and symbolic, thus allowing for the effective incorporation of sensor (metric) and social (symbolic) networks as a part of a large-scale distributed system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design of complex multi-level hierarchical systems, including systems that search for patterns to identify developing or immediate threats, is vitally important for various areas, including national security, environmental monitoring, SmartGrid and other critical infrastructures. This research will develop novel approaches for automated efficient fusion  of information from multiple sources or/and from multiple levels of  hierarchy of complex systems that will enable these systems to achieve high accuracy in detection of changes in trends, prediction, and recognition.   Probabilistic modeling of networks will be coupled with novel approaches to event pattern recognition, change detection and information integration/fusion in complex, multisource-multisensor distributed heterogeneous systems. Both mathematical formulations and solution algorithms will be developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Smart Grid refers to a new technology capable of achieving vast savings in energy by providing interfaces together power transmission networks, alternative power generation networks, and communication networks.  The savings are achieved by enabling close to real-time information exchange between energy suppliers and consumers.  One byproduct of this information exchange is to enable the management of energy utilization through demand response support whereby users are steered, through a variety of incentives, to cooperate with objectives set by utility companies aimed at ensuring the stability and resilience of the Grid.    The research under this grant falls under this banner of Demand-Response (DR) management.  Analytical and computational procedures have been developed that augment the capabilities of SmartGrid with a predictive dimension.  This enhances decisions predicated on SmartGrid information by allowing them to distill more knowledge out of the wealth of big data exchanged across the communication network.  A hallmark of the contribution from this grant to DR is the characterization of uncertainties attached to these predictions.  This permits the calculation of risks associated with these decisions and will serve to enhance the reliability of an increasingly complex power grid with entangled generation, distribution, and pricing.    Contributions were made, under this grant, in three complementary areas.  First, mathematical models were developed to describe uncertainty in demand expected to arise from both the presence of a human element in the loop and the dependence of alternative energy on weather and climate variabilities.  The mathematical model for tackling these challenges was initially conceived for application in nuclear physics and relies on random matrices that describe exchanges of power on a graph.  These exchanges, while uncertain, must satisfy a "what comes in must come out" at each node of the network.  With this very intuitive constraint, meaningful mathematical constructions ensue that provide improved predictability over the whole network.  These same ideas were adapted to applications in infrastructure sustainability and epidemiology, highlighting the significant broader impacts of this research.  A second contribution from this grant was the development of semi-parametric regression models that are adapted to SmartGrid data.  To the end, data was secured through a collaborative investigation with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).  Specifically, data from a controlled SmartGrid experiment in the Pacific Northwest was obtained from PNNL. While the data was extensive, its initial format was not conducive for prediction as it lacked both a causal and a statistical dependence structure.  As part of the exploration of this data, research under this grant developed conditions for validity of statistical models and of inferences based on them.  A number of statistical models were then compared and ranked.  A significant observation which underscores the value of SmartGrid technology is that short term consumer behavior is the best indicator of their future behavior over short term horizons.  However, this essential dependence on the recent past remains quite complex and nonlinear.       The third contribution from the present research to Demand Response has been in providing means for a consumer to capitalize on SmartGrid technology by defining and optimizing her or his utility under conditions of uncertainty similar to those available to utility companies.  The objective of this component of the effort has been to provide analytical and algorithmic logic for a "home energy management system" that interacts with both utility companies and the slew of appliances within a home with the objective of scheduling these appliances so as to meet consumer preferences including cost and comfort.  Methods of Robust Control and Bayesian Networks have been developed to address the peculiarities...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
