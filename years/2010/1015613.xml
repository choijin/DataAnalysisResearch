<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the main goals of reasoning is to derive new information from prior information. For instance, given the premises,  1. All men are mortal  2. Socrates is a man  one can reason to the conclusion, Socrates is mortal. This kind of reasoning, where the inference runs from generalities ("All men are mortal") to a specific conclusion ("Socrates is mortal"), is called syllogistic reasoning. Despite the usefulness of syllogisms, they do not have the right form for other reasoning problems. That raises the questions, are there other systems of logic that can be applied to those problems, and do humans in fact use them in their everyday reasoning?  There turns out to be many systems of logic, each fine tuned for specific types of problems, including one called "theory of mind" or  belief-desire reasoning. Theory of mind is an indispensable form of reasoning humans use in social contexts. Like syllogisms, it requires integrating two pieces of information to determine a third piece. But it works differently in that the pieces of information involve belief, desire, and action. Here are some examples to make this clear.  Example 1: If you know that a) your friend believes thereÆs an apple in the fridge and b) your friend wants the apple, then you can predict (that is, infer or reason) c) your friend will get the apple from the fridge (action).  Example 2: If you know that a) your friend believes thereÆs an apple in the fridge and you see that b) your friend is going to the fridge (action), then you can infer that c) your friend wants the apple.  Why study "theory of mind?" Consider that while the normally developing child engages effortlessly in following eye gaze, understanding sarcasm, lying, deception, cooperating, and others forms of sophisticated social interaction, children with autism tend to exhibit none of these abilities. What is different in autism that prevents them from engaging in the social world? Among other things, children with autism systematically fail on "theory of mind" reasoning tasks (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, &amp; Frith, 1985). For this reason, my collaborators and I have been studying how the healthy belief-desire reasoning system works, in hopes of better understanding its breakdown in conditions such as autism.  I conducted research in Tokyo, Japan, at Showa University and the University  of Tokyo under Dr. Nobumasa Kato and Dr. Noriaki Yahata. The reason I wanted to work with these people and at this location was that a) my mentors were experts in cognitive and clinical neuroscience, b) the university offered a variety of equipment, and c) I had never been to Tokyo before and I thought it would be a great chance to travel while doing science.  My collaborators and I tested two competing hypotheses: the domain-specific hypothesis that the brain has a specialized network for belief-desire reasoning and the domain-general hypothesis that the brain has a general reasoning network that handles both belief-desire (social) reasoning and non-social reasoning problems.

For each task, participants were given a number of problems to reason about while they laid in a scanner that used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity. We then compared the brain activity between the social and non-social tasks and showed that in the right hemisphere, there was a network that responded only to the social reasoning task. In the left hemisphere, there was a network that responded to the social reasoning task and to the non-social reasoning task. This suggests that right lateralized networks may be specializ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
