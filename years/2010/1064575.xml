<AbstractNarration>Sampling continuous-time signals constitutes a fundamental process in the modern digital technology era. This research investigates a novel class of event-triggered samplers, in which the sampling times are dictated in a dynamic way by the actual signals to be sampled. The richness of the event-triggered sampling schemes allows for the mathematical formulation of meaningful optimization problems that can lead to sampling strategies with optimal characteristics and resulting in potentially significant performance gains. The theories and techniques to be developed in this project can potentially make significant contributions to important application areas such as sensor network systems for event surveillance and monitoring, and networked control systems for smart-grid-based power generation and distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on three major problems in the general areas of decentralized statistical signal processing, namely, sequential detection (hypothesis testing and changepoint detection), parameter estimation, and signal estimation and control. In all three problems, optimal event-triggered mechanisms will be investigated that can optimize the corresponding detection or estimation performance. In addition, a special class of event-triggered samplers will be analyzed and the corresponding design methods for digital signal processing (DSP) will be developed .This research will have transformative impacts on the fields of statistical signal processing and digital signal processing. In particular, the use of event-triggered sampling in detection, estimation and control can significantly improve the performance in a decentralized setup and simplify considerably the communication requirements in terms of power and bandwidth.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this project is on decentralized sequential methodologies for statistical signal processing. We consider sequential methods since they are known to be significantly more efficient than the classical fixed sample size alternatives. We consider decentralized setup since with the emergence of sensor networks and Internet-of-things (IoT), distributed signal processing becomes ubiquitous.   During the course of this project, we have made significant contributions to the area of level-triggered-sampling-based decentralized statiscal signal processing, both on the theorey front and in various applications.   On the theory side, we have introduced the level-triggered sampling paradigm to a number of sub-areas of statitical signal processing, including (1) hypothesis testing (2) parameter estimation (3) signal estimation (4) composite hypothesis testing (5) joint detection and estimation (6) fully distributed detection. In each problem, the main goal is to discover the optimum sampling mechanism, within the rich event-triggered class, that optimizes the performance of the corresponding decentralized sequential signal processing task.  We have developed an array of efficient algorithms for these signal processing problems with provable performance guarantees.   In addition to the above theoretical advances, during the course of this project, we have also considered a number of applications where level-triggered statistical signal processing proved to be powerful, including distributed detection in MIMO radar sensor networks, fault detection in photovoltaic (PV) systems, power quality monitoring in smart grid, attack detection in online reputation systems, channel estimation in millimeter-wave massive MIMO communications, and joint spectrum sensing and dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio system.
