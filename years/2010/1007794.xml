<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to improve the control of multiple&lt;br/&gt;testing error rates.  A popular approach to multiple testing is based on&lt;br/&gt;permutation. One motivation for the use of permutation-based&lt;br/&gt;testing is to reduce the conservativeness of the tests while still&lt;br/&gt;controlling error rates.  Permutation-based tests are thought to achieve&lt;br/&gt;this by incorporating the multivariate distribution of the multiple test&lt;br/&gt;statistics. However, the hypotheses for which permutation testing is known&lt;br/&gt;to be appropriate are different from those usually considered in multiple&lt;br/&gt;testing. In this project, the investigators precisely describe model&lt;br/&gt;assumptions and conditions for permutation testing to control multiple&lt;br/&gt;testing error rates.  In particular, the investigators study precise model&lt;br/&gt;assumptions connecting the marginal distributions of interest in multiple&lt;br/&gt;testing to the joint distributions known to be appropriate for permutation&lt;br/&gt;testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the methods studied in this project can be used in many fields, they&lt;br/&gt;will be particularly applicable to genetic association studies.&lt;br/&gt;Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are conducted to discover&lt;br/&gt;biological pathways and prognostic biomarkers, and to guide treatment.&lt;br/&gt;Some GWAS discoveries have failed to replicate, possibly due to&lt;br/&gt;statistical testing procedures lacking error rate control.  In this&lt;br/&gt;project, the investigators study the conditions under which currently used&lt;br/&gt;methods are guaranteed to appropriately control statistical error rates.&lt;br/&gt;Such control will lead to better return on investments in developing drugs&lt;br/&gt;and treatments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Multiple testing for significant association between predictors and responses has a wide array of applications.  One such application is pharmacogenomics, where testing for association between categorical responses (e.g., healthy or diseased) and many categorical genetic markers is of interest.  Permuting response group labels to generate a reference distribution is often thought of as a convenient technique that automatically captures dependence in the data and leads to more powerful tests.  However, the PIs and their colleague showed that strong model assumptions are required for permutation testing to control multiple testing error rates (Kaizar, Li, and Hsu, 2011 Journal of the American Statistical Association).  When these assumptions are violated, permutation-based multiple testing can give incorrect unconditional and, especially, conditional assessment of the statistical significances.  Such flawed procedures may ædiscoverÆ important genetic markers that are in fact not related to disease, or fail to identify those that are in truth important to the disease mechanism.  Regardless of the study design, the statistical research showed that how misleading permutation-based assessment can be is primarily driven by covariances among the markers that differ between the two response groups (e.g., those with and without disease).   The PIs and their colleague further showed that these same flaws extend to permutation-based tests for markers that predict a response to treatment, known as "predictive markers" (Kaizar and Kil, 2013).  In fact, this research suggests that permutation-based tests for predictive markers actually identify markers that are associated with the outcome of interest (e.g., disease), regardless of its effect on the efficacy of treatment (i.e., prognostic markers).  Thus, using flawed permutation-based tests may erroneously identify subpopulations for targeted pharmaceutical use, when the drug should actually be used either more or less broadly.   In response to these troubling findings regarding permutation-based multiple testing procedures, the PIs have also developed statistically correct methods for subgroup discovery.  In particular, the new research considers the common case of finding a classification rule to group patients into target and non-target populations based on a continuous characteristic.  A frequently cited method in this setting relies on permutation-based multiple tests (Jiang, Freidlin and Simon, 2007 Journal of the National Cancer Institute).  The PIs and their colleagues have demonstrated the use of a different method that accounts for the correlation among nested subgroups without relying on permutation (Tang, et al, 2013).  A related method for categorical outcomes is still under development.  By using these new methods instead of permutation-based techniques, pharmaceutical researchers will be able to correctly identify subpopulations for which new drugs are effective and safe.  To broadly caution researchers against careless use of permutation-based multiple tests, Jason Hsu has taught five short courses on multiple comparisons that included precise conditions for validity of permutation multiple tests (FDA Center for Device and Radiologic Health, October 2010, Deming Conference, December 2010, Multiple Comparison Procedures Conference, August 2011, International Conference on Health Policy Statistics Conference, October 2011, and Multiple Comparison Procedures 2013, July 2013).  In addition, the PIs and their colleagues have publicized the assumptions necessary for valid permutation-based multiple tests in 18 presentations to both statistical conference and pharmaceutical company audiences (International Chinese Statistical Association Applied Statistics Symposium, June 2010, Eli Lily, February 2011, Mathematical Biosciences Institute, March 2011, FDA/MTLI Medical Devices and IVD Statistics Workshop, April 2011, National Health Research Institute, Taiwan, May 2011, International ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
