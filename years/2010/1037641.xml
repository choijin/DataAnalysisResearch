<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project explores how to create on-line social networks for Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) students.  These networks will be used to provide a support network for students to interact both with peers--other REU student--as well as faculty mentors.  Through the process of building and maintaining an REU support network at one test site, the project seeks to understand effective practices for mentoring REU students.  The resulting compendium of best practices will be widely distributed to REU participants including faculty and administrators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project is to learn how to create strong support networks for REU students.  Such support networks will enable REU students, some of whom have few opportunities to interact with a larger peer group, to more broadly interact with other REU students and faculty.  Such support networks can be particularly advantageous for under-represented groups in STEM fields.  By compiling a "digital handbook" of best mentoring practices, the project may improve the impact of REU programs across a wide range of STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

Pathways to Engineering Web Portal  A third major product is the Pathways to Engineering web portal, which will continue to serve the engineering community going forward.  Mainly an outreach and recruitment tool, it also provides a new channel for the access of resources and delivery of the educational materials. For example, students can search for programs based on discipline, geography, funding types, level of study, keywords, and more. Students and faculty can also access resources such as "Tips on Creating a Winning Application" for students, and "Recruitment Strategies" for program personnel. The portal has attracted 9,857 unique visitors and a total of 28,154 page views, with totals over the course of the project of 12,713 unique visitors and 38,753 page views. Outreach  In order to inform students and faculty about research opportunities, funding sources, and a host of resources designed to assist in building a more diverse workforce, IBP conducted face-to-face outreach and recruitment at 70 conferences and other ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
