<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award will lead to the development of a high-throughput functional microfluidic platform and unique cellular constructs such that dynamic readouts of signaling associated with cell death pathways such as apoptosis can be investigated.  The work combines advances in engineering such as BioMEMS with current knowledge in molecular and cell biology and pharmacology. This platform will be used to examine the mechanism of action of anticancer drugs, and ultimately be used in rapid drug screening.  The research will lead to a reduction in time to development of new drugs, not just for cancer, but potentially for a variety of diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational goals of this award, to enhance research opportunities and increase the number of students from underrepresented groups entering the professional workforce of biotechnology and bioengineering, will be achieved by (i) offering summer research experiences to high school students; (ii) increasing the retention of undergraduate engineering students; (iii) reaching out to industry to promote recruitment of biomedical engineering (BME) graduates; and (iv) enhancing the BME students' competitiveness in the job market of biotech/bioengineering by incorporating up-to-date biotechnologies into the CCNY BME curriculum and providing undergraduate research opportunities. For high school students, the research experiences will build their scientific knowledge and encourage them to pursue the BME major.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We have successfully developed a three dimensional microfluidic cell array (3D &mu;FCA), which reconstructs a 3D tumor microenvironment with cancer cells and microvascular endothelial cells. To mimic the in vivo spatial relationship between microvessels and non-endothelial cells embedded in extracellular matrix, three polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers were built into this array. The bottom layer had microchambers housing cells encapsulated in hydrogel; the top layer has multiple microchannels to allow cell culture medium to flow through. The middle layer has clustered micro-pores to enable positioned nutrient delivery and waste removal. Thus, the multilayer property of the device enabled the imitation of the drug delivery in a micro-cell/tissue array with simulated blood circulation. This work was published and has a pending patent in USA, Canada and China. In addition, we have developed 4 apoptosis reporter cell lines to detect the activation of TRAIL death receptors, caspase 3 and 8 as well as cytochrome C release from damaged mitochondria. To the pharmaceutical industry, combining a scaled-up system with the apoptosis reporter cell lines may may offer a novel mid-throughput screening tool with an improved drug discovery efficiency. To the cancer clinical drug screening, a modified 3D &mu;FCA with an ability to host tissue samples will provide a more accurate prediction of drug responses and identification of a personal treatment for a specific patient if biopsy samples are used. Thus, an improved treatment outcome could be available to cancer patients.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Sihong&nbsp;Wang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
