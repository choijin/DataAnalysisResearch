<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will study the feasibility for commercialization of an intelligent reconfigurable modular robot system called iMobot, which was originally developed at the University of California, Davis. Nowadays, robotics has grown beyond automation to encompass intelligent systems that are self-reliant, reconfigurable, mobile, intelligent, and aware of their environment. iMobot has four degrees of freedom capable of full mobility and assembly into clusters. Because of its flexibility, modularity, and reconfigurability, iMobot will be an ideal platform for many research and teaching programs in colleges and universities. For example, it allows researchers to study artificial intelligence, swarm technology, robot collaboration, mobile networking, and programming for reconfigurability. iMobot is designed with open architecture. Each module has a processor capable of supporting sensor fusion, gait simulation, and runs an open source embedded Linux operating system. Users can customize software and accessories for their specific needs. Proposed product feasibility research includes adaptable connectivity between modules, intelligent plug-and-play sensors, a robust and lightweight chassis, and re-configurability. In this proposed project, a professional design team will re-design and build a commercial quality prototype of iMobot for manufacturing in a large quantity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the proposed project will be one of the first attempts to scale up an intelligent reconfigurable modular robot for commercial deployment. The iMobot could be used for university research and teaching, K-12 STEM education, and life-saving rescue and search operations in the first responder system. With a standardized hardware base using an open architecture, users will be able to more widely share their work with each other, and to create a valuable open educational resource. Robotics is an interdisciplinary field. The unique full mobility and reconfigurability of iMobot are very appealing to college and K-12 students. The robot can be used alone or in collaboration with others, making it a flexible and scalable educational tool. By introducing students to interesting robotic projects with affordable hardware platforms, which involve a variety of math, physics, information technology, and engineering principles, we can excite their imagination and give them confidence to pursue STEM careers, especially for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged groups.</AbstractNarration>
