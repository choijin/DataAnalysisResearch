<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the development of computer models to simulate the behavior of fiber reinforced composite parts during the manufacturing process and to couple the new models with existing commercial compression and injection molding software. During the manufacturing of short fiber reinforced composite parts, mold filling plays a significant role in the quality, reflected by fiber damage, excessive fiber orientation, fiber jamming and fiber matrix separation. Current approaches are based on simulation as well as trial and error techniques.  However, in order to properly deal with fiber damage, fiber jamming and fiber-matrix separation, a comprehensive understanding of the physics behind fiber motion is required. Within this project, the fibers are modeled using a mechanistic approach, where their structure is represented as a flexible chain composed of a combination of springs and beads or cylinders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final product will allow the process engineer to predict potential defects and optimize the properties of a part before a mold is actually made. Simulation results will include final fiber orientations, fiber attrition and fiber density distributions within a molded part. Furthermore, such a tool will help shed light on phenomena that are not well understood, such as fiber matrix separation, that result in ribs and features with low fiber content and in injection molded parts with a fiber free skin region. With a higher level of understanding of fiber motion phenomena during molding, it will eventually be possible to mass produce polymer composite parts with higher quality and controlled properties, making lightweight polymer composites available to a wider range of applications, at a time when energy efficiency and innovation are needed in the automotive and aeronautical industries. Furthermore, the nature of this project will provide students the unique opportunity to obtain interdisciplinary training in various fields including material science, polymer composites engineering, systems science, and manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
