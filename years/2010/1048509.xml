<AbstractNarration>This proposal applies for NSF support for the 43rd International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-43). The MICRO Symposium is a top-tier conference on microprocessor related research and has enjoyed a rich history of success. The research results presented at MICRO conferences have shown strong impacts in this research field and are highly regarded in the computer architecture community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By providing this support to students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty members, the PI expect to extend the range of attendance. We also anticipate that the research results presented at the conference, as well as the emphasis on interaction between academic researchers and industrial designers, will be carried back by attendees to their home institutions resulting in heightened awareness and interests in advanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funds will be used solely to provide travel support for students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty members in order to defray the costs of attending and participating in MICRO-43. Priority will be given to those students who will present their research at MICRO-43 or its joint workshops. To broaden the participation, the PI will strongly encourage women and members of other under-represented minority groups to apply for the&lt;br/&gt;travel grant.</AbstractNarration>

The funding provided by NSF was supplemented by funds provided by the Association for Computing Machinery - Special Interest Group on Microarchitecture (ACM - SIG MICRO) and some funds from the Symposium itself, for a total of 63 travel grants (including 24 from NSF-awarded funds).  The International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO) is the world's premier venue for publishing research results in the area of microarchitecture, which generally considers approaches and mechanisms for improving performance, energy consumption, reliability, and security of microprocessors and computer systems that use them. Student attendance at MICRO is vital for maintaining long-term intellectual vibrancy of the conference itself and the microarchitecture research field. Both international and US-based students were supported by travel grants. Attendance of US-based students  is essential for maintaining the economic competitiveness of the United States, development of a globally competitive STEM workforce, and increased partnerships between academia and industry in the United States.Attendance of several foreign students who presented research papers at the Symposium was also supported, to promote international collaboration in this field and help US-based  academia and industry benefit from a broader international perspective and from research results produced outside the US.
