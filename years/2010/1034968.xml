<AbstractNarration>Center for Computational Materials Design (CCMD) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP-1034965 Pennsylvania State University (PSU) &lt;br/&gt;IIP-1034968 Georgia Tech (GT) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to renew the Center for Computational Materials Design (CCMD), an I/UCRC center that was created in 2005. The lead institution is Pennsylvania State University, and the research partner is Georgia Tech. The main research mission of the CCMD is to develop simulation tools and methods to support materials design decisions and novel methods for collaborative, decision-based systems robust design of materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of CCMD is based on the integration of multiscale, interdisciplinary computational expertise at PSU and GT. CCMD provides leadership in articulating the importance of integrated design of materials and products to industry and the broad profession of materials engineering; and is developing new methods and algorithms for concurrent design of components and materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CCMD has operated successfully in Phase I, and has helped develop a partnership amongst academe, industry and national laboratories. Based on feedback received from the various members, CCMD has outlined in the renewal proposal research thrusts and initiatives for Phase II; and has also identified gaps that will be addressed as research opportunities in Phase II. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CCMD will have a large impact on how industry addresses material selection and development. The expanded university/industry interaction of this multi-university center offers all participants a broader view of material design activities in all sectors. CCMD contributes to US competitiveness in computational materials design by educating new generations of students who have valuable perspectives on fundamental modeling and simulation methods, as well as industry-relevant design integration and materials development. CCMD participates in programs at PSU and GT that support K-12 STEM issues, women and underrepresented groups, undergraduate students, and high school teachers. CCMD plans to disseminate research results via papers, conferences and the CCMD website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Center for Computational Materials Design (CCMD), an NSF I/UCRC jointly created in 2005 by Penn State (Lead Institution) and the Georgia Institute of Technology (site), was renewed for Phase II in 2010 (PSU: IIP-1034965 and GT: IIP-1034968).  The CCMD addresses a critical technology area highlighted by a National Academy of Engineering National Materials Advisory Board study group on Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) and the recent White House Materials Genome Initiative (MGI).  ICME is an approach to concurrent design and development of products and the processes and materials which comprise them, while MGI aims to reduce the time and cost for materials development by half.  This is achieved by linking materials process-structure and structure-property models at multiple length and time scales with elements of the design system for specific products and applications. The CCMD continued development of partnerships among industry, academia and government laboratories through:  Educating future generations of scientists and engineers in ICME/MGI pertinent research themes, Improving the intellectual capacity of the workforce through industrial participation, high quality research projects in computational materials science and materials design, Promoting research programs of interest to both industry and academia, Enhancing the infrastructure of computational materials research in the nation, and Exploring and extending physics-based simulations of process-structure and structure-property relations of materials.   Biannual meetings were held in August 2012 at Penn State and February 2013 at Georgia Tech.  The CCMD focused on interfaces between phases in addition to fundamental phase properties in Phase II, with considerable emphasis on microstructure effects (e.g., arrangement of grains, phases, interfaces) on mechanical properties.  Monthly meetings were held via WebEx with graduate student presenations to CCMD member organizations and faculty.  Tools and methods include first principles calculations, CALPHAD, phase field, crystal plasticity, molecular dynamics, cohesive finite element mthods, homogenizatoin, and systems integration and design tools.  Materials systems include Al, Ni, Ti, Mg,and Nb alloys, as well as steels.  The CCMD represents a ground-breaking effort to instill the cultural paradigm shift associated with Integrated Computational Materials Engineering, viewing materials design as an integral part of engineering systems design.  The CCMD is affecting university education in materials that is relevant to consumer needs and sensitive to bringing materials development into greater concurrency with industry design cycle time for new and improved products.  The CCMD Director and Co-Director are visible in ASM, TMS and other professional society meetings in giving talks supporting principles of ICME and MGI to broad industry, government and academic audiences.
