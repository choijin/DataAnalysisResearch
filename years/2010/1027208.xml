<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a new magnetic field model aimed for use during magnetospheric substorms.  The model will be derived from a series of computer experiments based on the equilibrium version of the Rice Convection Model (RCM-E). The project will construct a cross-tail current module for the substorm growth phase and a substorm current-wedge module for the expansion.  The project will also use the comprehensive set of RCM-E simulations as a large database to systematically investigate the adiabatic convection of the plasma during substorm growth phase and the transport of the depleted flux tubes in the expansion phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology to be used is to generate a large number of RCM-E simulations with systematically varied inputs.  This will make it possible to determine how different changes in the boundary conditions and the initial condition affect the magnetic field configuration in the inner magnetosphere.  This approach will also make it possible to establish the cause-and-effect relationships between different physical processes and consequences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new model will be made available to the space physics community where it can be used to specify the magnetic field configuration for a variety of substorm conditions.  The project will benefit several of the Focus Groups that are part of the Geospace Environment Modeling program.  The model is expected to be of utility in understanding and improving space weather forecasts as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project aims at building a new magnetic field model of EarthÃ†s magnetosphere during active times called substorms. We use a 3D numerical code, called "RCM-E", to model the magnetic field configuration. Our approach has an advantage in using much dense "data points" extracted from the 3D modeling than using limited spacecraft measurements. The new model adapts a time-dependent thinning process during a gradual magnetic field stretching period of a substorm (i.e., the substorm growth phase) and a wedge-like electric current module during the rapid magnetic dipolarization period (i.e., substorm expansion phase). We find that the overall quality of modeling can be improved by 30% compared with previous empirical modeling methods.   The project is relevant to several focus groups of the NSF GEM program, including "Near Earth Magnetosphere" and "Substorm Expansion Onset". Our research provides a new tool for visualize the dynamic features of magnetic field reconfiguration and electric current system distributions associated with substorms.   The project has also trained a Post-doctoral research associate, Dr. Jian Yang, now a research scientist at Rice University. The research results are published in two journal papers in Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics, and are also presented in 2011 First Joint THEMIS-TWINS Science Workshop, 2011 RBSP Science Workshop and 2012 GEM Summer Workshop.
