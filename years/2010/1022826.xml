<AbstractNarration>Computer Engineering (32)&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California Santa Barbara is expanding a CCLI Type I project that successfully demonstrated the integration of interactive dialogue technology with computer-based instruction in first-year undergraduate and middle school outreach environments.  Results from the Type I project also showed that the benefits of this technology can be enhanced if students work in on-line environments that provide context-sensitive structuring to support collaboration.  This project is creating intelligent agent-monitored, internet chat-based modules for integrating mathematics and engineering in undergraduate engineering curricula.  The project is also building on prior NSF funded work at Wright State University that demonstrated that learning mathematics in the context of engineering applications leads to increased student achievement in both subjects in subsequent courses.  The project is implementing modules in the intelligent agent-based system covering the mathematics of differentiation, integration, and differential equations in engineering contexts.  An independent evaluator is conducting a rigorous evaluation of the modules and their impact on specific student learning outcomes.  The modules are being made available for free download via the project's website and the study results disseminated through conference and journal publications.   The modules are also being used in an outreach effort to middle school students in an effort to increase their interest in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The underlying premise of this project is that for many universities, offering a dynamic, self-paced learning environment for student use outside the lecture room is the best practical means for integrating mathematics fundamentals into engineering design and analysis education. The foundation of our approach consisted of two strategies: (1) tutorials guiding students through combined engineering and mathematics projects and (2) dynamic, dialogue-based interfaces which engage students in interpreting their work. As dialogue-based tutorials were integrated into a mechanical engineering curriculum at UCSB, we studied how students learned and taught each other in a tutorial-guided dynamic chat environment involving students in groups.  We successfully ran and debugged two lab exercises in this project, one involving beam bending of a microcantilever and the other involving torsion (both key concepts typically taught in strength of materials courses).  Throughout the course of the project, these assignments were tested on different class sizes at UCSB.  Students enrolled in the strength of materials course would sign onto the CMU-based intelligent agent system and proceed as instructed, generally interacting with one or more other UCSB students (unknown to each other) to work through a multiple part materials design oriented problem.  The most important outcome of the activity is how much students learned from pretest to posttest.  There was a trend for small teams to learn more. We also evaluated the impact of team size on activity scores.  Here, there was a significant effect of team size such that large teams scored higher.  It is interesting that the condition that produced the highest activity scores was not the condition that produced the greatest learning.  However, it is frequently the case that supporting performance and supporting learning have different requirements.       Last Modified: 01/22/2016       Submitted by: Glenn E Beltz]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
