<AbstractNarration>Howard University's project entitled: Plant Science as STEM Education at HBCUs - Increasing Minority Engagement with STEM through a Summer Immersion Program in Plant Biotechnology, seeks to apply the study of fast evolving plant biotechnology based theories and lab experiences designed and developed by nationally recognized leading Plant Biologists. The target audiences include pre-Freshman students and middle and high school science teachers.&lt;br/&gt;The students will acquire exposure to cutting-edge plant biotechnology based applications that are rapidly changing the bio-farming practices around the world. In addition, the exposure will help the participating students to develop a positive attitude towards plant science based science careers. The design of the enhanced instruction will help the middle and high school science teachers to increase their content knowledge about theory and applications of plant biotechnology which in turn will potentially be communicated to their students who are yet to develop any concrete career choices.&lt;br/&gt;The project will produce an on-line version of the lab modules that will help upgrade the scope of the activities at other HBCU campuses. The design of the project will solidly prepare the participants to understand how people learn, how to work with real life scientists, and how to develop the formative impressions into a real life career choice.</AbstractNarration>
