<AbstractNarration>The funds from this RAPID proposal are used to replace a broken cooling system for the primary 4Kx4K PixelVision CCD camera on the Yale Southern Observatory (YSO) 51-cm double astrograph located at Cesco Observatory in El Leoncito, Argentina. The Cesco Observatory is operated jointly by the Yale Southern Observatory and the Universidad Nacional de San Juan (UNSJ). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cooling system is essential for operating the primary CCD camera on the astrograph, which is needed to continue currently NSF-funded research through grant AST-0908996, The Milky Way in 3D Velocity Space: A View from the Southern Hemisphere, by Casetti, van Altena, and Girard. That grant was funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Dr. Casetti and her collaborators work on the Yale/San Juan Southern Proper Motion (SPM) survey. The astrometric observations have been ongoing for decades in order to accurately measure small stellar motions across the sky. The absolute proper motions of stars can be used to determine their orbits around the Galactic center. When such data are compared to dynamical simulations, models of Galaxy formation and evolution can be tested. Together with other observations these measurements are also used to learn about the gravitational potential of the Milky Way Galaxy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Measurements of the proper motions, positions and photographic photometry for globular clusters and areas along tidal streams and over-densities in the halo and thick disk are made publicly available on a webpage at Yale University. These huge data bases are a valuable resource to the astronomy community for studies of galactic kinematics and structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The repair of the cooling system will benefit more than one research project as other research group have use for the instrument. This is an international collaboration from researchers in Argentina and the US. Undergraduates at the Universities of San Juan, Cordoba and La Plata in Argentina will be trained as they obtain observations for the project.</AbstractNarration>
