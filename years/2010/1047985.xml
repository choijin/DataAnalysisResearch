<AbstractNarration>This EAGER research develops a viable sampling methodology and survey protocol, including the working partnerships, software, hardware, and key personnel, to implement a representative survey of Alaska Native households in Anchorage. This lays the foundation for several follow-on survey research projects, in particular a social ties research proposal, as well as rural-urban migration research, research on urban participation in subsistence harvest and sharing, and social indicators research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem is that no sample frame of Alaska Natives in Anchorage exists. Furthermore, with only 7.7% of the Anchorage population Alaska Native, a standard random household sample is not a cost effective method to locate them. The research pilot tests two complementary methodologies: a random sample of the census tracts and blocks with the greatest concentrations of Alaska Natives, and a quota sample generated through convenience and snowball sampling techniques. In addition to estimating sampling error, key questions in the pilot data are compared to American Community Survey data to assess potential bias. The pilot survey also develops a new survey technology and protocol using hand-held computers; measures the effects of incentives on survey response rates; generates preliminary estimates of ANCSA regional affiliations and migration status for use in future survey research designs; and pre-tests questions for the social ties research.</AbstractNarration>
