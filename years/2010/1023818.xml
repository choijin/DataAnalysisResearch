<AbstractNarration>This award funds research in two different areas of economic theory.  The first project develops a new method for understanding an important problem in mechanism design:  how to assign an indivisible object to one person when several different people would benefit from owning or using the object.  The research generalizes an existing theorem for implementing random assignments; the new generalized theorem applies to a broad range of circumstances and various practically important constraints.  The research identifies a condition on the constraint structure that is sufficient for implementation, and develop a computable algorithm for implementation.  The research also establishes the condition to be maximally sufficient in two-sided matching. Applications of the theory include improving the ex post fairness of assignment mechanisms, adapting existing mechanisms to be more broadly applicable, and developing new mechanisms.  Finally, the research establishes the welfare, fairness, and incentive properties of these mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second project examines behavior in a generalized second price auction (GSP), which is now the industry standard used to conduct auctions for internet search advertising.  The goal is to understand rich, dynamic interactions among bidders using a lab experiment.  Finally, the researchers compare the GSP method with alternative auction formats based on per-impression bids and analyze a broader class of auction mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random assignment of indivisible goods comprises an important class of real-world problems such as assigning children to public schools, low-income housing, offices, tasks, and queuing for services.  The theory and the computable algorithm developed here enhance the real world applicability of this class of mechanisms.  Understanding the effects of alternative ways to conduct interent search auctions will benefit providers, purchasers, and policymakers who consider the degree of competition in this increasingly important industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  My research project consisted of two parts.  The first part studies the designing of lotteries for randomizing assignments in a variety of matching problems encountered in school choice or housing assignmnents.  The objective is to identify the conditions that allow for implementation of lotteries to satisfy a general class of constraints and to develop random allocation mechanisms that perform well in terms of the efficiency and fairness, particularly in the presence of the constraints arising from considerations such as affirmative actions.  The conditions we have identified apply to school choice context where there are quotas for specific groups of applicants, as is often the case with afffirmative actions, or in course allocation problems where there are scheduling or curricular constraints. Further we apolied our theory to improve ex post fairness of assignment mechanisms, to adapt existing mechanisms to be more broadly applicable, and to develop new mechanisms, and we have established the desirable of these mechanisms in terms of welfare, fairness, and incentives.   The findings have been published in American Economic Review in 2013.   The seocnd part of the project seeks to understand how the generalized second price auctions used for sponsored search auctions operate and perform in the lab experiment, and in particular, whether the lab experimental result confirms the prevailing theory, and addresses the gaps in the theoretical model, having to do with the fact that the models adopted in the prevailing theory abstract away from the rich dynamic feedback that is important in the practice and that the equilibrium concept produces a plethora of predictions.  We find that subjects in our experiment behave in a way that are not significantly different between the control setting in which they interact in one-shot static fashion with complete information (as assumed by the theory) and the treatment setting in which they are allowed to interact and learn from past auction behavior (a salient feature of the sponsored search auction practice).  This result implies the static models adopted by theory do not entail significant loss by abstracting away the dynamic feedbacks that are present in practice.  At the same time, our experimental studies reject the prediction that the bidders would bid in a way that coincide with the Vickrey Clarke Groves outcome, showing that the subjects significantly overbid relative this prediction.  In the last year, we have adopted a new theoretical and estimation framework that can explain this overbidding behavior fairly accurately based on strategic uncertainty facing the bidders.  The paper has been submited to the Games and Econommic Behavior, and the editor has invited resubmission. We went through two rounds of revision.  The final revision has been complete and will be submited back to Games and Economic Behavior           Last Modified: 12/07/2016       Submitted by: Yeon-Koo Che]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
