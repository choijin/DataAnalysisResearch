<AbstractNarration>Grambling State University established the Center for Mathematical Achievement in Science &amp; Technology (CMAST) with funding from an HBCU-UP implementation grant. This Center had a major focus of increasing STEM student performance by reforming mathematics. The present project will expand upon the successes of CMAST by implementing a set of educational strategies and integrated activities to enhance academic performance and increase the success rate of STEM undergraduates. Introductory science and engineering technology courses will be reformed to support student success. A problem based learning approach will be implemented in these courses. Professional development activities will be provided for STEM faculty to assist in the effective transition to an inquiry guided teaching approach. A Living Learning Community will be established for freshmen STEM Majors. The Learning Community will promote the retention of STEM majors from the freshman to sophomore year. The community will be structured to promote teamwork, strong study skills, increase social awareness, and enhance communication skills.  A dual STEM degree/teacher certification program through a partnership with the College of Education will be implemented.&lt;br/&gt;The strategies used in this project should be of great interest to educators who face the challenge of retaining and graduating STEM students. Data collected in this project will advance the knowledge of best practices to address the under-preparedness of many entering students for the rigor of STEM disciplines. This project could be used as a model for STEM departments to address the national shortage of qualified STEM teachers in the secondary school setting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CMAST Project and LS-LAMP co-sponsored a trip on Februay 26, 2011 to  attend the Emerging Researchers Conference held in Washington DC. Ten students and three faculty/s taff members attended the conference.Additionally, the two STEM programs provided travel for 10 students to attend the Spring annual meeting (March 27 - 29, 2011) of the American Chemical Society, Anaheim, CA.    The CMAST Project and INSG Program (which is funded through the S-STEMprogram) collaborated to increase the number of STEM majors.  The INSG program provides scholarships to STEM students.  These recipients are required to participate in the  living and learning community activities,Rising Sophomore Academy, and seminars that are sponsored by the CMASTproject.  There were 21 STEM majors to participate in summer 2011.  The INSG program provides Supplemental Instruction in key gatekeeper courses.  This service is available to all STEM majors.      CMAST and High Ability program formed a partnership for the first timein Summer 2010 and again in summer 2011.  During the summer 2010 activitythere were 44 students; and summer 2011 there were 18 students.  The student participants were high school juniors who exhibit high academic achievement and maintain a minimum GPA of 3.2.  The students were selected to participate based on completed applications and strong letters of recommendation.   The summer partnership includes a four and half week academic experiencein which the student earns six hours of college credit in mathematicsand englishc; and receives a science enrichment in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Engineering Technology, and Computer Science.  The summer 2011 experience included a field trip to the mobile crime scene investigation CSI - exhibit in Witchita, Kansas in July 15-16, 2011.  A major objective of the CMAST-High Ability partnership is to recruit more students to GSU and to increase the number of STEM majors.
