<AbstractNarration>Larsen&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1009653&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator studies the evolution of defects in&lt;br/&gt;materials (e.g., fracture, damage, dislocation plasticity) using&lt;br/&gt;a progression of models from global minimization-based&lt;br/&gt;quasi-statics to full dynamics.  Global minimization models are&lt;br/&gt;now well understood, but very little is understood in the more&lt;br/&gt;physically realistic settings of local minimization-based and&lt;br/&gt;dynamic problems.  Specifically, existence is open for both&lt;br/&gt;cohesive and sharp-interface (Griffith) dynamic fracture, and&lt;br/&gt;effective macro-scale models for local minimization-based&lt;br/&gt;dislocation plasticity are unknown.  The investigator seeks to&lt;br/&gt;make significant progress on these and related problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The propagation of defects in materials is of obvious&lt;br/&gt;fundamental importance, yet in the most physically realistic&lt;br/&gt;settings mathematical foundations and analysis are lacking,&lt;br/&gt;leaving engineering models largely ad hoc.  The investigator&lt;br/&gt;works on developing mathematical support in these areas, leading&lt;br/&gt;to improved models, better understanding of solutions, and&lt;br/&gt;improved (and justified) algorithms for computing simulations.</AbstractNarration>
