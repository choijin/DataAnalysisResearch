<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an integrated carbon nanotube (CNT) cold cathode structure for high power vacuum electronic devices including x-ray sources and microwave tubes.  This project will utilize a proprietary CNT electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technology and advanced micro-fabrication techniques.  It is expected to demonstrate the integrated CNT cathode with one or few pixels and establish the road map for development and production of multi-pixel cathode structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a CNT cold cathode structure with more reliable performance for high-power and high-current applications, significantly reduced cost and improved manufacturing consistency and reliability.  The CNT based field emission x-ray technology has the potential for applications in diagnostic medical imaging, radiation therapies, homeland securities and industrial inspections.  Currently, the wide deployment of CNT cold emission cathode depends critically on the reliable mass production of low-cost integrated CNT cathode structures, which will be addressed by this project.</AbstractNarration>

The extraordinary properties of Xintek CNT cathodes have already demonstrated superior performance in various applications.(Figure 2, Figure 3) Although the technological advantages of Xintek CNT have been clearly demonstrated, the wide deployment and commercial success depend critically on the reliable mass production of low cost integrated CNT cathode structures.  phase I research has been a successful feasibility study for producing reliable and cost effective multipixel CNT cathode array. Components used in the integrated cathode array have been tested individually   and in an assembly. The components and structure successfully tested in the phase I of this project has already enabled a factor of 5 reduction in the manufacturing cost of gated CNT cathode structure.  Positive results from the products development activities further engage Xintek and its subsidiary for product commercialization. Successful development of reliable and cost effective multi-pixel cathode array, the core component, is critical for our product commercialization.
