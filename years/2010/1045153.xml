<AbstractNarration>In the past decade, the analysis of massive, high-dimensional, time-varying data sets has become a critical issue for a large number of scientists and engineers.  Observations across several disciplines, by researchers studying dramatically different problems, suggest the existence of geometrical and topological structures in many data sets, and much current research is devoted to modeling and exploiting these structures to aid in prediction and information extraction. Recent work by the investigators, among others, has shown that integrating statistical methodologies with ideas derived from computational topology and diffusion geometry often leads to strikingly superior results than by conventional means. The investigators now propose to bring these methods into the mathematics/statistics curriculum and departmental structure in a formal way, by establishing a vertically integrated program of undergraduate and graduate research and education. This activity has broad support from programs within the Division of Mathematical Sciences, including Applied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics, Statistics and Topology programs, as well as Division of Mathematical Sciences Workforce Program.&lt;br/&gt;This involves new undergraduate courses in the core theoretical areas, graduate topics courses, an extensive summer research program for undergraduates, as well as year long seminars aimed at both graduate and undergraduate students.  In addition, the investigators will disseminate their ideas via summer workshops aimed at small-college faculty, and methodology workshops directed to faculty from other large research institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need to analyze massive, complex data arises in a wide variety of scientific areas of national importance, including for example satellite image analysis, medical genomics, and internet security.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose a program of training future mathematical scientists to attack these new types of problems. The program will be vertically integrated, fostering extensive collaboration between post-docs, undergraduate and graduate students, and senior faculty, and will comprise a dynamic mixture of theoretical coursework and hands-on research activity. Participants in the program will gain valuable professional experience to distinguish them in the industrial and academic job-market.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the major outcomes was the creation of the Data+ program (http://bigdata.duke.edu/data). This started in Summer 2011 with 10 undegraduates, and has grown, in partnership of Robert Calderbank's Rhodes Information Initiative at Duke (iiD), to a program with over 80 fully-funded -- from industry sponsorships, alumni donations and support from Duke departments/schools --  undergraduate students, for 10-weeks each summer, across many majors at Duke. Students join small project teams, each managed by a Ph.D candidate, learn how to analyze and visualize data, while gaining broad exposure to the modern world of data science. Data+ has won numerous awards, including the Gold Medal for STEM innovation from Reimagine Education, and a Community Partner of the Year award from Durham's Crisis Innovation Team.  Other outcomes include  - the creation of 4 undergraduate courses in topics of data science, which attract a substantial number (the courses are routinely over-subscribed) students across multiple majors and disciplines.   - the creation of the "Data Seminar", which has now morhped into the wide-ranging "Data Dialogue," attended by over 80 people each week;  - the professional training of many undergraduate and graduate students (many of which successfully completed their Ph.D. and have now taken positions in industry and academica), as well as post-doctoral trainees, that included research, publishing in academic journals, and presentations at professional meetings;  - the creation of an REUF workshop "The Mathematics of Data," run in partnership with AIM and ICERM.
