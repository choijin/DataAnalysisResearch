<AbstractNarration>This grant supports partial travel expenses of international speakers in the Symposium Simulation of Hybrid Interfaces and Multi-Component Polymeric Materials, hosted by the Division of Polymeric Materials Science and Engineering (PMSE) and by the Division of Computers in Chemistry (COMP) at the 240th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), August 22-26, 2010, in Boston, MA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the symposium is to provide a forum for U.S. chemical engineers, materials scientists, and chemists with computational and experimental backgrounds to meet their international counterparts in Europe and Asia to exchange knowledge about latest advancements and research ideas in the area of simulation of (bio)organic-inorganic interfaces and polymeric materials. Interactions among the participants and the general audience will provide opportunities for international collaboration.  The symposium consists of 16 invited and nine contributed presentations organized in four half-day sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium particularly aims at better understanding of ionic, ion-dipole, dipole-dipole, hydrogen bonding, electron donor-acceptor, and pi-stacking interactions at the nanometer scale which determine interfacial self-assembly processes in bioengineered materials, energy conversion and storage materials, as well as in polymer nano-composites.  The co-sponsorship of two ACS Divisions, Polymeric Science and Engineering and Computers in Chemistry, will bring experimental and computational/theoretical communities closer together.  The significant fraction of international speakers will transfer more knowledge to the U.S. and support the exchange of ideas on an international scale.</AbstractNarration>
