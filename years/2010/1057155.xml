<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Oxide ceramics with high ionic or mixed ionic-electronic conductivity are currently essential materials for highly-efficient and environmentally-friendly energy technologies, including solid oxide fuel cells and batteries. The project addresses, on a fundamental level, the relationship between atomic defects in oxide ceramics and their mechanical behavior under the combined effects of elevated temperature and mechanical stresses. The results of this project are expected to advance significantly the knowledge on formation and interaction of atomic defects in oxides that is needed today for further development of reliable and durable devices for energy generation, transformation, and storage. This project integrates research, educational and outreach activates that are focused on understanding complex behavior of oxides under extreme conditions, with an emphasis on involving graduate, undergraduate, K-12 students and underrepresented groups in research on novel materials for energy applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Although, significant progress has been achieved in understanding the chemistry, structure and kinetics of point defects in oxides and their effect on transport properties, the behavior of point defects under applied loads and their effects on temperature-dependant mechanical properties remain elusive. The main objective of the project is to quantify experimentally the effects of type, concentration and association of point defects on the mechanical properties in pure and doped binary and ternary oxides ceramics with high ionic or mixed ionic-electronic conductivity. Furthermore, this project contributes to the theory of point defects in ceramics and generates a more comprehensive understanding of the role that these defects have on mechanical behavior by linking experimental results to structure, chemistry and point defects interactions under different conditions. New experimental and computational tools are utilized in this project to better rationalize relationship between structural and thermo-mechanical properties of oxides at elevated temperatures.  The grant further strengthens the educational and research experience of students through their close involvement in hands-on research and development of new courses in areas of materials science and renewable energy.</AbstractNarration>

The results of this project advanced the knowledge on formation and interaction of atomic defects in oxides that is needed today for further development of reliable and durable devices for energy generation, transformation, and storage.  The major outcomes of this projects are summarized as following:     A unique method, namely High Temperature Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (HT-RUS) was developed to study simultaneously changes of elastic moduli (Young?s and shear moduli) and mechanical loss in 25-1000 oC, with or without applied electric filed in controlled environments; Mechanical spectroscopy studies using HTRUS, Dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and cyclic mechanical testing (CMT) showed that all doped ceria and zirconia exhibit drop of elastic properties within different temperature range that is in the same time accompanied by significant increase in mechanical loss. The temperature range for this elastic anomaly and intensity of the mechanical loss was found to vary with the type and concentration of dopant, and attributed to the stress induced reorientation of vacancy-dopant complexes by oxygen vacancy hoping. Activation energy for oxygen vacancy hopping in different vacancy-dopant complexes was determined form mechanical spectroscopy results. This activation energy was fond to increase with increasing difference between ionic radii of dopant and host cations (cerium or zirconium). It was also found that anelastic relaxation due to vacancy hoping in vacancy &ndash;dopant complexes is affected by external electric field, because those defect complexes form no only elastic dipoles but also electric dipoles.      Results of this project are disseminated in 2 book chapter, 6 peer-reviewed journal papers, 2 doctoral tresses, 12 conference presentations and 2 invited lectures.  This project also contributed to the curriculum development at Texas A&amp;M University through development of three new course ("Fundamentals of Ceramics", "Fuel Cell Technologies" and "Materials Processing") and creation of class demonstration material on point defects in ceramics. Two graduate students, four undergraduate students and two international exchange student working on this project were trained in processing solid state ionic, mechanical spectroscopy and structural characterization of materials.
