<AbstractNarration>This is a 5-day workshop on the cytoskeleton to be held in Pingree Park, Colorado State University in the summer of 2010, entitled: The Cellular Cytoskeleton: Common Organizing Principles in Mitosis, Motility and Cell Polarization. The main theme of this meeting will be on using quantitative experiments and theory to gain insight into (i) how the behaviors of complex cytoskeletal structure arises from the individual molecules from which they are composed, and (ii) how these dynamic properties of the cytoskeleton are used by cells during mitosis, motility, and cell polarization. The conference will bring together a group of about 60 researchers and graduate students that have an interest, exposure and/or training in interdisciplinary research but who are not necessarily experts in multiples areas or techniques of cytoskeletal dynamics. The workshop will be organized into morning and evening sessions with invited speakers who are experts in cell biology, biophysics, biochemistry, microscopy, genetics and theoretical modeling. The target is more than 30% of women invited speakers and more than 40% women participants. The organizerss will select and provide support for applicants who are minorities and/or persons with disabilities. This conference will fulfill an important goal of broadening graduate student education by facilitating interactions of graduate students from diverse areas with each other. The organizers plan to publish a report summarizing the novel ideas and collaborations that developed during the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
