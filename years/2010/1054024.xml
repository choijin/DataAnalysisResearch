<AbstractNarration>The increasing complexity and dispersion of ethical issues in research on science, technology and society call for multi-disciplinary involvement in research design and conduct. Yet the epistemological assumptions, skills, and methods for tackling what are termed "ethical" issues vary across fields of scholarship (for example, sociology, philosophy, engineering, computer science, etc.). This workshop takes place on the heels of and extends the discussion of the U.S. Congress' interest to identify the contours of ethics training in science research via the America COMPETES Act of 2007. As a way of focusing the exchange, the workshop brings together science and technology studies scholars with training in philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and other fields whose research approaches ethics in science and technology from the perspective of justice. The objectives of the workshop are: &lt;br/&gt;1) To provide a space and dialogue for multi-disciplinary reflection on the relationships among science, knowledge, ethics, and justice. &lt;br/&gt;2) To document shared and divergent approaches to ethics in science and justice with a focus on the meaning and practice of socially and/or politically engaged research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to create substantive dialogue across fields, the workshop will be oriented around the three themes situated at the intersection of science, ethics, and justice. These themes are environmental justice, medical science justice, and genomic justice. Workshop participants will explain and share their theoretical frameworks and research methodologies for tackling each topic, thereby promoting a better understanding of the similarities and differences in ethics research. Such an exchange will promote the creation of innovative, multi-disciplinary approaches to the study of ethics in science. The workshop will result in the production of an edited volume and a set of panels for presentation at the 2012 annual meeting of the Society for the Social Studies of Science. The workshop will offer a training opportunity by including graduate students as well as junior and senior scholars as participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In San Francisco in April 2011, an interdisciplinary workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation entitled, "Science, Ethics, and Justice: Reconsiderations and New Directions" was convened at San Francisco State University. Scholars presented works-in-progress to a large audience who then with the goal of uderstanding how principles of ethics, including the ethical principle of justice, are included in science and technology innovation and use and with what social implications. The workshop brought together thirty-two scholars from diverse disciplines to examine the relationships among science, justice and ethics, the heterogeneous meanings of these terms, and how scholars working in different substantive areas and theoretical traditions engage and employ these concepts separately or conjointly.   We found generally that both terms, ethics and justice, are used in different ways and often employed for particular purposes. In particular, we found that ethics and justice can be used as research objects and as research goals or outcomes. The result was to encourage definition of use and to push science innovation to consider many levels of ethics and justice in their work.    The findings from the workshop were presented at the Society for teh Social Studies of Science annual 2012 meeting and have been published in a special issue of Science, Technology and Human Values (March 2013).
