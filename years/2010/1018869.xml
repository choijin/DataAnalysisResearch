<AbstractNarration>Adoption of each new generation of nano-scale technology is accompanied by lower yields, stagnant performance or increasing chip-to-chip performance variability, and decreasing robustness to environmental stress. The objective of this research is to identify new avenues for design, analysis, and testing to help compensate for these trends. This research takes a global view of the role of a module in the overall system architecture. This research will focus on two specific issues, namely (1) the impact of a fault in a module on the overall system operation and performance, and (2) the ability to reconfigure one module to compensate for a fault in another module by preventing it from affecting the correct operation of any system or user task. Additional case studies will be conducted to further demonstrate that both these aspects of a global view significantly improve system yield and performance. A systematic approach will be developed to exploit such a global view to dramatically improve yield, performance, and robustness. A completely new framework ? models, information, analysis, and algorithms ? for assembling systems using faulty (and fault-free) components ? will also be developed. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The utilitarian gains to society of this project are likely to be substantial. First, without changing any existing design, the proposed analysis and test approaches will provide significant improvements in yield, performance, and robustness to soft-errors. Second, the proposed analysis, design, test, and global compensation techniques will also help improve yields. Since the types of systems where this research is directly applicable include high-performance processors, the benefits provided will be amplified by the high price such processors fetch and the high volumes in which they are manufactured. Furthermore, since this research is orthogonal to much of the on-going research for improving yield and performance, improvements it provides can be combined with those provided by other approaches. Finally, this project will provide unique educational and training opportunities, for USC students as well as working professionals in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Manufacturers of large chips are concerned with low yields (percentage of fabricated chips that can be sold) due to their direct impact on their revenues. This concern is growing since future technologies are forecasted to be plagued with decreasing yields due to aggressive scaling of device sizes and operating voltage.  In this project we identified several new opportunities for yield enhancement for emerging technologies and emerging system architectures. In contrast with all existing design and test approaches that extensively use divide-and-conquer, our research took a global view of the role of a module in the overall system architecture.

Our theory and conceptual framework are embodied in an extensive, effective, and extendible toolkit for defect-tolerant designs that maximize the total useful computation that we can provide to users for each fabricated wafer.

Several doctoral students worked on this project and were trained via the development of the first systematic architecture-level framework for improving yields of processors fabricated using the highly non-ideal nano-scale processes of the future. We have given seminars at universities and companies, and reached out to K-12 students as well as entering freshmen from various departments and schools.  By developing the foundations for deriving efficient designs to combat high defect rates, the results of our research will be integral to the design of all large chips fabricated in high volume in the near future. In this manner, our research will help provide affordable information processing devices and infrastructure to support a large class of applications of great societal importance.
