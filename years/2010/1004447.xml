<AbstractNarration>The aims of this renewal REU project are to improve the understanding and processing of imaging data and to develop of computer- based solutions to current imaging and vision problems.  Student research projects will include: spectral data processing, perceptual, ubiquitous, and mobile user interfaces, content based media retrieval, multi- approach integration of image processing, and inverse problems using scattering theories. While designed for undergraduate research, the projects are relevant to current problems in the imaging field and thus seek to contribute to its advancement in a real way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
