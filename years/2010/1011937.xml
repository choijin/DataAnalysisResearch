<AbstractNarration>Professors Jeffery L Yarger and Gregory P. Holland of Arizona State University are supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to study the molecular structure and dynamic properties of surface functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) using solid and liquid state NMR techniques.  The focus of the proposed research is on two classes of ligand-capped NPs.  The first is inorganic oxides modified with phosphonic acids and the second is Au and Ag metal NPs modified with phosphines or phosphonic acids.  Solution-state NMR will be used to study the ligand binding chemistry and transport properties when the NPs are solvated and magic angle spinning (MAS) solid state NMR will be utilized for characterization of the capping agent and core structure in the solid form.  The mobility of the NPs in aqueous and organic solutions will be probed with pulsed field gradient (PFG) diffusion measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves the development of solid and liquid state NMR techniques to obtain chemical information on nanoparticles that is not available with currently existing surface analytical techniques. The overarching goal of this research is to understand and control the surface chemistry of nanoparticles.  Such an understanding is key for the successful fabrication of nanodevices for applications ranging from energy storage to catalysis.  Students will be trained in advanced NMR techniques and nanoscience and K-12 teachers will be involved in this research project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the past decade, the synthesis, characterization and use of nanoparticles has become a major research area in the chemical sciences with several American Chemical Society (ACS) journals dedicated to this area along with numerous institutes and research centers at most of the major universities, R&amp;D laboratories, national laboratories and research associations throughout the US.  While many synthetic chemists have created thousands of new nanoparticle materials, the full characterization of the products produced from these reactions are less well developed. We successfully accomplished the major objectives of the grant, which was to synthesize ligand-capped metal and inorganic oxide NPs (NPs) and to develop NMR methods to characterize the capping chemistry and nanoparticle structure.  The outcomes had several important broader impacts which included (i) elucidating the structure of an important class of nanomaterials and providing general characterization techniques for the nano-materials research communities, (ii) training the next generation of materials chemists and NMR spectroscopists, and (iii) develop educational outreach in the area of nano-chemistry to local high school teachers and classrooms.  The primary intellectual merit of the proposed project is focused on uncovering fundamental chemistries both structural and dynamic at the NP-ligand interface using a suite of NMR spectroscopy techniques from both the solids and liquid state NMR sciences.  This has lead to a broader impact in nanoscience by providing generalized NMR techniques and analysis for the characterization of ligand-capped NPs.
