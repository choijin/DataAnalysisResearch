Since it is now commonly speculated that most stars &ndash; including our Sun &ndash; are born in clusters that may contain massive stars, an understanding of how a forming massive star interacts with its environment is a vital part of the complete star formation picture. However, despite the great importance of massive star formation, a great deal is not yet understood. The formation of low-mass stars can be studied at high resolution in nearby Galactic sources. However, Galactic massive star formation studies are plagued by many problems, including large distance uncertainties, confusion along the line-of-sight, and extinction along the Galactic plane. Moreover, Galactic massive star forming targets are very limited in number. On the other hand, a nearby Galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the perfect laboratory for massive star formation studies since it is located at a known distance of 50 kpc (~160,000 light-years) with relatively low extinction and a nearly face-on orientation that provides a clear, close-up view of the entire Galaxy. Using a combination of near and mid-infrared images and spectra from Spitzer, my collaborators at the University of Illinois have developed a large and unique catalog of 277 massive young stellar objects (YSOs) covering the entirety of the LMC (Gruendl &amp; Chu 2009, Seale et al. 2009). Contained within the infrared spectra is information about the evolutionary stage of each massive YSO (Seale et al. 2009). In order to confirm these evolutionary stages, it is necessary to look at the surrounding gas of the YSOs. The youngest YSOs should be inside dense clouds of gas. As the protostars age, they slowly eat themselves out of the cloud; eventually the gas is completely consumed by the star and interstellar medium. In order to look at this surrounding gas, I have used the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to look at ultra-compact HII (UCHII) regions (i.e., hydrogen that is ionized by the UV radiation from the YSO) as well as high-density gas tracers (HCO+ and HCN molecules) for approximately 50 YSOs in our sample. I have compared these to the evolutionary stage expected in our Spitzer catalog in attempt to confirm our thoughts of the current evolution of massive star formation.  Initially we found that sources with silicate absorption (that is, the youngest of the YSOs) had most of the UCHII detections. Since receiving the observations, my collaborators have used models to approximate the masses of each YSO from Spitzer data. Using simple calculations, we found that almost every YSO massive enough to have UCHII detections (given the sensitivity of the ATCA observations) were indeed detected (see Figure 1), thus disallowed any comparisons of age of the YSO and whether it was detected. We had hope to also see a relationship between size of the YSO and the age, but we could not draw any significant conclusions here either (see Figure 2). These results are not incredibly surprising since YSO environments are very diverse; infalling gas differs from YSO to YSO (making it harder for some stars to ionize the hydrogen gas), some observations suffer more from extinction, some YSOs could be multiples, etc. The HCO+/HCN observations, on the other hand, should be more promising because highly embedded, young stars should definitely have gas around them. However, due to poor weather while receiving these observations, we could not come to a statistical conclusion. Ongoing work is still being used with this data in order to attempt to investigate other scientific goals, such as each YSO's density profile and the ionizing radiation leakages that form extended halos around a YSO. Astronomy in essence is a global phenomenon. Since the ideal locations for telescopes are in areas with high elevation, low humidity, and low light pollution, the best tel...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
