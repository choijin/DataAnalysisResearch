<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research and Findings  In 2010, I spent my summer at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), conducting research with my host advisor, Mary Kathryn Thompson.  In this research, we examined design teams in project-based design courses at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the University of California at Berkeley (UCB).  In particular, we explored the studentsÆ confidence levels in design- and engineering-related skills (as defined by ABET), comparing across countries and against different diversity factors such as gender and learning styles.  These include skills beyond traditional areas related to analysis and experimentation, such as creativity and practical ingenuity, communication, and professionalism.  Many believe these skills provide a foundation for engaging in life-long learning and real-world problem-solving.  The results highlight variations in studentsÆ perception of their development in ABET-related skills.  The American students rated themselves higher in creativity, teamwork, ethics, facility with tools of engineering practice, and in recognizing global impact.  The Korean students assessed their skills higher in design, problem solving, and communication skills.  There was no significant difference in leadership or analytical skills.  However, in spite of these national differences, the students followed similar gender patterns.  Overall, the men were more confident in technical and analytical skills, while the women were more confident in communication and teamwork skills.     Longer-term Outcomes  We plan to continue collaborating on this work, both with follow-up studies with the current database as well as new studies with additional semesters of the design classes.  One long term goal is to redo this analyses in a another year, after the Korean students have declared their major, to identify the national versus disciplinary contributions to the confidence levels.  We are presenting initial results at an upcoming conference, and look forward to future presentations and publications.  Our ultimate goals are to understand design teams on an international level, so all can gain the confidence to successfully face future design challenges and reach the best solutions possible.
