<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the effects of geomagnetic storm-time ionospheric and magnetospheric current systems at low and mid-latitudes using the recently coupled thermosphere/ionosphere (CTIPe) and magnetospheric convection (RCM) models.  Specifically, this work will develop an algorithm to calculate simulated magnetic perturbations at the ground based on modeled currents, compare results from the simulation with ground-based magnetometer network data and electric field data from the AMPERE satellite network, and characterize the spatial and temporal evolution of storm-time current systems based on idealized simulations.   Specific science questions address the relationship between neutral thermospheric wind effects, storm phase, and global distribution of magnetic perturbations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Temporal and spatial evolution of the storm time electric currents and fields in the ionosphere and magnetosphere was investigated in this project. An attempt was made to identify the dominant physical process(es) at work.   Intellectual merit:  Sub-Auroral Polarization Streams (SAPS), an enhancement of the magnetospheric/ionospheric electric field in the subauroral region from dusk to midnight local time sector during storms are found to extend equatorward of the ionospheric trough. The suggested mechanism of SAPS requires the low conductivity within the SAPS to enhance the electric field due to current continuity, whereas equatorward of the trough the conductivity is higher. This SAPS extension is explained by the "midlatitude flywheel effect", in which neutral particles accelerate ionized particles to generate electric field even when magnetospheric forcing has retreated because the neutral particles have a bigger inertia.  Furthermore, numerical simulations of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere model show that penetration electric field which has been considered to be purely forced by magnetosphere during geomagnetically active period is modified when the ionosphere and thermosphere had been activated due to previous geomagnetic activity.     Broader impacts:  The development of the capability to calculate three dimensional ionospheric currents and associated geomagnetic perturbations will contribute to the development of the diagnostic capabilities of the community models TIEGCM (http://www.hao.ucar.edu/modeling/tgcm/) and WACCM (http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working_groups/WACCM/).  The development of a new ionosphere plasmasphere electrodynamics (IPE) model will contribute to the development of the coupled WAM-IPE model, which is planed to be transitioned to an operation in the near future at NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (http://cog-esgf.esrl.noaa.gov/projects/couplednems/wam-ipe).
