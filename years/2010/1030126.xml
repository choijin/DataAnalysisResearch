<AbstractNarration>Society's Grand Challenges for Engineering (GCE) is the backdrop of this particular project as it works to develop socially-relevant engineering curricular modules for middle school instruction in STEM.  The project team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison consists of engineering and education faculty, along with 23 middle school teachers and guidance counselors from 5 rural and urban public schools who are collaborating to design and test curricular modules and career exploration activities.  Through summer professional development, the project equips teachers and counselors with the tools they need to delivery relevant content to enhance STEM curriculum and market the field of engineering to a broad student demographic, especially girls. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team utilizes Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) to design the process of instruction, focusing on building self efficacy and outcomes expectations. The research is answering whether students engaged in GCE courses (1) report higher levels of STEM career interest, (2) report higher math and science self efficacy and outcomes expectations, and (3) engage in more exploration of STEM careers and post-secondary STEM education options.  Students who are not exposed to the modules serve as the comparison group on these outcomes variables. The effects of the program are being evaluated by a variety of measures of student and teacher learning and practice, as well as counseling practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will demonstrate a strategy for transforming the attitudes and increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM-related disciplines by embedding the societal context of STEM fields into middle school curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broader impact:  The "Grand Challenges for Engineering" (GCE) research effort at UW-Madison explores a strategy for increasing interest in STEM careers among middle school students from groups historically under-represented in these fields.  Our approach has involved the creation of four instructional modules aligned with middle school math and science curricular standards, making use of case studies to highlight some of the many ways that the work of engineers improves quality of life and addresses societal challenges.   The themes of the pilot instructional modules developed by a team of engineers and educators include: 1) Solar Energy, 2) Improving Aging Infrastructure, 3) Health Care and 4) Water Resources.  Written materials for each module were collected in binders for classroom use.  Each module consists of one or more "units" that follow a fictional story line to provide an entertaining context for the technical content. Unit titles include: Solar Cookers, Photovoltaics for Lighting, Bridge Restoration, Seismic Retrofitting, Biomedical Imaging and Drinking Water Quality.   Materials developed for each unit include student and teacher guides for each activity, as well student sheets for written problem solving.    An instructional pilot of individual units took place during the 2011-12 and 2012-13 academic years.  Units selected by alignment with grade level standards and classroom curriculum were taught by math and science teachers at six Wisconsin middle schools.   The units progress through a fun and lively mix of hands-on and team-based student activities.  Teachers rehearsed each module with coaching by the UW team at two "Summer Institutes" that took place on the UW-Madison campus in 2011 and 2012.  Teachers provided input into module development based on their experiences with the materials during the Summer Institutes and following their classroom implementation.  Their feedback took the form of annotated drafts of module documents, presentations at the 2012 Summer Institute, and at a half-day meeting held at UW-Madison in Spring 2014.  The approach and samples of instructional materials were disseminated through presentations at conferences sponsored by the Wisconsin Society for Science Teachers (WSST, 2012 and 2013), Frontiers in Education (FIE, 2012) and the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA, 2014).  Intellectual merit:  The research component of this project contributes to the knowledge base of Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT).  Gender differences in STEM learning have previously been shown in both a) perceived self-efficacy and b) outcomes expectations, in other words, beliefs about oneÆs capabilities and whether engagement advances oneÆs personal goals.  Self-efficacy beliefs and outcome expectations are known to influence career interests, as one is likely to be drawn to careers for which one feels a minimum level of competence, and which are perceived to help attain valued  personal outcomes.  Changes in self-efficacy and outcomes expectations associated with the GCE curriculum were measured using validated scales (i.e., questionnaires, administered "pre" and "post" GCE curriculum at five partner schools) designed for this purpose, and administered to the participating students as well as a comparison group of students at each school who were not in GCE classrooms.  Data collected suggest that in three of the five participating schools, students who experienced the GCE curriculum reported significantly higher social cognitive beliefs than the comparison group at their school.  Social cognitive beliefs were found to differ significantly across six measures, with four showing more positive beliefs about math post-GCE, and two showing enhanced science-related beliefs.  Differences between schools may be related to when and how the curriculum was implemented, as well as how many units each student experienced.  While these results are encouraging, further investigation is warranted in order t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
