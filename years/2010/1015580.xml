<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For many decades, the most thoroughly studied microorganism in biology has been the bacterium Escherichia coli.  This organism is easy to grow and genetically manipulate in the laboratory and is therefore a very useful model organism.  Despite the relatively large amount known about the model organism E. coli, there is still much to learn.  The functions of nearly half of the 4453 genes in the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome have not been experimentally confirmed, and many do not even have predicted functions.  Many of these unknown genes are thought to code for enzymes, proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. By comparing experimental results to model based predictions, it is possible to identify where knowledge is missing.  Several methods have been developed recently, and I have applied these to discover new genes and reactions in E. coli.  Working at the Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University in Tsuruoka, Japan, I used the metabolomics infrastructure of Dr. Martin RobertÃ†s lab to identify the functions of as yet uncharacterized E. coli genes.  In particular, I have analyzed a set of genes predicted by systems biology methods to encode metabolic enzymes.  A total of eight genes were investigated in detail during this project. The procedure used is conceptually straightforward, and was used to rapidly identify the reaction carried out by an enzyme in vitro (i.e. in a test tube rather than in living E. coli).  The first step in this procedure was to express and purify the uncharacterized protein from the gene of interest. A library of clones of every E. coli open reading frame (ORF), called the ASKA Collection, was used for this purpose.  E. coli strains containing the target genes were grown overnight, and the expression of the genes was induced.  The next day, the proteins were extracted and purified by adhesion to metal beads.  In the second step of the project, in vitro reaction mixtures containing all of the possible metabolites that may be consumed in an enzymatic reaction were prepared.  This was done using a mixture of the predicted substrates and various general cofactors such as NADH, NADPH, ATP, GTP, biotin, coenzyme A, and others.  The purified proteins were then be added to the proper reaction mixtures, allowing the chemical reactions to take place.  Many sets of these reactions were performed throughout the project.  In the third step of the procedure, the concentrations of the different compounds in the mixtures were measured using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS), a method that can measure the concentration of many different charged organic compounds. Control reaction mixtures (without enzyme) were also prepared and measured by LCMS.  These different sets of measurements were analyzed using the MathDAMP software package.  The metabolites that are consumed in the enzymatic reaction should decrease in abundance, while the metabolites that are produced should increase.  In most of the reaction mixtures measured, the samples with enzyme contained similar compound concentrations to the control samples, indicating that the predicted reaction did not occur in vitro.  However, by altering reaction conditions such as temperature, enzyme and metabolite concentrations, and concentrations of various inorganic ions, it was possible to find the proper conditions for enzyme activity.  Reactions that appeared to work were repeated for confirmation.  By the end of the project, new enzymatic reactions were experimentally verified for five E. coli genes.  Several additional experiments are now being planned to further verify these results.  This project has thus increased our knowledge of the metabolic capabilities of E. coli.
