<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will explore the use of a distributed temperature sensing monitoring system (DTS), using fiber-optical (FO) technology, as the basis of a sustainable, sub-ice cavity sensing array. FO cable systems, such as may be deployed through a hot-water drilled hole through an ice shelf, passing through the underlying cavity to the sea floor, are capable of measuring temperatures down fiber at 1 meter intervals, and at time frequencies as high as 15 seconds. DTS FO systems operate via optical time domain reflectometry along the fiber waveguide using inelastic  backscatter of coherent laser light as a probe beam in the FO environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The introduction of new technologies to the harsh environmental conditions of the Antarctic are often associated with high risk. However, the potential rewards of this approach (e.g. multiyear capability, minimal submerged mechanical or electrical components that may fail, relative simplicity of deployment and measurement principle, yet yielding distributed real time and spatial observation) are attractive enough to conduct a pilot project at a field-ready location (McMurdo). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current indications are that the instability of some of the world's largest ice sheets located around the Antarctic and Greenland may be caused by the presence of warming, deep ocean waters, shoaling over continental shelves, and melting the underside of floating ice shelves. Additional knowledge of the temporal and spatial variability of the temperature fields underneath terminal ice shelves, such as those draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, are needed to accurately project future global climate effects on ice-shelf ocean interactions, and in order to inform societal and technological aspects of adaption to changing sea-level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Major goal of the project is development of cost efficient monitoring system to produce real-time high spatial and temporal resolution ocean temperature data.  The specific objectives of this project effort were to:  1. Develop a rapid, light-weight, low logistic burden and environmentally friendly drilling system to produce access borehole through 200 m thick ice shelves.  2. Develop, test and deploy a distributed temperature sensing (DTS) ice shelf and sub-ice shelf monitoring mooring.  3. Develop a surface-based data acquisition/power/data transfer platform.  For the first time , this project demonstrates: low logistic burden field operation that successfully deployed DTS moorings capable of operating continuously in Antarctica conditions. The mooring operated over a 14 month period and demonstrated a new technique to monitor both ocean circulation and ice shelf melting.  The primary key outcome of this work is development of light-weigh drilling technique for access hole drilling; the development of a low cost continuous sub-ice shelf monitoring system capable of detecting sum-millimeter changes in the ice shelf thickness.  Secondary, we have developed a continuous profile of the sub-ice shelf ocean temperatures over a full year monitoring. The calibrated ocean temperature data (at 1 m depth intervals and 4 times per day) will be made available through the National Snow and Ice Data Center for other researchers.  Thirdly, two students were involved in the project: doctoral candidate Alon Stern and NYU (graduated Spring, 2014) and Master's candidate Scott Kobs (graduated Spring 2014) at UNR, and both have received training in the areas of monitoring ice shelf, data analysis and heat transfer modeling.  Fourthly, developed low cost oceanographic (and other) sensors deployment technique can be used by other than polar oceanographers and glaciologists scientists: marine biologists, geophysicists, geologists and others.  The results of the project are presented in 2 published and 2 accepted for publication articles in peer review journals.
