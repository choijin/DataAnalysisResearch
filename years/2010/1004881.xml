<AbstractNarration>This proposal will fund the REU program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison through the summer of 2014 inclusive.  A minimum of nine students will take part in the ten week program each summer. The research topics available are extensive and varied; they include observational programs in stellar, interstellar, and extragalactic projects as well as theoretical work in galactic dynamics, neutrino astrophysics, and the dynamics of the ISM. After the summer program is concluded several of the most promising students will be invited to present their research at the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society. During the program the students take part in a weekly seminar series, organized field trips, and take part in activities meant to directly prepare them for graduate school&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very nature of an REU site results in a broader impact, in terms of educational activities. One somewhat unique aspect of this program is that the students are required to take a course in scientific ethics. The students are also encouraged to take part in public outreach activities at UW-Madison. The PIs of this award note that special consideration will be made to include women and underrepresented groups in the program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Astronomy and the Astrophysics group in the Department of Physics have been hosting a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in Astronomy and Astrophysics every summer since 2002, supporting a total of 152 students to date, more than 25 of whom have gone on earn PhDs. During the period of this award (2010-16), forty-five students from around the country were supported by NSF funding with an additional twenty students supported by other funding sources. The program focuses on advancing scientific discovery and promoting undergraduate training by providing exciting research projects, a supportive research environment, and strong mentor-student relationships that continues beyond the summer.      Student projects have great intellectual merit; they are high quality and cover scientific areas such as astrophysical detectors, observational cosmology, X-ray and neutrino astrophysics, observational stellar, interstellar and extragalactic astronomy, theoretical galactic and interstellar dynamics. Projects use a variety of world-class facilities, including the IceCube neutrino detector at the South Pole, the WIYN 3.5m and South African Large Telescopes, and several national facilities. Most students have the opportunity to present their research at national or intenational meetings; many have also published their findings in the scientific literature. Students also participate in a lecture series in astrophysics, training in preparing scientific presentations, web-page development, Python programming, scientific ethics, graduate school preparation, and have opportunities to participate in public outreach events.        The University of Wisconsin-Madison REU progam in Astronomy and Astrophysics also has had a broader impact on education in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields. It has established a track-record of supporting women and members of underrepresented minority (URM) groups in pursuing careers in astrophysics and other STEM fields. Of the participants in the last six years (the period of this award), 46% are women and 20% are members of underrepresented minorities. Of the Wisconsin REU astrophysics alumni (since 2002) who have obtained PhDs so far, nine were women and seven were from under-represented groups.
