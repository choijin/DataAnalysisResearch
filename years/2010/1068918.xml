<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to understand the cilium, one of biology's most fascinating machines. The cilium performs a diverse range of functions throughout the biological world from nutrient gathering and sensing to organ development and fluid propulsion. The design principles that make them work - from their architecture to the force generating molecular arrays that produce their complex beat shapes- are central to important questions in biology and biomedicine, and also provide a template for myriad biomimetic technologies. The goal of this project is to develop a computational model of how the cilium works as informed by advanced nanomanipulation experiments to assess the cilium mechanics and force generation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete model of the cilium is necessary to provide a deeper view of the underlying mechanisms that make complex biological machines work throughout nature.  An accurate ciliary model will also provide invaluable insights into biomedical questions related to ciliary function in the lung and the brain, as well is in technological contexts such as microfluidics systems where biomimetic cilia arrays could provide unprecedented control over fluid pumping and sensing at the nano and micro scales. That cilia are one of the principle wonders of the biological world drives the researcher's outreach efforts that will include the building of a scale cilium model and an accompanying animation of dynamic ciliary motion to be distributed online. They will also develop interactive software in which a dynamical ciliary model can be explored by tuning the mechanical properties of cilium or fluid viscosity. These activities will be promoted through the investigators extensive collaborations with regional science museums and the North Carolina Science Festival.</AbstractNarration>

Cilia perform a diverse range of functions throughout the biological world including nutrient gathering, sensing, organ development, and fluid propulsion.  A beating cilium is a system with multi-scale mechanical operation from the molecular motion of protein motors (dynein), to the microtubule doublet sliding mechanism, to the full ciliary waveform.  From the perspective of biomimetic technology, cilia are arguably the standard of mechanical actuation at the nano and microscales.  The design principles that make them work are central to important questions in biology and biomedicine, and also provide a template for myriad biomimetic technologies.  A structurally and mechanically accurate computational model is crucial to understanding dynamic ciliary behavior.

In this project we combined powerful experimental imaging and force measurement techniques with expertise in computational modeling with the goal of developing a detailed model of ciliary dynamics.  Our ultimate goal is a 3D finite element model of the axoneme (the load-bearing structure of the cilium) and finite volume model of the surrounding fluid.  Our major Experimental Outcomes:  We as well as other groups have observed that microtubule doublets from ciliary axonemes, when isolated from the axoneme are curved. In the course of this project we collected evidence that this curvature is due to aysmetric attachment of the protein motors dynein.  This new mechanism of curvature regulation has significant implications for models of cytoskeletal and axonemal dynamics The broadest significance of the discovery that asymmetric protein binding causes biological filiment bending is that it represents an underappreciated, and potentially ubiquitous, mode of force generation and mechanotransduction in cell biology.  Our Major Theory/Modeling Outcomes:  Our modeling results show tat the current model of ciliary beating with dynein deforming a passive structure that would be in static equilibrium if unforced is shown to be inaccurate. Our The internal construction of the axoneme shows a prestressed structure, with strong coupling between bending, twisting and shearing. Dynein molecular motors control the release of internal stress. Overall ciliary beating is a transition between unstable modes of the elastic structure.
