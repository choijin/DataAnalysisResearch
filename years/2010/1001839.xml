<AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks funds to support a five day conference representing the 2010 Barrett Memorial Lectures. The Lectures, which are well known and highly regarded, have been organized annually on a variety of topics and with a distinguished list of speakers and participants. The 2010 Barrett Lectures are entitled "Discrete Differential Geometry and Applications". This will be a five-day conference organized by Professor Kenneth Stephenson (Tennessee), and Professor Alexander Bobenko (Technical University, Berlin). The conference continues a sequence which started in Germany and has been instrumental in founding Discrete Differential Geometry) as a coherent topic. Three distinguished researchers, Rick Kenyon, Igor Pak, and Peter Schroeder, will be involved in organizing the five days, each devoted to a different aspect of DDG through hour talks and sessions for shorter talks. One evening there will be a contributed poster session, and one evening a contributed software demonstration session. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is intended to introduce Discrete Differential Geometry and its unique mixture of theory, computation, and application more broadly in the US. Young researchers and graduate students are particularly important parts of the audience, and every effort will be made to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary audience, including women and minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF project provided a portion of participant expenses for the 2010 Barrett Memorial Lectures, sponsored by the Department of Mathematics of the University of Tennessee. The Lectures, entitled  ``Discrete Differential Geometry and Applications'', spanned a period of five days and were organized by the PI, Professor Kenneth Stephenson (Tennessee), and Professor Alexander Bobenko (Technical University, Berlin).   The topic DDG (discrete differential geometry) is a unique mixture of mathematical theory, sophisticated computation, and practical application which is founded on layer upon layer of geometric theory stretching back to the ancient Greeks and beyond.  Along with advances in computers has come the realization that this beautiful but abstract geometric theory must be discretized --- decomposed into discrete pieces amenable to computation --- if it is to be applied in practical situations.   This conference, extending a sequence of meetings started in Germany, brought together specialists in the mathematical, computational, and applied aspects of DDG. The goal was not only to share ideas, but to help establish DDG as a coherent topic, one that would provide a foundation for future efforts as well. In addition to the PI and co-organizer Bobenko, three distinguished  researchers, Rick Kenyon (Brown), Elias Wegert (Freiberg, Germany), and Peter Schr\"oder (Caltech), were involved in organizing the five days of the conference, each devoted to a different aspect of DDG through hour talks and sessions for shorter talks. In addition, there was an evening contributed poster session and another evening with contributed software demonstrations.  A selection of terms from the titles illustrates the coverage of the talks: ``curvature line parametrized surfaces'', ``Riemann-Hilbert problems in circle packing'', ``geometric model for elastic deformation'', ``filament-based smoke simulation'', ``Frenet frames and protein structure'',  ``local remeshing and elastoplastic simulation'', ``computation of Ricci curvature'', ''discrete conformal maps''.
