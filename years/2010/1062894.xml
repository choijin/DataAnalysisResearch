<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Rutgers Institute of Marine &amp; Coastal Sciences and Rutgers University Marine Field Station. The Research Internships in Ocean Science (RIOS) program will support ten students each summer for three years during a ten week summer research internship. Through independent projects and team research experiences, students will focus on process-oriented concepts and techniques applicable in any marine ecosystem. Students can choose to focus on a wide variety of research topics and technologies including remote sensing, ocean observatories, autonomous vehicles, numerical modeling, and molecular biology. The faculty and research facilities at IMCS allow undergraduates to explore these technologies to understand marine ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An initial five-day orientation introduces students to ongoing research, focusing on the Raritan River-Raritan Bay and the Mullica River-Great Bay systems. The two estuaries provide a sharp contrast in their human impacts on coastal ecosystems. The orientation includes two days at the Rutgers University Marine Field Station in Tuckerton, with hands-on experience in the coastal LEO-15 research area, and on the Mullica River. During the first week students also consult with mentors, and learn how to formulate a research question and write a proposal. Other orientation activities include workshops on effective teamwork and an online course on responsible conduct of research. Ethics training will be supplemented by group discussions of case studies. Students make oral progress reports of their research in a mid-program workshop. Discussions of careers in ocean science and when and how to apply to graduate school take place towards the end of the program. All participants receive instruction on how to write up and analyze their data, and how to prepare a poster for the final poster session. Students complete questionnaires and concept maps at the beginning and end of the program. Additionally, educational research methodologies are used to provide insight into how learning takes place during the internships. Support provided by NSF and DOD includes funding for student stipends, student travel to and from the site, student housing and meals and some administrative costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported a Research Experience for Undergraduates site at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.  This program, named Research Internships in Ocean Sciences (RIOS), provided hands-on research experiences for undergraduate students who are interested in marine science.  The program ran for ten weeks during the summers of 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.  In total, 39 students from colleges and universities in 15 states around the country participated.  Students received a stipend, and their travel and room expenses were covered under the grant.               When applying for the program, applicants were provided with descriptions of ongoing research projects by faculty in the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers and asked to identify potential mentors.  Applicants were screened by a selection committee and ranked on the basis of their undergraduate transcripts, personal statements of their career goals and research interests, letters of reference, and match with a suitable mentor.  Mentors can be faculty, postdoctoral researchers, or advanced graduate students.               The goal of the program was to provide students with an in-depth research experience.  All major phases of conducting research were covered, including writing a proposal describing the planned project and the expected outcome, designing the study, collecting data, analyzing and interpreting data, making an oral presentation of the results of the project, and preparing a professional poster.  The capstone of the program was a poster session, similar to those held at professional marine science meetings.  Posters were judged, and the winner was sent to a national science meeting to present their project.  During the course of the program, students also participated in workshops covering various aspects of a career in science, such as responsible conduct of research and how to apply to graduate school.
