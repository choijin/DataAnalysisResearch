<AbstractNarration>This award will support a theoretical investigation of an early phase in the formation of planets, namely how millimeter-sized grains grow into objects that are about 1 kilometer in diameter.  There are three main goals to this effort: (1) calculating the effects of instabilities on dust layers in protoplanetary disks; (2) exploring the formation and evolution of three-dimensional vortices in stratified protoplanetary disks; and (3) modeling the trapping of dust grains in three-dimensional vortices and the formation of planetesimals.  These studies will be done using numerical codes developed by this team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This group will establish a joint research team at both institutions that will involve people at all stages from undergraduate studies through senior researchers.  The researchers will also engage in curriculum development in partnership with the San Francisco Teachers Institute and with the Yale National Initiative.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is a remarkable fact that planets start out as microscopic grains within the protoplanetary disks of gas and dust in orbit around newly formed protostars, somehow growing roughly 40 orders of magnitude in mass in a period no more than a few million years.  There is no one physical process that can explain growth over this enormous range of sizes: the very smallest grains can grow via collisional agglomeration in which the sticking mechanism is electrostatic in nature; whereas, on the other end of the size spectrum, objects in the kilometer to tens of kilometers regime can grow via gravity-enhanced collisions. The least understood stage of growth is how millimeter-size particles grow to kilometer size; grains in this regime are too large for sticking via electrostatic forces, yet far too small to have any significant self-gravity. Even more problematic is the fact that particles in this intermediate size regime are strongly affected by aerodynamic drag of the surrounding gas and will spiral into the star in only a few hundred years. Whatever process is responsible for grain growth through this range of sizes must act on timescales faster than this inspiral time if any raw materials are to be available to build protoplanets.  With support from the NSF, we have shown that there exists a brand new kind of fluid instability in these protoplanetary disks of gas in dust. We nicknamed the instability the "Zombie Vortex Instability" for two reasons: first, the instability occurs in the "dead zones" of protoplanetary disks that are believed to be magnetically inactive; and second, perturbations cause the development of a zombie vortex that "infects" a neighboring region, causing it to go unstable and spawning another generation of zombie vortices.  The process multiplies, potentially filling the protoplanetary disk with zombie vortices.  Zombie vortices may play an important role in how planets form. Vortices are very efficient at capturing and trapping particles at the vortex centers, which greatly increases the density of dust particles. This concentration enhances the rate of particle collisions that are necessary for particles to grow, and may even trigger a gravitational clumping of dust particles which directly collapse into planetesimals, the basic building blocks of planets.
