<AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Chromosomes of all living cells are folded into a highly ordered structure with multilevel organization to fit within a confined space. To support cellular functions, chromosome structure undergoes a variety of changes both on the global and local levels. Understanding global chromatin organization is particularly challenging because it requires explaining how chromosomal proteins control the structure of the much bigger chromosome. This project focuses on the mechanism of proteins called condensins and cohesins, which play a central role in global packing of the chromosomes in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. In this project, the mechanism of DNA organization by several such protein complexes, including the bacterial condensin named MukBEF and the eukaryotic condensins and cohesins, will be explored. The project involves the use of several complementary techniques that assess DNA reconfiguration in vitro, in live cells, and on a single DNA molecule and includes the development of methods suitable for biochemical dissection of the higher order chromatin structure. The completion of this study will uncover the mechanism of chromatin rearrangements by condensins and cohesins and will increase our ability to manipulate chromatin structure.&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT: The broader impact of this project includes the establishment of a nanomanipulations research center specializing in problems at the interface of physics, chemistry and biology as well as integrated interdisciplinary education on graduate and undergraduate levels. The magnetic tweezers, a technology that allows for analysis of DNA configuration at the level of a single molecule, and its focus on biological problems will be synergistic to the existing and emerging nanotechnology research within the Oklahoma NanoNet. The educational component includes the exposure of graduate and undergraduate students to single molecule research on self-organizing systems and the development of new courses in biophysical chemistry both on graduate and undergraduate levels.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Condensins play a unique role in global chromosome organization. The mechanism of this activity became considerably clearer thanks to the support of this project. In particular, this project revealed that the ability to bridge DNAs is conserved among all tested condensins, indicating that this is the primary activity of the proteins central to their function. Furthermore, biochemical dissection of the <em>Escherichia coli</em> condensin MukBEF helped assign distinct functions to its all three subunits. Whereas the core, SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) subunit of the complex is responsible for DNA binding and condensation, the non-SMC subunits recruit the complex to its cellular addresses and regulate DNA reshaping by the core. In eukaryotic cells, such recruitment sometimes involves DNA binding by one of the non-SMC subunits of the complex. This project further helped uncover a novel family of bacterial condensins and revealed that many bacteria, similar to eukaryotic cells, harbor multiple condensins. One example of such bacteria is <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, an opportunistic human pathogen and a remarkably robust environmental strain. PAO1 strain of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> encodes two condensins, SMC and the newly discovered MksBEF. The two proteins play asymmetric functions in global dynamics of the bacterial chromosome. Moreover, both proteins are integrated into the regulatory network of the bacterium and control its developmental switching. This finding provides an unexpected link between global chromosome packing and differentiation in bacteria. Finally, this project helped develop a novel technique for mapping the DNA binding site of a protein. This technique has been validated using the non-SMC subunit of the yeast condensin. The discovered protein-DNA interaction affects the activity of the entire complex and is, therefore, functionally significant. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/31/2016<br>      Modified by: Valentin&nbsp;V&nbsp;Rybenkov</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
