<AbstractNarration>Turbulence in classical fluids is important and challenging both from a  theory perspective and for many practical applications. This research, a collaboration between the University of Florida, Yale University,  and the Universities of Lancaster, Manchester and Birmingham in the United Kingdom, aims to understand how classical turbulence is modified in a superfluid, such as liquid helium, in which flow is severely restricted by quantum conditions associated with the quantization of angular momentum and a complete lack of viscosity. Quantum turbulence has a character that depends on the temperature.  Just below the superfluid transition temperature a superfluid behaves as a mixture of a normal (classical-like) fluid and a superfluid;  either or both fluids can be turbulent,  which gives rise to a rich variety of possible turbulent patterns  At much lower temperatures only the superfluid component remains, exhibiting most clearly the fundamental aspects of quantum turbulence. The study of quantum turbulence would be greatly facilitated if the patterns of turbulent flow could be visualized.  The use of micron-sized particles of hydrogen as tracers has been pioneered elsewhere, but the investigators in this project are implementing the use of much smaller particles in the form of metastable diatomic helium molecules, which will be observed by laser fluorescence.  At temperatures somewhat below the superfluid transition such molecules are expected to follow the normal fluid, while at much lower temperatures they are expected to follow the quantized vortex motion in the superfluid component.  In the earlier stages of the work the investigators will develop this technique for application in the more accessible temperature range where the molecules track the normal fluid, but where many important aspects of quantum turbulence have still to be studied and understood.  The preliminary experiments will pave the way towards applications at lower temperatures. Also, since a very simple form of turbulence can be generated in the wake of a steadily moving grid, the investigators are developing techniques for moving a grid through superfluid helium at a very low temperature where the quantum turbulence involves only the normal fluid.  The resulting turbulence will be studied on a global scale in two ways: observing the rate at which the superfluid heats up as a result of the decay of the turbulence; and using the scattering of ions to measure the rate at which the concentration of turbulent eddies decays. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success of the proposed experiments is dependent on the development of close interactive collaboration between Florida (development of the moving grid and study of energy dissipation behind it), Yale and Manchester (visualization), Birmingham (theory), Lancaster and Manchester (decay of the concentration of turbulent eddies behind a moving grid). Students and postdoctoral associates from all labs will work in the other labs both to promote the overall effort and further to develop each researcher?s capability. While the work is challenging because of the low temperature environment, the possible pay off is high, as an understanding of quantum turbulence may offer insights into classical turbulence which have heretofore escaped common understanding.</AbstractNarration>

Many visualization experiments have been performed to date, the overwhelming majority using large and expensive apparatus, but until relatively recently the same was impossible in quantum systems. This work boldly extends the state of the art in quantum turbulence visualization, by developing an experimental apparatus (Fig. 1) and protocol that does not contaminate the quantum liquid (superfluid He4) by using tracers of diatomic helium molecules that couple unambiguously to the normal fluid component above 1K (one degree above absolute zero) and to the superfluid component below 0.6 K. The visualization technique creates excited helium dimers, barely bigger than the helium atom, in the superfluid with a femtosecond pulse laser and subsequently allows for pump/probe fluorescence experiments on the very same dimers. Fig. 2 shows a small sample of the collected data. We have taken the helium excimers characterized by the McKinsey group (Yale) and shown that they can be created in very thin lines that subsequently deform with the flow of the normal fluid above T=1K. Experiments on counterflowing superfluid helium-4 reveal several interesting qualities of superfluid turbulence:  1)    There is an abrupt laser-power threshold beyond which the superfluid is ionized and will only generate clumps of excimers. Thin lines of excimers can only be created in a narrow band of powers just below the ionization threshold.  Fortunately, at this power level the superfluid is not disturbed.  2)    It appears that turbulence is initiated near the walls of the experimental channel, rather than simultaneously across its width, as previously assumed.  3)    The turbulence in the normal fluid has a much higher intensity (50%) than a classical fluid in similar geometries.  4)    The normal fluid turbulence has a velocity probability distribution that is strongly Gaussian across all probed velocities.  5)    The energy spectrum of the normal fluid has a form E(k) ~ k2, rather than the ubiquitous classical form E(k)~k-5/3 first predicted by Kolmogorov.     These experiments, though they are only scratching the surface of superfluid turbulence visualization, have already added significant value to the field. They have revealed a heretofore totally unpredicted phenomenon (2) above, which has subsequently led to a flurry of additional numerical work in the field.  Further, they show that the characteristics of turbulence in macroscopic quantum fluids are measurably different from the classical turbulence we experience on a daily basis.
