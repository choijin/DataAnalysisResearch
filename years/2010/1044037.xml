<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active engagement materials for upper-division nuclear and particle physics courses are being developed for the purpose of improving student learning. More than 20 years of physics education research has created a variety of well-documented active engagement pedagogies for introductory courses whose effectiveness is supported by empirical evidence, yet few advances have been implemented in upper-division courses. The nuclear and particle physics materials being developed include: (a) conceptual discussion questions for use with peer instruction, (b) warm-up questions for use with "Just-in-Time" teaching, (c) "back of the envelope" estimation questions and small-group case studies that incorporate recent nuclear and particle physics findings and databases, as well as (d) conceptual exam questions. Ongoing formative assessment of student responses is allowing for continual improvements of these materials and methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applying these active engagement approaches to a new course requires a large up-front investment from instructors. Therefore the project team is creating a range of materials so that instructors with a wide variety of styles can pick up and use them with ease. The materials are being classroom tested at a diverse group of institutions, with subsequent refinement before being published for the physics education community as a whole. In addition to several professional presentations for the broader physics education community, the materials being developed in this project are being disseminated through several digital libraries, including ComPADRE, MERLOT, the JiTT Digital Library, NSDL, and the Interactive Learning Toolkit (ILT) at Harvard.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   More than 20 years of physics education research has created a variety of well-documented active engagement pedagogies whose effectiveness is supported by empirical evidence. Despite the prevalence of this course in U.S. physics programs, little or no effort has been made to apply active engagement techniques to this upper-level nuclear and particle physics. In this project we used these methods to create high-quality materials for enhancing student learning in these topics. This work built extensively on existing knowledge about STEM education, and the resulting materials should encourage the widespread adoption of active engagement techniques in particle and nuclear physics as well as in other upper-level physics courses.   The vast majority of physics departments have experience with active engagement in parts of their programs, but the typical physics instructor faces a large amount of up-front investment in developing high quality materials for a new course. There is a wide audience of physics instructors well-positioned to use the materials created in this project, which will help build the STEM education community. The availability of these materials will lead to improved performance in courses on these subjects and, more importantly, better understanding of the concepts that underlie the topic.    Outcomes: We developed items in five categories: a) Conceptual discussion questions for use with Peer Instruction; b) warm-up questions for use with Just in Time Teaching, c) "Back of the Envelope" estimation questions and small-group case studies incorporating the use of nuclear and particle databases, and d) conceptual exam questions.   We created over 170 items among these types, covering a huge range of topics within the realms of nuclear and particle physics.  Each item is organized by topic and includes   The question/activity itself.   Tags based on relevant sub-topics for easy searching.   A "Pre/Post" section which discusses where the item fits into a typical course on the topic being discussed.    A "Notes" section which addresses the correct answer to each question and guides the instructor on how to discuss common misconceptions and other teaching notes.    The entire collection of items is available digitally, both as individual documents or as one large PDF.             Last Modified: 09/24/2015       Submitted by: Jeffrey T Loats]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
