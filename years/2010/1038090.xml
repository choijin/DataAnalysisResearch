<AbstractNarration>Although hydrothermal vent systems have been intensively studied at mid-ocean ridges where ocean crust is being created, few such studies have been carried out in back arc basin spreading systems where crust is being subducted back into the mantle.  This research assesses the chemical evolution of hydrothermal activity and its linkages to associated vent biology in one such back arc basin spreading center in the East Lau Basin.  A unique series of time series fluid samples that were collected in 2009 will be analyzed for a variety of geochemical and isotopic species, including magmatic volatile species.  These data will be combined with temperature measurements to examine the effect of acid volatiles on the evolution of hydrothermal systems overlying silicic magmas and how this influences the mobilization of metals.  It will also be used to examine the role of seawater circulation in the ocean crust and its impact on the removal of CO2 via mineral precipitation.  Broader impacts of the work include the support of an early career scientist, involvement of faculty and undergraduates from a college that serves economically struggling urban centers in southeastern Massachusetts, and engaging undergraduates involved in local summer sea-going programs.  Hands-on learning modules for K-8 students will be created.</AbstractNarration>

Preliminary data indicate substantial changes in fluid composition at at one of these vent sites (Vai Lili) over a 16-year span during which vent fluid temperature decreased from 334&deg;C to 120&deg;C in 2005.  We supplimented these sparse data with ~80 new discrete samples from 2006, 30 discrete samples from 2009, and several thousand samples from 7 continuous fluid samplers that were deployed from 2006 to 2009. These fluid samples were then aanlysed for their dissolved gas content, ion composition, and selected isotopic compositions. Results  suggest that the temporal evolution of hydrothermal systems influenced by degassing of felsic magmas may be relatively rapid and follow a path that is not analogous to typical basalt-hosted mid-ocean-ridge hot-springs.   Our data set allowed us to gauge the time scales over which back-arc hydrothermal systems evolve and the role that magmatic volatiles have in the evolution of hydrothermal systems.
