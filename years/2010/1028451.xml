<AbstractNarration>1029020&lt;br/&gt;Murowchick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to permit micron-scale textural and elemental mapping of solid materials for research and research training in geology, mineralogy, geoarchaeology, paleoclimatology, and environmental science.  Faculty at the University of Missouri Kansas City Department of Geosciences maintain an active role in K-12 outreach through established programs of teacher training and mentoring of urban students in geosciences and the SEM will foster enhanced development of those activities   The instrument will also serve as a regional facility in support of collaborations with scientists from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and geotechnical firms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The original intent of this project was to purchase a compact scanning electron microscope to be used to support teaching and research (undergraduate, graduate, and faculty research) in Geology and Environmental Sciences at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Such an instrument was not readily available on campus, yet was badly needed.  We planned to use the instrument to support teaching and research in other programs at UMKC, including Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, and Pharmaceutical Sciences.  We also planned to use the instrument to support select high school science projects, and to attract new students to science, especially those from under-represented groups in the Kansas City area.   During the time between submission of the proposal (early 2010) and award (March 2012), we found that the cost of scanning electron microscopes had dropped, and we decided to purchase a full-featured SEM with elemental analysis capability instead of a compact instrument.  The instrument was installed in early December, 2012, with training completed December 18-21, 2012.  Since that time, the instrument has proven to be extremely useful, and has been used for a variety of projects as described below.  A new course to train students in the theory and operation of the system is being taught this semester (Spring, 2013).  Despite having been in operation for only a few months, the SEM and elemental analysis system has been used in a variety of projects in geosciences, chemistry, physics, and engineering.  In Geology, we are studying regional black shales, which often contain high concentrations of heavy metal elements.  We are using the SEM to determine which minerals host those elements in the black shale.  That information will help us understand the geochemical behavior of those elements in the environment.   In Chemistry, the microscope is being used to characterize novel materials with potential use in solar panels, light-emitting diodes, and other energy saving applications, and for new types of battery materials.  The SEM gives information on the shape, size, and arrangement of the particles in those materials.   In Engineering, the SEM is being used to explore the effects of using various "waste" materials as admixtures in concrete, as well as to characterize and identify various reactive phases in the concrete.   The range of users goes well beyond faculty and graduate students.  Though in operation for only a month, the new SEM is already being used in undergraduate research in Physics and Geology as well as the research projects listed above.  In the coming few months, it will be used to help local high school students with science projects, and to interest even younger students in science in an effort to assure a steady supply of new scientists for the future.  Overall, the newly-acquired scanning electron microscope is a tremendously useful tool for research, teaching, and recruiting the next generation of scientists, and provides valuable new analytical capabilities for UMKCÆs science and engineering departments, and users beyond UMKC.
