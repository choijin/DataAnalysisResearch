<AbstractNarration>The Semantic Web is based on describing the meaning ? or&lt;br/&gt;semantics ? of data on the Web by means of metadata ? data describing&lt;br/&gt;other data ? in the form of ontologies. The World Wide Web Consortium&lt;br/&gt;(W3C) has made several recommended standards for ontology languages&lt;br/&gt;which differ in expressivity and ease of use. Central to these&lt;br/&gt;languages is that they come with a formal semantics, expressed in&lt;br/&gt;model-theoretic terms, which enables access to implicit knowledge by&lt;br/&gt;automated reasoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress in the adoption of reasoning for ontology languages in&lt;br/&gt;practice is currently being made, but several obstacles remain to be&lt;br/&gt;overcome for wide adoption on the Web. Two of the central technical&lt;br/&gt;issues are scalability of reasoning algorithms, and dealing with&lt;br/&gt;inconsistency of the ontological knowledge bases. These two issues&lt;br/&gt;are being addressed in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scalability issue has its origin in the fact that the expression&lt;br/&gt;of complex knowledge requires sophisticated ontology languages, like&lt;br/&gt;the Web Ontology Language OWL, which are inherently difficult to&lt;br/&gt;reason with ? as witnessed by high computational complexities, usually&lt;br/&gt;ExpTime or beyond. This project builds on recent new developments in &lt;br/&gt;polynomial time languages around OWL in order to remedy this. &lt;br/&gt;In particular, in this project efficient algorithmizations and tools are &lt;br/&gt;developed for the largest currently known polynomial-time ontology language, &lt;br/&gt;called ELP. Reasoning with knowledge bases with expressivity beyond ELP is&lt;br/&gt;enabled through approximating these knowledge bases within ELP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inconsistency issue has its origin in the fact that large knowledge&lt;br/&gt;bases, in particular on the web, are usually not centrally engineered,&lt;br/&gt;but arise out of the merging of different knowledge bases with&lt;br/&gt;different underlying perspectives and rationales. &lt;br/&gt;In this project tools are developed for efficient, i.e., &lt;br/&gt;polynomial-time reasoning with inconsistent ontologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concrete outcome of the project is an open source reasoning&lt;br/&gt;system which is able to reason efficiently with (possibly)&lt;br/&gt;inconsistent knowledge bases around OWL, in at least an approximate&lt;br/&gt;manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page at &lt;br/&gt;http://knoesis.wright.edu/faculty/pascal/projects/tron.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This primary goal of this project was to establish methods for efficient data management using ontologies and semantic web technologies. In particular, it focused on the effective combination of two knowledge representation paradigms - the older one based on rules, the newer one based on description logics - for data management, and in particular through the management of metadata.  One primary outcome relates to mathematical relationships between the rules and the description logics paradigm. This project has demonstrated that these two paradigms, which were previously thought of as very distinct, can in fact be bridged much more easily using formal mathematical approaches, than had previously been anticipated.  Another primary outcome concerns the use of complex algorithms for deductive reasoning over ontologies. We have shown that suitable combinations of the rules and the description logic paradigm - following the formal relationships mentioned abvove - lead to superiour algorithms in terms of both theoretical complexity and practical efficiency.  A third primary outcome concerns the use of software tools for ontology modeling. Our insights into the relationships between rules and description logics have led to software improvements which make it possible to do metadata modeling more efficiently and with fewer errors. This has been validated statistically by means of a user study.  The project resulted in over 80 publications.  The project furthermore had significant participation from underrepresented groups.       Last Modified: 11/20/2017       Submitted by: Pascal Hitzler]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
