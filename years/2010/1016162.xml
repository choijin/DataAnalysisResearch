<AbstractNarration>In response to the high priority placed on such a program by the physics community, including its inclusion in the most recent long range plans produced by the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel and the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE) are actively engaged in developing a program for a deep underground science and engineering laboratory environment (DUSEL) to be located in a former mine situated near Homestake, South Dakota. The primary drivers have been a number of physics experiments that require placing advanced detectors underground in order to protect them from cosmic rays. However, independent opportunities have been identified in other fields (geosciences, engineering, environment, and biology) that would also benefit from the infrastructure needed for the physics experiments.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A committee will be formed to assess the proposed DUSEL program. The study will assess (1) the major physics questions that could be addressed with the experiments being proposed for DUSEL, (2) how the infrastructure being considered for DUSEL would impact research in fields other than physics, (3) the need for DUSEL in the context of similar programs worldwide, and (4) broader impacts of these activities in areas such as education and public outreach.  A published report will be issued at the conclusion of the assessment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This grant provided partial support for the National Research CouncilÃ†s (NRC) study to assess the science proposed for the Deep Underground Science and Education Laboratory (DUSEL) in Lead, South Dakota.  In addition to assessing the science, the study was to assess how such a facility would impact the research communities involved and whether it was needed, given similar science programs in other regions of the world.  In response to this charge, the report concludes that three of the proposed physics experiments&mdash;(1) a direct detection dark matter experiment on a scale of one to tens of  tons, (2) a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment, and (3) a ton-scale, neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment&mdash;are  of paramount and comparable scientific importance. Each of these experiments addresses at least one crucial question upon which the tenets of our understanding of the Universe depend. A direct detection dark matter experiment (1) would seek to learn the nature of the mysterious dark matter that makes up approximately 80 percent of the material Universe, a subject of enormous significance to astrophysics and particle physics. A long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment (2) would significantly advance the study of neutrino properties, particularly if it is coupled with a neutrino beam produced using a new high-intensity proton source at Fermilab. It would also provide increased sensitivity for the possible detection of proton decay and neutrinos from supernovas, phenomena whose observation would be momentous for science. A neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment (3) could determine whether neutrinos are their own antiparticles, the answer to which will help us understand how the Universe has evolved. Each of the three experiments is the central component of an ongoing scientific program and could result in a breakthrough discovery upon which particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics will build.  The report also notes that exceptional opportunities will result from proceeding with plans to build in the United States a world-leading long-baseline neutrino experiment and developing within the United States both one direct dark matter detection experiment on the ton to multi-ton scale and one neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment on the ton scale for installation at a U.S. site or, if such a site is not available, at an appropriate overseas facility.  Pursuing this program would not only allow the United States to address scientific questions of paramount importance but  would also have a  significant positive impact on the stewardship of the particle and nuclear physics research communities and would result in the United States assuming a visible leadership role in the expanding field of underground science.  The report finds, moreover, that a fourth physics experiment, a nuclear astrophysics study to measure low-energy nuclear cross-sections relevant to astrophysical processes, would be scientifically important. These cross sections are quite small, and efforts to measure them need the protected environment provided by underground laboratory space to filter out competing signals. Construction of a small underground accelerator facility would enable these scientifically important measurements.  The proposed DUSEL facility would also provide unique opportunities for fields outside of physics&mdash;geosciences and subsurface engineering&mdash;to explore in situ the physical and mechanical properties of rock at depths and over areas and times not currently available to them. The subsurface environment would also give biology researchers an opportunity to explore life in extreme environments and to learn how biological systems manage to live in the conditions that exist deep underground.   Co-locating the three main underground physics experiments at a single site would allow infrastructure, personnel, and expertise to be shared. Co-location would also contribute to stewardship by fostering...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
