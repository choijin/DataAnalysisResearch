<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This CAREER award supports a research project to characterize a new class of materials, the ULTRA-STRENGTH, which have the capability of withstanding specimen-wide mechanical stresses that approach the theoretical limit, i.e. the maximum achievable stress in crystalline materials. This project is an experimental study to reveal the fundamental deformation mechanisms of ultra-strength nanoscaled materials. Experiments on "hard" materials (metals, ceramics, semiconductors) will attempt to ascertain both the strength- and rate-controlling plasticity mechanisms. The project will employ a suite of quantitative in situ nanomechanical experiments to provide essential links between directly observed structures, defect nucleation and evolution, length scales, and attendant materials response.  Systematically varying the testing temperature and employing transient mechanical tests (e.g. strain-rate changes, stress relaxations) will quantitatively elucidate the energy barriers for plastic deformation. This research is driven by three technical objectives: (a) synthesize quasi-defect free single crystalline and heterostructure nanomaterials, (b) employ quantitative in situ nanomechanical testing in high-resolution electron and focused-ion-beam microscopes utilizing varied temperature and transient experiments to identify and study deformation mechanisms at stresses near the ideal limit, and (c) leverage the insight gained of the influence of flaws and defects on attendant mechanical response to engineer novel nanomaterials with microstructural control allowing for hybrid functionality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This research project is motivated by several technologically relevant questions: (1) How do nanomaterials accommodate deformation when an entire specimen, feature, or device is subjected to stresses at or near the theoretical limit of strength? (2) How can the strength- and rate-controlling deformation mechanisms of these ultra-strength materials be experimentally elucidated via nanoscale synthesis and quantitative in situ mechanical testing? (3) Can the high dynamic range of elastic strain available in ultra-strength materials be used to tune functional properties such as electrical and thermal transport via strain engineering? The proposed activity aims to enrich the educational and research experience of students at UPenn through new training and outreach programs. The project will include the development of an undergraduate curriculum with infusions of nanoscale materials science &amp; engineering. Additionally, a pilot series of Congressional visits to Washington DC will be launched. It is intended for undergraduates and graduates with hybrid engineering and economics training via the Jerome Fisher Management &amp; Technology Program. Experiences and opportunities will also be provided through the proposed integration of international collaborative research with this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Key outcomes for the CAREER project, which bridged two institutions (University of Pennsylvania and University of California Santa Barbara), are summarized below.    We employed a combination of defect-free      metallic nanostructures grown in near equilibrium conditions and unique in situ mechanical testing to      uncover nonlinear mechanical response that is completely reversible.  The unprecedented dynamic range of      elastic strain allowed by these nanostructures enables elucidation of      material behavior far from equilibrium. We overcame two persistent and substantial      challenges to the study of dislocation nucleation: (1) the use of      nanoscaled metallic crystals containing no pre-existing dislocations (not      possible even in the purest of semiconductor-grade bulk crystals) and in a      technologically-relevant geometry, and (2) the use of novel quantitative in situ nanomechanical testing      providing controlled loading, easily interpretable stress states, and most      importantly control of temperature to uncover the thermal nature of      nucleation. We demonstrated results that contrast with the      prevailing theoretical view of dislocation nucleation in that the process      is largely deterministic ? thus,      a singular prediction can be computed given a set of conditions.  Our results suggest a diametrically opposite      view: that surface dislocation nucleation at finite temperature is      strongly probabilistic.  We showed that the statistical      distributions of nucleation strengths are strongly temperature dependent      and collapse in both the athermal (0K) and high temperature limits.  Our results suggest a very different      approach to nanoscale device design that is in stark contrast to conventional      wisdom. We illuminated the mechanistic underpinnings of      dislocation nucleation in these noble metal nanowires to be      rate-controlled by surface self-diffusion, with very low energy barriers      and activation volumes leading to a large degree of thermal uncertainty.  We identified a synthesis strategy to control the      surface dynamics, and ultimately the nucleation behavior, through the use      of ultrathin coatings.  The average      strength of Au nanowires increased as a function of coating thickness,      whereas the deformation mechanism was consistent with that of the uncoated      nanowires. While the thinner coatings caused subtle increases in the      scatter of the strength distribution, the thicker coatings showed a      pronounced narrowing of the distribution. Sufficient coverage of the      coating can kinetically hinder surface mobility as evidenced by increases      in both the activation energy and the activation volume for dislocation      nucleation. We identified that tailoring the interfacial      shear strength force between the core and the coating may be the key      optimization parameter for tailoring the ductility and strength in the      surface dislocation nucleation mediated regime.   Our project provided key insights from the use of bottom-up synthesis of nanostructures as a means of studying plastic deformation of defect-scarce metals, where nucleation of dislocations is a requirement in otherwise perfect crystals. The striking implication from our collective efforts is two-fold. First, in this deformation mechanism regime where thermal fluctuations assist in the nucleation process, deterministic mechanical response gives way to probabilistic yielding with a strong temperature dependence and activation energies suggestive of surface self-diffusion as the rate-limiting step needed to promote displacive activity.  Second, through mechanical deformation experiments using various in situ electron and X-ray probes on high quality single crystalline Au nanowires, we identified a new means of controlling mechanical response ? by control of the free surface via ultrathin coatings to mediate dislocation nucleation and the ensuing plasticity.  An additional outcome from this project was the development of several novel in situ probes for interrogating the mechanical response of nanostructures, which have the potential for being adapted in a wide range of scientific settings.  We believe our findings could permeate to a host of scientific fields and have implications for various technological sectors.  Arguably the most important class of crystalline defects, dislocations explain not only crystal plasticity and the transition to irreversible deformation, but also clarify rapid crystal growth and diffusion-less phase transformations.  In functional settings, dislocations, for instance, degrade optoelectronic response in light emitting and light-harvesting applications, limit electron mobility enhancements in strained field effect transistors, and augment phase change behavior in next-generation electronic memory.
