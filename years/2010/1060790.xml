<AbstractNarration>This award funds research that develops a new modeling framework for incorporating the discovery of new ideas (by firms, consumers, and other economic decision makers) into a class of models that are widely used in modern economics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These models assume that individual actors use Bayesian inference to adjust their expectations over time.  In this model of learning, over time the agents observe the world, compare that to their list of possible explanations, and eliminate possibilities that do not explain what they see while also adjusting their beliefs about the remaining possibilities.  There is no idea here of discovering entirely new possibilities that were completely unknown at the start.  The PI will generalize the Bayesian method to allow for this kind of discovery in a logically consistant way.  He will determine the class of dynamic models that can be analyzed in the proposed new framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has transformative potential for macroeconomic theory, because the results may yield a useful new method for thinking about how new scientific and technological discoveries affect macroeconomic behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the potential to improve our ability to consider the role of scientific discovery on economic outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work has generated several models of learning. The most closely related to the theme of the proposal was the paper published in the 2013 JPE and coauthored with Szentes. The paper deals with venture-capital outcomes most of which are failures. Like scientific discovery, VC activity deals very much with the unforeseen in a sense that gambling at the casino does not.  The high-tech projects that much of venture deals with are not the type that merely implements a given blueprint such as would, say, the construction of a bridge or the paving of a highway. With high-tech projects one cannot enumerate the possible outcomes, simply because one is not aware of what they can generate.  Because of this, the outcome is highly uncertain and as the investment proceeds (always in stages) VC terminates most of the projects in his portfolio because it becomes clear that the probability that the project will pay off is too low. One could not anticipate, before investment begins, what the result would be and what the precise nature of the innovations will be -- it is unforeseen. What does matter, however, is that the investor -- in this case the VC -- can have an idea about the monetary payoff that the discovery will generate. This is enough to provide him with the right incentives.  The paper shows that even though the VC and the firm's founder cannot forecast the outcome, having the correct distribution of the monetary payoffs is enough to produce a socially efficient level of investment in venture capital.
