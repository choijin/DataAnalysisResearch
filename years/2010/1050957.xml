<AbstractNarration>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the high number of species present in tropical forests. The outcome of these processes, which could include random or non-random elements, may be reflected in the evolutionary history and distribution of functional traits (plant size, leaf size, flowering pattern, etc.) in a community. Because they reflect "community assembly in action", successional tropical forests (developing after a disturbance) provide an ideal natural laboratory for testing the power of an integrated multi-faceted approach to community assembly. Using data collected in secondary and mature forests in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, the proposed research will develop a novel approach to understanding community assembly that will integrate detailed forest inventory data. This approach will be used to assess the relative importance of habitat differences, niche differences, and lack of seedlings in driving tropical forest community assembly at different spatial scales and across life history stages. Coordinated data collection will allow for comparisons of functional traits across successional stages within a context of the plants' evolutionary history, which will be reconstructed using DNA bar-coding technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major objectives of this research are to (1) compare patterns of species-level phylogenetic (evolutionary) relationships and functional similarity of plants between successional and mature forest communities; (2) link functional traits and phylogenetic structure with population and community dynamics through sophisticated models of tree mortality and growth, and (3) assess the role of recruitment limitation and the relative importance of functional and phylogenetic relatedness in predicting species- and stage-specific population dynamics during succession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secondary forests now cover more area than remaining old-growth forests in many tropical countries and are increasingly important components of tropical landscapes for biodiversity conservation and provision of ecosystem services. A mechanistic understanding of how these forest communities are assembled is urgently needed. The evolutionary relationships among plants that will be discovered as part of this project will contribute to a deepening understanding of the angiosperm evolutionary history. Two doctoral graduate students, one postdoctoral researcher, and undergraduate students from the University of Puerto Rico, the largest Hispanic institution in the US federal system, will be trained.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The worldÃ†s tropical forests are undergoing unprecedented change, with profound consequences for the future of biodiversity and the quality of life on our planet. Natural disturbances and large-scale conversion of forest to alternative land uses by humans are sufficiently frequent and widespread that forest areas throughout the world are in a state of continual flux. These successional forests now cover more area than remaining old-growth forests in many tropical countries, and are increasingly important components of tropical landscapes for biodiversity conservation and provision of ecosystem services. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of tropical forest community assembly and dynamics is urgently needed. Successional forest dynamics may be determined by the functional characteristics and evolutionary history of the species in the regional pool and by spatial dynamics within forest stands.     In this research we: (1) compared patterns of species-level phylogenetic relationships and functional similarity between successional and mature forest communities; (2) linked functional traits and phylogenetic structure with population and community dynamics through spatially-explicit hierarchical Bayes neighborhood models of tree mortality and growth.  The key intellectual outcome of this research is the finding that three functional traits: wood density, leaf thickness and leaf water content drive tree demography. These effects on demography result in differences in key functional traits and important ecosystem functions (e.g., aboveground carbon sequestration) across forests of different ages.        Other important outcomes of this research:     Establishment of four 1-ha research permanent plots in Puerto Rico and 25 seedling plots in each 1-ha plot;      Three years of census (growth and mortality for trees and seedlings) in these plots;      A DNA barcode phylogeny for all Puerto Rican tree species developed as part of this project will contribute to a deepening understanding of the angiosperm phylogeny and will provide information for conservation planning;      Functional trait databases for more than 400 Puerto Rican species were developed.      Two doctoral graduate students, one postdoctoral researcher, and over 25 undergraduate students from several universities, including the University of Puerto Rico, the largest Hispanic institution in the US federal system, were trained in forest ecology.  Two technicians acquired training in management skills.                    Last Modified: 05/01/2014       Submitted by: Maria Uriarte]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
