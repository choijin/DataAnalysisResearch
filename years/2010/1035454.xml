<AbstractNarration>The Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) Noyce Scholars Program increases the number of qualified STEM teachers in rural northeastern North Carolina with a special emphasis on the recruitment and retention of minorities and other underrepresented populations. The ECSU Teacher Education Program is accredited by NCATE and has met or exceeded state expectations since 1999. Noyce Scholarships increase the number of graduates of the program by four, producing 16 scholars over the five year project period. The four partnership school districts are Elizabeth City Pasquotank, Edenton-Chowan, Perquimans and Northampton, all of which are low performing and located in rural Northeast North Carolina. Students with majors in computer science, aviation, and engineering technology are also targeted as potential mathematics education scholars. Due to ECSUs proximity to numerous military bases, retirees and other military personnel will be recruited through the Troops to Teachers Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) Noyce Scholars Program was designed to increase the number of highly qualified STEM teachers in rural northeastern North Carolina with a special emphasis on the recruitment and retention of minorities and other underrepresented populations.  ECSU employed a multipronged approach for recruiting Noyce Scholars that included Teacher Recruitment Fairs, presentations in entry level mathematics and science classes, individual meetings with STEM advisors, visits to local community colleges, presentations by renowned science and mathematics education scholars, and distribution of brochures and flyers.  One-on-one meetings between Noyce personnel and advisors were by far the most successful recruiting strategy with 70% of all scholars? first hearing about the program through their academic advisor.  At ECSU faculty serve as students? academic advisor which creates a unique advisor/advisee relationship that is built on trust and respect.  The intimate nature of the interaction between students and their advisors make it clear why advisors served as the ECSU Noyce programs? most effective form of recruiting.        Two key programs contributed to the training of Noyce Scholars; the Noyce Summer Program and the yearlong Preparation of Highly-qualified Advanced STEM Educators (PHASE) Program.  Although the Noyce Summer Program was initially designed to recruit freshman and sophomore STEM majors who had not considered teaching into the Noyce Scholars program, during the third year the program expanded to include current and past Noyce Scholars.  Noyce scholars who participated in the summer program designed the curriculum, developed inquiry based activities, and served as the primary instructor for all courses.  Participation in the summer program increased the confidence of scholars which resulted in a smooth transition to the classroom.  The PHASE Program was an academic year program designed to provide participants with additional training and mentoring opportunities.  PHASE activities included sessions on the use of technology and other representational tools in the classroom, developing and teaching hands-on and inquiry based lessons, and research in STEM education.  PHASE participants were able to apply the techniques they learned during the academic year when they taught a variety of inquiry based lessons for middle school and high school students during ECSU?s Research Week and ECSU?s Celebration of Women in Mathematics Annual Conference.  Both the Noyce Summer Program and PHASE Program were optional components of the Noyce Scholars Program.  While program requirements did not permit Noyce personnel to make the summer program and PHASE Program mandatory, Noyce scholars who participated in these two activities received additional training and experiences that enhanced their overall training.  The impact both programs had on scholars suggests the need for similar programs to be integrated into teacher preparation programs.  While early field experiences in teacher preparation programs are essential, the success of the Noyce Summer program and PHASE program is evidence that allowing students to teach students in a low pressure environment outside of the traditional classroom goes a long way in building the confidence of prospective teachers.           Ninety-one percent of the Noyce Scholar graduates are currently employed in a high needs school district.  Out of the students that are employed, 40% are working in a partnership school district in Northeast North Carolina, 20% are working in a school located inside ECSU?s 21 county service area, and 40% are working in North Carolina outside of ECSU?s 21 county service area.  In addition, although two Noyce scholars have completed their teaching commitment both not only remained in the teaching profession but are continue to teach in high-needs schools.  Lastly, 82% of Noyce Program scholars surveyed indicated that they are highly likely to remain in the teaching profession which speaks to the overall effectiveness of the ECSU Noyce Scholars program.
