<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division supports Professor Michael J. Krische of the University of Texas- Austin in the US.  The international collaborator, Professor Bernhard Breit of Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t in Germany is supported by the German funding agency, DFG, in a collaboration  that will design new routes to commodity and fine chemicals. The proposal for which this award was granted was submitted in response to Program Announcement NSF 09-608: International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) between US investigators and their Counterparts Abroad. The researchers propose to develop catalytic processes that enable byproduct-free manufacture of chemical products from abundant, renewable resources. The Breit Group will design and prepare a series of novel phosphine ligands that incorporate supramolecular recognition elements specifically tailored for the activation of carbonyl groups, including carbon dioxide. These "first-generation metal complexes" will be assayed in C-C bond forming hydrogenations developed by the Krische Group in order to establish key structure-reactivity and structure-selectivity trends that will allow Krische and Breit to design improved second-generation catalysts that will be prepared by the Breit Group and assayed by the Krische Group. The collaboration between the Krische and Breit groups is an ideal combination of scientific expertise that will enhance both groups through direct exposure to research techniques, approaches, philosophies, and networks across the Atlantic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research intends to achieve the high catalyst activities and selectivities necessary to activate new substrates efficiently on a large scale, which will enhance fine chemical applications, including the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. The largest impact of this proposal will be in education through research. The requested funds are for undergraduate and graduate students, who will benefit from the unique opportunity to acquire skills across the disciplines of synthetic organic chemistry, physical organic chemistry, and transition metal inorganic chemistry. Students from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences will also be recruited to participate. The Krische Group participates in programs such as the "Pfizer Research Fellowship for Under-Represented Minorities" and the NIH sponsored "Bridges to the Future" program, which facilitates the transition of minority students from BS/MS to Ph.D. degree granting institutions. Additionally, Professor Krische has mentored several students using NIH-sponsored "Research Supplements to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research."</AbstractNarration>
