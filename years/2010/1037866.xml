<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2010 AAAI Robotics Workshop and Exhibition addressed the need for  integration between the artificial intelligence research that focuses  on controlled simulations and robotics research that focuses on  adapting to real world situations.   The full day workshop, "Enabling  Intelligence through Middleware", discussed the role of software in  allowing investments to be reused across the research community.   The  outcome of this workshop was an article that compared and contrasted  software strategies and highlighted future goals in robotics software.   The exhibition, held over three days, contained both challenges and  exhibits.    The challenges are important because they allow  researchers to benchmark different approaches to several important  problems in identical conditions.  The small-scale mobile manipulation  challenge consisted of intelligent chess-playing robots that  identified the opponentÃ†s move, determined the next best move and used  a robot hand to move the correct piece to the new position.  Although  chess may appear to be a "toy" problem, it was selected because the  component skills (manipulation while moving and visual identification)  are key to successfully using robots in safety and security  applications (i.e. searching car trunks and glove compartments).   The  learning by demonstration challenge focused on the techniques needed  to successfully teach robots to perform tasks that would be too  dangerous for humans to undertake.   The third challenge focused  educating new computer scientists and roboticists by providing simpler  problems less advanced students.  Having students solve simpler  problems works well because not only do students get the experience of  using their robot algorithms outside of the lab, but students also  participate in the workshop and exhibition, giving them important  access to advanced techniques and researchers.  The exhibition  showcased the robots and researchers involved in the challenges.   The  exhibition consisted of research groups from 20 schools.  The  exhibition was open to both conference attendees and the public.  One  of the highlights of the exhibition was having high students play  games of chess against the intelligent robots.     The NSF funds were used to provide partial travel support to students  and researchers involved in the workshop, challenges and exhibitions.
