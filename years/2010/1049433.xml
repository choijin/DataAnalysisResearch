<AbstractNarration>When continents collide, as Asia and India are doing today, continental crust can be taken to depths of 100-150 km.  The presence of the minerals diamond and coesite in some crustal rocks is evidence that deep, ultrahigh-pressure rocks have been buried deep and then exhumed back to Earth's surface.  The time frame in which this exhumation occurs is important for understanding how fast tectonic processes associated with continental collision can take place.  A major problem in determining timing is that the minerals used to calculate pressure and temperature (i.e. thermobarometers) at specific depths in the Earth are not the same minerals as the ones used to obtain the ages of the rocks (i.e. geochronometers).  The hypothesis to be tested is that the budget of rare earth elements (REEs) in both sets of minerals can be used to find links between the age of the rocks and when the minerals grew at certain depths in order to track the path of these rocks back to the surface in the exhumation process.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exhumation of continental ultrahigh-pressure terranes in collisional orogens is an important process that impacts our understanding of plate tectonics through time, recycling of crustal material into the mantle, subduction zone magmatism and collisional processes in general.  Understanding the relationship between geochronometers and metamorphic evolution is currently a very active field of research, which is enabled by recent advances in microanalytical techniques that allow in situ chemical analysis.  This project will focus on an excellent example from North-East Greenland where the period of exhumation is long enough - approximately 55 million years - to resolve exchanges in REE along the pressure-temperature path.  The results will be easily transported to other metamorphic systems and environments, ultimately influencing petrologic, tectonic and geodynamic models for orogenesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  Ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) terranes are rare pieces of crust that have been subducted to mantle depths and exhumed back to EarthÃ†s surface.  They are recognized by the index minerals coesite (a high-pressure polymorph of SiO2) and/or diamond, usually as inclusions in strong phases.  The goal of this project was to use a suite of existing samples from the North-East Greenland UHP terrane, collected on a previous NSF grant, to test whether rare earth element (REE) chemistry can be used to tie radiogenic minerals that give ages (e.g. zircon and titanite) to the metamorphic evolution gleaned from minerals that give pressure&ndash;temperature (P&ndash;T) information, such as garnet.  In essence, we are looking for chemical tests to link time to the P&ndash;T path.  Key outcomes of our research include:  Trace elements track five different stages of zircon growth in the North-East Greenland UHP terrane.  However, one needs to piece the stages together from a wide range of rock types, because not every stage is present in zircon from every rock.  Zircon captures melting events on the exhumation path.  The trace element chemistry in zircon can lag behind the P&ndash;T conditions and fail to record exhumation particularly if garnet is not consumed.  This means that the REE are not a stand-alone link to pressure and temperature. Mineral inclusions in zircon, particularly coesite, are the best way to connect zircon growth to the P&ndash;T path and should be used in conjunction with the REE chemistry. A P&ndash;T path for exhumation of melted metasedimentary rocks shows that melting did not trigger exhumation, but started just below the coesite stablitily field, after the rocks had decompressed.  These rocks exhibit melting of the hydrous HP mica, phengite, to produce melts of granitic composition.  In contrast, the eclogites are calcic and contain melt inclusions and textures that indicate melting of a calcic hydrous phase, probably zoisite.      Three generations of titanite can be recognized on the basis of U-Pb ages and trace elements, and can be identified in atomic number contrast images.  Titanite may also provide enough variation in REE to be a useful indicator of the stage of metamorphic evolution.   Products from the current research include 7 published conference abstracts and 6 peer-reviewed journal articles thus far.     Broader impacts:  Gilotti and co-workers have explained their research on UHP rocks to general audiences via a number of venues.  Gilotti served as the Guest Editor of the August 2013 issue of Elements entitled "Continental Crust at Mantle Depths;" Gilotti, McClelland and Massonne contributed papers to the volume.  Elements is directed at the general community of mineralogists, petrologists and geochemists; it reaches over 15,000 scientists from 17 different international societies.  Gilotti was invited to share her experience of attending the 10th International Eclogite Conference in the western Italian Alps with the general community as a Meeting Report in Elements.  She has used her general knowledge of polar regions&mdash;gained in part from NSF funding of her Greenland research&mdash;to review two popular books for the journal Arctic.  Gilotti has spoken about her work to the Cedar Valley Rock and Mineral Society in Cedar Rapids, IA and annually showcases her research for the University of Iowa Women in Science and Engineering chapter.  Samples are routinely shared with colleagues, such as Helen Lang (West Virginia University), Simona Ferrando (Turin, Italy) and Sorena Sorensen (Smithsonian).              The project had a positive impact on the education of students. UHP metamorphism was the topic of a graduate student seminar (EES6670) at Iowa in Fall 2012.  Eight students discussed current topics and learned how to review a scientific article by critiquing two of the papers submitted to the Elements issue.
