<AbstractNarration>The use of airborne longwave-infrared hyperspectral imagery (allowing high cloud/nighttime observations) to assess methane emissions from Gulf of Mexico platforms and areas of ocean surface contaminated by spilled oil to varying extents will be used in this RAPID project.  SEBASS (Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System) will be flown on a Twin Otter over the oil leak site at various altitudes and over the course of one week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Twin Otter aircraft will also carry equipment to enable in situ whole air sampling at a range of altitudes and downwind distances from the Deepwater Horizon site.  In addition, the Twin Otter flights will be coordinated with NASA's ER-2 that will be flying the AVIRIS (Airborne Visual Infrared Imaging Spectrometer).  The ER-2 flights are covered under a separate RAPID.  ER-2 and Twin Otter flight paths and flight times will overlap to look at data consistency and different spatial scales and resolutions.  This is part of a three-pronged approach that the Atmospheric Chemistry Program is coordinating in response to the Gulf Oil Leak to estimate trace gas emissions.</AbstractNarration>
