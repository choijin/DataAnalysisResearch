<AbstractNarration>Abstract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposers intend to continue their study of meromorphic functions using the methods of geometric theory of functions and topology, the approach which already brought significant results in their previous research. All problems in this proposal arise naturally from the results of the previous research of the proposers funded by NSF. The proposers intend to concentrate on the following specific problems: geometry and topology of real and complex spectral loci of the one-dimensional Schrödinger operators with polynomial and rational potentials; singularities of implicit analytic functions defined by entire relations; general properties of certain classes of meromorphic functions occurring in holomorphic dynamics and in spectral theory of the Schrödinger operators; polynomial approximation of discontinuous functions on systems of intervals. Proposed research will expand our understanding of solutions of transcendental equations emerging in analysis and mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meromorphic functions constitute the most basic class of functions used in mathematics and most of its applications. In addition to elementary functions like the exponent, cosine and tangent, this class includes higher transcendental functions, indispensable in physics and engineering. Previous work of the authors on this subject already found important applications in control theory, material science, computer science, signal processing, mathematical physics and astrophysics. This proposal contains several problems of the function theory motivated by quantum mechanics, and the proposers expect their results to yield deeper understanding of this fundamental physical theory. The PI and coPI will also work with graduate students on  research related to the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The broad subject of this research project is the theory of  analytic functions, which is a part of pure mathematics. This means that the choice of problems to investigate is motivated by the inner logic of of development of mathematics, rather than immediate applications. However the experience shows that the results of such fundamental research are indispensable for the progress of science and technology.  Analytic functions is a class of mathematical functions which is most important in science and engineering. It includes most elementary functions as well as most of the special functions of mathematical physics.  1. Principal mathematical results of this project resulted in 15 publications in specialized mathematical journals, authored by the PI, his graduate students, postdocs and other collaborators. The most important results are the following:  a) Establishing certain qualitative properties of energy levels of anharmonic oscillators. These problems are motivated by foundations of quantum mechanics, which is the most fundamental theory about the real world that modern science possesses. Energy levels of anharmonic oscillators have been intensively studied for about a century since the introduction of quantum mechanics, and a new method of their investigation has been developed within this project.  b) Discovery of non-algebraic quadrature domains. This solves a long standing question. In two dimensions, all quadrature domains are algebraic (in the sense that their boundaries are algebraic curves). It was found that in dimension four, there are quadrature domains which are bounded by smooth non-algebraic surface. Similar question in other dimensions remains open.  c) Solution of certain optimization problems for analytic functions motivated by control theory. The question of control theory involved here is whether it is possible to control several different systems by a single controller. The result obtained in this project shows that under some circumstances such a single controller does not exist.  2. Impact on education. The Principal investigator advised 2 PhD students and two post-doctoral fellows. Both students completed their PhD theses, one in 2012, another in 2014. Two of the publications resulting from this project are joint with a graduate student, and two others with one of the postdocs.  3. Outreach activities. The PI maintains web pages at www.math.purdue.edu/~eremenko which contains various resources on mathematics and science, oriented on a wide audience from school children, undergraduate students and amateurs of mathematics to advanced researchers. One of these pages was a base of a radio broadcast in the series "Engines of our ingenuity", episode 2703. It has been also translated into French, Polish, Romanian and other languages which gives some evidence of its popularity. The PI is also active in the Math Overflow, which is a web site where researchers in mathematics communicate and exchange research problems. The very large audience of this site contains mathematicians of all levels, from students to most famous researchers in the field.
