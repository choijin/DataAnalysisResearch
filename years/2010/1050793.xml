<AbstractNarration>Bats constitute nearly 25% of the diversity of all mammals. They have a global distribution, and are key players in diverse ecosystems. Like any other mammal, they are exposed to, and suffer from a range of parasites. Among these parasites are a group of bloodsucking insects - the bat fleas. Contrary to many other fleas, they are uniquely adapted to bats. Currently, even basic knowledge about these parasites is scarce. This grant sets out to remedy this problem by pursuing the following important goals: 1) for the first time comprehensive information about the development, diversity, global distribution, host association, and ecology of these fleas will be gathered, 2) the evolutionary history of bat fleas and the timing of their diversification will be explored, in the context of parallel evolution with their hosts, and 3) the previously unknown microbial diversity of bat fleas will be studied and linked across different parasite developmental stages and ecosystems, characterizing beneficial as well as potentially pathogenic bacteria. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of these interdisciplinary studies will benefit a wide range of researchers (e.g. systematists, microbiologists, conservation biologists, parasitologists, epidemiologists). The proposed studies will enhance current knowledge about symbiosis, parasitism, co-evolution, and disease ecology, and will form the foundation for further research in these fields. This project will provide educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student training in important research areas, such as parasitology, metagenomics and phylogenetics. Minority undergraduates will be especially recruited, and academic success of these students will be monitored by a novel mentoring approach, called "Research in Pairs". This approach centers on teaching students the value of ethics, communication, and mentoring while they are pursuing their own research projects.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit: This grant supported research on a group of fleas uniquely associated with bats, also known as Ischnopsyllidae. Bat fleas are obligate blood-feeding parasites, their adults live on bats, whereas larvae (as well as eggs and pupae) are associated with guano. Bat fleas were also suggested to be vectors of pathogens among bats. The main outcomes of this research relate to a) a better understanding of bat flea diversity and evolution, and b) new insights into the microbial associates of bat fleas. Understanding the flea microbiome in the context of evolution and pathogen transmission will contribute to novel arthropod borne pathogen control strategies, and inform predictive epidemiological models of pathogen-symbiont interactions.</p> <p>Results from this grant support an Eocene origin of bat fleas, tightly following the diversification of the earliest bat hosts. Likely, early representatives of Eocene vesper bats (which are a very diverse group) were ancestral hosts of bat fleas, and interestingly, the group of bats formerly known as megabats is a secondary host association of bat fleas. The geographic origin of bat fleas remains ambiguous, but a Laurasian beginning (Northern supercontinent) is likely. In general there is a strong correlation between obligate cave-roosting habits, crowding and an association with bat fleas. Throughout the lifetime of the grant new bat fleas species were discovered, as well as new host and geographic records.</p> <p>For the first time the microbial associates of bat fleas were explored across developmental stages of larvae and adults. Bat flea larvae feed on guano, whereas adults are exclusive blood-feeders. Results show an almost complete turnover of the microbial bat flea associates across developmental stages. The larval microbiome is dominated by Gamma-proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes; the adult bat flea microbiome contains mostly Alpha-proteobacteria. Some of the discovered microbial diversity is undescribed, and cannot be matched to known entries in public databases (i.e. Genbank). In adult fleas, <em>Bartonella</em> spp., <em>Wolbachia</em> spp., and <em>Rickettia</em> spp. are specifically dominant members of the microbiome. Bartonellae are important, because some of the strains isolated from bat fleas are not only shared with bat hosts, but are also closely related to strains that have been implicated in human disease syndromes.</p> <p>Broader Impact: In alignment with NSF policy this grant devoted significant resource to human resource development.
