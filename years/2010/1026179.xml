<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to hold a two day workshop on health systems engineering and leadership. While a few pioneering health systems engineering (HSE) programs in academia have focused for decades on engineering delivery processes and operations, it is only in recent years that the enormous potential contributions of HSE are beginning to be widely recognized. The result has been an explosion of healthcare delivery research activities and education programs across academic units, especially those specializing in industrial, systems and related branches of engineering. Rather than each of the HSE academic programs evolving alone, it is time to create a leadership community where ideas can be shared and collaborations formed on both HSE research and HSE education. This workshop will begin this network-building by convening a select group of leaders from 25-30 of the most prominent HSE academic research and education programs in a two-day Healthcare Systems Engineering Research and Education Leadership Workshop at the University of Arkansas (U of A) in Fayetteville on May 20-21, 2010. The workshop will include breakout groups to build a vision for advancing the broad missions of HSE research and education, and what specific next steps should be pursued. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful this workshop will provide a definitive roadmap to a newly energized and cohesive HSE community accelerating its research contributions to improve cost, safety and effectiveness of healthcare delivery, while preparing the HSE leaders of the future to continue and extend those achievements. A formal written report and website and will also disseminate widely the collected program information submitted by attendees and add accounts of discussions on education, student viewpoints, and a continuing forum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Motivation:  - It is well recognized in everything from the ongoing national debate over healthcare reform to a series of national reports that the systems for delivering healthcare in the United States are in a crisis of inconsistent and sometimes dismal quality, safety and efficiency, with vastly unequal access and exploding costs.  - While a few pioneering health systems engineering (HSE) programs in academia have focused for decades on engineering delivery processes and operations, it is only in recent years that there has been an explosion of healthcare delivery research activities and education programs across academic units specializing in industrial, systems and related branches of engineering.     Questionnaire Results:  - The data the current state of healthcare systems engineering research and education in industrial, systems and related branches of engineering disciplines was collected from a questionnaire that was distributed to workshop participants.  - Responses from 22 academic programs were received. Participating universities included: University of Arizona, University of Arkansas, Clemson, Cornell University, Georgia Institute of Technology, HEC Montre?al, Lehigh University, University of Louisville, University of Michigan, University of Missouri, North Carolina State University, North Carolina A&amp;T State University, Pennsylvania State University, Purdue University, University of South Florida, University of Southern California, Texas A&amp;M University, University of Florida, University of Minnesota, Virginia Tech University, University of Toronto, University of Wisconsin.  A summery of the results are given in figures      Workshop Conclusions:     Education  -Healthcare systems coursework for engineers should span at least three components:    1. Students should be schooled in the relevant methods and tools used in HSE.    2. Engineering students need to learn the language, culture, values and structure of healthcare delivery organizations.    3. Some classwork should explicitly address how engineering tools can be applied in meeting healthcare delivery challenges. - HSE educational offerings of all types can benefit from exposure of engineering students to the actual environment of healthcare delivery by working on problems posed by clinical professionals there.  - Among the most promising innovations in HSE education are courses attracting both engineering students and their counterparts from medicine, nursing, pharmacy, public health and similar programs.  - Many HSE programs are considering degree or certificate programs covering a broader range of content than would be possible with isolated courses, and offering graduates a formal credential of HSE expertise.  - Beyond the standard on-campus model of HSE education, there is a large potential market for coursework offered online or in short courses.     Establishment of a HSE Alliance  - The Healthcare Systems Engineering Alliance (HSEA) should be an association of academic programs conducting research and offering education curricula focused on engineered solutions to the abundant operational and process shortfalls of current healthcare delivery.  - The principal activity of the HSEA should be to conduct 2-3 day annual workshops hosted by one of its members on or near their campus.  - Besides the annual workshops, the HSEA will synergize the individual efforts of member academic programs in healthcare delivery research and education by continuing activities to foster broader collaboration.  - Membership in the HSEA should be open to any university-level academic program engaged in research or teaching about engineered solutions to healthcare delivery challenges.
