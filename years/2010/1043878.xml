<AbstractNarration>In this NSDL Usage Development Workshops project the American Physiological Society is transforming its existing resource repository to a dynamic platform (the "Archive") supporting a community of biology educators. Participating faculty are using new Archive tools to promote discussion, sharing, and recommendations of teaching resources and strategies focusing on both how to use resources and their effectiveness in the classroom, with an eye towards forming a reflective community of practice. To organize participants, the project is creating and supporting "like-minded" User Groups of faculty who teach similar courses at similar institutions. Furthermore, the project is providing online faculty development workshops - Archive Scholar Online Workshops - to teach expanded skills for finding and using high quality online materials and for annotating and sharing these resources with colleagues. The strong intellectual merit of this approach is enhanced by the project's evaluation of these tools and professional development activities for their impacts on faculty skills and behaviors using a quasi-experimental design. The project's broader impacts are felt through its designation of faculty who complete these professional development activities as Archive Scholars, thus identifying a cadre of faculty leaders. In addition, the project is devoting special attention to recruiting and supporting minority faculty and faculty from historically minority institutions for both the User Groups and Archive Scholars activities.</AbstractNarration>

To achieve this goal, we transformed our online digital library of teaching resources into an online community of practice, the Life Science Teaching Resource Community (LifeSciTRC, <a href="http://www.lifescitrc.org/">www.lifescitrc.org</a>). Communities of practice are made up of people who are engaged in similar activities; by participating in a community of practice they learn to do that activity even better. In our case, we sought to build a community of practice where high school and undergraduate life science educators would become more effective in their teaching by interacting with each other, learning about excellent resources and teaching methods, and sharing their knowledge.</p> <p class="Default">We had four goals: 1) Increase the diversity of resources in the digital library in terms of content and format; 2) Create and test tools to promote effective community building and sharing of effective teaching/learning strategies; 3) Build a core group of community members who not only use the digital library resources but also create new resources, test resources and strategies, and share what they learned with other community members; and 4) Develop and promote in-depth multidisciplinary faculty professional development activities using digital library resources.</p> <p class="Default">To accomplish these goals, we added six new professional societies as LifeSciTRC Partners.

We built online tools to encourage community participants to share information, including discussion boards and blogs as well as ratings and comments so they could share which resources they found most useful. A survey of LifeSciTRC users showed that community ratings and comments were an important factor in selecting and using the teaching resources.
