<AbstractNarration>Doctoral student Emily Mendenhall (Northwestern University), supervised by Dr. Rebecca Seligman, will undertake research on the relationship between the folk models for disease causality and control, and psychological and physiological health outcomes. This research contributes to broader understandings of mind-body interactions by investigating the relationship of traumatic experiences both to mental and physical health outcomes, and their overlap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will focus on diabetes and will be conducted among low-income Mexican and Mexican-American women living in Chicago. The research builds upon a small body of research that demonstrates that Mexicans and Mexican-Americans often implicate stress and emotional distress in diabetes causality. The researcher will investigate the possibility that the significance of disease narratives about stressful and often traumatic experiences may reveal more than simply "folk models" and/or non-biomedical beliefs. The researcher will gather data through diabetes lifestyle questionnaires, anthropometric measures, biomarkers, psychiatric inventories, and in-depth qualitative interviews to (1) determine how individuals communicate psychological and social suffering in health narratives; (2) investigate the relationship between trauma exposure and mental health among women living with diabetes; and (3) examine the relationships among psychological and social suffering reported in diabetes narratives, psychological distress, and diabetes outcomes. By developing a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which individuals use diabetes as an idiom of distress, the researcher will measure how suffering revealed in diabetes narratives may be inscribed in both mind and body. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is important because it will contribute to social scientific theory about the connections between mind, culture, and biology. It also has application to understanding differences between individuals with good and poor diabetes outcomes, and may suggest new directions for intervention. Finally, supporting this research supports the education of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>

Seven major life stressors were identified from the narrative interviews: interpersonal abuse, stress related to health, family, neighborhood violence, immigration status, and work, and feeling socially isolated. Unusually high rates of interpersonal abuse (65%), likely depression (49%), severe depression (34%), and poor diabetes control (HbA1c&gt;7.5; 77%) were found in this study. Results indicate that interpersonal abuse was a major stressor in womenÆs lives, and together with structural violence, poverty, and immigration stress contributes to the development of and complications with co-morbid diabetes and depression. Experiences of abuse were interconnected with political and social contexts that perpetuate womenÆs vulnerability to violence through the breakdown of social protection and social networks.  In many cases, narratives of chronic adversity and severe stress were internalized for many years, revealing themselves years later in chronic depression and traumatic memory and interacting with diabetes self-care.  This project developed a theory of syndemics to explain the intersections of psychological and social suffering with diabetes and depression among low-income first and second generation Mexican immigrant women in Chicago.  Moving beyond concepts of "epidemic" and "comorbidity," a syndemics framework describes situations in which adverse social conditions, such as poverty and oppressive social relationships, stress a population, weaken its natural defenses, and expose it to a cluster of diseases. The VIDDA Syndemic was coined to unpack the cumulative negative affect of interactions among these various factors on the study population. The first dimension of The VIDDA Syndemic is Violence &ndash; encompassing structural, symbolic, and everyday forms.  The second dimension is Immigration-related stress and associated feelings of social isolation as a result of being detached from social networks.  The third aspect is Depression, which in many cases has been prolonged and internalized for decades, and for which very few poor women in the United States receive treatment.  Type 2 Diabetes is the fourth dimension, as all women were diagnosed with the disease.
