<AbstractNarration>Why do rainforest habitats support such a large diversity of animal life?  One way to approach this question is to test hypotheses about the evolutionary origins of that diversity.  This research project will use modern genetic tools to test the hypothesis that fragmentation of forest habitats during the Last Glacial Maximum approximately 18,000 years ago drove the speciation process in a group of tiny arachnids, the mite harvestmen, in the Wet Tropics of Queensland, Australia.  In addition, the researchers will name and describe many species of this poorly known animal group that are new to science.  Specimens will be deposited in the Queensland Museum and the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, and will be available to professional biologists through loans from the museums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of this project, six undergraduate students will participate in fieldwork in Queensland, and at least 20 undergraduates will be trained in lab research techniques such as scanning electron microscopy and DNA sequencing.  Student learning will happen both during the summer months, when students will be supported to work full-time on independent research projects, and as part of coursework at Macalester College.  In addition, the researchers will work with outreach staff at the Bell Museum of Natural History (University of Minnesota) to disseminate the results of this work to the public through talks and exhibits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Why are some parts of the world more diverse than others?  The best-known example of variation in biodiversity over geography is the latitudinal gradient in species diversity &ndash; a global pattern of high diversity in tropical areas close to the equator and decreasing diversity at higher latitudes.  Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain this pattern, some of which have to do with present-day ecological differences between low and high latitudes &ndash; for example, higher energy inputs from the sun at the equator &ndash; and some of which have to do with historical differences &ndash; for example, higher rates of speciation at the equator.     While the global latitudinal gradient in species diversity is probably the most famous biogeographic pattern, differential distribution of diversity across geography is seen at a multitude of spatial scales.  The work funded by this grant examined the relationship between historical climate change and current levels of biodiversity across one of the world?s biodiversity hotspots, the rainforests of the Australian Wet Tropics.  We mapped species ranges of a group of obscure arachnids, the mite harvestmen, across the Wet Tropics.  We used information about where these animals are found today to generate a model of climatic suitability of this group &ndash; that is, what kinds of temperature and precipitation conditions do these animals need to survive?  We projected this model onto paleoclimate data layers representing different climatic conditions going back to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, the most recent Ice Age), and we discovered that areas in which suitable habitat for mite harvestmen was present during the LGM are the areas that are most diverse today.  In fact, the historic location of good climatic conditions is a better predictor of present-day diversity than the current location of good climatic conditions.     Mite harvestmen are a particularly good system for studying historical forces that shape biogeography because they are dispersal-limited.  The typical range of a species is no more than 50km in its largest dimension, meaning that these animals stay within very narrow ranges over the course of their lives, and therefore retain the signature of past events to a much greater extent than animals that can, for example, wake up in one location in the morning and move 50km before sunset.  Animals from the same mite harvestman family found in Australia also inhabit New Zealand, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Chile, and Madagascar.  As part of our work supported by this grant, we have been able to test the hypothesis that this distribution reflects the pre-breakup configuration of the fragments of the supercontinent Gondwana.     All of this biogeographic work is built on knowledge of species distributions, and to this end we have discovered, described, and mapped twenty new species of mite harvestmen from Australia over the course of our work on this project.  Therefore, our work has contributed to basic biodiversity knowledge, which is particularly important in biodiversity hotspots such as the Australian Wet Tropics, rainforests that are known for having high numbers of species that occur nowhere else.     Finally, this project has supported the training of a large number of young scientists.  Undergraduate biology majors at a small liberal arts college have had the opportunity to do fieldwork in Australia, learn to generate and analyze DNA sequence data, image specimens using scanning electron microscopy, and analyze geographic data.  They have presented their work at national and international conferences, coauthored and also taken the lead on writing published papers, and gone on to graduate school at prestigious universities.  Much of this work has taken place during the summer, when undergraduates were supported to work in the PI?s lab, but students have also received training through a semester-long research methods course run by the PI twice during the course of the grant, broadening access to authentic research experiences.  Finally, undergraduates were able to collaborate with graduate students from the University of Minnesota in the lab of the Co-PI of the grant, providing those graduate students with mentoring experience while the undergraduates learned about the experience of completing a PhD and working at a large research university setting.
