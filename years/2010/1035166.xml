<AbstractNarration>The Intrinsically Multifunctional Composites Workshop will bring together leading minds in advanced composites, nanomaterials, structures and systems who will contribute to the creation of a roadmap for future research needs for intrinsically multifunctional composite systems. Approximately 100 attendees will be invited to participate.  The award will be used for stipends to offset participant cost and for the publications of the workshop proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information from the workshop will be disseminated via a website and a summary report which will include pertinent details related to the issues, ideas, concepts and plans identified at the workshop.  Additionally, proceedings of the workshop, transcripts of the panel discussion and a video of the workshop with special focus on the panel discussions will also be produced.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This 2-day workshop brought together leading minds in advanced composites, nanomaterials, structures and systems, who contributed to the creation of a roadmap for intrinsically multifunctional composite systems. They shared in some of the latest developments, collectively identified major challenges and possible solutions, and stimulated university-industry-government collaborations to advance this area of vital research. The workshop participants examined issues such as systems requirements, gaps, promising approaches, expected results and applications.     Primary areas of interest included:  (1)        Multifunctional composite and nanocomposites systems,  (2)        Nanomaterials for extreme conditions e.g. fire, smoke, toxicity and high temperature,  (3)        Multifunctional composite applications,  (4)        Intrinsic condition monitoring and sensing,  (5)        Use of advanced materials in prosthetics,  (5)        Multiscale manufacturing and modeling, and  (6)        Multi-scale integration.     The workshop featured single sessions focused on presentations in the areas outlined above. In addition to oral presentations and panel discussions, posters promoted discussions and interactions. The workshop featured four invited keynote presentations from prominent members of the composites community that provided attendees with a vision on the need, advancements and technical/business gaps in the area of multifunctional composites.     Broader Impacts: This workshop enhanced the field of multifunctional composite systems.
