<AbstractNarration>The researchers aim to develop several high-resolution (~2 to 5 year), time-overlapping and replicated delta oxygen-18 isotope records over the past five millennia from uranium series dated stalagmites collected in an El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) sensitive region of southwestern Mexico.  The goal of the project is to test the hypothesis that southern Mexico experienced prolonged wet conditions during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA) that was coincident with a more La Ni√±a-like state of low sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impacts involve the education of a doctoral student and the development of English and Spanish guides to cave science for interested members of the public in the U.S. and in Mexico.  Also, the science results could have broad application to many areas in the physical and social sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Speleothems provide the possibility of constructing absolutely dated high-resolution records of climate change.  In this project we use uranium-series dating in combination of measurements of oxygen isotopes in speleothem in order to reconstruct the climatic backdrop for the rise and fall of Mesoamerican civilizations.  We published a study in the journal Geology consisting of a quantitative 2400-yr rainfall reconstruction for the Basin of Mexico from a precisely dated and highly resolved speleothem, that documents highly variable rainfall over the past two and a half millennia.

Our data suggest that rainfall variability was likely forced by the El Ni&ntilde;o /Southern Oscillation, and impacts on spring-fed irrigation agriculture may have been a stressor on Mesoamerican civilizations.     As part of the project we also studied the dating complexities that may arise as a result of the alteration of aragonite to calcite.  This is important because the strength of speleothem-based climate reconstruction is related to the absolute chronology provided by the U-Th system.  We analyzed uranium-series concentrations and isotopic ratios in amixed aragonite and calcite stalagmite from Juxtlahuaca Cave, from the Sierra Madre del Sur of Mexico. The U-series data for the aragonite layers return highly precise and stratigraphically correct ages over the past ca. 4300 years.

A need for apparent high initial 230Th/232Th ratios results from ingrowth of 230Th during 234U decay.     Aside from the scientific contribution, we pay attention to the human resource development aspect of our project.  Jon Baker, the PhD student working in the LVIS lab, has gained an impressive level of competence in stable isotope analytical techniques. Jon is not financially supported on the project, but he has been involved in drilling of stalagmites for stable isotopes, and analysis on the mass spec. This teaching experience will serve Jon very well as he becomes more competitive, both today as a PhD student, and later when he begins applying for jobs.
