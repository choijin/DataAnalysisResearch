<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Teachers site at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.   The award will support seven teachers per summer and two teachers for year long research activities. High- and middle-school science teachers, pre-service teachers, and, exceptionally, elementary-school teachers, will be exposed to cutting edge research in the departments of Chemistry, Geosciences, and Physics, and the UWM Planetarium under the guidance of faculty mentors and teacher mentors (the latter will be experienced interns from the previous program). Specific areas of study, development, and research participation for RET interns may include: radio astronomy and pulsar detection (ARCC@UWM), gravitational wave detection (LIGO), high temperature superconductivity, measurement of molecular electric fields in biological systems and the development of novel optical fiber sensors for remote environmental monitoring, nanoscience and nanotechnology using scanning tunneling microscopy, imaging and manipulation of nanoscale objects such as single fluorescent molecules, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, investigation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in dairy manure and private drinking water wells in Northeast Wisconsin, Macromolecular Crystallography, kinetic and thermodynamic investigation of enzyme reactions, imaging of protein activity and interactions in living cells using laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy with spectral and temporal resolution, analysis of data of air showers produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays from the Pierre Auger Observatory, and petrology of recent lava flows from northern British Columbia and Iceland. The interns in this program will not only strengthen their knowledge base by engaging in suitable research activities under the guidance of a faculty mentor, but, with the guidance of the teacher mentors, they will also develop an inquiry-based teaching project that will be: implemented in the classroom; presented to a state-wide audience at the annual Wisconsin Society of Science Teachers conference in the spring following the core summer program; and developed as a web-based resource for a national audience on the UWM RET website.   This award is funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of Chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award has supported 17 high- and middle-school teachers from inner city, suburban, and rural schools who worked directly with University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) science faculty during the lifetime of the Research for Teachers (RET) program.  The teacher-interns have worked on projects ranging from water quality and the presence of drug-resistant bacteria in the public water supply to photometry of the Strange Companion to the pulsar PSR J1816+4510 to the development and introduction of astronomy curricula in high schools.  The program has supported a wide variety of educators ranging from a science teacher in a rural middle school to a special needs teacher in an inner city high school.   The goals of the RET program have been: collaboration with science teachers in middle and high schools to improve the quality of science education and thus to stimulate the interest and imaginations of students who might not otherwise pursue science studies at college; to develop further and nurture the links between UWM and the educational community in the State of Wisconsin; to further the professional development of middle and high school instructional staff; and to allow educators to develop specific teaching projects which they will take back to and use in their classrooms.  One significant outcome,  was the presentations by the RET interns of their research and/or teaching projects at a regional or national meeting to disseminate their work to a larger audience.  RET interns presented at out-of-state national or regional meetings of:  the American Astronomical Society; the American Association of Physics Teachers; the National Geological Society of America; and ChemEd (which stands for Chemical Education).  Other interns presented their work at the in-state meeting of the Wisconsin Society of Science Teachers Convention.  It is of vital importance that the energy, enthusiasm, and understanding of new and exciting research fields be carried back to the students in the interns' classes.  Therefore, the most significant outcome of the project was the implementation of the teaching projects.  As an example of this impact, the classrooms and students numbers for one project year (2013-2014) are detailed below:  1. Computer Programming course (10-12 grade; approximately 100 students) in an inner city school.  2. Accelerated physics (11-12 grade; approximately 45 students) and standard Physics (11-12 grade; approximately 48 students) in a suburban school.  3. Physics and IB/Advanced Physics (11-12 grade; approximately 100 students) and  Astronomy (11-12 grade; approximately 40 students)  in an urban school in city about 80 miles from Milwaukee.  4. Earth Science (8th grade; approximately 55 students) and Oceanography (mixed-grades; 14 students) in a rural school.  5. Environmental Science (10th grade; 17 students) and Biology, (11th grade; 15 students) and a single semester environmental science course (9-10 grade; approximately 42 students)  in an inner city school with some special needs students.  6. Astronomy, AP-B Physics, and AP-C Physics &ndash; including both mechanics and electricity and magnetism (10-12 grade; approximately 140 students) in a suburban school.  The Intern's students also benefit from the after school UWM astronomy club, where the intern has 12 participating students.  7. Physics (10-12 grade; approximately 81 students) and AP-C Physics (10-12 grade; approximately 42 students) in a suburban school.   Students also come to UWM campus to participate in the Astronomy Club.  It is important to note that once this impact has been initiated, this is sustained each year going forward.  Therefore, 700 students per year could be conservatively estimated to be impacted by this project in a range of science classes, school types and entry level.  This report is best concluded with statements from two former interns:   "I gained invaluable experience that directed a new curriculum I implemented in the 2013-14 school...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
