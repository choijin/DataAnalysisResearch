<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the creation of a new revolutionary imaging instrumentation that combines vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy with infrared (IR) spectral microscopy. VCD microscopy represents a new class of spectroscopic imaging diagnostic capable of measuring VCD images with millimeter to sub-millimeter spatial resolution. The recent discovery that long-range structural chirality in protein fibrils is characterized by unusually large and distinctive VCD spectra provides the backdrop for this project. None of the currently available techniques can characterize the fibrillation pathway or the final fibril state with the same ease and detail as VCD. VCD microscopy can be thought of as circular polarization contrast microscopy that is sensitive to long-range chiral order in localized regions of biological samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are studies of the supramolecular chirality of fibrils. This product is not a small improvement of an existing technology but a distinctly new method of studying long-range biochirality that is more sensitive, provides more detail, and is easy and fast to use. A secondary, higher-impact long-term impact will be clinical research laboratories where this innovation can be used for the detection and characterization of amyloids in vivo, i.e. for tissue biopsies, rapid detection of amyloids and drug screening.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The realized accomplishments of this project include primarily the development of a micro-sampling accessory for vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) with the aim of measuring enhanced VCD spectra of amyloid fibrils in various locations on a film of such fibrils.  The accessory allows over a 100-fold reduction of VCD image size from an area approximately 10 mm on a side to an area less than 1 mm on a side, thereby allowing detailed VCD mapping of a film sample.  Amyloid fibrils are implicated in a number of neuro-degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's Diseases, and it is known from electron or force microscopy that amyloid fibrils form with various morphologies that have differing degrees of pathogenicity.  Within the time period of this grant, we established, by a number of publications, a correlation between the sign pattern of enhanced VCD and fibril morphology.  In parallel with these studies, the development of a VCD micro-sampling accessory, now commercialized as VCDuSamplIR, and soon to be available in the Mantis VCD Accessory that can be used with any FT-IR, we have been able to demonstrate that VCD spectra of fibrils on a single film sample show enhanced VCD with opposite signs, and hence differing morphology, at different locations of the film.  The micro-sampling capability of VCD more recently has made possible our measurement of VCD spectral images of brain tissue sections to determine the chirality and morphology of localized amyloid fibrils in a setting of direct biomedical significance.
