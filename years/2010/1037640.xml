<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to create an accelerated track for engineering bachelor and master degrees for veterans at Kansas State University focused on the energy industry.  The program integrates elements of accelerated programs, credit for military experience, and a clearly defined pathway into the renewable energy industry.  This program, if successful, can serve as an example to other universities who seek to allow students with military experience ways to translate that experience to faster engineering degree completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project comes from addressing the needs of the large population of veterans, and additionally preparing those veterans for careers in the energy industry.  Energy, particularly sustainable energy, is burgeoning field that has become a national priority.  The approach pioneered by the research team can serve as a model which can be emulated by other universities who wish to target military veterans.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project is to address issues involved in academically preparing and integrating post-9/11 veterans into the engineering workforce.  A recent NSF Workshop on Enhancing the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Benefit indicates that new, more generous veteransÆ educational benefits create an opportunity to expand the technical workforce while benefitting those who have served our country.  The workshop further indicates that the veterans include a diverse and qualified pool of future talent for the nationÆs engineering and science employers.  The result of this project is the creation of a program to (1) the integration of veterans into the engineering curriculum using accelerated courses and to (2) leverage the technical expertise acquired during military service by evaluating and applying it to academic degree requirements.      The first aspect involves the creation of accelerated courses specifically for veterans enrolled in the program. Veterans may have a base of technical knowledge acquired through the technical nature of their assignments. Assigning them to introductory level courses with traditional freshman and sophomore students does not respect their technical expertise nor challenge their capabilities and accustomed pace.     The second technique is to thoroughly evaluate veteransÆ training, experiences, and expertise with the option of granting academic credit where appropriate. Current policies give little credit for military experience or training.     Another feature of the project is summer internships for participants. Additional key supporting components include the development of strategies to inform veterans of engineering workforce opportunities and the recruitment activities, program overviews, and coordination with campus military veterans support staff and personnel at nearby military installations.     The initial technical focus on the energy systems and energy distribution technical areas will help fill a critical need for engineers in these areas.  A recent NSF Workshop on the Future Power Engineering Workforce indicated "a serious need is emerging for more power and energy engineers..."  Information regarding program features that help facilitate the transition of veterans into engineering programs has been obtained. The personnel associated with this project have a long history of accommodating students from nontraditional backgrounds as they successfully complete a degree in engineering.     This program produces engineering graduates with a quality technical background in renewable energy systems and energy distribution as it draws from an experienced veteran population inclusive of ethnic and gender diversity. Increasing engineering graduates in these areas addresses forecast shortages.  This program allows veterans to complete engineering degrees within the time limits for educational benefits.
