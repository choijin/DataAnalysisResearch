<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Diversity in Fortune 500 Companies, 1996-2008&lt;br/&gt;SES- 1061243&lt;br/&gt;Sheryl Skaggs&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas-Dallas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES - 1061430&lt;br/&gt;Kevin Stainbeck&lt;br/&gt;Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This research studies how changes over time in corporate leadership (corporate board of directors and corporate executives) influence gender diversity among managers and non-managers in Fortune 500 companies. The concept of the "glass ceiling" has been well-discussed by the public, academics, and the popular press. Although research continues to examine conditions that may influence women?s progress toward "breaking the glass ceiling," few studies have considered whether and if so how having women serve in high-level leadership roles affects gender diversity at lower levels of corporations. This project utilizes two primary sources of unique data covering the period between 1996 and 2008:  Catalyst's Annual Census of Women Corporate Board of Directors and Officers that measures gender diversity at the highest corporate ranks, and annually collected data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on employee racial, ethnic and sex composition by occupational groups. The sample includes over 4,000 company-by-year observations. The investigators hypothesize that increased gender diversity within top decision-making roles creates opportunities for women?s advancement at high, mid and low corporate levels and reduce workplace gender segregation. Because corporations and workplaces operate within a complex mix of practices, policies and external constraints, the investigators will also consider how these features may facilitate or deter gender diversity over time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Over the past four decades the percentage of women?s participation in the U.S. workforce has surged, and there is an ongoing interest in workplace diversity. The study's findings will contribute to (1) scientific scholarship on gender inequality, organizational dynamics, and change, (2) a knowledge-base for the management of an increasingly diverse U.S. workforce, and (3) a better understanding of the efficacy of policies related to equal employment opportunities both at the national level and within workplaces.</AbstractNarration>
