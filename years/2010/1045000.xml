<AbstractNarration>Planning Visit to China and Workshop Involving Two Marine LTER Sites and Two Chinese CERN Sites Concerned with Coral Reefs&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a two-week planning visit and joint research workshop to be held in Sanya, Hainan Island, China, in August 2010. The related visits will include stops at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, the Jiaozhou Bay National Marine Ecosystem Research Station in Qingdao, and the South China Sea Institute in Guangzhou, as well as the Hainan Tropical Marine Biology Research Station in Sanya. Participants in the trip will be six senior researchers from two marine-research sites in the NSF LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) network. Both Chinese research stations, members of the Chinese Ecological Research Network (CERN), as well as the US participants from the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER and the Moorea Bay Coral Reef LTER are members of the International LTER network. The purposes of the trip are to plan for the formation of an East Asia Coral Reel Alliance involving Sanya with similar stations in Taiwan, Australia, and Moorea and to promote collaborative US-China research on temperate reefs. The objective of the workshop is to focus on a joint geographic study on reef resilience. &lt;br/&gt;The visits and workshop will promote valuable collaboration and provide opportunities for comparative studies among various ecosystems. The resulting work will facilitate testing of hypotheses regarding the effects of local and regional diversity patterns on ecological processes and responses to environmental drivers such as climate change. One form of broad impact will derive from opportunities for  participation of students and young researchers from both countries in the planned collaborations. Their interactions, among themselves and with the more senior researchers, are expected to establish long-term relationships that should encourage productive research collaborations. In a broader sense, better understanding of reef resilience and local ecological phenomena should lead to methods for remediation and control of reef destruction, a serious environmental problem.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ US scientists from the US Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program visited China to attend planning meetings and participate in a two-day workshop at Sanya, China.  The overall goals were to discuss the potential for academic exchanges and research cooperation between two marine research stations of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) - the Hainan Tropical Marine Biology Research Station (South China Sea Institute of Oceanography) at Sanya, and the Jiaozhou Bay National Marine Ecosystem Research Station (Institute of Oceanography) at Qingdao.  Both stations are members of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN), which together with the US NSF LTER program, are founding members of the International Long Term Ecological Research network (ILTER).  Six US scientists from two marine sites in the US LTER network &ndash; the Moorea Coral Reef (MCR) and the Santa Barbara Coastal (SBC) LTERs &ndash; visited both CERN sites, the South China Sea Institute in Guangzhou, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.  They also participated in a two-day workshop at Sanya to exchange recent research findings related to resilience of coral reefs and identify research issues of mutual interest that could form the basis for future cooperation.   Coral reefs are one of the world's most diverse and economically important coastal ecosystems, yet they are threatened by human disturbances and climate change.   Building the flow of information and cooperation between Chinese and U.S. scientists will help provide information of critical importance to resource managers and others charged with conservation and management of coral reef ecosystems.  Discussions included the potential for assembling an East Asia Coral Reef Alliance and possible China &ndash; US LTER temperate reef associations.   The planning visit also laid the groundwork for possible future interactions and reciprocal exchanges of students, postdocs and scientists.  The visit resulted in a much deeper understanding of research being conducted at several of the most important marine laboratories in China and the US.
