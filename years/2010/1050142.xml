<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;RNA synthesis, or transcription, is the main target for regulation of gene expression in all three kingdoms of life. The RNA polymerases of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, which are responsible for RNA synthesis, are strikingly similar in structure. The aim of this research program is to gain a detailed understanding of how the RNA polymerase from the bacterium, Escherichia coli, forms a transcription-competent complex at promoter DNA, the site of initiation of RNA synthesis. Such information is vital to our detailed understanding of RNA polymerase's mechanism of action and in turn, how gene expression is regulated. In view of the similarities of their RNA polymerases, this information will be relevant to all bacteria, including pathogens.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;This research program affords the opportunity to maintain a strong representation of women and underrepresented minorities. To extend this to undergraduate students as well, students are recruited through the Summer Program in Undergraduate Research (SPUR) at Case Western Reserve University. This program makes it possible for students to spend ten weeks working in a research laboratory under the direction of a faculty member, culminating in the presentation of a poster in the final week. The students are provided a stipend to defray the costs of their participation.</AbstractNarration>

Broader Impact  During the 4 years of the grant, 4 women have worked on various projects:            Disha Haque, undergraduate (now at The Ohio State University, and soon to be in a medical school; no choice made yet)                                                           Manasa Sagaram, undergraduate (Now doing a post-bac at the University of Toledo)                       Heather Oreh, BA (now taking care of a special needs child).                              Tyrishea Crumedy (under represented minority) high school student (now at Central State University), and 1 man:      Ebenezer Minaya (under represented minority)  For the two undergraduates it was the their first time doing research. The two undergraduate students had some experience. Howwever, when each of them had just arrived arrived in the laboratory , the advice of my technician Heather Oreh's and myself was essential. All got useful results, but they did not accumulate enough data to be included among the authors of the paper we published. The two high school students also benefitted from lectures presented in the program "Scientific Enrichment and Opportunity Program designed to bring underprivileged students from the Cleveland Metropolitan School District into contact with faculty at the School of Medicine".
