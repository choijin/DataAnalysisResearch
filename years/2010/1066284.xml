<AbstractNarration>Award: 1066284&lt;br/&gt;PI: Stebe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will perform fundamental studies to establish quantitative guiding principles for anisotropic capillary assembly, i.e. to relate particle shape, contact angle, and interface shape, to the range and strength of interactions and to the assemblies which form. To do so, we will study capillary assembly in experiment, numerics and theory. We have established an intellectual basis to study interactions between any anisotropic particles at interfaces which we are in the process of applying to cylindrically shaped particles with uniform contact angle. We choose cylinders as the first shape to study because they have intriguing properties when they are at interfaces- they have high interfacial area density near their planar end faces which cements end-to-end assembly. We now understand far field interactions between cylindrical particles at interfaces in detail. However, when the particles come close together, the strong deformations near the ends overlap, forming a strong  interaction between particles termed a "capillary bond", whose strength we will quantify numerically.  We will then check the validity of the calculation experimentally- this will establish the pair interactions between cylinders at interfaces at all separations. We will then address three assembly aims, selected to pave the way to fields which exploit oriented particle assemblies. We will: I. Establish in experiment whether, as scaling suggests, capillary interactions are important for sub-micron to nanoscale particles, important for making annealable structures and for extending the technological impact of capillary assembly. II. Characterize the strength of capillary assemblies using magnetic tweezers, important in applications that exploit particle-stabilized emulsions, colloidosomes, and other hierarchical assemblies. III. Develop capillary recognition elements, which would preferentially assemble only with mating particles like puzzle pieces on an interface. This requires that we develop and understand capillary repulsion to impart selectivity to particle interactions. These aims were selected to seed new materials-related research to exploit anisotropic particle assemblies. For example, ordered oriented particle monolayers could be exploited to epitaxially grow new 3-D structures; oriented, assembled anisotropic particles could allow new classes of metamaterials to be developed; capillary recognition elements could promote registry of particles with other features within devices, and could serve as sensors or read outs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Soft aterials are often made on fluids and collloidal components arranged spatially to give certain properties; the structures are often solidified e.g. in photonics, in the creation of high surface area catalysts and in the creation of hierarchical structures for complex wetting.  To form ordered structures more  complex than close packed crystalline assemblies, applied external electromagnatic fields are often used to direct particle assembly.  We have developed alternative strategies based on exploitation of energies that emerge when particles are placed in soft matter.  Particles at fluid interfaes, studied here, are an important example,  Particles attach to interfaces to satisfy wetting conditions, and deforma the interface around them. The deformation carries energy, the product of the area of the distrtion and  the surfae tension.   We have significantly advanced the understanding of these phenomena, and demonstrated microation and structure formaiton from disks, spheres and other shaped particles on deformable fluid interfaces with clear closed form theory.  This work has potential for broad impact in diverse fields in materials science.     Broader Impacts: In  performing this reserach, we have trained several post-graduate ressearchers and undergraduate researchers.  We have developed and presented lectures on this subject for (i) University courses (ii) Advanced Summer Schools in Soft Matter internationally (iii) for use in the PI's outreach efforts to draw new cohorts into STEM fields.
