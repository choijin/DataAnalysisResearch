<AbstractNarration>Based on the previous successful WIRES1 conference in June 2009 in Spain; and the positive outcomes of WIRES1, the PIs proposed this summit proposal of WIRES2 to maintain the momentum of the activities and explore creative and potentially transformative face-to-face ways to continue cross-continental engineering research among women. Proposed activities are well conceived and organized with sufficient access to resources.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks to fund the participation of approximately 50 US female engineering faculty at the research summit in Orlando, FL facilitating international collaborations in targeted engineering disciplines of sustainable energy, clean water and health care. The PIs expect another 50-60 female engineers from foreign countries to join this summit and to be supported by their academic or research constituents. The proposal provides a sound rationale, and addresses a real need for a clear pathway in pursuing international collaborations; and  expanded databases on engineering women faculty and common issues they are facing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ WomenÃ†s International Research Exchange (WIRES) was an international summit for female researchers seeking global collaborative opportunities in energy systems, micro/nanotechnology, disaster management research and simulation-based engineering.  The overall goal was to promote leadership in the establishment of substantive and sustainable international research collaborations for female faculty in engineering and technology.  1) Major activities;  Identification and selection of high potential female engineering faculty for international research collaboration establishment International Research Summit  Partnering of US female researchers with international researchers  Facilitation of on-going partnerships   2) Specific objectives;  Provide      a community of excellence for forging personal, sustainable relationships      among female engineers around the world by revealing facilities/expertise      available in the respective countries. Provide      a clear, visible pathway for females to pursue international      collaborations. Identify      methods of securing funding for international collaborations from federal      agencies, international sources (e.g., NATO, UNESCO), the private sector,      foundations, etc. Identify      common issues faced by female researchers pursuing careers in engineering      such as inclusiveness in research endeavors, gender lens in innovation,      female-friendly environments, institutions, &amp; companies, family leave      policies, "dual-career couple" issues. Focus on      the global engineering research enterprise by enabling the participants to      develop a personal understanding of how engineering research, innovation      and technology to the market (T2M) are conducted in various countries      around the world. Generate      a database of female faculty who are interested in conducting      international research.      3) Significant results, including major findings, developments, or conclusions (both positive and negative); and  Evaluations of WIRES 2009 and 2011 immediately following the summits showed that the participantsÃ† understanding of how to engage in successful international research collaborations increased "very much," and that, on average, participants identified 4 to 5 new collaborators.  One year after WIRES 2009 and six months after WIRES 2011, participants were surveyed. Results of these post?summit surveys shows that the connections participants established and information received at WIRES have resulted in research proposals, papers, and other conferences and workshops. WIRES research focused on studying barriers and facilitators for international research collaborations and taking a global look at gender equity issues. WIRES 2011 outputs included identification of barriers to international research collaborations, recommended practices in international research collaborations and development of essential skills.  4) Key outcomes or other achievements.  The level of international collaboration for WIRES participants was significantly more than for the period prior to their participation in WIRES.   Level of International Research Collaborations (IRC)    67.1% report an increased level of international research collaboration*  27.6% report that their level of international research collaborations has remained the same*  IRC Outcomes that resulted from connections made or information received at WIRES1    Number of research proposals     Written and submitted: 42 Funded: 10      Number of research papers     Submitted: 10        Fully accepted: 10   23 students trained    56 visits between IRC collaborators  * as compared with the level of international research collaboration in the prior three years.     IMPACT   The summit will raised awareness of pathways and methods for females to pursue international collaborations and seek funding sources. Participants in the summit will included approximately 200 females (60 from the U.S. and 140 international) in v...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
