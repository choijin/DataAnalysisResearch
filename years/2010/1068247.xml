<AbstractNarration>Technical description of the project: The project is concerned with&lt;br/&gt;A) the study of algebraic varieties over finite fields, exponential sums on such &lt;br/&gt;varieties, their associated L-functions, how these objects vary in families, and &lt;br/&gt;the determination of the associated monodromy groups which govern this variation. &lt;br/&gt;B)Various "horizontal" questions where we start with a situation over the integers, reduce modulo various primes p, and ask how the answers to the questions of section A) above vary with p.&lt;br/&gt;C) Various questions of Lang-Trotter type about families, other than modular families, of elliptic curves in a given characteristic p.&lt;br/&gt;Some of the main technical tools for attacking questions of type A) are group&lt;br/&gt;theory, Fourier Transform, and the theory of perverse sheaves. For questions&lt;br/&gt;of types B) and C), there are very few tools, and even designing &lt;br/&gt;and implementing numerical experiments to guess what should be true can be nontrivial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader significance and importance of the project: The broader significance and importance of the project is three-fold. While it is too soon to appraise the societal impact of this particular project, the last two decades have seen stunning practical application in many fields (e.g., telecommunications, cryptology, and computer security, to name just a few) of a great deal of algebraic geometry over finite fields, some of which goes back to the nineteenth century, and all of which seemed quite arcane at the time it was being done. The project proposes to extend our understanding of already posed, extremely interesting mathematical questions over finite fields, questions the answers to which may well in the future have a broader societal impact. Second, the project proposes the investigation of new, extremely interesting, mathematical questions, for whose consideration there does not yet exist even a theoretical framework; any progress on such questions may point the way to the presently missing theoretical framework.  Third, the project will deepen our understanding of the analogies between the finite eld case and the number field case, analogies which have already played a important role in shaping our very thinking about the number field case.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was devoted to questions in what is called "arithmetic algebraic  geometry" as related to life over finite fields. For a prime number p, for example 2 or 3 or 5 or 7 or 11 or 13 or 17 or 19 or 691 or 1987,  we can think in   "clock time" modulo p (the usual clock time being modulo 12, sadly not a prime),   which is to say, in the field of integers modulo p, denoted F_p.  Some fundamental questions concern the behavior of complex-valued functions defined on F_p (though it is a bit technical to explain exactly why these   questions are in fact fundamental). Examples are the so-called exponential sums, of which a typical example, first studied by Gauss some two hundred  years ago, is the "Gauss sum", the sum, over integers t running from 0 to p-1,  of Exp(2*Pi*I*t^2/p). When we replace the polynomial t^2 by some more  complicated polynomial, say t^7 + 3t, we get another exponential sum. If we  look at what happens when we change the 3 in 3t to other elements of F_p ,so we look, for each a mod p, at the sum, over t running from 0 to p-1, of  Exp(2*Pi_I*(t^7+at)/p), the question becomes what can we say statistically  about how these sums "depend" on the varying "a" in their definition.     The answer to this kind of question involves the computation of what are called  "monodromy groups". They were invented by Riemann some one hundred and fifty years ago, but only in the last fifty years were they transposed to the  "arithmetic algebraic geometry" context, by Grothendieck, and had their applicability to the above question shown by Deligne some forty years ago.     There are also monodromy groups attached to other, more complicated situations, and a great deal of the project was devoted to their computation.  In terms of potential practical applications, it is too early to point to any, but this kind of mathematics more generally is what underlies modern communications technology and encryption.     There are a number of published research papers, some by me alone and  some with collaborators, on these questions. There is also my book "Convolution and Equidistribution", published by Princeton University Press,  which is more readily available to the general public than research articles.
