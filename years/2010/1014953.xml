<AbstractNarration>1014953&lt;br/&gt;Ben-Yakar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Femtosecond laser microsurgery (FLMS) has emerged as a remarkable technique for precisely ablating living tissue below the surface while ensuring minimal damage to surrounding regions. The combination of this technique with nonlinear optical imaging (NOI) modalities (two-photon fluorescence and second harmonic generation) provides a non-invasive means for visualization to guide laser microsurgeries in situ. A miniaturized probe capable of combined FLMS and NOI will provide physicians a means for guided microsurgery with the highest precision available. The PI proposes to build such a probe specifically designed for use in delicate vocal fold restoration surgeries. They will first determine the required laser parameters for successful creation of sub-surface voids in scarred vocal folds. Second they will build and test an image-guided, miniaturized surgery probe. They will then perform surgery in live animal scar models to determine the efficacy of this novel technique before it can move into clinical trials.</AbstractNarration>
