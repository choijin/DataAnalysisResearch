<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Improving our understanding of species invasion dynamics and their interactions with possible biocontrol agents is a critical priority for eliminating invasive species and for managing and restoring impacted ecosystems.  The Chinese tallow tree, Triadica sebifera, is a highly competitive, monoculture-forming tree in its invasive range in the southeastern U.S.  Host species-specific herbivores are of particular interest in this system, as evidence suggests that a plantÃ†s competitive advantages may be reduced in the presence of abundant native specialist herbivore populations.    In the summer of 2010, I completed a study, supported by the NSF East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute, aimed at establishing the native range and history of distribution for this moth by searching for it among Chinese Tallow populations in China.  I worked with Dr. Jianqing Ding, a specialist on species invasions and Chinese Tallow.  I also had the opportunity to work with researchers at East China Normal University in Shanghai, which is the sister school to Tulane University, where I am a PhD student.  Professionally and personally, I believe that my Chinese colleagues and I benefited greatly from this collaboration, and the study yielded some interesting results. While U.S. colleagues and I have observed high population densities and no natural enemies for this Caloptilia in the southeastern U.S., I found that in China, Caloptilia occurred at significantly lower population densities and were subject to relatively strong predation pressure from wasps.  Interestingly, although the Caloptilia collected in China are morphologically and ecologically similar to the species found in the U.S., genetic analysis indicates that there are at least three distinct species in China.  These three species appear to be geographically correlated (see image).  Furthermore, at least one, and possibly all of these species are new to science.  Since Chinese Tallow is known to vary across its range in traits that affect herbivores, these results may imply that genetically-based traits of the host plant are driving evolutionary changes and speciation of a specialist herbivore.  This could illuminate a possible mechanism for the unexplained appearance and proliferation of this anomalous herbivore in Chinese Tallow's invasive range.   I will continue to build on this study by expanding the collection efforts to the full range of Chinese Tallow's distribution, including new sites in China, Japan, Taiwan, and Australia.  Additionally, I am initiating observational and manipulative field studies in the U.S. that will examine the ecological aspects of the interaction between this insect and its host plant.  Finally, collections of genetic material from both host plants and Caloptilia will be comparatively analyzed to test for signatures of reciprocal evolutionary changes.  The results of these studies will contribute to our overall understanding of specialist herbivore adaptation to evolutionary changes of the host plants they consume and the possible ecological outcomes.  In closing, I would like to thank NSF-EAPSI and the partner organizations in China that have made this work possible. This international collaboration continues to have profound positive impacts on my scientific career and development as an individual.
