<AbstractNarration>This project is continuing to develop and evaluate a substantially new model for engineering education known as the IRE (Iron Range Engineering) model, built on project-based learning (PBL). In IRE, students work with industrial professionals on design projects.  The goal is to produce graduates who possess integrated technical and professional knowledge and competencies. IRE students are upper-division mechanical engineering students most of whom are graduates of Minnesota's community colleges. IRE students do not take classes. All of their learning is done in the context of the industry projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publication of Engineer 2020 in 2004 reiterated the need for a new-look engineering graduate. The IRE model has been developed with guidance from respected leaders in engineering education.  In addition to industry-based PBL, the model includes outcome-based assessment, just-in-time interventions, self-directed learning, and emphasis on reflection.  The emphasis of this project is on the evaluation of how engineering learners develop in the IRE model. The project is assessing the extent to which IRE students are acquiring knowledge and developing competencies recommended in national reports and by ABET (the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology).  This evaluation is using various assessment tools (such as the Self-Directed-Learning-Readiness Scale, the National Survey of Student Engagement, the TIDEE design assessment system, selected concept inventories, and best-practice portfolios) to measure realized outcomes with respect to the goals. The results of this project are bring shared with the widest possible audience &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The primary emphasis of this project is on the development of learning outcomes that have been spelled out in national reports, including The Engineer of 2020 and ABET. This emphasis is in contrast with a heavy emphasis on topical material that characterizes many of the engineering programs throughout the world. Faculty members in the new IRE program invest heavily in developing the abilities of students to assess their development with respect to these outcomes. To support self assessment, faculty members are teaching the IRE students criteria that are assisting their metacognitive thinking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Successful completion of this project is providing engineering educators with a researched-based understanding of how effectively students learn engineering in project-based learning. The results of this study will make visible the extent to which students in engineering PBL develop cognitively, acquire technical competency, acquire professional competency, and the extent to which their motivation to learn is affected.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to evaluate the development of engineering students in a PBL (project-based learning) curriculum using a wide variety of tools and methods.  Over the course of the project many tools were used to collect data. Some tools were found to be useful. Others were not. The most useful evaluation tools were a survey instrument designed as part of the project (the professional development / professional expectations survey), the self-directed learning readiness scale (SDLRS), two interview protocols, and tracking of passing rates of the fundamentals of engineering exam (FE).  Intellectual Merit:  1. The professional competency tool which measures both "importance" of the competency to the individual and their "performance" in the competency found:  PBL students importance level stayed constant across upper division education. Traditional student importance level decreased across upper division education. PBL student performance increased across upper division education. Traditional student performance remained constant across upper division education.   2. The qualitative study aimed at discovering "why" the PBL students developed professionally identified that PBL students can verbalize, at high levels, their professional competence.  3. Attributes of the education that aided in development:  Explicit language in the instruction  Structured reflection during instruction Cyclical continuous improvement Authenticity of the industry cllient-based projects   4. PBL education results in higher levels of self-directed learning capability.  5. Results indicated that PBL students develop technically on par with traditional students.  Broader Impacts:  There is a growing body of evidence that activity-based learning results in the development of an entry-level engineer that better meets the needs of society. This development is in regard to the graduate's ability to perform technically, professionally, creatively, and as a lifelong learner. The results of this project based learning study add to the body of evidence. The curricular decision makers for engineering education at the institution level can use the outcomes of this study to contemplate how PBL education in their social construct may have professional development attributes aligned with their needs.
