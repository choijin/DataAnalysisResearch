<AbstractNarration>This award is made on a proposal to the Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation. The Office of Cyberinfrastructure and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports developing an internet-based scientific computing environment, particularly for computational materials research. The PI will advance into computational materials research a recent innovation known as cloud computing ? the ability to utilize computer resources connected via the internet, which may be geographically separated by vast distances, on demand to do computing. The PI will develop a computing environment that will be robust, flexible, and relatively easy for the materials research community to use. The PI will focus on specific codes that calculate the states of electrons in materials starting from the identities of the atoms in the material and their positions. Forces between atoms may be calculated from the electronic states. These codes will be used in the short term to calculate complicated motions of atoms and molecules, to understand data from experiments that involve scattering light from materials, to study how specific materials absorb and interact with light to advance solar cell technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports education and outreach activities to enable the research community to effectively use the new computational tools developed under this award, and expose high school students to cutting edge advances in computation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computer simulations are an essential part of research in materials science and increasingly in all areas of research.  They help analyze observations; they help design models and make predictions that can be tested in an experiment.  Therefore it is important to make scientific computer simulations accessible to those who could benefit from them:  for example to applied scientists who interpret their lab measurements on the fly, or to students whose scientific learning benefits greatly from performing accurate simulations of scientific phenomena.  Our Scientific Cloud Computing Platform  is a way to achieve that level of accessibility.  As our theoretical understanding and the availability of computing power steadily increase, computational scientists develop ever more sophisticated simulations that describe reality more accurately, and provide better analysis and predictions.  Unfortunately, these state-of-the-art simulation codes are often not readily accessible to all researchers.  They typically require powerful parallel computers, and not all scientists have access to such computers, or have the specialized technical skills necessary to use them.  Additionally, new scientific software often lacks user-friendliness, requiring tedious installation procedures and careful, expert execution.  This double threshold prevents a wide class of researchers and students from using the most accurate simulation tools.  This represents a missed opportunity to catalyze scientific research by quickly putting the best tools in the hands of all potential users.  Instead it takes a long time for innovation to trickle down to the general research community.  We have developed a Scientific Cloud Computing platform to eliminate these barriers to innovation.  A researcher can rent computer resources on-demand from a Cloud Provider much as she would rent a car rather than purchase one.  This service has a much lower entry cost (typically several cents per core-hour) than buying and maintaining a parallel computer.  The pay-as-you-go model also fits the variable needs of many research groups.  Moreover, a code developer can package his state-of-the-art simulation program in a  "virtual computer" ready for use in the Cloud.  The researcher who needs access to the simulations, e.g. to predict the optical properties of a new material, can then simply rent ready-to-go computers fully equipped for the task with simulation tools that have been configured and optimized by the developer.  This is even more important when a workflow involving several simulation tools is needed.  Finally, to make the simulations optimally user-friendly we provide a Graphical User Interface that runs from the user's laptop and interfaces with the Cloud in an automated way, hiding the underlying complexity.  In other words, a user can execute a state-of-the-art simulation from her laptop, where a user-friendly GUI connects to the Cloud, executes a simulation on a parallel computer allocated on-demand with developer-installed simulation tools, and brings the results back to her when ready.  This model is already prevalent in mobile computing: many of the modern "apps" on a smartphone are mere front-ends that rely on the Cloud for the heavy work and then display the results to the user.  We believe that the same paradigm can flatten the learning curve and accessibility threshold for scientific computing.  In summary, we have developed a Scientific Cloud Computing Platform.  It includes cloud computer images designed as nodes in a parallel cloud cluster and equipped with a variety of simulation codes relevant to materials science.  We have also developed interface layers suitable to either end-user access or GUI building.  These interface layers make it easy to group Cloud computers into parallel clusters and manage them.  We have demonstrated that typical, heavily parallellized materials science simulations achieve good performance on such cloud clusters.  Finally, we have de...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
