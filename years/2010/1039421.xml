<AbstractNarration>1039421&lt;br/&gt;Petronis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of a thermal demagnetizer and ancillary paleomagnetic lab equipment to support research and research training in the Department of Natural Sciences at New Mexico Highlands University.  A new ASC thermal demagnetizer will replace an inoperative thermal demagnetizer in the PIs lab and will support a wide range of paleomagnetic investigations including studies of magma flow dynamics based on magnetic fabric measurements, paleogeographic investigations of Neoproterozoic glacial deposits preserved in the high Arctic, and Quaternary paleoenvironmental studies of lacustrine deposits.  NMHU is a Hispanic serving institution (56% of the student body is Hispanic) and has a documented record of recruiting students into STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
