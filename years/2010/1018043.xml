<AbstractNarration>The AUM Seamless Admission Summer Bridge program for Engineering Students is a potential national model that will provide a welcoming campus environment and immerse participants in a culture of rigor, encouragement, and connectivity within the campus. The emphasis on females will address the continuing low number of women in engineering fields, particularly in graduate education and the professoriate. LSAMP support and engagement will bring in intellectual and material resources to ensure success and bring the national conversation on engineering preparation into the program design and implementation. Students will gain foothold on their college degree program through the advising, strategies for success, tutoring and mentoring, as well as receive a stipend which will allow them to participate and benefit from the activities instead of working during the summer. Students will be exposed to research and career opportunities for a well rounded experience. The faculty have a clear and confident vision of the program. The one-on-one interaction between faculty and students; and other demonstrated experts in the broad scope of engineering fields is important to both faculty and students. &lt;br/&gt;Value added includes the tours of local engineering companies and the US Space and Rocket Center, which will provide access that the students would not otherwise have. The seminars, workshops, and required poster projects broaden the student experience well beyond coursework. The dissemination of lessons learned in the national LSAMP magazine will share the program with a national audience, expanding the potential impact.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Seamless Admission Summer Bridge Program for Engineering Students was a five-week program designed to simultaneously provide rigorous mentorship of and a smooth transition for women and underrepresented minority students with an interest in majoring in engineering from high school to college.  Academic preparation was a major focus for the summer bridge program. Students were enrolled in English Composition I and Pre-calculus for a total of seven-credit hours of course work. To ensure academic success, students attended mandatory tutoring 4 days a week.  Morever, social activities and field trips were designed to help students bond together and help each other succeed. Last but not least, students participated in weekly seminars that focused on time management, leadership and communication skills, academic honesty, and campus safety, to name a few.  Twenty students (14 females and 6 males) from various counties throughout Alabama participated in the Seamless Admission Summer Bridge Program for Engineering Students. The influence of the AUM Summer Bridge Program on student achievement was notable; that is, the overall grade point average (GPA) for Summer Bridge participants was 2.92, compared to a 2.66 GPA for part-time freshmen AUM students in the School of Sciences.  The AUM Summer Bridge program helped to increase the retention of students from underrepresented groups that are enrolled in engineering programs; that is, all twenty students successfully completed their freshman year at various colleges and universities throughout Alabama.    A summer bridge program for high school graduates that are potential engineering majors is an excellent way to enhance the freshman year for engineering majors at colleges and universities across the nation. Such a program provides students with a new level of confidence as they enter the major, which requires more credit hours than most other majors. Moreover, such programs are excellent recruiting tools for engineering programs. It raises recruitment to another level inhigh schools by providing an opportunity for potential engineering majors to earn credit as well as pocket change during the summer prior to the freshman year.
