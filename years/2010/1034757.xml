<AbstractNarration>The Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will examine the actual impact of social capital on the speed and quality of early post-disaster housing recovery. This collaborative award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering, Americas Program and the long-term goal is to advance scientific knowledge on disaster resilience. The objective of this award is to enhance scientific knowledge concerning the role of social capital, as an important component of resilience, in the early recovery process following the January 12, 2010 Haiti earthquake in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area. To achieve our study objective, we have three specific aims: (1) Document the pre- and post-disaster social capital in three diverse Port-au-Prince communities; (2) Document the housing recovery process in three selected Port-au-Prince communities; and (3) Assess the impact of pre- and post-disaster social capital on the speed and quality of housing recovery in these communities. The selected communities are Pétionville (a high-income area), Delmas (a middle-income area), and Canapé Vert (mainly a squatter area). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will involve two waves of data collection (a baseline and a follow up) spaced six months apart in Haiti. In each wave, the project team will conduct in-depth semi-structured interviews of policy makers/practitioners and community leaders, and focus groups with community residents. In addition, a member of the team based in Haiti will conduct participant observation by attending community and public meetings on post-disaster housing recovery. Lastly, the team will review secondary sources, including post-disaster housing recovery plans, newspapers, minutes of public meetings, laws and regulations, published documents.  The study will capture time-sensitive and perishable longitudinal data on the recent earthquake in Haiti that will contribute to knowledge on early post-disaster housing recovery, social capital, and resilience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have the following outcomes.  First, the study will enable policy makers to establish long-term recovery policies that take into account each communities unique needs and capabilities rather than developing one size fits all policies to guide recovery interventions. Second, it will help identify the capabilities of selected Port-au-Prince communities. Third, the study will contribute to enhancing education and the research infrastructure at Florida International University, Arkansas State University, Boston University, and the Université d?Etat d?Haiti. Fourth, it will strengthen institutional ties between these universities. Fifth, the study will enhance participation of under-represented groups (e.g., women, Hispanics, Haitians, economically disadvantaged students) in disaster research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering, Americas Program.</AbstractNarration>

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS  During the project period, we conducted 12 focus groups with the residents of Delmas, P&eacute;tion Ville and Canap&eacute; Vert (Sample size=47 in the first round and 45 in the second round of focus groups) and 54 in-depth interviews with community leaders and policy makers (Haitian government officials and international aid agency representatives).

(2) Social capital plays dual roles in post-disaster shelter recovery of the displaced population in Haiti.

(3) Deep rooted historical mistrust in government (cognitive components of social capital), exacerbated by exclusion of displaced populations from recovery processes, results in their reluctance to fight for change to solve their shelter/housing problems. Such reluctance also has to do with the fact that displaced populations need to take care of their familiesÆ immediate needs (e.g., shelter, work, food, and education of their children) as well as negotiate issues of faith and spirituality.
