<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University proposes to hold an International Research Network Connections (IRNC) Program Workshop in Washington, DC. The Workshop will be held on July 13, 2010. The current planned location is the Ballston Hilton Hotel in Washington, DC. The workshop will bring together key international research and education network service providers and the IRNC Principal Investigators.  The group will discuss current and future network developments, future science activities and collaborations and how to work together to ensure that global network cyberinfrastructure is available to support and encourage existing and proposed science collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this workshop proposal is to develop a roadmap for project interoperation within the IRNC program and to expand this roadmap to the US interoperation with national research and education networks worldwide. The workshop will bring together network cyberinfrastructure practitioners with key science communities dependent on that infrastructure in a way that will lead to ongoing, sustainable global scale interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will set the initial agenda for US international networking efforts for the IRNC funded networks and will help insure smooth inter-operation among the funded projects and with the auxiliary services. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ IRNC Kickoff Workshops  Under the National Science FoundationÆs International Research Network Connections program, Indiana University, International Networks at Indiana University, put on two workshops in support of furthering the collaborative efforts among the programÆs nine Primary Investigators and their supporting organizations.      The first workshop was held on July 13, 2010 in Washington DC. This workshop brought together key international research and education network service providers and network users and scientists. The group discussed current and future network developments, future science activities and collaborations and how to work together to ensure that global network cyberinfrastructure is available to support and encourage existing and proposed science collaborations.  This was the first meeting of the complete group of  IRNC investigators.  The meeting was supplimented by that addition of several international scientists.  IRNC PI plans and scientists presentations are available at the URL below.     The second workshop was held in Washington DC on October 6, 2011.  This workshop followed up on the first workshop.   IRNC investigators outlined accomplishments for Year 1 of the program and presented plans for Year 2.   IRNC investigator accomplishments and plans are detailed in the sceond URL presented below.
