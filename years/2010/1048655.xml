<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor Sarah Green and colleagues Lanrong Bi, Shiyue Fang, Haiying Liu and Martin Thompson from Michigan Technological University will acquire a benchtop matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) DNA sequencing using solid phase capturable di-deoxynucleotides, (b) oligonucleotide purification and block gene expression, (c) design and synthesis of highly water-soluble fluorescent conjugated glycopolymers and glycodendrimers, (d) dendrimers with multiply-bonded dimetallic cores, and (e) analysis of free and glycoprotein-bound glycan structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometers (MS) are used to identify the chemical composition of a sample by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) is a technique for preparing the sample to be ionized by a laser before injection into the mass spectrometer. The time of flight (TOF) mass analyzer has high sensitivity and mass accuracy to assist the analyses and interpretation of the resultant data. This open access instrument will be available for training students in this analytical tool. It will be used by undergraduate and graduate students in research and in laboratory instruction courses and in outreach activities. It will also enhance collaborations with research groups outside the department that use chemical methods, including those in Forestry, Biological Sciences, Chemical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
