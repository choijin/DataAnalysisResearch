<AbstractNarration>This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of how best to use information from next-generation Earth System Models (EaSMs) to improve climate-related decisions.  The project will explore the use of climate information from two sources:  high-resolution, dynamically downscaled, regional projections from Atmospheric Ocean General Circulation Models and estimates of extreme climate behaviors from ensembles of runs from Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity.  Decision-support applications in biodiversity and in water resource management will provide real-world experimental test beds to examine the value to decision makers of this climate information at alternative levels of spatial and temporal resolution and with alternative characterizations of uncertainty.  Field evaluations and psychological experiments will formally measure the contributions of the alternative types of climate information towards better decisions.  These three lines of research will combine to address two questions that are central to the effective production and use of information from EaSMs:  (1) What is the value of climate information with increased spatial and temporal resolution?  (2) What is the value of imprecise and/or deeply uncertain information about potentially extreme behaviors of the climate system?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will make significant contributions towards the EaSM interdisciplinary grand challenge by providing concrete evidence as to what types of climate information and which characterizations of uncertainty prove most valuable to those facing climate-related decisions.  The nation's investment in next-generation EaSMs aims not only to improve fundamental scientific understanding of the climate and related systems, but also to improve decision makers' abilities to proactively plan for the impacts of climate variability and change.  Decades of research on decision making and decision support confirm that merely providing additional information in complicated situations such as those posed by climate change does not necessarily improve the quality of the decisions.  The results from this research may prove valuable in guiding those designing future EaSMs and the information systems that support them.  In addition, the project aims to (a) improve methods for incorporating climate information into biodiversity and water management decisions; (b)  advance the science of decision support, in particular the understanding of information needs, characterizations of uncertainty, and the evaluation of decision support activities; and (c) help train the multidisciplinary workforce the nation requires to respond to climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When providing climate information to support adaptation decisions, is it best to offer the single, most accurate projection; a wide range of less accurate projections; or some mix?  This project conducted comparative case studies in the areas of biodiversity conservation and water supply management, coupled with laboratory experiments on the psychology of decision making, to help address such questions.   Many considerations affect the best balance among a larger or smaller number of high or less high-resolution projections.  Both producers and users of climate information often express the need for high spatial resolution climate information.  Adaptation managers often seek high spatial resolution climate data because it is required by their impacts models, for instance the models that estimate future species habitat in a changing climate. In addition, high-spatial resolution maps can facilitate communication with decision makers. While either statistical or dynamical downscaling can provide high-resolution projections for adaptation managers, climate scientists often favor the latter because, with its greater fidelity to fine scale geography and physical processes, it can offer higher accuracy.  In addition, a wider range of projections, derived from a diverse set of climate models, can provide a more expansive representation of uncertainty, but it also imposes various costs. One such cost is computational. In this regard, statistical downscaling is much less computationally intensive than dynamic. But the costs of using a larger ensemble of climate information can also include incoporating lower confidence information in the ensemble and increased cognitive load on decision makers.   To address such questions, this project compared decision support applications for biodiversity conservation and water supply management in California, each using alternative ensembles of climate information. Each such ensemble had different numbers and combinations of high and low resolution climate projections generated from the NARCCAP (North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program), CMIP3, and CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects) ensembles.  We find that using different sets of climate information can lead to different rankings of climate adaptation strategies. In particular, in both examples using a single, very high spatial-resolution projection leads to different policy recommendations than using an ensemble of many climate projections, some with lower spatial-resolution.  These differences arise both because: 1) the high-resolution projection has different properties than the mean of the lower resolution ensemble and 2) the ensemble with many projections spans a larger range of uncertainty than the single projection.   The decision support methods in this project suggest means to quantify the importance of using a broad ensemble as opposed to a single high-resolution projection, and the extent to which the difference is due to the difference in the properties of the projections and/or to a wider range of uncertainty.  The importance of these two factors varies between the water supply management and biodiversity applications, and among the different species considered in the latter.  This study suggests no a priori way to determine which factors are most important in any particular application.  Lacking such a priori knowledge, the results of this project suggest that climate-related decision support applications should stress test proposed adaptation plans over a wide range of climate projections.  In particular, we found that conservation policies should consider the worst case as well as the best case futures, such that decisions can reflect those bounds of uncertainty.  Our results indicate that uses of averages (e.g. average values of climate projection ensembles) may lead to ineffective long-term policies, especially for already endangered species that have already been greatly reduced in numbers or range s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
