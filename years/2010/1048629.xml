<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor John Dawson and colleagues Richard Adams, Sophya Garashchuk, Vitaly Rassolov and Linda Shimizu from University of South Carolina will acquire a computer cluster. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) chemistry of transition metal cluster complexes, (b) effects of zero-point energy on reactivity of methane, (c) spin properties of aromatic radicals, (d) porous nanoreactors from macrocyclic urea, and (e) synthesis and characterization of new complex photoluminescent oxides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cluster of fast, modern computers is vital to serving the computing needs of active research departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing. The computing resource will permit research, research training, and research outreach opportunities the neighboring colleges such as Claflin University, USC Aiken, Newberry College, Allen University and Presbyterian College.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chemical modeling and computations have recently become valuable educational and research tools for improving our fundamental understanding of structure, bonding and reactivity of chemical systems ranging from individual molecules to complex nanophase materials.  Such insight is essential for planning and conducting research and for the rapid discovery and development of novel compounds, materials and technologies in chemical fields.    With the help of the NSF award CHE-1048629, the Department has acquired a midsize high-performance computational cluster equipped with state-of-the-art computational chemistry software, which allows the faculty and their students to better plan experiments and explain their results. The computational cluster is currently used by ten research groups spanning organic, polymer, inorganic and physical chemistry within the department. The cluster is also made available to faculty and students at eight undergraduate institutions in South Carolina in order to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the scientific process.   The research findings facilitated by this award range from design of advanced catalysts, to new materials for energy applications, to the development of new modeling tools as reported in about 30 publications and 80 presentations.   Some examples of the findings made with the help of this award:    (1) Simulations of collisions of hydrogen and deuterium with graphene in the Garashchuk group demonstrate selectivity in adsorption which may be useful for H/D isotope separation and, more broadly, to assess nuclear quantum effects on chemical reactions unfolding within complex molecular environments (Fig. 1).     (2) Adams et al. have discovered a new binuclear mechanism for the formation of carbon-hydrogen bonds in aromatic compounds. Computational analyses have revealed the nature of the bonding of a key intermediate in the transformation (Fig. 2).     (3) L. S. Shimizu and collaborators have demonstrated control of photoreactivity by placing the reagents into porous molueclar structures.  A greater understanding of the factors that control diffusion and  reaction in confinement leads to the development of better  catalysts (Fig.3).    The computational cluster is also actively used for education:   (i) students and researchers receive training in high-performance computing and use of computational chemistry tools; (ii) education of   chemistry majors now incorporates computational chemistry labs as recommended by the American Chemical Society. Moreover, the award spurred improvements in cyber-infrastructure and support of high-performance computing at the University of South Carolina.
