<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal 1057547&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the exposure pathways, fate, and risk of nano-silver in the natural environment.  The objective of this proposal is to address two hypothesis:  (1) nano-silver can undergo complete reactive dissolution in the environment through kinetically limited oxidation processes. Nano-silver will be non persistent in particle form in environmental compartments containing dissolved oxygen, but persistent in anoxic compartments or in biological matrices containing reducing agents. (2) Reactive dissolution rates will show significant dependence on nAg particle size, surface state (ligands, coatings) and media composition, requiring detailed experimentation in complex media and biological tissue to make useful predictions for life-cycle risk assessment. The project will proceed in four tasks: (1) development of a first generation model of sources and materials flows of nano-silver in the environment accounting for dynamic dissolution behavior, (2) detailed kinetics and mechanisms of nanosilver dissolution, accounting for the effects of stabilizing ligands attached to the particle surfaces, coatings, composition of the near-particle environment, and surface oxidation state, (3) silver distribution and nanoparticle persistence in biological compartments, through experiments using the organism Xenopus laevis, an amphibian used as a model sentinel species in aquatic systems that is highly vulnerable to environmental pollutants and well suited to the study of nanosilver biodistribution and persistence, and (4) integrated model development and analysis to differential nano-risk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This proposal will find solutions to some of the toxicity issues as a result of nano-silver-containing products are washed, abraded, or discarded, silver can enter the environment either as nanoparticles, nanoparticle aggregates, or soluble ions.  Silver is reported to be highly toxic to some aquatic organisms, and as an antibiotic may also damage or alter beneficial microbial communities in the environment. Silver is also known to bioaccumulate in phytoplankton and some marine invertebrates and has been shown to be highly toxic to zebrafish embryos. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts This project addresses the potential environmental impacts of one of the highest production volume nanotechnology products on the current market: nano-silver. The main result of this project will be a conceptual model of nano-silver exposure pathways, allowing estimation of the location, forms, and concentrations of silver in a variety of environmental compartments. The work will provide policy-relevant information to help define the "differential nano-risk" defined as the extent to which nano-silver has the potential to pose environmental risks beyond those easily estimable from source terms and prior experience and data on conventional silver forms. This is a key regulatory issue that governs whether nAg requires special consideration as a nano-risk or can be treated as a conventional Ag ion release. Finally, insight into Ag+ release kinetics and mechanisms will and aid in the development of controlled release formulations that optimize the use of nAg and avoid material waste and eukaryotic toxicity as a side effect of antibacterial medical products.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project, Exposure Pathways, Dissolution Kinetics, and Fate of Nano-Silver in the Environment, was to provide information to help assess and manage the environmental and health risks associated with the use of nano-silver in consumer and medical products.  The widespread use of nano-silver as an effective antibacterial agent offers societal benefits, but its toxicity and risk to environmental organisms and humans is not fully understood.  This project was able to show that silver nanoparticles spontaneously react with dissolved sulfide species under conditions relevant to the natural environment to produce silver sulfide, a solid chemical compound with a very low solubility and reduced toxicity relative to the original synthesized nano-silver.  The reaction was shown to occur only in environments containing oxygen, and to be sensitive to fluid pH as well as the presence of natural organic matter in the environment.   This reaction is believed to be a type of natural detoxification pathway for nano-silver that is released to the environment through use, washing or disposal of nano-silver containing consumer and medical products.  These results were reported to the pubic in 2011 in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.  The project also extended the techniques developed to study silver transformations in the natural environment to those occurring in the human body.  The project showed that silver nanoparticles undergo profound biochemical transformations, including dissolution in the stomach, binding to sulfur-containing proteins in the blood, and reduction back to metallic nanoparticles through photo-reduction in light-effected regions of the skin.  This work proposes a new conceptual model for nano-silver behavior in that body that is useful for understanding the causes and development argyria, the medical condition involving severe skin discoloration that can accompany high-dose exposure to silver or nano-silver.  This work was reported in 2012 in the scientific journal ACS Nano.  At the end of the project period, the techniques and concepts developed for nano-silver were applied to nano-copper, which is another emerging material used for as an antibacterial agent and conductive ink. Environmental and safety issues are particularly important for copper-based nanomaterials because of their potential large-scale use and their significant toxicity reported from in vitro studies. This study showed that copper oxide nanoparticles also undergo profound chemical transformations under conditions relevant to living systems and the natural environment. Copper oxide nanoparticles dissolve at low-pH but not at neutral pH in pure water.  Copper oxide nanoparticles also undergo significant dissolution in some biological fluids where amino acids and other biological molecules assist in the release and solubilization of copper ions.  Copper oxide nanoparticles also undergo sulfidation to form copper sulfide, which are found to be much less toxic than the original copper oxide.  Similar to nano-silver, the reaction of nano-copper with sulfide species in the environment or human body can serve as a natural detoxification process that reduces its environmental and health risks.   This work was reported in 2013 in the scientific journal ACS Nano.  This project made broader societal impacts beyond basic science by informing national policy on nanotechnology regulation industrial safety practices.  The principle investigator presented results at industry-government-university workshops on the safe development of nanotechnology and at federal government committees examining research priorities in nanotechnology safety.  The project trained and graduated a woman Ph.D. chemist, who is now working at U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.
