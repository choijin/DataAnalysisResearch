<AbstractNarration>The  application of controlled quantum dynamics to computational problems has been one of the most  important developments in information science in the last two decades. This project uses  optically trapped neutral atom qubits for implementing quantum logic operations. The experimental approach uses  laser cooled neutral Rb atoms stored in a linear array of optically resolvable trapping sites. Focused optical beams are used to manipulate the quantum states of the atoms. Two-atom interactions are turned on and off by exciting the atoms to high lying Rydberg states that interact strongly via a dipole-dipole coupling. In this way single and two-qubit gates are implemented, and used to create entangled states. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work are twofold. First, this research contributes towards realizing the dream of a large scale quantum processor that exceeds the capabilities of conventional classical computers. The availability of such a device would have far reaching impact on numerical mathematics, information security, and problems in the simulation of quantum systems related to the development of new, technologically valuable materials. Second, the research program will contribute to the training of students and postdoctoral researchers for careers in science and engineering.  People from  diverse backgrounds will be educated and trained in modern experimental science, as well as in abstract concepts that bridge the boundary between physics and information science. Training will occur via curriculum enrichments, and through direct participation in the University based research program. We will also inform the local community about the importance of physics to information technology, and the new developments in the area of quantum information science.  Outreach to the public will be facilitated by public visiting days at the Physics department, laboratory tours, and faculty visits to local schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The scientific focus of this project was development of neutral atom based techniques for quantum information processing (QIP). QIP is an alternative to classical information processing that encodes information in objects that show quantum mechanical behavior and can store larger amounts of data than classical systems.  We perform experiments with quantum bits (qubits) encoded in single atoms that have been laser cooled to microKelvin temperatures and are held in microscopic optical traps. During this one year project we worked on two important aspects of QIP with neutral atoms.  First we worked on ideas that will enable single atoms to be trapped deterministically, without relying on random statistics as has been the case in earlier experiments. We achieved a single atom trapping probability of close to 60% and believe this can be further improved in future experiments.  Second, we performed detailed calculations to predict the ultimate limit of how accurate a neutral atom quantum gate could be. We find an error limit of about 0.001, in other words a probability of error when performing a basic quantum logic operation between two atomic qubits of 0.1%. This is small enough that it should be possible to build a large quantum computer using many neutral atom qubits.  In future reseach we plan to work on demonstrating improved single atom loading and quantum logic gates with errors close to the theoretical limit.
