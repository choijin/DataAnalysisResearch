<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program at the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Vincent P. Conticello of Emory University. This project focuses on the synthesis and structural characterization of collagen-mimetic fibrils derived from self-assembly of designed peptides. Collagen is the main structural component of the extracellular matrix and is responsible for guiding the development and maintaining the structural integrity of tissues in human systems. Currently, collagen derivatives for medical applications are drawn primarily from animal sources, however the development of synthetic collagen derivatives is a highly desirable objective, particularly if the chemical, biological, and mechanical properties of the materials could be tailored to maximize their efficacy with respect to a given function. This proposal evaluates the potential for the creation of synthetic collagen fibers on the basis of structural considerations uncovered from analysis of model collagen peptides. The results of these studies will be of interest not only in generating synthetic collagenous materials that mimic native structural proteins, but also for the design of novel structures with functional properties that exceed those of the materials currently available from animal sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused at the interface of chemistry, biology, materials science, and nanotechnology and provides training for graduate and undergraduate students in inter-disciplinary research in a technologically significant area. Undergraduate students are selected from among participants that are involved in the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience at Emory (SURE) program. SURE is organized and administrated out of the Emory College Center for Science Education (ECCSE), a satellite university center responsible for the promotion of undergraduate access, interest, and participation in the sciences. In addition, NSF funding provides support to high-school chemistry teachers for six weeks during the summer. Each teacher will spend time on research and on translating the research experience into a lesson plan for high school students or colleague teachers.</AbstractNarration>
