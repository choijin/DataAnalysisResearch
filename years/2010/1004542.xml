<AbstractNarration>This award, made to Harvard University, is supported by the Department of Defense ASSURE program and the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences. Harvard will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students each year, for the summers of 2010-2012. The scientific focus of the program is cellular and molecular biology, and students conduct research in cell and developmental biology, microbiology, neurobiology, biochemistry, genetics, and virology.  The objectives of this REU are to: (a) increase knowledge of basic biological research; (b) develop students' interest in pursuing research careers; (c) enhance related skills necessary for success; and (d) provide post-program advising and networking. In addition to their research projects, students participate in weekly student-faculty research, and in a weekly career development series, which covers such topics as choosing graduate programs, completing successful applications, and interviewing.  Special skills sessions on critical reading of the literature and strategies for preparing for GRE exams are also included.  Ethics and the responsible conduct of research topics cover rigorous experimental documentation, research fraud and misconduct, and ethical issues related to lab life.  Students participate in a peer advising/mentoring program with current graduate students and are provided additional opportunities to meet other research faculty and graduate students in both academic and social settings. Participants are recruited from a nation-wide pool, with particular emphasis on recruiting students who are interested in careers in research, members of under-represented minority groups, and those with limited research opportunities on their home campuses.  Selection is based on statements of interest, recent academic achievement and preparation in science courses, recommendations, and some previous research experience. Several mechanisms of formative and summative evaluation are employed, and will include an assessment tool common to REU programs.  Program alumni receive twice-yearly newsletters, contact information about each other, and open access to continued advising and counseling by the REU program director, their individual research advisors, and their peer mentors. These follow-up activities facilitate effective tracking.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award provided financial support for the Summer Honors Undergraduate Research Program (SHURP), a 10 week summer program for non-Harvard undergraduates to do research at Harvard Medical School.  The project objectives were to 1) increase students' knowledge of basic biological research, 2) develop students' interest in pursuing research careers, 3) enhance related skills necessary for success, and 4) provide post-program advising and networking.  The activities that were employed to achieve these objectives were 1) a 10 week mentored research experience in labs at Harvard Medical School; 2) weekly career development and research discussions; 3) peer mentoring; and 4) a bi-annual newsletter sent to alumni as well as different program directors across the country.  In addition to research and the career and research discussions,  students also attended a national conference where they presented their  research.  The participants for the program were undergraduates from schools across the country.  Applicants were selected based on research experience, academic record, personal statement and letters of recommendation.  Special emphasis was placed on identifying students from groups underrepresented in the sciences and those with limited access to research at their home institutes.   During the period of this award a total of 24 students funded by NSF participated in the program.  Two students returned to the program for a second summer.    Among the 19 students who have completed their undergraduate degree, 17 are pursuing either an MD, MD/PhD or PhD and the remaining two are pursuing additional post-baccalaureate research training.
