<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for developing a series of chemically-stable conductive polymer nanocomposites (cPNCs) to tackle a central problem, corrosion of conductive metals, facing metallic electronic devices.  Two strategies will be carried out.  One is to use conductive fillers to make insulating polymers conductive. Two different types of conductive filling materials, soft and hard, in three combinations will be explored. The commercial hard nanofillers will be modified for better compatibility with the polymer matrix. The conductive polymer soft nanofillers (particle and fiber) and conductive polymer coated particles will be fabricated.   The other strategy is to use the doped conductive polymer as the hosting matrix. The nanofillers will introduce the desired functionalities.  Different filler shapes will be utilized to disentangle the intrinsic properties of the cPNCs. The fundamental science of the project will involve developing composites preparation techniques, manipulating the component and structure of the nanofillers and their surface characterization, disclosing the properties under static and dynamic conditions, and correlating their properties to the intrinsic structure especially under mechanical dynamic situation.  The dynamic performance of the cPNCs will be predicted from the percolation theory under different mechanical deformation conditions and compared with experimental results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will make a significant impact to the rapidly developing field of polymer-based conductive nanostructural materials. The cPNCs either from combining different conductive nanofillers into insulating polymer or from utilizing the conductive polymer matrix bring prospects of organic-based devices with reduced weight density, increased integration, and multi-functionality. The collaboration with industries will facilitate the possible commercialization of the newly developed cPNCs. The results of the proposed work will create many noteworthy opportunities for education and training. The education of underrepresented groups will be highly emphasized during this project. K-12 education, curriculum development, and international outreach will also be established and improved.</AbstractNarration>

A reduced viscosity was observed in 1.0 wt% Fe@C/epoxy resin liquid suspension samples and the viscosity was increased with further increasing the Fe@C loading. The dynamic storage and loss modulii were studied together with the glass transition temperature (Tg) being obtained from the peak of tand.

The tensile strength observed in the PNCs with 1.0 wt% Gr/Fe@Fe2O3 is 58% higher than that of the pure epoxy, and was attributed to the high stiffness of Gr.
