<AbstractNarration>Lake Victoria is the largest freshwater lake in Africa and the second largest in the world. The lake's watershed is home to more than 30 million people, a region with one of the highest population growth rates in the world.  The watershed faces a myriad of environmental problems that seriously impact the quality of its waters and hence the availability of fish and other resources. Increasing population pressure, fisheries mismanagement, poor waste management, lack of adequate sewage treatment, introduction of exotic species, inappropriate agricultural practices, unregulated small scale gold mining, unchecked industrial activities, deforestation and intense grazing pressures within the lake's watershed have had repercussions such as excessive sedimentation, eutrophication, oxygen depletion (hypoxia), contaminated drinking water supply, and an increased incidence of water-associated diseases (e.g., schistosomiasis, dysentery, and cholera).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit.  This US-Africa planning visit will support the travel of three senior researchers from the US to the Lake Victoria region to meet with East African scientists from Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda including Prof. J. Machiwa (University of Dar es Salaam - Tanzania), Dr. Nicholas Lwambo (NMRI - Tanzania), Prof. Daniel Olag (Univiversity of Nairobi - Kenya), Dr. John Gichuki, (Kenya Marine Fisheries Research), Dr. Fredrick Muyodi (Makerere University - Uganda), and Dr. J. Balirwa (Fisheries Resources Research Institute - Uganda). The visit will help the US scientists establish long term collaborations with scientists in the African great lakes region, an area that is well suited for study in many NSF priority areas including climate change science, biodiversity, and water use/water dynamics. Discussions will focus on future collaborative projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. New collaborative projects will aim to synthesize new and extant data sets into a coherent model that both describes the synergistic effects of anthropogenic pressures including climate change on the local environment and predicts the effects of abatement measures versus continued inaction on the productivity and sustainability of ecosystem services provided by this large tropical lake.  Understanding these issues has the potential to improve the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of this vulnerable ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

Stony Brook University, New York  2.      University of Connecticut, Connecticut     We discussed research priorities, educational needs, and strategies for submission of a full research proposal by U.S. scientists to the National Science Foundation (NSF). We also examined possible study sites, requirements and logistics for data collection including research vessels and laboratory space and equipment, teaching facilities, and logistical matters ranging from transportation, housing and catering for the participants, and governmental requirements.

There were some differences in approaches to similar problems from one country to another, for example, Kenyan fishermen were forming cooperatives but that approach was not working well in Tanzania. In addition to individual and mutual research priorities, we discussed issues related to capacity building and economic development.  Research Priority Areas:  As a study site and natural laboratory, the Lake Victoria watershed provides a tremendous opportunity for research first because although scattered among research groups and institutions in all three countries which border the Lake, there is a significant amount of basic information on topics ranging from fish populations and fisheries, invasive species, nutrient inputs and levels, human diseases, to the interactions of people who depend on the Lake for their livelihood. Much of this information has been obtained through external grants to individuals and research institutes to address specific research questions and through collaborations with foreign scientific groups from the U.S., Europe, or Japan. Funding for research and institutional infrastructure from the governments of all three countries was universally minimal. Nevertheless and in spite of the limited resources, the scientists we met had all taken advantage of any and all external funding opportunities to produce high quality research and make fundamental contributions.  Additionally there was little ancillary data to explain observations of specific changes or trends in for example fish stocks or snail distributions.  Basic information on topics including mixing rates and Lake circulation, residence times and turnover rates, the influence of weather and climate on physical, chemical, and biological processes, and the balance between atmospheric and riverine inputs of nutrients was either lacking or not consistently obtained.  This lack of fundamental data hampers efforts to predict or model impacts of climate change. Apart from the International Decade for East African Lakes (IDEAL), there has not been an overarching interdisciplinary research campaign. We found all the groups to be incredibly knowledgeable and prepared to tackle many of the questions they raised. Limited governmental support is the principle reason why some of the topics described below have not heretofore been addressed.
