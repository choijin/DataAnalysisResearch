<AbstractNarration>The synthesis, release and actions of steroid hormones such as estrogens, progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol are vital for normal daily living.  For example, the absence of cortisol production is incompatible with life, and insufficient estrogen production in women leads to hot flashes, osteoporosis and infertility.  In addition, steroids promote the growth of some cancers. The purpose of this conference is to bring together world-renowned scientists studying the effects of steroid hormones in the brain and other organ systems (heart, pancreas, gonads, colon, etc.). The overarching goal is to develop broad new concepts about the way in which steroids have immediate impact on individual cells in various organ systems as well as long term effects on growth and development of organ systems. This meeting will not only foster new collaborations among the experts in the field but will also provide a venue for junior scientists of diverse background to interact and collaborate with these expert leaders. Moreover, the FASEB conference will foster the development of novel systems level biological approaches toward understanding the communication networks (via blood, nerves, etc.) involved in steroid actions throughout the body.  The cross-talk between this distinguished group of scientists, which include marine biologists that work on simple marine organisms and physicians that treat patients, will allow the development of common research approaches to better understand endocrine systems.</AbstractNarration>

The purpose of these conferences was to build new bridges and create collaborations in the field of steroid hormone (e.g., estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone) signaling.  To achieve this goal, the meetings brought together established leaders in the field, up and coming junior scientists, and a cadre of trainees, all of whom spent the entire meeting working, eating, and socializing together.  Overall, more than 60 scientists participated in these conferences &ndash; a size suitable to create diversity and breadth, but still small enough to promote substantial cross-talk and personal interactions among faculty and fellows.     The meetings consisted of seven scientific sessions that included twenty-eight established investigators as well as a young investigator symposium that included eight invited trainees. These talks were given by a wide array of international speakers from North and South America, as well as Europe and Asia.  Posters from scientists all over the world were presented as well.     The subject material was diverse and included nearly every aspect steroid hormone signaling.  Examples include steroid hormone effects on both male and female reproduction, heart function, brain function, and cell biology.  After every presentation, discussion was lively and formative, and, by the end of the meetings, all participants felt that they had both learned a great deal of new and important information.  In addition, the meetings served as a vehicle to create new collaborations between trainees and both junior and senior scientists.  In fact, after the meeting, organizers received several emails from grateful trainees and young faculty (see Table 1), prompting them to begin planning the next meeting in 2015.  Finally, over 15 participants, mostly trainees and young faculty, published papers based on their talks presented at the meeting in the prominent hormone journal called STEROIDs (Steroids 76:821, 2011 and Steroids 78:528, 2013), thus leaving an everlasting record of this occasion in the scientific literature.

It was a great opportunity for a junior scientist like me to present my research in front of some of the most prominent scientists in the field of rapid steroid signaling. The conference was highly beneficial to me as I was able to interact with several senior scientists.  I learned a great deal f...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
