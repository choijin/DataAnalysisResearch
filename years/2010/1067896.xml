<AbstractNarration>This project has two goals: 1) to increase the number of students who are&lt;br/&gt;U.S. citizens or permanent residents and have a STEM major and 2) to increase the number of students who graduate or transfer to four-year institutions to complete their STEM baccalaureate degrees.  To help achieve these goals strong emphasis is placed on academic excellence through activities offered to keep the students engaged and participating at a high level. These activities include research experiences, civic engagement, supplemental instruction, first-year experiences, cohort advising, faculty mentoring, STEM workshops and seminars. The broad array of disciplines represented by STEM faculty who can assist students as advisers, the variety of articulation agreements with four-year institutions, and the selection of business and university collaborations available to engage students in research and internships provide students with a broad intellectual base from which to draw.</AbstractNarration>
