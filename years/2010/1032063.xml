<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Grid Connected Advanced Power Electronics Systems (GRAPES) studies conducted by the University of Arkansas site (lead) and the University of South Carolina site. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-507.  The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical merit of this project is in advancing the state of the art in fully-integrated, fullywide-bandgap, fully-isolated power electronic converters based on GaN. This will produce new state-of-the-art boundaries in switching speeds, volumetric reduction, power density, temperature of operation, efficiency, and immunity to interference. Eventually, these technologies will be applied to grid-connected systems. The outcome from this fundamental effort has the potential for transforming how power electronic systems are designed for numerous smart-grid and power converter applications. The team of participating university faculty is very well qualified to conduct the project and they are supported by capable and knowledgeable professionals from their industry members. It is a creative proposal that is well conceived in that it takes a practical, proof-of-concept approach to the problem. Both universities are well equipped with excellent facilities to perform their respective research tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project has the potential to make a huge societal impact if their approach is proven successful for the development of more integrated, less expensive and more efficient power electronics for converter and power grid applications. The research plan engages graduate students in the research effort and will have an influence on undergraduate students as well. Many of the participating students are expected to come from underrepresented minority groups. The research results will be distributed broadly and communicated directly to key industry representatives.</AbstractNarration>
