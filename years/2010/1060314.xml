<AbstractNarration>This project is building upon a prior S-STEM project that had a significant impact on improving STEM enrollments and student diversity, and further improving its effectiveness. Specifically, the project is offering 25 scholarships of $5,200 each per year over a four year period. It is expanding the existing mentoring program, including activities that facilitate career exploration, particularly through a self-selected Experiential Learning Module, where students pursue their interests in academic and career development. It is enhancing the effectiveness of individualized student mentoring through a personalized, data-driven approach based on academic progress, career interests, and predictive information collected at the time of matriculation. Finally, it is developing an online application that determines students' level of interest in STEM fields. This helps select and advise students interested in engineering and science.  The project especially recruits women and members of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project have intellectual merit, particularly the development of the data-driven approach to mentoring and its ability to predict and improve student success in STEM fields. The assessment data include responses to nationally-normed Assessing Women in Engineering surveys. That allows comparison of data with other institutions and facilitates dissemination of program results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include continued growth of STEM graduates, including underrepresented groups, at the university. They constitute a pool of technical talent for the northwestern Pennsylvania region and beyond. The model developed, the mentoring program, and the data-driven approach to student advising are transferable and adaptable to other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Objectives  The objectives were to provide scholarships and a mentoring program to support and retain students in STEM majors.  The mentoring program used a variety of academic activities to assist scholars in the creation of their academic plan, optimize their academic performance, and expose them to a wide range of opportunities.  An Experiential Learning Module (ELM) structured the scholars? creation of an academic plan, career exploration, and focused in-depth experience in their academic fields. Examples include research, internships, and community outreach projects.   Scholar Description  Scholars submitted a short essay about their STEM experiences and goals with their application.  Members of the faculty advisory committee reviewed the applications and selected the recipients.  A total of $520,000 in scholarships were awarded, with scholars receiving up to $17,600 over four years.  Funding was not received in time to recruit a freshman class for 2011.  From 2012 through 2015 there were 43 freshmen, 23 in engineering and 20 in the sciences.  One was male and four were minorities.  Thirty-two upperclassmen (15 in engineering and 17 in science) were already participating in the program, for a total of 75 scholars over the five years of the grant; four without scholarships. Ten scholars left the program as a result of a poor GPA, change of major, or transfer (7 in science and 3 in engineering).  Thirty-seven scholars graduated; 19 in engineering and 18 in science.  There were 28 active scholars at the end of the grant.  Program  A one-credit course was created for the mentoring program and activities.  Mentors, who were upperclassmen in the program, led a variety of group programs and worked with the scholars individually.  Each mentor was responsible for 3-5 scholars and 7-10 upperclassmen.  Freshmen activities were designed to assist in their college transition in the fall semester and academic career planning in the spring semester.  In the fall semester, the sophomores created an Individual Activity to address an academic need, such as researching options for their major or a minor, summer internships, graduate schools, or job opportunities.  This project prepared scholars for their ELM in the spring semester.   ELMs consisted of an outline of scholars? semester plans, listing activities in one, some, or all of the following categories:  Learning Development and Academic Success; Academic Progress toward Graduation; Career Planning; Preparation for Employment or Graduate School; or, Community Involvement.  The scholars met individually with the program supervisor as often as needed to design their plans, review their progress, and/or modify their activities.  Some scholars focused on the spring semester.  Others defined their long-term goal (to be achieved by graduation) and worked in reverse to determine what would need to be completed during the current semester.  Some scholars listed topics while others created a detailed outline of tasks to be completed during the semester.  Most listed activities in three or four categories.  The most common activities were:  meet with instructor weekly; research minors; review "Recommended Action Plan" with advisor; revise resume; job shadow; apply for internship; and, improve interview skills.  An Open Forum was created to bring faculty, staff, company representatives and scholars together. The scholars met with a variety of people to ask questions about majors, minors, internships, study abroad, and career preparation.  Additional social activities included field trips and receptions at the end of each semester.  A faculty advisory committee assisted in scholar advising, programs and activities, the ELM, and the design and review of the grant.  Outcomes  In the final year, six of the nine seniors, three of the four juniors, and four of the eight sophomores had participated in internships or research.  For all but two scholars, this was for more than one semester.  One scholar became involved in research during her second semester and was part of a presentation at the Plant and Animal Genome Conference at the beginning of her fourth semester.  Another scholar was an intern for Apple during the summer after both her freshmen and sophomore years.  An engineering student began an internship with GE Transportation during her fourth semester which continued throughout her college career, ending with a job offer that included participation in their Edison Engineering Development program leading to a Masters in Mechanical Engineering.  Of the 37 graduates, 25 reported that they had confirmed plans before graduation.  This included 15 who had accepted job offers, some at the beginning of their senior year.  Ten continued their education in graduate school.  The program benefited the scholars in quantitative and qualitative ways.  Analysis of predicted and actual grades versus a control group indicated that the scholars outperformed the non-scholars consistently, demonstrating the value of the mentorship program.   Surveys showed that the mentors were a valuable resource for the scholars.  Scholars provided feedback on the program that indicated its importance in their development and success.  An effective program by any measure!          Last Modified: 10/27/2016       Submitted by: Oladipo Onipede]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
