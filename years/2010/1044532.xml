<AbstractNarration>The project is implementing a novel approach to integrate coursework in four semesters of the core mechanical engineering curriculum using a long-term design project requiring tools from several courses and focusing on the drive train for a hybrid vehicle. The investigators hypothesize that this extended activity will substantially enhance student learning, particularly with regard to knowledge retention across courses and student problem solving and design skills.  In the evaluation effort, both knowledge retention and design skills will be measured and compared with the group of students taking the courses in the year before the intervention. Dissemination activities include posting material with an interactive lessons learned component, faculty workshops at national meetings, conference presentations, and journal publications. Owing to the modular nature of this work, the approach can be easily adapted to other institutions, whether they be small predominantly undergraduate institutions or large research universities.  Broader impacts include the wide dissemination efforts and the emphasis in the curriculum on the new hybrid technology that will meet industry's need for graduates with these skills.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ensuring retention of critical engineering concepts can be quite challenging.  Hearing a variation on "but we never learned this!" is an all-too-frequent experience for most instructors, and many students feel justified in jettisoning all knowledge of a subject once the final examination is past.  Subjects that are separate in the curriculum, such as thermodynamics and mechanical design, are integrated in practice, since thermal and mechanical systems must function cohesively in real mechanical systems.  With this in mind, we have implemented a novel, potentially transformative approach to integrating coursework through five semesters of the core mechanical engineering curriculum.  Before and after testing was conducted to assess a) change in retention between courses and b) change in student problem-solving and design skills.  The design project &ndash; a bench-scale hybrid powertrain &ndash; is completed by students in modules spanning six courses in the mechanical engineering curriculum.  The six courses begin in the second semester of the sophomore year, and end in the second semester of the senior year: a span of three years.  The hybrid powertrain is very similar to the one used in a first-generation Toyota Prius.  In the benchtop design, power is supplied to a load using an air motor and DC motor.  The contributions of the air motor and DC motor are combined using the planetary gearset.  Power is stored for later use (during light parts of the load cycle) by the generator.  The strategy employed by the controller is to keep the output shaft turning at a constant speed, despite variations in load.  It does this by regulating the 1) air flow to the air motor, 2) the electrical flow to the DC motor and 3) the rate of charging in the generator.  Over the course of five semesters, the students designed, fabricated and assessed the components in the benchtop hybrid powertrain.  Each module was designed to be stand-alone; that is, students could implement the Electric Motor Speed Control module without having completed the Planetary Gearset module.  But completing all the modules in sequence leads to a much deeper, broader understanding of the field of mechanical engineering.  The overall goal of the design project is to produce a hybrid powertrain that drives the "wheels" at constant speed under varying load, in a similar fashion to cruise control in many automobiles.  The prime mover in the system is the air motor, and the "fuel consumption" is the amount of compressed air used by the motor in driving the system.  The student designs were judged upon how much compressed air is used to "drive" the system for a given number of miles under varying load conditions and how closely they achieve constant speed under varying loads.  Note that in some cases the system is driven "downhill"; that is, the load motor back-drives the hybrid powertrain.  In these cases, the generator provides regenerative braking, and charges the battery pack.  Thus, the performance of the hybrid powertrain depends upon the efficiency of the studentsÆ air motors as well as the effectiveness of their overall control strategies.  Knowledge retention was tested using concept inventories and design skill level was assessed using simple design exercises.  Overall, the results show that while the design project did not improve student knowledge retention, it did improve their design skill and ability to communicate design ideas.  A website for this project has been developed and is currently online.  The URL for the website was chosen for its ease of memorization and descriptiveness ("benchtop hybrid")  www.benchtophybrid.com  One of the outstanding features of the website are its many animated figures.  The investigators have developed a large number of simulations using HTML5 and JavaScript.  For example, when the "Play" button is pressed on one page, the entire linkage of an air engine is animated, and a student can easily visualize the correct timing of the...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
