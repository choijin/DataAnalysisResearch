<AbstractNarration>A conference on Compact Moduli and Vector Bundles, which will be held at the University of Georgia during October 20-24, 2010,  will allow an exchange of ideas in these interrelated subjects. The topics will include the moduli space of stable varieties and pairs, including stable curves but also with a special emphasis on the higher-dimensional case, and the vector bundles on compact moduli spaces, with a special emphasis on conformal block bundles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the conference is to bring together and strengthen an international community of algebraic geometers including many young people -- graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty -- as well as established researchers for discussing the progress achieved during last few years and&lt;br/&gt;to produce cross-fertilization between several major fields of study and spark new ideas and cooperation.</AbstractNarration>

With the objective of bringing together and strengthening the international community of algebraic geometers working in these areas, we held the conference Compact Moduli and Vector Bundles,  at the University of Georgia from October 21 to 24, 2010.

The idea was to try to lessen the intimidation barrier for graduate students to meet senior people.  We matched 12 postdocs with 36 graduate students.    We are currently working on a proceedings volume in the American Mathematical Society Contemporary Math series with editors Valery Alexeev,  Angela Gibney,  Elham Izadi, Janos Koll&aacute;r, and Eduard Looijenga.
