<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Department of Defense (ASSURE Program) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Geraldine Richmond at the University of Oregon.  The research projects supported in this site are in areas of environmental chemistry.  Undergraduates will be recruited to this site from Primarily Undergraduate Institutions.  The site will support twelve students per summer in a ten week program.  A sample of the projects that undergraduates would work on include:  (1)  the spectroscopic and thermodynamic study of oil dispersions at the oil/water interface; (2)  the synthesis and study of nanostructured films for advanced photovoltaic materials; (3)  the green synthesis of functionalized inorganic nanoparticles; (4)  the development of new catalysts for nitrogen fixation; (5) the use of "ionic junctions" in conducting polymers for use in solar energy conversion; and (6) the development of new supramolecular methods for chelation of hazardous metals.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including a discussion of ethics in science, via a book club, and meetings with other professionals (businessmen, lawyers, etc.) to discuss how issues of environment impact business and law/policy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in the chemical sciences, with a strong emphasis on environmental science.  The research projects are in diverse areas of chemistry, many of which will have an impact in areas of national need.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
