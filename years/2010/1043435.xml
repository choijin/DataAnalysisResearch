<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of San Diego to establish a Phase I Climate Change Education Partnership (CCEP) in collaboration with California State University San Marcos, The San Diego Foundation, the Steve Alexander Group, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The overall goal of the CCEP Phase I project is to establish a coordinated national network of regionally- or thematically-based partnerships devoted to increasing the adoption of effective, high quality educational programs and resources related to the science of climate change and its impacts. This project will focus on involving ?Key Influentials? (thought and opinion leaders, trend-setters) to increase awareness of climate science, mitigation, and adaptation issues among the non K-16 population in the San Diego region. The project targets a diverse audience, including local elected officials representing 18 cities and the County of San Diego, the Hispanic/Latino community, the real estate development community, faith-based communities, and tribal communities. The specific goals include: (1) creating an innovative team that combines climate scientists, education psychologists, formal and informal educators, private-sector communication professionals, and policy experts to develop and implement a strategic educational framework; (2) using an action research framework to assess current public opinion and understanding about climate change through surveys, a series of innovative workshops, and knowledge gathering sessions; and (3) developing compelling messages and methods to educate target audiences about climate change science that could impact short- and long-term behavior, without prescribing what that behavior should be.&lt;br/&gt; By the end of this project, the PIs expect to: (1) develop a comprehensive strategic communications and education plan to increase climate science, mitigation behaviors, and adaptation awareness in the San Diego region, with particular emphasis on the audiences outside the formal K-16 environment; (2) develop strategies and communication methods based on the latest research from educational psychology and other learning sciences to educate groups within the general public about climate science; (3) develop a web-based portal of climate related information, sources, and activities available in the region; (4) gather detailed public opinion data on regional awareness and attitudes of climate related issues; (5) develop a range of communication methods and messages to improve quality of education practices; and, (6) using an action research framework, establish of a diverse group of 30-50 ?Key Influentials? and a regional advisory board to work with the project team. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information on this project is available by visiting http://www.sandiego.edu/ccep or contacting the PI, Dr. Michel A. Boudrias at boum@sandiego.edu</AbstractNarration>

In addition, the partnership assembled and met regularly with an advisory board of key influential leaders. The role of the advisory board was to provide feedback to and advise the partnership on the most effective approaches to engage regional leaders.   The project team assessed both global and local climate knowledge and how mediating factors like efficacy ("I can &hellip;"), identify ("I am&hellip;"), and values ("I am part of a community who &hellip;) interact with knowledge for both the general public and key influential and thought leaders early in the process to establish a baseline. The partners designed survey instruments to conduct interviews with nearly 40 leaders and a random sample of more than 1000 people in San Diego County. Results of the Key Influential interviews were summarized in a white paper that provides a detailed analysis of the findings.

The finalized inventory was released publicly and posted to the project website, which serves as a repository of work conducted under the project and to provide news and updates. To better understand the state of climate education, the partners completed a comprehensive review of the social and learning sciences literature, which included brief summaries of over 40 books and articles and a description of how each relates to climate change education.  Using preliminary feedback from public opinion surveys and key influential interviews, the partners assessed climate science education approaches using an experiment and focus groups.  The learning science partners designed and conducted an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of a series of messages and messengers.  Overall the scientist as messenger was most effective in transmitting knowledge and efficacy while the business leader was most effective as a messenger for identity.  Results from a series of focus groups with both seasoned and emerging leaders revealed uncertainty about all the science information available and some difficulties connecting global climate change to local impacts.   Based on the results of all the activities above, the project team developed a compr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
