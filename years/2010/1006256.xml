<AbstractNarration>Technical: The goal of the project is to control and manipulate polarization and electric fields at interfaces of crystalline oxides and semiconductor material. Key to achieving this goal is atomic level control of the microscopic form and structure of the interface, which requires advanced oxide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth techniques. The research requires specialized characterization tools to probe buried epitaxial interfaces with the highest reciprocal space resolution, including high speed methods of measuring the crystal truncation rods of interface structures using synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Other physical and electrical structure characterization techniques include in-situ electrical transport measurements, in-situ surface diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The PIs combine these synthesis and characterization tools to develop new functional behavior in three specific areas: band offsets (interface dipoles), interface polarization, and single layer interface ferroelectrics. Each research direction is focused on a materials system suited to the relevant property under investigation: BaO for band offsets, SrTiO3 for interface polarization, and MX2-type layered films for ferroelectricity. The research addresses the fundamentals of how form (structure) affects function (electrical properties) at crystalline oxide-semiconductor interfaces. By considering crystalline oxides, one can apply a battery of atomic level control and structural characterization techniques to achieve a level of understanding of the microscopic structure that is not possible with amorphous oxides. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The research has the potential to transform the utility of semiconductor structures by engineering and tailoring the properties of crystalline oxide-semiconductor interfaces at the atomic layer level. A key component of the project involves undergraduate and post-baccalaureate STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) participation in the implementation and practice of these techniques. Undergraduates grow materials using oxide MBE in both classroom and research environments and characterize these materials using synchrotron scattering techniques. The STEM graduates are involved in the engineering development and improvement of the synthesis and characterization techniques. This project is aimed at enhancing the technical skills of STEM graduates whose career goals are to transition to permanent technical positions in industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Oxides containing transition metals display a wide variety of properties and are used for an array of applications, including for displays, camera sensors, and computer memory.  One of the main challenges for using these materials is integrating them with the most common material used for electronics: silicon.  This challenge is addressed here by obtaining a detailed understanding of how a model transition metal oxide, SrTiO3, can be integrated with silicon as a single crystal.  The approach used is to grow state-of-the art, crystalline films of SrTiO3 on silicon, and then characterize the atomic structure of the crystalline interface with picometer resolution, taking advantage of resources provided by the national laboratories, such as the Advanced Photon Source and the National Synchrotron Light Source.  It has been found that the electronic properties of SrTiO3 thin films on silicon are determined by interactions at the atomic-scale interface. This discovery has led to the development of a new material, only a few atomic layers thick, which can be used as an advanced computer memory.  Broader Impact  The development of materials with atomic layer precision is at the cutting edge of electronic and energy technologies.  This work requires a comprehensive approach to thin film growth and characterization, involving multidisciplinary teamwork via extensive collaborations with the national laboratories. This approach provides a rich training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral associates; it also provides direct laboratory experience for non-Ph.D. scientists who wish to pursue careers as research technicians. As part of this grant, a graduate of Southern Connecticut State University was trained in vacuum technology, thin film deposition methods, transmission electron microscopy specimen preparation, and surface characterization techniques.  With this experience, the graduate was able to move into a staff position with the Yale Institute for Nanoscience and Quantum Engineering, where he is now supporting diverse research activities.
