<AbstractNarration>This is an award for the 18th West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS), to be held at the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Hidalgo, Pachuca, Mexico, 24 September 2010. It will support travel for USA based speakers, graduate students, postdocs, and other USA based participants. Approximately 20 USA based participants are expected, including about 10 graduate students and postdocs, to attend the three day seminar. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WCOAS is a 20 year tradition among the operator algebraists in western North America. Its intellectual merits include: providing an opportunity for researchers to disseminate their own results; furnishing an opportunity for researchers to learn about recent research of others and to stay abreast of current work; fostering collaborative research by giving researchers the opportunity to meet and discuss their work with one another. Among the broader impacts of WCOAS are the encouragement and nurturing of graduate students and postdocs by giving them the opportunity to present their own work, learn about recent work, and meet established researchers in operator algebras; creation and maintenance of a cohesive regional community of operator algebraists; and the fostering of connections between the faculty and students at research universities and those at primarily undergraduate institutions. Moreover, this WCOAS will help develop ties between mathematicians in Mexico and the rest of North America.</AbstractNarration>
