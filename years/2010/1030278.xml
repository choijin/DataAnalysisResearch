<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT - CMMI - 1030322/ 1030278&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this collaborative research is to identify and model key interfacial systems in which reproducible stick-slip and steady-sliding behaviors occur in micromachined structures.  A central issue is the relationship between the structure of organic monolayer coatings applied to the interfaces, and the resulting kinetic phase diagrams.  This study will create a scientific toolset to enable investigations of stick-slip and steady-sliding behavior.  The friction test system consists of a long-travel high-force linear actuator pulling a calibrated spring and a friction block to which a controllable normal force is applied.  The test apparatus will be imaged by a high-speed video camera.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friction-based micromachined linear actuators have broad potential applications of significant technological importance including nanometer-scale positioning of optical components, data storage, microvalve flow control and microrobotics.  This actuator technology holds the potential to revolutionize fiber communications, lab-on-a-chip diagnostics and microassembly techniques.  The performance and reliability of these actuators depends strongly on control of the contacting interface and understanding of its behavior under various loading and environmental conditions.  The proposal?s educational component includes the development of complimentary Senior/Graduate elective courses at Carnegie Mellon and Auburn Universities, entitled "Experimental Micro- and Nanomechanics" and "Thin Film Deposition and Characterization Methods."  A summer exchange program will ensure that students learn experimental techniques taught at each university.  Outreach will be accomplished by interacting with high-school journalism classes which will develop videos stimulating interest in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
