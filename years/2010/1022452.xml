<AbstractNarration>Michael G. Muszynski&lt;br/&gt;IOS-1022452&lt;br/&gt;Functional Analysis of Leaf Pattern Formation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multicellular organisms must control the spatial organization of cells and tissues during development in order to attain their proper forms.  The nature of the signals that control how spatially organized patterns are formed during growth is poorly understood.  This project aims to increase our understanding of how patterns are formed in plants by studying maize leaf growth.  The maize leaf is an excellent system in which to study pattern formation since it is organized into four distinct tissues.  The leaf sheath is the most proximal tissue located closest to the stem, while the blade is the most distal tissue located furthest from the stem.  Separating the sheath and blade are the auricle and the ligule.  This proximal-to-distal pattern of growth is established early in developing leaf primordia and is essential for normal leaf shape.  Molecular genetic studies revealed that mutations in a protein that initiates signaling of the perception of the plant hormone cytokinin (CK), the maize cytokinin receptor, disrupted the proximal-distal pattern of leaf growth.  This result suggests a direct link between CK signaling and leaf pattern formation which is a new function for this critical plant hormone.  This project will investigate the role CK signaling plays in establishing proper leaf growth patterns using a combination of molecular, genetic, genomic and cell biological approaches.  The results of this project are expected to reveal how the components of CK signaling participate in guiding leaf growth patterns and to identify additional molecular players controlling pattern formation in leaves.  The project will involve cross-disciplinary training of a post-doctoral scientist and several undergraduate students.  Furthermore, a detailed understanding of the molecular control of leaf development is essential to improve crop production in the face of a changing climate and increased global demand.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  During organ development in multicellular organisms, different cell and tissue types are organized in 3 dimensional space.  This spatial organization or patterning is essential for the organÃ†s size, shape and its proper function.  Plant leaf development relies on organized patterns of growth which are particularly prominent in grasses like maize.  To identify signaling components that control leaf patterning we analyzed the Hairy Sheath Frayed1 (Hsf1) maize mutant which has altered leaf patterning.  Analysis of Hsf1 identified the plant hormone cytokinin (CK) receptor, Zea mays histidine kinase1 (ZmHK1), as the gene responsible for the mutant phenotype.  Our results indicated (1) specific single amino acid changes near the CK binding pocket of the receptor protein underlie the Hsf1 phenotype; (2) these mutations increase the binding affinities for natural CKs of mutant receptors; (3) increased CK affinity leads to hypersignaling in developing leaf primordia; and (4) CK hypersignaling in developing leaves triggers gene expression changes similar to other organogenic expression programs that leads to development of a novel organ, the prong.  Overall, our work has identified a new connection between the plant hormone cytokinin (CK) and leaf patterning which leads to changes in leaf size and shape.      Broader Impacts  Increased signaling of CK leads to changes in leaf size and shape suggesting modulating signaling of this hormone or some of its target genes can be used to manipulate the size and shape of different plant organs for improved agronomic performance.  This project has also contributed to the interdisciplinary training of the next generation of scientists through training of 1 post-doctoral scholar, 2 graduate students and 5 undergraduate students.  As our lab aims to promote the training of students from underrepresented groups, one of the graduate students and two undergraduates are female.  Of the 5 undergraduates, three graduated and are currently pursuing PhDÃ†s in different graduate programs.  In addition, this project supported two summer interns: a woman from the George Washington Carver Summer Internship Program and a Native American from the HHMI Summer Scholars Program.
