<AbstractNarration>The dawn of the massively parallel sequencing technology has propelled&lt;br/&gt;research in epigenetics, from genome-wide methylation profiling,&lt;br/&gt;histone modification patterns clustering, to identifying gene&lt;br/&gt;regulation through spatial interactions. The power of epigenetics&lt;br/&gt;has already been felt, such as its use in making drugs for treating&lt;br/&gt;several diseases, but unfortunately, it has also been recognized that&lt;br/&gt;it may be exploited for the bad. The powerful, rapidly acquirable,&lt;br/&gt;stable, and heritable features of epigenetic could be a perfect vehicle&lt;br/&gt;for bio-terrorism. The regulatory mechanism of gene expression may&lt;br/&gt;be altered based on the epigenetic principle to create mutant cells&lt;br/&gt;with devastating consequences very quickly. To counter the potential&lt;br/&gt;of such threat, the detection of changes in epigenetic marks is a&lt;br/&gt;key issue. This project aims to develop likelihood based as well&lt;br/&gt;as Bayesian methodology, computational algorithms and associated&lt;br/&gt;software for analyzing massively parallel epigenomic sequencing data&lt;br/&gt;that are tangible for detection of biological threats. The focus will&lt;br/&gt;be on chromatin signature and structure analysis to study histone&lt;br/&gt;binding patterns in promoters and enhancers and spatial interactions&lt;br/&gt;between promoters and enhancers within a protein complex. Methods and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms developed will be implemented in three software packages:&lt;br/&gt;DIME, ChAPE, and BASIC. It is anticipated that the analytical tools&lt;br/&gt;developed will contribute to uncover global host-response epigenetic&lt;br/&gt;patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charles Darwin's publication of "On the origin of species" 150 years&lt;br/&gt;ago has taught us that evolutionary changes take many generations&lt;br/&gt;of natural selection. In recent years, however, a new scientific&lt;br/&gt;area called epigenetics is helping to usher in a paradigm shift. It&lt;br/&gt;is hypothesized, based on amassed scientific evidence, that powerful&lt;br/&gt;environmental conditions may leave an imprint on the genetic material,&lt;br/&gt;which can lead to passage of new traits in a single generation&lt;br/&gt;through the epigenetic process. The importance of epigenetics has&lt;br/&gt;been recognized in the scientific community, and indeed, epigenetics&lt;br/&gt;has been used for the good, such as its utilization for producing drugs&lt;br/&gt;for treating complex diseases. Unfortunately, it may also be exploited&lt;br/&gt;by bio-terrorists. In other words, gene regulation mechanism may be&lt;br/&gt;altered to create mutant cells, which could pose great threats with&lt;br/&gt;devastating consequence. Anticipating the potential of such type of&lt;br/&gt;threats, this project proposes statistical methods and computational&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to analyze epigenetic data from advanced genomic sequencing&lt;br/&gt;technology to detect mutant cells that may have gone through epigenetic&lt;br/&gt;changes. These tools are anticipated to contribute to early detection&lt;br/&gt;of exposure to potential biowarfare pathogen. This project will also&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the training of the next generation of researchers in&lt;br/&gt;a cutting-edge interdisciplinary research area that fuses knowledge&lt;br/&gt;in biology, statistics and computer science.</AbstractNarration>
