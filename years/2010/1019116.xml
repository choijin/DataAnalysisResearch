<AbstractNarration>This award will support an "International Workshop on Wind Energy Development" to be held in Cairo, Egypt from March 23-25, 2010.  The workshop is a collaborative effort between Dr. Manisa Pipattanasomporn from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and Dr. Janet Twomey from Wichita State University, together with Dr. Mohamed Elsobki from Cairo University, Egypt.  This workshop will bring together wind energy experts from industry, non-government organizations, government agencies, and universities.  Approximately 40 experts will be invited from the United States, Egypt and the region to identify and discuss the research and development needs that will facilitate sustainable wind energy development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  The workshop will focus on two key issues related to wind energy.  These issues, which are of interest to both US and Egyptian participants, are: (i) methodologies that can increase wind turbine performance in terms of its design and operation; and (ii) the analysis and identification of methodologies to mitigate impacts of large-scale wind energy integration on electric power systems and on the environment.  Of equal importance are the policy, economic, education, training and awareness aspects in the context of wind energy projects.  The expected outcomes of this workshop will include a set of recommendations that identify necessary building blocks for facilitating the deployment of large scale wind energy projects.  Furthermore, it is expected that the presentations and discussions at the workshop will lead to the identification of opportunities for collaborative research among diverse stakeholder groups both in the region and in the United States.  These collaborations are expected to contribute to facilitating wind energy development solutions in many parts of the world that have diverse wind, atmospheric and environmental conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  The workshop will provide the participants, including undergraduate and graduate students, with a culturally rich experience.  The students will have the opportunity to interact with experts from various countries and discuss their interests.  This will serve as a basis for future collaboration and for conducting joint research and/or setting up joint programs on wind energy among the U.S. and the Egyptian institutions, as well as institutions from the region.  Special efforts will be made to recruit workshop participants from under-represented groups, including women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is funded under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to undertake cooperative research.  Co-funding has been provided by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering; the NSF Engineering Directorate's Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems; and the NSF Engineering Directorate's Office of the Director, Diversity and Outreach.</AbstractNarration>
