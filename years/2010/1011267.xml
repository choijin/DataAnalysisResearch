<AbstractNarration>This research addresses the interaction between ecological and evolutionary processes by examining the recent evolution of a common invasive fish species, the white perch, in lakes and the consequences of this evolution for community and ecosystem dynamics.  White perch have successfully invaded lakes spanning a productivity gradient, which provides diverse selective pressures that may result in altered fish morphology, physiology and ecological role.  Adaptation by these fish may, in turn, feed back to affect lake productivity and community structure through several ecological and chemical pathways.  This project tests the hypothesis that this rapid evolutionary divergence within a single species has resulted in ecological effects that are large relative to longer term divergence between different species of fish.  The research will use controlled rearing of fish from differing lakes to establish the genetic nature of the relationship between lake productivity and fish traits that include body chemistry, body shape, and feeding morphology.  In additional, mesocosm experiments will be used to determine the effects of fish trait variation on plankton community structure and ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and productivity.  By using mesocosms seeded with plankton and fish from different source ponds, fish and plankton source treatments will be crossed and the relative impact of fish invasion into novel habitats will be compared to longer term evolutionary divergence.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research tests an ecological-evolutionary framework that is a recent synthesis between evolutionary biology and ecology.  This framework has the potential to provide general insight into the causes and consequences of biodiversity and a better understanding of the pace at which evolution and ecology interact.  This theoretical framework and research that uses a common fish invader informs practical issues involving management and conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of water quality in lakes. This project will enhance the doctoral thesis of a graduate student and provide several undergraduate students with research experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mitigating the decline in water quality of lakes and streams often focuses on reducing nutrient inputs by humans.  However, other organisms, such as introduced fishes, can also contribute to processes that recycle nutrients and drive algal blooms and poor water quality.  Different species of fishes can influence lake water quality in different ways through differences in their feeding, excretion and interactions with other organisms.  We sought to assess how finer scale fish diversity might influence lake water quality by experimentally examining effects associated with different populations of a single fish species. White perch (Morone americana), our study organism, has been widely introduced throughout Maine and much of North America, and there is some concern this invasive species may contribute to declining water quality.       As part of this research, we characterized trait differences among nine white perch populations that inhabit a gradient of water quality conditions from low-nutrient, clear water systems (oligotrophic) to high-nutrient, green water systems (eutrophic).  We found significant differences among populations in fish body shape and chemistry, diet and nutrient excretion.  Most of this variation likely arose in the last hundred years, when these fish were introduced to these lakes and as some lakes became more polluted than others.  To understand the ecological consequences of this diversity we reared two populations of these fish in the lab, one from a nutrient rich lake and one from a nutrient poor lake (Figure 1).  Using artificial habitats (mesocosms) stocked with these 2 strains of fish we were able to show that the different fish populations had different effects on water quality.  Importantly, we found that fish adapted to high productivity lakes have the capacity to make such systems even more productive than their counterparts adapted to low productivity systems.  This suggests that water quality reductions due to nutrient inputs to lake systems may be exacerbated as introduced fishes adapt to such conditions.  In a broader context, this project was developed out of collaboration with MaineÆs Department of Environmental Protection and this work has the potential to influence future policy regarding species introductions and water quality remediation.  The proposed research also contributed to the education and training of undergraduate students from a state in which scientific training and technology-based careers are underrepresented.
