<AbstractNarration>This three year REU Site program at Case Western Reserve University is focused in the area of biomedical engineering.  This ten week summer research program has three components: 1) a research project in which students will work with faculty, postdoctoral and graduate student mentors; 2) a seminar series; and 3) student/faculty forums which are designed to introduce the students to the breadth of the research activities that are available in biomedical engineering.  The seminar series will offer a variety of topics including laboratory safety and general procedures, ethics in research, student presentations about their research, and guest speakers discussing career paths.  In addition to the research and educational activities, the REU participants will be introduced to the social and cultural activities in the Cleveland area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the program is to recruit a diverse group of students with emphasis on underrepresented minority students.  Recruitment efforts will focus on students from colleges and universities across the country which has large populations of underrepresented minority students.</AbstractNarration>

Recruitment efforts  focused on students from colleges and universities across the country which has large populations of underrepresented minority students.  In a representative year we had 257 applicants, 13 were selected including 3 African American and one Hispanic student as well as 9 female students. 4 students were selected from Case Western Reserve University, while the other students were from 9 different universities around the country including institutions where research opportunities in STEM are limited (e.g. Wofford College).
