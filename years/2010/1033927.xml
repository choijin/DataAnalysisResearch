<AbstractNarration>Workshop on Knowledge Representation and Information Management for Financial Risk Management (KR-Financial Risk)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The credit crisis of 2008 and the ensuing Great Recession have shone a light into the hitherto esoteric world of investment data processing. The lack of consensus or acceptable best practices around standards, agreed upon definitions, procedures, metrics, and mathematical techniques have left supervisory agencies unable to ingest market information in either a timely manner that would permit a macro-prudential response, or even determine what information might be missing. This has resulted in the following unsatisfactory situation:&lt;br/&gt;     * Corporate managers are uncertain of the trustworthiness of&lt;br/&gt;       their internal risk and accounting numbers;&lt;br/&gt;     * The academic community is lacking the information required to&lt;br/&gt;       examine and analyze actual market operations and behavior;&lt;br/&gt;     * Regulators, analysts, and the financial press are denied an&lt;br/&gt;       understanding of capital market operations sufficient to&lt;br/&gt;       forge knowledgeable and prudent financial policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this NSF-sponsored workshop is to help develop the underlying theory and framework that might unify the disparate ongoing and planned efforts at understanding and managing the enormous data and information flows in the financial services industry, and to develop a comprehensive list of the challenges in this domain with respect to robust risk assessment and management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will draw upon an interdisciplinary team of experts from computer science (data management and mining and knowledge representation), finance, mathematics, economics and operations research.  The workshop will generate a report which will develop a comprehensive list of the challenges in this domain including the fundamental forces and constraints and policies and models of information management that are critical for robust financial risk management.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The recent financial collapse has laid bare the inadequacies of the information infrastructure supporting the US financial system.  Technical challenges around large-scale data systems interact with significant economic forces involving innovation, transparency, confidentiality,complexity, and organizational change, to create a very difficult problem.  The post-crisis reform legislation has created a unique opportunity to rebuild financial risk management on a solid foundation of information management principles.  The workshop identified several areas of research within CISE that has the potential to have an impact on the following:  (1) Next generation financial infrastructure;  (2) Modeling and monitoring of systemic risk.  The workshop developed six financial use cases that illustrate the benefits of the next generational financial infrastructure.  The workshop identified several computational research challenges that may lead to productive doctoral research. The workshop identified the importance of making datasets available for research and teaching.  The workshop explored research and education along the following areas:  (1) Data representation and complex models.  (2) Knowledge representation and reasoning.  (3) Heterogeneous data sources, interoperability and information integration.  (4) Data quality and provenance.  (5) Streaming, change management and performance.  (6) Ontologies, and open standards and protocols for information exchange.  (7) Visual analytics.  (8) Human language technologies for financial data collections.  (9) Metadata management and information archives and long term preservation.       Last Modified: 07/02/2012       Submitted by: Louiqa Raschid]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
