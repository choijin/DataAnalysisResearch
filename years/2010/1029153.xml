<AbstractNarration>This project is built upon the existing collaborations between the PIs from the California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in the U.S. and the foreign partners from Peking University (PKU) in China since 2006. Based on their previous work together, this project will focus on: 1) year-round research collaboration; 2) students' summer visit in PKU; and 3) undergraduate student involvement. The proposed research work includes not only GaN LD/LED device level modeling and simulation, but also fabrication, testing, and control system design for the design and implementation of a new class of efficient and intelligent lighting systems. Intellectual merit: This project has a strong research component and novelty, especially in the area of increasing energy conversion efficiency of GaN light emitter devices. Students will perform GaN LD/LED design simulation at Cal Poly, and Cal Poly students will work at PKU in summer to fabricate their designed devices. Broader impacts: This collaboration provides students a valuable opportunity to gain first-hand overseas educational experiences and also helps them to further adapt themselves in a global environment. In fact, students on both sides will obtain a better understanding of foreign cultures and languages.</AbstractNarration>
