<AbstractNarration>Previous studies have suggested that tropical storms may introduce marine organic matter onto land via precipitation.  In the context of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that occurred in the northern Gulf of Mexico in April, 2010, it is natural to focus attention on the potential for storms in this region to transport and deposit some portion of the pollutant oil inland.  As of June 10, 2010, a conservative estimate of the surface slick in the Gulf is 45,000 square kilometers.  While attention is currently focused overwhelmingly on impacts in the open marine and coastal environments, little -- if any -- attention has been given to examining the potential for tropical storms and hurricanes to move oil spill contaminants far inland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding through this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) researchers at East Carolina University will take a first look at the conveyance of components of the Deepwater Horizon to short-range and longer-range inland sites via the sea storm - rainfall route.  Post-storm rainfall samples will be collected at one coastal site (Lake Pontchartrain) and at one or more inland sites for analysis for aliphatic hydrocarbon (finger-printed to the material from the oil spill) and carbon isotopic composition.  This will be the first study of its kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Besides the obvious relevance to advancing our understanding of the near- and far-field environmental and human health impacts of the Deepwater Horizon spill, this simple study will also inform scientists, environmental managers, and policy makers working dealing with similar environmental catastrophes in the future and at other places.  A first-year female graduate student will also participate in this project.</AbstractNarration>
