<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit. Type IV pili (TFP) are bacterial surface fibers that have a range of functions including twitching and gliding motility, adhesion to cells and surfaces, and formation of microbial biofilms.  In some metal-reducing bacteria, they function as nanowires capable of carrying an electric current.  TFP are assembled by a protein complex spanning the inner membrane and the peptidoglycan of Gram(+) bacteria as well as the outer membrane of Gram(-) bacteria.  The core assembly complex includes the pilin subunits themselves, an assembly ATPase, and an inner membrane protein; for Gram(-) bacteria, there is also an outer membrane secretin (channel) through which the assembled pilus passes.  Many TFP also utilize a retraction ATPase to disassemble pili, which facilitates twitching motility and tight adherence to surfaces.  The force generated by the retraction ATPase has been measured at &gt;100 piconewtons, making it the strongest molecular motor known in biology.  However, the mechanism by which the pilin monomers are polymerized into a growing pilus is still not well understood.  This project will a comprehensive atomic-level model that can account for pilin polymerization in an energetically favorable fashion.  The approach is to reconstitute a functional TFP assembly apparatus in lipid vesicles using purified proteins, derived from the Gram(+) bacterium Clostridium perfringens.  Experiments will also measure the rate of pilin polymerization using fluorescently tagged proteins.  The direct output from this project will be (1) identification of the minimal components that comprise a functional TFP assembly apparatus, (2) direct measurements of TFP assembly rate kinetics, and (3) measurement of the energy input (ATP) required to translocate pilin monomers from a hydrophobic membrane environment to another hydrophobic environment found in the core of the pilus filament.  These results will have wide applications in microbial physiology and ecology, as well as nanosystems biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts.  Graduate students will be heavily involved in this research project.  In addition, minorities and other underrepresented individuals will be encouraged to participate as either graduate students or undergraduate research interns. The principal investigator will continue to participate in an institutional PREP program, which is also dedicated to recruiting and retaining members of underrepresented groups into graduate school and scientific careers.  The investigator will continue training female graduate students and undergraduate students, which in the past have included one student with a disability.  The investigator will incorporate findings from this research into course lectures and presentations local grammar schools.  The intent is to get young people excited about biology and microbiology and to encourage them to pursue careers in science and math.  Since bacterial pili play an essential role in many bacterial environments, the results will likely benefit society in such areas as agricultural safety practices, microbial ecology, geobiology, as well as nanotechnology applications for industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bacteria produce type IV pili (TFP), fibers extruded from the cells that are used for motility, attachment to surfaces, uptake of DNA and even as nanowires for conducting electric current.  TFP are made up of a single protein, pilin, that is polymerized from a pool of pilin protein in the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria.  These fibers are retractable, allowing the bacterium to move in the direction of pilus attachment.  How TFP are assembled is still not known at the molecular level.  To better understand this process, we used the simple TFP system present in the Gram-positive bacterium, Clostridium perfringens, as a model for TFP structure and function.  The main goals of this project were to purify the individual components of the TFP core system from C. perfringens and assemble a working TFP assembly apparatus in artificial lipid vesicles.  This involved purification of three different proteins: the pilin itself, an assembly ATPase (PilB2), and an essential protein, PilC2.  Two of the these proteins, the pilin and PilC2, are integral membrane proteins and so very challenging to purify to the high degree needed for these studies.  PilC2 was especially problematic, since synthesis of this protein in an E. coli host resulted in rapid death of the cells.  We overcame these problems by using an alternative host, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which makes TFP of their own, to express the TFP proteins.  The PilB2 protein was active for ATP hydrolysis and underwent a conformational change when bound to ATP.  This is the first biochemical characterization of an assembly ATPase for any Gram-positive bacterium.  PilC2 was purified to homogeneity and shown, via circular dichroism spectroscopy to be comprised mostly of alpha helices, which was anticipated by structural prediction software.  Binding studies of purified PilC2 and PilB2 have not shown any direct interaction between these proteins, which indicates there are likely other proteins involved in the core complex that do hold these individual proteins in the assembly apparatus.  The C. perfringens pilin could not be purified from C. perfringens itself, due to an inability to shear off surface pili and was not expressed well in E. coli.  Therefore, as a substitute, we purified pilin from P. aeruginosa for use in the assembly experiments and showed, via fluorescent labeling of the pilins, that it is efficiently incorporated into artificial unilaminar vesicles.  Since it appears other proteins may be involved in assembling TFP, we are purifying accessory proteins from C. perfringens that have homologs in other bacteria and have been shown to be important for TFP function.  When complete, this project will demonstrate the minimal amounts of proteins needed to assemble a TFP, which will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying synthesis of this important bacterial organelle.     Four graduate students and seven undergraduate research students have been directly or indirectly supported by this project.  The results have been reported at local, regional and national microbiology meetings.           Last Modified: 05/28/2015       Submitted by: Stephen Melville]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
