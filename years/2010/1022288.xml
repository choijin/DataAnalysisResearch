<AbstractNarration>Transition metal homeostasis is a key process for all forms of life.  Metal homeostasis can be disrupted by a variety of environmental or genetic factors.  For example, oxygen can alter the oxidation state of some transition metals, such as iron and copper, thereby altering their bioavailability and toxicity.  In addition, the requirement for multiple transition metals for correct cell function can be problematic if some transition metals compete with each other for binding to similar protein active sites.  For example, under anaerobic conditions in bacteria, iron is combined with nickel in the active sites of the Ni-Fe hydrogenase family of enzymes.  During anaerobic growth bacteria increase nickel uptake to provide for hydrogenase maturation.  However, excess nickel is toxic to cells in part due to disruption of iron homeostasis.  This project focuses on the transcription factor YqjI that regulates iron homeostasis genes in response to cellular nickel accumulation.  YqjI is a nickel-dependent metalloregulatory protein that represses transcription of the ferric reductase YqjH under low nickel conditions.  YqjI-dependent repression of yqjH is switched off when nickel levels rise above the concentration necessary for proper metalloprotein function leading to increased expression of yqjH.  This project will characterize YqjI transcriptional regulation of the yqjH promoter and determine how nickel acts as an allosteric switch to control YqjI-dependent regulation.  This project will also elucidate the in vivo function of the YqjH ferric reductase during iron homeostasis to understand why it is specifically cross-regulated by a nickel-responsive regulator (YqjI).  Finally, this project will use genome-wide methods to identify new targets of YqjI transcriptional regulation in order to better understand how iron and nickel homoeostasis are integrated in E. coli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide insight into the mechanisms of intracellular iron and nickel homeostasis and will contribute to the broader fields of bioinorganic chemistry and the study of environmental stress responses in biological systems.  As part of th educational and outreach activities, minority undergraduate students from local Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in South Carolina will perform summer research projects directly related to these studies.  In addition to learning biochemistry and molecular biology techniques, the students will participate in a year-long mentoring plan designed to increase minority involvement in scientific research and minority participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Project "Characterization of a Novel Nickel Metalloregulatory Protein, YqjI" was completed.  This project sought to understand how organisms respond to toxic levels of metals (such as nickel) by altering the expression of genes that protect cells from metal toxicity.  In this case the experiments were conducted using the bacterium Escherichia coli because it is fast-growing, easy to manipulate genetically, and amendable to biochemical analysis.  The main focus of the project was to determine how cells respond to toxic levels of nickel.  This is an important public health problem due to the exposure of human workers to inhaled nickel particulates in some industrial settings, which can lead to the development of cancer.  We discovered that nickel toxicity disrupts the ability of cells to maintain adequate levels of the metal iron.  Iron is essential to most organisms (including humans) because it is used as a cofactor for oxygen transport (in heme) and for respiration (in heme and iron-sulfur clusters).  We found that toxic levels of nickel can prevent cells from taking up adequate levels of iron to support growth.  This block has many downstream consequences for cell metabolism and physiology that are broadly relevant for many organisms (including humans).  We also studied a protein, YqjI, that senses elevated nickel levels inside the cell and then activates the expression of genes important for iron transport.  This result indicates that cells cross-regulate iron metabolism to help alleviate nickel toxicity.  We defined how YqjI senses nickel and regulates specific genes.  During the completion of these studies, the laboratory trained 5 undergraduates and 1 graduate (Ph.D.) student from ethnic groups that are underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields.  In addition to training them rigorously in how to conduct scientific research, our goal was to provide positive research experiences for the students in order to encourage them to continue in a STEM career path.  In addition to these students from underrepresented groups, the project also supported 5 additional graduate (Ph.D. and M.S.) students.  In sum, the educational component of the project helped increase the number and diversity of highly trained STEM workers in the U.S.       Last Modified: 08/17/2016       Submitted by: F.
