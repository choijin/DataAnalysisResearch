<AbstractNarration>Two ATE Centers (the National Center for Materials Technology Education and the National Center for Rapid Technologies) are collaborating and participating at the ground level of Global Additive Manufacturing (AM) Standards development by providing technical and educational input in the areas of terminology, test methods, processes, materials and design that facilitate the creation of AM core competencies.  The project advances knowledge about and understanding of additive manufacturing by providing standardized vocabulary, materials, specifications, and quality benchmarks that can be replicated and accepted by industry and their customers.  The project improves technician education by providing student technicians with more comprehensive and up-to-date skills and experiences with AM industry processes and methods.</AbstractNarration>

T.E.A.M. has fulfilled its goals via the following outcomes and achievements:  T.E.A.M. has demonstrated consistent leadership in AM for technician education. T.E.A.M. is a nationally recognized "go-to" resource for AM. T.E.A.M. has continually developed and strengthened linkages with national entities and stayed involved in the national AM conversation in industry and education (e.g., ASTM, SME, AMUG, and NCATC).  T.E.A.M. has made critical impacts in dissemination, replication, and implementation of AM information, knowledge, and best practices. The core competencies produced by T.E.A.M. have made a positive difference in how AM programs deliver state-of-the-art instruction.       INTELLECTUAL MERITS     T.E.A.M. provides a new and effective model of how industry and education can come together, by working shoulder-to-shoulder with ASTM and their Global AM Standards efforts. This partnership speeds the development and delivery of core competencies based on the new and emerging (draft) standards. The model helps shorten the lag time and brings the latest standards work to education directly.  T.E.A.M. involvement nationally has ensured that MatEdU and RapidTech are well positioned to stay on the leading edge of AM. T.E.A.M. contacts and connections, established over the life of this grant, provide a solid foundation for additional future relationships in AM and more productive gains for advancing technician education in the AM discipline. Workshops, presentations, and modules on "Unpacking Core Competencies" were updated and delivered to faculty and teachers in numerous venues in 2014-2015. Additional core competencies are being developed, tested, and rolled out as new opportunities for dissemination became available. This ongoing work to consolidate and convert AM standards to core competencies is a major T.E.A.M. contribution to technician education.
