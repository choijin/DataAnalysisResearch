<AbstractNarration>The investigators will develop processes and methodologies to support effective integration of the NSF incoherent scatter radars (ISRs).  The ISRs provide observations of a broad range of ionospheric and thermospheric properties used in space science studies for more than four decades.  Recent community-based assessments of the global ISR network have recommended better coordination of scientific and technical activities being undertaken at the various sites.  The Integrated Facilities Office (InFO) will coordinate scientific and technical activities at the NSF facilities, taking advantage of the entire available skill sets across all facilities. InFO will be located at SRI International in Menlo Park, California. The office will be managed by a senior staff member with extensive experience in the coordination of incoherent scatter radar facilities worldwide.  InFO activities will draw on the expertise and experience of all the facilities, as well as other skills and capabilities within SRI. The coordination office will organize distributed skills teams comprising members who will remain embedded in their home facilities and institutions, but work together to address common issues for all the radars.  Initially, three distributed skills teams will focus on data analysis, transmitter technology, and international coordination of radar experiments. InFO will also support and mentor a postdoctoral scientist, who will serve as a liaison between InFO and the other incoherent scatter radar sites.  In the first year of the award, InFO will conduct a study evaluating the costs and feasibility of building an Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar facility at McMurdo in the Antarctic.  A workshop will be conducted in August 2011 to discuss the scientific needs and specifications for the Antarctic facility.  Finally, InFO will oversee the planning and organization of the successful AMISR summer school. The summer schools feature one week of intensive training and hands-on radar experience aimed at graduate students and other beginning users of incoherent scatter radar data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Integrated Facilities Office (InFO) project was established to develop structures and working practices to create greater integration between the six incoherent scatter radar (ISRs) of the NSF’s Upper Atmosphere Facilities (UAFs). InFO activities supported the NSF's investment in the UAFs and related instrumentation and research programs. InFO aims were aspirational and difficult to realize within the UAF community; nevertheless, InFO created multiple initiatives which led to separately funded projects both at the host institution and elsewhere.  InFO principally operated using Distributed Skills Teams (DSTs) that drew on expertise from across the facilities, and sometimes beyond, to create loosely tied groups able to leverage skills, resources, institutional memory, and radar expertise without removing team members from their respective host institutions.  A strong DST focused on future ISR redeployments and became the working group on Incoherent Scatter Radar Deployment Scenarios (WISRDS). Based on pre-existing plans to deploy an Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) at McMurdo in Antarctica, plans were also developed to deploy an AMISR to Argentina and to create a large, new, Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC)-scale facility, SKYNET, to be located in the northern part of central North America. The plan to locate an AMISR in Argentina did not go forward when it proved impossible to establish a formal Memorandum of Understanding between NSF and the Argentinian sponsors, and the strategy evolved into a wider community need to address the goals articulated in "CEDAR: The New Dimension" and the "Geovision Report," particularly in regard to geospace system science. The SKYNET proposal and other deployment strategies matched well with the goals and targets articulated in the later Decadal Survey report, and a larger initiative to redeploy and develop new ISRs to create a Magnetic Meridian Ring provided further context for SKYNET.  InFO created a well-received proposal for an International Forum to address geospace goals under the auspices of the International Space Science Institute (ISSI), but ultimately it proved impossible to sufficiently define the Forum scope and involve adequate numbers of key contributors. The overarching challenges to (1) identify the gaps in understanding and observation of geospace dynamics and space weather and (2) create a roadmap to address those areas in data, observations, modeling, and instrumentation remain unaddressed at the end of the InFO project; however, they may ultimately be realized in broad-community approaches to the data challenges of adequate global monitoring to enable effective geospace understanding and forecasting for scientific, user, and operational purposes.  InFO supported the US involvement in the European Union &ndash; NSF initiative for joint funding of facilities, Cooperation European Union/US (CoopEUS). While the related UAF program did not receive the expected support, the initiative led to involvement in a successful Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) proposal to support the US administrative component, and the US community participated in the EISCAT_3D effort through an arrangement subsequently supported by a separate NSF award.  InFO developed and submitted a Cyberinfrastructure proposal to exploit available expertise within the UAF and related communities to make ISR data more readily available and understandable to the public and to professional out-of-field users. While it was hard to gain a community consensus, the initiative also led to a successful proposal for a pilot study under the EarthCube umbrella.  InFO organized and managed, on behalf of the NSF, multiple community meetings, including several Radar Schools that were later supported by a separate award.  InFO provided support for a number of subject experts, from several ISR and related facilities, to visit and assist at facilities other than their own. InFo had envisioned appointing an InFO postdoc but, when the position remained unfilled at the end of the second year, funds were reallocated, with prior NSF approval, to support travel and the summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at Arecibo, including travel to the CEDAR meeting.  InFO ideas and progress were reported and discussed at community meetings, about six each year, including the major CEDAR and AGU meetings, Radar Schools, Heater meetings, UAF PI meetings, Antarctic science, EarthCube, and the international CoopEUS and EISCAT workshops, and the Quo Vadis and Fall AGU meetings after the end of the project.  The principal thrust for InFO focused on developing a long-term approach to coordinated UAF participation in geospace system science. The development of overarching scientific planning, prioritization, and implementation across the community optimizes the return on research funding but, more important, focuses effort toward solving societally important scientific questions while maintaining and improving an environment within which pure science investigations, including serendipitous discoveries and advances, can flourish. Although InFO has ended, the ideas will continue to provide a framework to support both national and international coordination and support.
