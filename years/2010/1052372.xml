<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to discover the ecological and evolutionary processes that govern host specificity of insect parasitoids of ants in the fly family Phoridae. As a group, these parasitoids consist of several 100 species in the Neotropical Region, most of which are extremely specialized, attacking one or a few closely related ant species. The research group, consisting of a natural products chemist, an evolutionary biologist and a behavioral ecologist, will focus on the chemical signals host ants use in communication (pheromones) as the primary cue by which the parasitoids locate hosts and lay their eggs in them. Once the chemical signals parasitoids use to find hosts are identified, the investigators will experimentally quantify the limits of host specificity by attracting parasitoids and inducing them to oviposit novel hosts to see if they develop normally. These chemical signals will then be mapped onto the phylogenetic tree of hosts and compared to the phylogenetic tree of the parasitoids to determine how the distribution of chemical signals shape the evolution of host specificity and shifts to novel hosts. Results of the project will have broad application to insect parasitoids and the potential for biological control of insect pests. Educational and outreach goals of the project include: 1) training US, Latin American and Caribbean graduate and undergraduate students in natural products chemistry and the ecological, behavioral and evolutionary aspects of life history specialization in insects; 2) training secondary school science teachers in the process of scientific research; and 3) using the results and products of the project to develop inquiry-based learning activities (IBAs) for Utah K-12 classrooms. These IBAs will focus on scientific issues such as conservation and biodiversity, adaptations and species interactions, and the family tree of life, all of which are part of the Utah state science core curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ants of the Ponerinae subfamily have been subjected to many chemical and behavioral studies.   Ants of this group contain a group of chemicals called pyrazines in two internal organs, called the mandibular glands, found in their heads. These chemicals are used by ants as pheromones to coordinate their communal activity.  However, the signaling effects of pyrazines are not confined to ants. These compounds are widely used also as food additives and fragrants by humans. Thus, correctly identifying the chemical structures, and quantifying the amounts of these compounds present in natural mixtures are important scientific endeavors.  Although these compounds are structurally simple, they are often very similar.  Thus, their correct identification and characterization is not at all a straightforward task by existing analytical procedures.       In this NSF funded project, we chemically synthesized a large number of pyrazines and developed analytical procedures for their unambiguous identification.  A spectral and chromatographic database for identification of these compounds was generated.  The results have been disseminated to public by peer-reviewed scientific publications.  In fact, this was collaborative project with entomologists from University of Utah.  They provided us samples of many species of ant, and we made the chemical identification of pyrazines mixtures found in the heads of these ants.  We also provided synthetic chemical samples for their behavioral studies.          In addition to behavioral studies, biologists use the chemical composition of these pyrazines mixtures in ants for taxonomic studies, and to find evolutionary relationships among different species. With our newly developed methods for identification pyrazines, we found that several chemical identification previously reported in literature were erroneous.  The corrections we made were published in the Journal of Chemical Ecology 44 (2018) 444-451 (DOI: doi.org/10.1007/s10886-018-0948-y).  When there are misidentifications, the predictions based on such data on evolutionary relationships between species become futile.  In other words, the corrections we made is an important outcome of our study.  Using our data, we proposed that four of the ant species we studied are closely related (same clade), and within this group, three species were more closely related than the other species.  More importantly, our predictions from chemical analysis agreed well with the classifications results reported by other researchers.
