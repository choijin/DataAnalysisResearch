<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to establish a recruiting and retention program for veterans at Mississippi State University in partnership with the Mississippi College for Women.  The research project, if successful, will create a portable, modular set of courses to transition veterans to college engineering programs and collect data on their effectiveness.  A key element of this project is integrating research on learning preferences into the development of the transition modules.  The broader significance and importance of this project will be to develop tested modules which other institutions and organizations can use to transition military veterans to college degree programs.  The research effort partners with veterans organizations and professional associations to adopt best practices in recruiting under-represented students.  The discoveries that may result from the modular courses to transition students will have broad applicability across organizations that deal with military veterans.  This research project will enhance the number of students who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs or start new high tech businesses.</AbstractNarration>
