<AbstractNarration>The architecture of an engineered system determines its flexibility, its stability to small and large perturbations, and ultimately its success. This project uses algebraic methods to analyze large systems that possess a layered structure -- which is an extremely useful and natural class of designs.  The advantages and disadvantages with respect to tree structures and complex networks are essential to understand, particularly in applications to healthcare and transportation systems and other important instances of engineering design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layered systems are hierarchical.  They maintain essential aspects of simplicity and robustness as they grow in scale. They allow an algebraic approach that exposes natural measures of complexity and controllability.  The goal of this project is to uncover those implicit and important quantities, and to develop and disseminate their applications to engineered structures. The design of a system is crucial to its success.  For complex systems like transportation and healthcare, that design is often a mixture of layers of decision makers, and top-down trees of authority, and interconnected networks.  The key issues are the flexibility and resilience of these different systems.  An ability to measure these qualities can have important impact, and the PIs believe that algebra and combinatorial methods provide powerful tools to develop that ability. The goal is to advance the understanding of the complex structures on which our society depends.</AbstractNarration>
