<AbstractNarration>Increasingly, technology mediated interactions play a significant role in science and engineering research. This proposal will manage a workshop to identify and address issues surrounding the impact of advances in information and communications technologies and the resulting human disengagement with the natural world on research and education in the information sciences.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will take a very broad view and bring together creative and visionary thinkers from five disparate constituencies.  The organizers will invite leaders from information schools, key thinkers in CI, thought leaders from the IT worlds, representatives from cognate fields, and CI researchers from minority-serving institutions.  The workshop will result in papers outlining the intellectual frontiers of iSchool research and synergies produced in the workshop, which will be presented at major conferences and published in appropriate journals.</AbstractNarration>
