<AbstractNarration>This proposed S-STEM program would provide three-year engineering scholarships which will be spread across five years and awarded to 20 students. The goal is to attract, retain and graduate outstanding students in Eastern North Carolina, a region known to be poor and rural. The program will foster and enable relationships with faculty, students, and industry leaders from ECU's Engineering Advisory Board (EAB), ultimately with the goal of increasing E3NC students? confidence, leadership potential, and sense of community responsibility. The E3NC program will also be used as a recruiting tool.  The intellectual merit of this project is focused on the general engineering curriculum in which the participants will be enrolled, being characterized as intellectually challenging. Seminars held with ECU's Noyce Scholars (students majoring in math education or science education) will provide opportunities for discussion and dialogue outside the classroom setting, challenging students to think about their roles as engineers and as community members who value science and math education.  Broader impacts focus on broadening diversity in STEM by targeting students from poor and rural areas of North Carolina.  The project develops and maintains a web site that serves as a place to learn about the program, obtain an application, and includes features to allow participants to engage with each other and with student support faculty.  The NC STEM Community Collaborative (www.ncstem.org) is used for dissemination.  This is an organization that assists North Carolina communities who want to expand their involvement in STEM initiatives by connecting them to resources across the state and the country.  Additionally, presentations are planned at the NACADA (National Academic Advising Association) Annual Conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award provided funding for scholarships and enrichment programs for 28 students.  To date, 18 of those students have completed a BS in Engineering and 3 more are expected to do so in 2018.  Students were supported by awards of $5,000, $7,500, or $10,000 annually, renewable up to 4 years assuming satisfactory progress toward an engineering degree was made and a minimum GPA of 3.0 was maintained.    Eastern North Carolina is a rural region with many counties considered economically disadvantaged.  Many of the students supported by these scholarships may not have been able to afford to attend a university without the funding this scholarship provided.  Throughout the grant period, students were mentored by a team of faculty.  They were aided in navigating university resources to help them be more successful such as learning how to receive free tutoring, ensuring they were properly registered for all of the classes they needed, and guiding them toward professional development experiences such as resume reviews and career fairs.  They were highly encouraged to engage in undergraduate research and to seek internship opportunities.  At least 4 of the students supported by this program have gone on to obtain graduate degrees in engineering.  Some supported students engaged in undergraduate research programs on campus and some in other locations such as NSF funded Research Experiences for Undergraduate programs at other universities.  Students were highly encouraged to pursue engineering internship opportunities and most of them did so prior to graduating.    Students in this program graduated at a higher rate than the general student body of the ECU Engineering program.  Most graduates from the program are working in eastern North Carolina.  It is hoped that by contributing talent to a region that has historically had difficulty in retaining engineering talent by providing a high-quality engineering education to students from the eastern NC region with demonstrated need will help contribute to regional transformation.    The success of this program in providing opportunities for students to pursue a degree in engineering and graduate with minimal debt has prompted the ECU Engineering program to work towards establishment of a similar and expanded program for engineering majors including students who start at a community college.
