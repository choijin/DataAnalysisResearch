<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research:  Investigating Lithologic and Stratigraphic Controls on Hydrogeology in Neogene Strata of the Central High Plains Aquifer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jon Smith, University of Kansas, EAR-1023285&lt;br/&gt;Michael Petronis, New Mexico Highlands University, EAR-1023278&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The High Plains aquifer accounts for nearly 30% of all groundwater withdrawals in the United States.  The aquifer is under increasing developmental stress and experiencing historic declines in water levels that could seriously compromise major agricultural production on the North American Great Plains. The objective of this research is to investigate the subsurface sedimentary facies, stratigraphic framework, and chronostratigraphy of Neogene and overlying Quaternary units in the central High Plains aquifer. These properties control aquifer geometries and hydrogeologic relationships and are derived from the formative processes and depositional histories of water-bearing and confining strata. Quality stratigraphic information from the High Plains, however, has been impossible to retrieve previously due to unconsolidated and saturated intervals of the aquifer. To accomplish this, PIs will use a mobile platform-mounted rotary-vibratory drill rig. This state-of-the-art drilling technology provides, for the first time, an efficient and cost effective means of collecting intact core with nearly 100% recovery.  Long continuous cores, coupled with  lithologic, spectral gamma-ray, and magnetostratigraphic core logging; stable isotope chemostratigraphy; and geochronologic constraints imposed by tephrochronologic, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), magnetic polarity studies, and U/Pb dating of Neogene sediments, will provide the critical time element to constrain permissible interpretations of stratigraphic correlation and hydrostratigraphic architectures.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have global import because aquifers in heterolithic successions of continentally derived Neogene sediments are under developmental stress in many parts of the world. Management of groundwater resource is achieved most effectively by using numerical modeling to predict hydrogeological response to different management strategies and such models depend on accurate characterization of aquifer materials and their stratigraphic framework.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merits: The objective of this research was to investigate the stratigraphic arrangement and depositional history of sedimentary rock layers comprising the central High Plains Aquifer (HPA, Fig. 1).  In large portions of the HPA, groundwater withdrawals greatly exceed rates of recharge, leading to dramatic water-level declines and growing concerns for long-term sustainability.  Predicting the effects of different groundwater management strategies will depends on improving our understanding of the water containing sedimentary units and their distribution.  Scientific drilling and outcrop investigations in western Kansas began in 2010.  To date, 26 cores totaling over 1,000 meters have been collected from 10 study areas in western Kansas and Nebraska (Fig. 2).  Laboratory analyses on geologic samples included particle size, stable isotope geochemistry, spectral gamma ray logging, magnetic susceptibility, and U-Pb age dating of detrital zircons.  Chronostratigraphic control (age dating) was one of the primary research goals of the project.  High-precision ages derived from zircons in the rock layers provided a means to achieve long-distance correlation of sedimentary units and helped delineate significant hydrostratigraphic subunits within the HPA system on a regional scale.  We found that fine-grained intervals, paleosols (ancient soils), and volcanic ash deposits in the Ogallala Formation of western Kansas contain abundant zircons appropriate for statistically significant U-Pb age dating.  While the distribution of zircon ages provides sedimentary provenance information, our main concern was with acquiring data on the youngest populations of zircons in each sample set to interpret the maximum depositional age (MDA) of the deposits.  From outcrops in Norton County, northern Kansas (Fig. 2), we found that U-Pb dates ranged from ~11 to 13 million years old (Ma) (Hallman, 2016).  These dates are consistent with the 10&ndash;12.7 Ma super-eruptions of the Bruneau-Jarbidge volcanic center in the Yellowstone-Snake River Plain (YSRP) volcanic system (Fig. 3).  Zircons from ash beds in nearby Ellis County (Fig. 2) showed ages ranging from ~8&ndash;10 Ma, also originating from the YSRP but slightly younger than in Norton.  Zircons collected from paleosols in the Ogallala Formation in Ladder Creek Canyon, west-central KS, are mainly from the YSRP (Sitek, 2017).  This study found a succession of paleosols with superposed ages from 10.3 to 6.3 Ma.  All of these results are consistent with previous age estimates of the Ogallala Formation in Kansas and Nebraska.  In the HP1A core in southwestern KS (Fig. 2), MDAs at the 16 m and 24 m intervals were ~27.9 Ma, MDAs from 34 m and 52 m were ~35.4 Ma, and zircons from 87 m yielded ~36.4 Ma (Fig. 4).  Zircons from 23&ndash;24 m in the nearby CMC1 core yielded a MDA of 29.9 &plusmn; 1.6 Ma. Paleogene zircons in these cores originate from explosive volcanism associated with the Mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up (Fig. 3).  The flare-up was a period of magmatic activity that began ~44 Ma that eventually covered large areas of the American west with a patchwork of volcanic fields and ash deposits.    The most parsimonious interpretation of the MDAs in southwest KS is that previously unrecognized Eocene&ndash;Oligocene deposits, time-equivalent with the White River and Arikaree Groups, are present strata previously assumed to be the Neogene Ogallala Formation (Smith et al., 2017; Fig. 5).  Several lines of evidence lead us to interpret this as the actual ages of the deposits.  Firstly, the MDAs occur in a superposed order with depth, while we would expect the reverse if the zircons were deposited due to unroofing of successively older tephra in the source area.  Secondly, Miocene and younger age grains are completely lacking from the over 3300 individual zircons analyzed in the HP1A and CMC1 cores.  Given the sample sizes, the statistical likelihood of missing a population of Neogene zircons is vanishingly small.  The absence of Miocene zircons from cores in southwestern Kansas is striking given that such grains derived from the YSRP (16.1&ndash;0.6 Ma) are readily identified in the Ogallala in northern and central Kansas.  Eocene to Oligocene aged deposits in southwestern Kansas may explain why the aquifer response is so different compared with other parts of the central HPA and the extreme groundwater drawdowns in this region.  Broader impacts: The success of the drilling program provides a strategic opportunity to initiate a network of national partnerships implementing novel geologic techniques to study the architecture and depositional history of the aquifer.  This project has help support the early career development of six recent Ph.D. scientists by involving them in fundamental research on a natural resource problem of great strategic importance. Moreover, project personnel have included seven graduate and undergraduate research assistants, three of which from underrepresented groups in the geosciences.  Over 50 publications have resulted from this funding, including 7 manuscripts published in peer reviewed journals (2 in preparation), 44 abstracts to professional meetings, 1 undergraduate honors thesis, 3 Master?s theses, and 1 Ph.D. dissertation.
