<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to transform and expand the nation's renewable energy storage capacity using a thermochemical approach for converting the energy of photons into chemical bonds. The approach relies on the capacity of selected nonstoichiometric metal oxides, specifically cerium oxide (ceria), to store and release oxygen in response to changes in temperature, where the thermal cycling is induced by exposure to solar radiation. The resulting stoichiometry changes can be directly utilized for fuel production when coupled with the introduction of appropriate reactant gases. Such fuel, in turn, can be used for electricity generation on demand, employing either conventional combustion or fuel cells. The PIs will build on recent breakthroughs in the understanding of thermochemical cycling behavior of nonstoichiometric oxides and expand the effort so as to (a) attain targeted thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics and (b) demonstrate technical feasibility in a prototype reactor, designed and optimized on the basis of validated models and measured material properties. Critical to the materials success is enhancing reaction kinetics and tuning the thermodynamics of the redox reactions so as to enable operation at temperatures compatible with reactor construction materials and solar concentrating optics under atmospheres conducive to high heat recovery. Both objectives will be pursued through the introduction of transition metal dopants and other substitutional cations into the host oxide, modifications which can further enhance solar absorptance. Beyond the manipulation of the fundamental materials properties, porous materials with engineered architectures will be employed to enhance thermochemical cycling characteristics, by, for example, providing high surface area for rapid reaction kinetics, ensuring minimal resistance to gas flow, and providing tunable solar absorption properties. A hierarchy of thermal and solar-thermal reactor models with increasing complexity will be employed to achieve the transition from benchtop experiments to a working prototype operated under concentrated solar radiation.  A thermochemical approach to solar energy storage has the potential for large-scale implementation and hence broad impact because the method employs relatively earth-abundant materials, and the efficiency can be extremely high. Beyond the advancement of a technically feasible approach, the proposal provides a multi-disciplinary and international environment for the education and training of the next generation of energy scientists and technologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FY 2010 EFRI-RESTOR Topic that supports this project was sponsored by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorates for Engineering (ENG), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and Computer &amp; Information Science and Engineering in collaboration with the US Department of Energy (DOE).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  This project aims at enabling solar fuels via a thermochemical approach. Concentrated sunlight is used to generate high temperatures, and the resulting heat is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, or carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide (a precursor to liquid transportation fuels) and oxygen. The reaction proceeds by making use of a reactive ceramic, cerium dioxide, that releases oxygen from its structure at high temperature (&gt; 1400C) and then reincorporates oxygen from a gas such as steam or carbon dioxide at lower temperature. Through materials and reactor development, significant steps were taken towards the ultimate goal of &gt; 10% efficiency in sunlight to fuel conversion efficiency.  Thermodynamic analyses indicate the solar thermochemical ceria-based redox cycle must be operated with a large temperature swing between reduction and oxidation (&gt;500&deg;C), 75% solid-phase heat recovery, and 80% gas-phase heat recovery to reach commercially viable water?splitting efficiencies above 10%.  An opportunity for an order of magnitude improvement in efficiency was identified in the form of a hybrid metal-oxide cycle in which the partial oxidation of methane over ceria enables co-production of syngas and hydrogen in separate streams.  Proof of concept experiments at UMN demonstrate high conversion of methane with high selectivity for syngas.  A prototype solar reactor which includes mechanisms for implementing solid phase heat recovery was prototyped and has undergone testing in the UMN simulator. While the full potential of the reactor has not yet been realized, it was successfully taken to a cavity temperature of 1440&deg; C with the heat recovery mechanism operational and to the intended cavity temperature of 1500&deg; C with the heat recovery mechanism temporarily disabled.  Fuel production was sustained for a period of two hours with cavity temperatures above 1400&deg;, and the maximum fuel production rate was 90 mL min-1.    In support of the reactor design, methods were established for creating porous ceria-based materials with ordered porosity on the micrometer scale and stability of these structures was demonstrated at temperatures approaching those required for reactor operation. Kinetic properties (diffusivity and surface reaction rates) were measured from similar ceria-based materials. These properties were found to exceed the requirements for achieving high fuel production rates. That is, the rate of fuel production is limited by the reactor operational conditions, not on the ability of the material to respond to change in temperature. In further support of the reactor design, mechanical properties of ceria have been obtained for temperatures up to 1500&deg;C.  These data extend and augment very limited and dated data available in the literature by 150-200&deg;C, a range where the properties change dramatically.  An improved model for analytically predicting the elasticity and strength of RPC foams has been developed to account for the various geometries resulting from different manufacturing processes.  The new models expand on previous work by allowing the cross-sectional shape of the ligaments constituting the foams to be varied, as well as accounting for the interior void occurring in the ligaments of some foams.  While the models were created to predict strengths of the foams used in the reactor, they are applicable to all ceramic foams.   Broader Impacts  The work has dramatically advanced the technological understanding of solar fuel generation by the thermochemical process. Solar fuels, in turn, stand to play a major role in a low-carbon, sustainable energy future.  The training provided by these research activities has been extensive. The project has involved more than a dozen graduate students and supported the completion of 6 doctoral and 1 master dissertation. More than a dozen undergraduates have also been engaged in the both the experimental and computational work.  Ov...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
