<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "Optics for Animation Artists" project is developing and assessing curricular materials for teaching optics to art students, in particular those majoring in animation, illustration, and related fields such as architecture, industrial design, graphic design, new media, and fine arts. The San Jose State University group brings together two physicists of considerable experience in this area with two very active animation and illustration artists, and the project is being completed within the globally recognized animation region of the San Francisco Bay area. Many within the exploding field of professional animators identify the technological facet of their craft as the most rapidly advancing (and now indispensible) component of their industry. Animation and illustration students are keenly aware of these trends and understand that their future careers require them to have an increasingly broad exposure to science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project creates visual assets (illustrations, videos, etc.), develops annotated slides, designs classroom demonstrations and studio activities, formulates lighting projects, and then combines all these elements into lecture packets and tutorials. Developed materials are being tested in three settings: as embedded lectures within existing art classes, as special Master Class workshops, and in a newly developed general education physics course designed specifically for animators and illustrators. The project is transforming one portion of undergraduate science education by bringing this aspect of physical science directly to a motivated and underserved audience, namely artists without the mathematics background required by advanced science courses. Modules being produced are subject to a careful assessment to enable a broad impact on U.S. art education and also to encourage their use in other liberal arts classes that focus on science and the arts.</AbstractNarration>
