<AbstractNarration>This project is to sponsor a workshop on ?Cooperative Autonomous Resilient Defenses in Cyberspace (CyberCARD)? which is to be held in the DC metro area over the two days of January 27-28, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this workshop is a report that outlines new research directions in the area of Cooperative Autonomous Resilient Defenses in Cyberspace. This report will become available on the web within two weeks after the conclusion of the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop consists of four tracks that span all areas of defenses in cyberspace:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Trustworthy cyber-physical systems and infrastructures: to provide robust control and communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Pervasive monitoring and analytics: to provide self-awareness and situational-awareness, particularly in real time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Attack-resilient system operation: to provide continuous services even under persistent attacks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Cooperative autonomous cyberspace defense: to enable systems to work together cooperatively with shared understanding</AbstractNarration>
