<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is for a collaborative effort of researchers from Christopher Newport University (CNU), Old Dominion University (ODU), and the University of Virginia (UVA) to develop and construct a longitudinally polarized proton and deuteron target. This target is intended to be used with the CLAS12 detector as an essential part of the high-priority PAC approved electron scattering experiments to study the internal structure of the nucleon as part of the 12 GeV program at Jefferson Lab (JLab). This will expand the spin structure program at JLab and be used to determine the contribution of the valance quarks to the properties of the nucleon. The target will use standard solid materials (15NH3, 15ND3, and possibly LiD) at ~1K and will be dynamically polarized in the 5 T field of the CLAS12 central solenoid. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design and construction of this target will have positive impacts on the training of future scientists because undergraduate and graduate students will be deeply involved in the process. This award will enable the knowledge transfer from experts at UVA to other researchers. A polarized target with the proposed specifications will have a strong impact on the research program at Jefferson Lab.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ultimate goal of nuclear physics is to gain a full understanding of the structure of matter.  Over the last half century, much knowledge has been gained from myriad experiments carried out at particle accelerators; indeed, using particle scattering from various targets elucidates the fundamental structure of the target constituents in much the same way as scattering (and subsequent refocusing) of visible light in a common microscope is used to understand the structure of the sample under investigation.  However, many important questions related to the structure of the particles that make up the atomic nucleus, i.e. protons and neutrons, remain unanswered.  In particular, we seek a better understanding of how the so-called "spin" of the proton and neutron is generated from the elementary objects which compose these particles, namely quarks and gluons. By "spin", we are referring to the intrinsic magnetic moment of all elementary particles that produce their magnetic properties (which, in turn, are the basis of spin resonance measurements, e.g. MRI in medicine and material science). With the recently completed upgrade of the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Newport News, VA; also known as "Jefferson Lab") to an electron beam energy of 12 GeV, a new avenue has opened up for high precision measurements of this spin structure of protons and neutrons.     A large program of measurements of this spin structure has been proposed and approved (by the Jefferson Lab Program Advisory Committee) for the new CLAS12 detector, which is presently being built in experimental Hall B at Jefferson Lab. At the heart of the program is a device that allows us to orient in a particular direction the spins of protons and deuterons (nuclei made of one proton and neutron each) &ndash; a so-called polarized target. This target uses the magnetic properties of protons and neutrons, together with a sophisticated system of extremely low temperature refrigerators, superconducting magnets, and high-frequency microwave power to align the direction of the proton and neutron spins either along or opposite to the direction of the incoming electron beam. We can then measure the different interactions of the electrons in the beam (which are also aligned in their spin direction) for the two different target spin directions to extract the sought-after information on the contribution from constituent quarks to the proton and/or neutron spin.     With the funding supplied by the NSF MRI grant "Collaborative Research: MRI-Consortium for the Development and Construction of a Longitudinally Polarized Proton and Deuteron Target for CLAS12 at Jefferson Lab", our group (consisting of three Universities &ndash; Christopher Newport University, Old Dominion University, and the University of Virginia) has acquired all the parts and, with help from Jefferson Lab scientists, completed the design and the assembly of the main components of such a polarized target.

A large international collaboration with over 300 members (the CLAS collaboration) will carry out the program of measurements enabled by this target, leading to fundamental new insights into the structure of the building blocks of all visible matter. If history is any guide, dozens of publications, as well as dozens of freshly minted Ph.D. scientists, will be the direct results from these efforts; future benefits for society may range from medical devices to new insights into material behavior.
