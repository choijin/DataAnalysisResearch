<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was an unexpected event that represents a major disturbance to coastal systems. Our understanding of how oil affects coastal wetland communities is incomplete. In particular, we know little about how oil affects the arthropod food web, about dose-response relationships between oil exposure and community response, and about long-term recovery from exposure. Moreover, the spatial extent, severity and persistence of this novel disturbance will provide new insights into how coastal wetlands function. Pennings' laboratory is well poised to examine how this novel disturbance will affect coastal wetland communities. His group has set up and sampled an experiment in 2009 at 22 coastal wetland sites ranging along the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida and the Atlantic Coast from Florida to Maine. This RAPID project will re-sample the same sites and plots in 2010 and future years to determine how the coastal food web is affected and recovers.  The PIs will test the hypotheses that: a) oil exposure will reveal that herbivorous insects and snails have strong negative effects on salt marsh plants; b) oil exposure will reveal the importance of 'transient' members of the arthropod food web; c) oil exposure will interact with fertilizer and wrack treatments to affect the arthropod food web. Because of its spatial extent and persistent effects, the oil spill represents a novel disturbance to coastal wetlands. Evaluating community responses to this disturbance will provide new insights into how the food web functions, leading to a deeper understanding of this critical system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salt marshes provide a variety of critical ecosystem services to humanity. New scientific insights provided by this project will help predict the future condition of coastal wetlands, which are threatened by a combination of sea level rise, eutrophication, and other stressors such as oil spills, including this largest spill in U.S. history. Public interest in the health of coastal ecosystems is intense, and has already led to interviews of Pennings by journalists following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The results of this RAPID project will be of considerable media interest. In addition, the project will train two graduate students and one undergraduate in ecosystems science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project was to determine how the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill affected arthropod (insect and spider) food webs in salt marshes.  The arthropods provide an important food web link to birds and fish, and also affect plant growth.  Up to twelve sites, some affected by oil and some unaffected, were sampled in August of 2010, as oil was coming ashore, and again in August 2011. Sampling was conducted in stands of Spartina alterniflora in salt marshes. At oiled sites, sampling was conducted in stands of Spartina that appeared healthy and were located a few meters behind stands that had been killed by oil.  Although we sampled in areas where plants were not killed, oil was present and visible on the sediments and plant stems.     The primary conclusions of the study were that salt marsh arthropods were both vulnerable and resilient to oil exposure. They were vulnerable in the sense that, in 2010, densities of arthropods were reduced by 50 % or more at sites exposed to oil, even though plants were not obviously affected.  In other words, the arthropods were killed more easily than the plants. This is important because it means that sites that appear healthy (the plants are alive) still could be affected (if arthropods were killed).  They were resilient in the sense that arthropods had largely recovered by 2011.  This is important because it means that salt marsh arthropods may be able to recover quickly from an oil spill if the spill is moderate rather than severe (does not kill plants) and if arthropods are able to reproduce or colonize from unaffected areas.     The project supported a graduate student, an undergraduate student, and a technician. The project led to three data sets that are publically available through the GCE LTER web site (http://gce-lter.marsci.uga.edu/), two publications in the scientific literature, one presentation at an international scientific meeting, and one web resource (a guide to identifying Spartina arthropods).
