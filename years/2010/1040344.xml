<AbstractNarration>1040344&lt;br/&gt;Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Integrated Microfabrication Laboratory (IML) is a 2,500 square foot Class 10 cleanroom on the Brigham Young University (BYU) campus. It is an open access facility that is freely available for use by anyone affiliated with the university. The facility supports externally- and internally-funded research projects, and both undergraduate and graduate hands-on instructional laboratories. Its toolset is focused on micro and nanofabrication processes for device fabrication in areas such as photonics, MEMS microfluidics, and sensors. The available processes include photolithography, thin film deposition, chemical-mechanical planarization, reactive ion etching, and various types of metrology. However, many current research projects require lithography on non-planar substrates, a capability they do not currently have. Other projects require writing in three dimensions, which also cannot be done using existing instrumentation. The goal of this proposal is the acquisition of a maskless, 3-dimensional direct-write microlithography system to address these critical needs. Direct-write lithography is a revolutionary new technique in which substrates are patterned using optical imaging rather than using photomasks. The addition of such an instrument as specified in this proposal would add state-of-the-art maskless lithography capability to the IML and complement existing infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Departments of Chemistry, Physics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering at Brigham Young University were awarded a Major Research Instrumentation Grant from NSF to purchase a Heidelberg Maskless Lithography System for both research and educational pursuits.  The system was installed during 2011-2012, and is now fully operational.  The instrument is capable of micron-sized to centimeter-sized lithography directly onto substrates, without the need for masks.  The system can also be used to produce masks for subsequent processing.  The system is automated allowing for rapid and hands-off work.   Several research groups now use this system for research in areas such as miniaturized mass spectrometry, microfluidics, micro-scale analytical separations, and novel materials.  For instance, superhydrophobic surfaces can be created by very small-scale patterning on a variety of surfaces, making a surface that repels water.  Thin-layer chromatography based on patterned arrays of carbon nanotubes show promise for faster analysis of organic reactions.  Smaller ion traps made using patterned ceramic plated can be used to produce a small, portable mass spectrometer for on-site chemical analysis.  Microfluidic devices made using the new system may someday be used for point-of-care clinical diagnosis.  The system is also used as part of the microfabrication classes in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at BYU.
