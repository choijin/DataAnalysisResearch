<AbstractNarration>The Quantum Control of Light and Matter Gordon Research Conference for 2011 is the seventh in a series, established in 1999.  The conference was created to foster and encourage the new and rapidly growing subfield of physical science known as Quantum Control (or Coherent Control).  This field was devoted initially to the physics and chemistry of phase-controlled optical fields to control unimolecular processes such as dissociation and ionization in gas phase.  In the intervening decade, the field has grown much larger, encompassing quantum coherence aspects in sub-femtosecond laser physics, ultrafast x-ray physics and materials science, quantum information science, as well as gas and liquid phase coherent control of chemical reactions, in particular photoassociation of ultracold molecules. The purpose of the conference is to integrate all these cross disciplinary subjects to a general theme of quantum control.</AbstractNarration>
