<AbstractNarration>This project is a collaboration among educators from Blackfeet Community College, Din√© College, Arizona State University, and Michigan State University to meet a need for culturally relevant geoscience assessment that complements place-based curriculum and pedagogy.  Cultural validation of geoscience assessment contributes to more equitable assessment of undergraduate geoscience students, provides educators with a relevant means for assessing their students' conceptual understanding, involves educators in designing assessment appropriate for diverse students, and contributes to the conversation about cultural validity of science assessment in the broader science-education community.  This project enhances Earth Systems Science Literacy by developing place-based assessment for diverse student populations engaged in learning geoscience through leveraging of local knowledge.  As part of this collaborative work, this project provides in-service training to Tribal College educators in assessment design (including proper question layout, language use, and importance of cultural and communication validity), establishes new relationships between Tribal College and university educators, and leverages existing scholarly networks to help facilitate access to research-based educational assessment in the geosciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary outcome of the Cultural Validation of Geoscience Assessment project was the development of pathways for collaborations among geoscience education researchers; Tribal College faculty and staff; Native American students at Tribal Colleges and universities; and other Native cultural experts. Personnel from two research-intensive state universities, one private comprehensive college, and two Tribal Colleges successfully collaborated to develop culturally-valid assessments for use in evaluation of learning in geoscience classrooms.  Pathways for collaboration between researchers and Tribal College personnel were established through the implementation of four workshops focused on (1) development of learning goals aligned with place-based and culturally-valid learning; (2) the theory of assessment design; (3) practical implementation of assessment questions; and (4) collaborative revision of assessment to allow real-world application in different Tribal contexts. Pathways for collaboration between researchers and Native students were established through an IRB-approved interview program.  The primary product is a tested method for designing culturally-valid geoscience assessment items in collaboration with Native communities within the northern Rocky Mountains and desert Southwest.  Resulting assessment items will be contributed to the Geoscience Concept Inventory, a national database for conceptual geoscience questions.  As part of this project, we have customized the online interface to allow for real-time testing of new questions with Tribal College students.  Results have thus far been disseminated by a refereed publication in a geoscience-education research journal, two presentations at national geoscience conferences, and one presentation at a Western regional geoscience conference.
