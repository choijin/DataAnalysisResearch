<AbstractNarration>Compared to mid-ocean ridges, the life cycle of back-arc spreading is short, averaging ~15 Ma of extension between arc-ward ridge jumps. Once initiated, back-arc volcanism evolves from relatively arc-like to relatively MORB-like compositions (Taylor and Martinez, 2003; Langmuir et al., 2006). Both of these observations are ascribed to the over-increasing distance to the back-arc spreading center from secondary convective upwelling above a subduction zone (Taylor and Martinez, 2003; Martinez and Taylor, 2006). This hypothesis makes substantial predictions for the geochemistry of any mantle rocks that may be exposed during the end phase of the magmatic system. Melting should become drier, productivity lower and lithospheric melt stagnation more common as a back-arc rift approaches the end of its life cycle. We propose to test this hypothesis using mineral chemistry of spinel and clinopyroxene, and whole rock Os isotopes from a substantial suite of abyssal peridotites recovered from a time line from the Godzilla Mullion in the Parace Vela Rift, the former back arc spreading center behind the Mariana arc (19-20 Ma). A declining magmatic budget would confirm the notion that secondary slab upwelling is the driving force in back-arc spreading in general, and suggests a mechanism for triggering ridge jumps. Preliminary mineral chemical data suggests that a coherent and interpretable melting signal is present in the Godzilla Mullion mantle rocks. Os isotopes will be used to determine whether the depleted signatures found are representative of the recent geodynamic configuration or are inherited ancient signals (e.g., Liu et al., 2008). This work will also provide an important comparison between in-situ back-arc and fore-arc mantle rocks, and serve as a petrologic characterization of mantle rocks supporting IODP drilling proposal 640-Full.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal furthers the basic understanding of core-complex style ocean crustal formation in a back-arc. This is an important new and still relatively poorly understood type of crust accretion. For this reason, it belongs to a class of basic geologic problems related to the formation of the ocean floor that can best be investigated via direct ocean floor observations. &lt;br/&gt;This project will support the career development of an excellent young female scientist, who will help mentor undergraduate and graduate student participants. She will also extend her current skill set in learning LA-ICP-MS and Os isotope techniques, and participate in research and teaching as appropriate. Grad student support is for an undergrad who began as an REU student on the sampling cruise. This project is part of a collaboration of long standing between the PI, the Japanese Research Institute, JAMSTEC, and the Japanese Hydrographic Office. Separate funding has been acquired for minority undergraduates, including two female undergraduates interested in pursuing work in this area for later graduate school. The UH is the second most diverse among 250 ranked universities (US News and World Report, 2010), serving the surrounding working class Houston community. This project provides an essential point of contact between students from traditionally underserved groups (~60%) at UH and the cutting edge of scientific research. The results of this study also flow directly into the teaching of the PI, who had 105 beginning mineralogy students in Fall 2009, a majority of whom were minorities. The impact on traditionally underserved communities is thus disproportionately large.</AbstractNarration>

They are this a window into the functioning of both he lower crust and the upper mantle of the ocean basins. Godzilla megamullion in the Philippine Sea <strong>(Figure 1)</strong> is special because it is A) the largest such megamullion, covering an area roughly the size of the state of Delaware, and it is in a back-arc spreading environment of the Parece Vela Rift, which opened from 20-~8 million years ago.</p> <p><strong>Morphology of Godzilla Megamullion</strong></p> <p>Over the past 20 Ma the direction of seafloor spreading in the Parece Vela Basin has rotated ~70? counterclockwise.  Associated withing this plate rotation with the morphology of magma-starved crust provides further insights into the tectonic development of this region and the largest oceanic core complex discovered to date: Godzilla Megamullion.  Regridded public seafloor morphology data <strong>(Figure 2) </strong>allow the creation of high-resolution bathymetric surfaces (250 &ndash; 250 m grid) by which seafloor features such as corrugations, faults, and rider blocks can be delineated.  To infer the direction and character of extension the spatial and temporal relationships of seafloor features were explored along with petrography of recovered rock samples and published seafloor ages of spreading-normal fault scarps and spreading-parallel corrugations.  The strike of seafloor the spreading normal seafloor volcanic ridges features changed from ~190? at ~20 Ma to ~120? at ~8 Ma in a Philippine Sea Plate fixed reference frame.  Most rotation occurred between 19 &ndash; 13 Ma, coincident with the cessation of back-arc spreading and its jump eastward at ~15 Ma <strong>(Figure 3)</strong>.  During rotation concomitant intraplate deformation was exemplified by crosscutting ridge parallel normal faults and seafloor volcanism.  On the oceanic core complex surface, we have identified three fault populations that formed both before and after formation of the surface of the Godzilla Megamullion: 1) master faults, 2) faults forming rider blocks, and 3) late-stage faults.  Late-stage faults on the detachment surface may be related to reaction-driven cracking caused by shallow hydrothermal circulation, a result of melt stagnation in the lithosphere as tectonic spreading rate decreases rapidly before termination.</p> <p><strong>Petrologic evolution of Godzilla Megamullion</strong></p> <p>Back arcs generally decline and become extinct before spreading jumps nearer to the arc. Standard models for this process of back arc spreading involve both subduction rollback and secondary convective influences. These spreading models make specific testable predictions regarding the magmatic decline of an aging back arc spreading center. Godzilla Megamullion formed in the declining last stages of spreading in of the Parece Vela Rift. Mantle peridotites recovered from exposures along the length of the megamullion structure thus reflect processes in the melting region beneath the rift as it evolved. Here we report variations in peridotite spinel mineral chemistry along Godzilla Megamullion in order to examine variations in melting processes with time. Peridotite spinels from Godzilla Megamullion document a back arc mantle with variable degrees of melt depletion and enrichments in TiO<sub>2</sub> very similar to mid-ocean ridge abyssal peridotites and different from peridotites derived from forearcs and many ophiolites (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). The Megamullion consists of three distinct regions: (Distal, Medial and Proximal to the paleo-rift, respectively,) with common petrotectonic styles that show  remarkably consistent secular variations of petrogenetic tracers.: As a time series these regions are first depleted, then fertile then heavily melt-impregnated. This petrogenetic variation is interpreted as the response of the magmatic system to the final stages of the life of the Parece Vela Rift, from a robust spreading ridge to a magma starved spreading ridge with a thickening lithosphere, and finally to a nearly amagmatic ridge similar in some respects to magma-poor segments of ultra-slow spreading ridges. The process sequence of ridge decline, death and rebirth (<strong>Figure 5</strong>) is predicted to be a common feature of back arc evolution.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>This study has supported the work of about a dozen undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs, including participation in cruises, summer research laboratory analytical work, land-based field work and participation in about seven international conferences.
