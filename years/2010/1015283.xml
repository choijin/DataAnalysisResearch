<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Manipulation and Assembly of Polymer Vesicles by Application of an Electric Field  Diagnosing diseases can be an expensive and timely process.  In developed countries with a strong medical infrastructure, complex and time consuming lab procedures are required that can make diagnosis incredibly costly to the average consumer.  In third world countries that lack infrastructure and clean laboratory resources, disease diagnosis is nearly impossible.  In order to increase the speed and decrease the cost of diagnosis, a simplified mechanism is required.  The far-reaching goals of this research are to aid in the creation of a small, hand-held device that could take a few drops of blood and complete a series of rigorous diagnostic tests to determine the type of diseases carried by the patient.  Optimally, this device would be the size of an iPod, be simple enough to use for any operator, and be able to test for multiple diseases at one time.  The research completed in Beijing, China works primarily towards a very basic understanding of creating this lab-on-a-chip.  One way to manipulate blood cells and testing markers is through the use of electric fields.  Therefore, this grant will study the way in which polymer vesicles are transported under the application of electric field.  Polymer vesicles could be used to encapsulate important markers which are then released after the application of an electric field with a specific frequency and voltage.  In this work, first various polymers and synthesis of vesicles were studied with four optimum samples chosen to be studied further.  Next, the behavior of the polymer vesicles was observed under an alternating current electric field.  Polymer movement, from areas of high electric field to low electric field strength and vice versa (known as dielectrophoresis) were documented.  Finally, attempts to apply a frequency and voltage that would be sufficient for encapsulation release were studied.  As a result, the polymer blends of polystyrene-co-polyethylene oxide were studied at various chain lengths for each polymer.  It was found that all three polymer blends tested could be manipulated to travel to pre-determined positions when applying an appropriate electric field.  However, due to the stable nature of polymer micelles, it was impossible to apply a strong enough electric field force to break open the vesicle and release the encapsulated particle.   Still, polymer vesicles provide a very useful and interesting medium for lab-on-a-chip technologies.  It is expected that this research will contribute to the greater understanding of molecular responses to electric fields and possibly be implemented in future research towards diagnostic technologies.
