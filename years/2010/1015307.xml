<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Laura Reynolds  EAPSI Japan Project Outcomes Report                 Seagrasses are submerged, flowering plants found around the world. These plants provide many valuable ecosystem services including improved water quality through sediment and nutrient filtration, high production rates, and a suitable habitat for a number of ecologically and economically important invertebrate, fish, and marine mammal species. There is some evidence genetically diverse assemblages of these plants provide more ecosystem services than less genetically diverse assemblages.              Because seagrasses inhabit nearshore, shallow areas, they are often disturbed or destroyed by human activity: mostly nutrient and pollutant inputs into the water. These anthropogenic disturbances are resulting in large losses or seagrasses worldwide, and scientists are attempting to mitigate these losses through restoration.              My dissertation work at the Virginia Coast Reserve LTER site has shown that restoration of eelgrass (Zostera marina) using seed maintains the genetic diversity of the donor meadows and that using a genetically diverse donor can increase both the diversity of the restoration and the amount of ecosystem services that restoration provides. That research has also shown that meadows maintain that diversity over time, as restorations age. This maintenance over time is important because it means that investments into making restorations genetically diverse will have impacts for many years into the future.
