<AbstractNarration>The exceptionally preserved Fezouata Biota from the Lower Ordovician of Morocco: a unique window into the Cambro-Ordovician faunal transition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Derek Briggs, EAR-1053247&lt;br/&gt;Yale University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Exceptionally preserved biotas, which preserve more than just the hard shells of marine animals, offer critical insights into the history of life.  Such biotas are relatively common in rocks of Cambrian age, but our knowledge of life during the period that follows, the Ordovician, is almost entirely based on the evidence of shells alone.  This situation has improved dramatically with the discovery of the Fezouata Biota in south-eastern Morocco ? the first early Ordovician exceptionally preserved fossil assemblage from a normal, open marine setting. These Ordovician animals show considerable diversity and contain a large number of forms typical of older Cambrian Burgess Shale-type deposits as well as more modern looking creatures. These findings show that the apparent disappearance of Burgess Shale-type fossils after the Middle Cambrian is not a result of extinction and replacement, but simply a reflection of the rarity of suitable settings for their preservation in Ordovician rocks. New discoveries in Morocco indicate that animals characteristic of the Cambrian continued to have a considerable impact on the biodiversity and ecology of marine communities more than 20 million years later, into the Ordovician. In addition, the presence of a number of advanced animals, like horseshoe crabs, in the Fezouata Biota indicates that these groups radiated much earlier than we knew, before the beginning of the Ordovician. The new Moroccoan discoveries will allow us to explore whether the diversification of major animal groups during the Cambrian (the Cambrian Explosion) and the subsequent Ordovician radiation (the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event) were separate events, or simply a continuation of the same process. In addition we will carry out field-work and analyses of specimens to determine the environments of deposition and processes leading to the preservation of the soft-bodied fossils, allowing us to predict where new examples are likely to be found in the future.  &lt;br/&gt;The project will provide unique learning opportunities for graduate students through interdisciplinary research in an overseas area of spectacular exposure.  It will enrich courses on the history of life for non-major undergraduates and on exceptional preservation for graduates.  The Moroccan fossils will be the subject of a temporary exhibit at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, and of Museum webpages for the general public.  They will continue to attract the attention of the wider media.  The project will involve collaboration with researchers and students from many nations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project investigated a deposit containing exceptionally preserved fossils in rocks of early Ordovician age (~470-485 million years ago) in the Anti-Atlas region of southeastern Morocco. The fossil record of marine life consists mainly of hard parts ? shells, bones and teeth ? but surveys of modern oceans indicate that only about 40% of marine animals have biomineralized hard parts. The creatures that make up this other 60% decay rapidly and require exceptional conditions for fossilization. Such conditions are rare but particularly so in rocks of Ordovician age, the period of geological time immediately following the rapid appearance of the major groups of animals during the so-called Cambrian explosion.</p> <p>Our project investigated newly discovered occurrences of exceptionally preserved fossils in the Fezouta formations north of Zagora in Morocco. The Fezouata shales are remarkable in that they extend over several hundred square kilometers and through a sedimentary sequence over 1000 meters in thickness. The Fezouata fossils are an important resource for paleontologists and evolutionary biologists and also attract interest from a general audience. More than 8,000 specimens are held by the Yale Peabody Museum where they are available for study. Photographs and data are available through collections portals, including the Peabody Museum online collection database (<a href="http://collections.peabody.yale.edu/search/Search/Advanced?collection=Invertebrate%20Paleontology">http://collections.peabody.yale.edu/search/Search/Advanced?collection=Invertebrate%20Paleontology</a>), the NSF-funded Integrated Digitized Biocollections portal (<a href="https://www.idigbio.org/portal/search">https://www.idigbio.org/portal/search</a>), and GBIF, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?q=">https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?q=</a>). Specimens will be included in new displays planned for the upcoming renovation and expansion of all the Yale Peabody Museum exhibits.</p> <p>We explored the nature of the Fezouata animals and investigated how they came to be preserved. The fossils include the range of shelly fossils typical of Ordovician seas: sponges, trilobites, echinoderms, molluscs, brachiopods, graptolites. In addition, however, there is a diversity of soft-bodied animals, including a number that would not look out of place in Cambrian deposits such as the famous Burgess Shale of British Columbia. The Fezouata shales preserve the most diverse fauna of soft-bodied creatures yet discovered in Ordovician rocks. Most striking among these are the giant radiodontids, recognized for more than 30 years as top predators during the Cambrian, when they were represented by forms such as <em>Anomalocaris</em> and <em>Hurdia</em>. The new Ordovician radiodontids include <em>Aegirocassis benmoulae</em>, which is unusual in being a filter feeder. One near-complete individual is preserved in a giant concretion nearly one meter long and isolated elements indicate that <em>Aegirocassis</em> reached lengths of over 2 meters. This discovery is evidence that giant filter feeders were important even in the early oceans. A second example of a remarkable fossil from the Fezouata shales is a small slug-like form called <em>Calvapilosa kroegeri</em>. The head region is protected by a single shell and the body is covered by hollow spines. A number of specimens preserve a series of teeth forming a radula, the feeding organ of molluscs. <em>Calvapilosa</em> provides a link between living forms such as chitons (coat-of-mail shells) and the more familiar snails and clams, providing evidence of the likely morphology of the ancestor of living molluscs. The Fezouata shales preserve not only animals that look like throwbacks to the Cambrian; there are also groups that were previously unknown in rocks as old as early Ordovician. Horseshoe crabs, for example, some 25 million years older than the previous oldest known examples, are some of the most abundant forms in the Fezouata shales.</p> <p>The discovery of the Fezouata biota has significantly changed our understanding of the early evolution of life in the oceans. The widespread Fezouata shales echo conditions that were more common in older Cambrian rocks. They remind us that the fossil record is biased by the availability of rocks that favor the preservation of soft tissues. The Fezouta shales provide a critical source of data on the major diversification of life that followed the appearance of the major animal groups in the Cambrian, the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/21/2018<br>      Modified by: Derek&nbsp;Briggs</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1053247/1053247_10118489_1542813009174_Aegirocassisreconstruction--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1053247/1053247_10118489_1542813009174_Aegirocassisreconstruction--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Reconstruction of Aegirocassis benmoulae"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1053247/1053247_10118489_1542813009174_Aegirocassisreconstruction--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Reconstruction of Aegirocassis benmoulae"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Reconstruction of Aegirocassis benmoulae by Marianne Collins</div> <div class="imageCredit">Van Roy, Daley and Briggs 2015 Nature 522, 77-80</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Derek&nbsp;Briggs</div> <div class="imageTitle">Reconstruction of Aegirocassis benmoulae</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1053247/1053247_10118489_1542813205187_Calvapilosamodel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1053247/1053247_10118489_1542813205187_Calvapilosamodel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Reconstruction of Calvapilosa kroegeri"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1053247/1053247_10118489_1542813205187_Calvapilosamodel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Reconstruction of Calvapilosa kroegeri"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Reconstruction of Calvapilosa kroegeri, model by Esben Horn.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Vinther et al. 2017 Nature 542, 471-474</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Derek&nbsp;Briggs</div> <div class="imageTitle">Reconstruction of Calvapilosa kroegeri</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1053247/1053247_10118489_1542813761168_Fezouatafieldphoto2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1053247/1053247_10118489_1542813761168_Fezouatafieldphoto2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fezouata field photo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1053247/1053247_10118489_1542813761168_Fezouatafieldphoto2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fezouata field photo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">View towards the north from Tigzigzaouine Hill, west of Oued Ezegzaou, c. 25 km north of the town of Zagora.
