Using those patterns, computer algorithms called classifiers were trained to automatically detect metalanguage in text. A small set of clues in vocabulary and grammar were found to be very common and accurate as predictors of metalanguage. Further research on this topic will make it possible for computers to parse and "understand" the information conveyed by metalanguage, leading to improvements in technologies such as conversational computer interfaces, language tutoring systems, and automated dictionary building tools.
