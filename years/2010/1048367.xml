<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor Klaus Theopold and colleagues Joseph Fox and Charles Riordan from University of Delaware will acquire a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with variable temperature capabilities, a CCD detector and a molybdenum source. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) computationally guided design of catalysts for fluoroolefin polymerization, (b) dioxygen activation with nickel complexes, (c) asymmetric catalysts based on metal-salens, (d) synthesis and structural characterization of lanthanide based silicides and germanides, and (e) use of transition metal catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and will also be used for collaborations with researchers and students at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte, the University of Hawaii, James Madison University, Gettysburg College, Haverford College and Widener University.</AbstractNarration>
