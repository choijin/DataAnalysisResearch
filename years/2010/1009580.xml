<AbstractNarration>Dr. Dan Stinebring of Oberlin College will develop new techniques for the analysis of pulsar timing data.  Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars which emit beams of radio radiation.  Accurate timing of detected radio pulses probes stellar physics, and can in principle detect gravitational waves produced by massive black holes in the cores of galaxies.  In this project, Dr. Stinebring and his students will explore propagation effects as these radio pulses pass through interstellar gas between the pulsars and the Earth.  Understanding these effects is important, since they can hamper high precision timing of pulsars by introducing random noise into the timing signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is anticipated to benefit the scientific community by improving the ability to detect gravitational waves.  The analysis methods will also aid the understanding of the interstellar gas, including how it is distributed in space and how turbulence operates within it.  Dr. Stinebring will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students, who will work closely with him in the process of data taking and analysis.</AbstractNarration>
