<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to create new DNA-based manufacturing technologies that produce nanostructures capable of efficiently harvesting solar energy. This research will elucidate the underlying physics and chemistry that are pertinent to the oligonucleotide-based nanocrystal synthesis and molecular recognition processes. Theoretical modeling will be developed to guide experimental realization, generating optimal conditions for large-scale nanocrystal production. The fundamental understanding of DNA-programmed manufacturing and assembly will enable the formation of dynamic nanostructures that can convert solar energy through successive system regenerations, similar to what is seen in natural photosystems. The manufactured nanostructures will also serve as a novel platform to study electron and energy transfer mechanisms at the nanoscale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the outcome of this research will lead to new manufacturing technologies that transform solar energy utilization. The nucleic acid-based manufacturing and bio-inspirational concept of system regeneration will develop a new paradigm for harvesting solar energy with impacts on the photovoltaic industry. The overall goal of this project is to integrate cutting-edge research and education for sustained impacts on the nanomanufacturing field for alternative energy, while training the next generation of engineers. The project activities will (1) provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to learn and conduct pioneering science and engineering in a multidisciplinary environment, (2) increase participation of women and underrepresented minority students, and (3) make strong impacts on K-12 students through active outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>
