<AbstractNarration>The 52nd Annual Maize Genetics Conference will be held March 18 - 21, 2010 at Riva del Garda (Italy). At this conference, members of the maize community present and discuss their most recent research results covering a wide range of topics including classical genetics, molecular genetics, and genomics. The Maize Genetics Conference provides an outstanding opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas as talks or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers. The funding provided by NSF helps defray the costs of participation of students from the U.S. scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
