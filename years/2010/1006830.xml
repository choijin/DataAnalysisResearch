<AbstractNarration>This project will bring together representatives from the herbarium (plant museum) community along with affiliated computer scientists and information technologists to develop a national plan to make information available from this group. The group will focus on establishing community best practices to acquire information, to use this information and to disseminate the information to the public. Curators will develop a sustainable plan to mobilize the community and seek funds to meet community goals.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The herbarium community has four main long term goals: 1) digitize all herbarium collections in the country by the year 2020, 2) enhance research, teaching and service potentials of herbarium curators and affiliates, 3) recruit students from underrepresented groups to careers in the herbarium sciences, to provide a continuing brain trust in the 21st century, and 4) provide information to the public, K-12 teachers and students, college and university faculty and students, scientists, corporations and decision-makers in effective and useful formats. The herbarium community offers a tremendous potential database for systematists, ecologists, climatologists, and evolutionary biologists.  This meeting will nationalize ongoing efforts and integrate local and regional progress to provide herbarium data at a continental scale through the United States Virtual Herbarium.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Museums across the country have millions of preserved plant and animal specimens.  Plant museums (called herbaria) have flattened plant specimens glued to paper accompanied by information about where they were collected, who collected them and when they were collected.  Many herbaria have specimens of fungi, algae, mosses, liverworts and lichens, along with the plant collections.  These collections are an irreplaceable national resource, with many of the collections from the past two centuries taken from areas that are now urban or suburban, offering a "time lapse" picture of plants and natural habitats across the United States.   There are more than 800 herbaria in the United States that collectively hold over 90 million specimens.  These herbaria are mostly associated with universities and colleges and are used by scientists, students, scientists from state and federal agencies and corporation scientists.  Herbaria holdings range in size from a few thousand specimens to more than one million specimens at a single institution and are generally accessible by the public, but the information about these collections is not easily obtained, short of visiting each collection.  The US Virtual Herbarium is a national effort designed to make these herbarium specimens available electronically, to allow scientists and students easy access to specimen images and label data.  With funding from the National Science Foundation, a US Virtual Herbarium workshop was held on Feb 23-25, 2010 at the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.  The goals outlined in the workshop proceedings were to make the collections electronically available within the next ten years (2020).  Coupled with this broad goal was a secondary goal of providing appropriate tools to curators and affiliated scientists to clean, explore and enrich both the physical and the virtual collections.  A third goal followed from the first and second, to make specimen-based information available to the public in usable forms for K-12 schools, corporations, decision-makers and other scientists.  Sixty-four workshop participants from across the United States with expertise in botany, taxonomy, systematics, biology, ecology, specimen curation, biodiversity conservation, biological informatics, information technology, and computer science worked together to refine the US Virtual Herbarium (USVH) concept by identifying issues and tasks associated with its development and defining the organizational and technological structure needed to support it. Participants represented each of the four largest free standing herbaria (New York Botanical Garden, Missouri Botanical Garden, The Field Museum, and Smithsonian Institution), small and mid-sized herbaria, existing herbarium networks, the iPlant Project, the National Park Service (NPS), and the US Geological SurveyÆs National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) program, the US node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).  In terms of organization, workshop participants strongly endorsed working with and through the existing structure of regional consortia/alliances/associations of herbaria, several of which are already active and were represented at the workshop. This was seen as the most effective mechanism for disseminating information and sharing and leveraging existing expertise and resources among participating herbaria because it enables the project to build on, and promote, existing collaborations. The basic structure proposed for the USVH consisted of an advisory group composed of individuals nominated by the regional consortia, using procedures of their choice, and representatives of selected groups such as the US National Park Service, that have a vested interest in the herbarium community. In addition there would be a USVH steering committee of 7-9 individuals, most of whom would be elected but with 2 positions reserved for nominees of the USGS and the US node to GBIF.
