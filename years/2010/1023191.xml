<AbstractNarration>This research will explore a new method of deciphering the history of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the Pliocene and Pleistocene by measuring the cosmogenic isotope beryllium-10 in sediment cores previously collected off southern and eastern Greenland by the Ocean Drilling program. Beryllium-10 is produced by cosmic rays in exposed rock. The premise of this investigation is that Be-10 accumulates in surface rock during times of ice-sheet retreat and is eroded and deposited in marine sediment during times of ice-sheet growth. The isotopic time series will include Pleistocene and Pliocene sediment stretching back 4 to 6 million years, possibly beyond the onset of continental-scale glaciation in Greenland. The investigators hope to 1) constrain the time at which continental glaciation on Greenland began, 2) estimate the relative areal extent of the ice sheet through time, 3) determine the erosivity and sediment transport efficiency of the ice sheet, and 4) constrain the erosion rate of Greenland prior to the onset of glaciation. Understanding Greenland Ice Sheet dynamics in the past (particularly the extent of deglaciation and the timescale of regrowth) is key to understanding how the ice sheet might behave in the future. A central part of the project is the training of a young postdoctoral research associate, and two undergraduate students will work on the project as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Greenland Ice Sheet has covered much of the continent for millions of years; yet, its history beyond the last glaciation, which ended about 10,000 years ago, is poorly known.  In order to understand the long-term history of the Greenland Ice Sheet, we conducted a variety of experiments including analyzing sediment deposited offshore and retrieved using sediment cores and collecting and analyzing rock and sediment from around Greenland.  To make our analysis, we extracted isotopes of Aluminum and Beryllium and measured their composition using ultrasensitive mass spectrometers. These isotopes, Aluminum-26 and Beryllium-10, are produced predominately near EarthÆs surface and are very rare at depth. Our work has revealed a long and complex history of glaciation, erosion, and paradoxically landscape preservation on Greenland.     Marine sediment records progressive erosion of Greenland over millions of years.  The long-lived pre-glacial landscape has in many places now been deeply scoured by erosive glacial ice leaving little Aluminum-26 and Beryllium-10 for us to measure both in the uppermost, young marine sediments and in the sand carried away from Greenland today in thundering meltwater streams.  Our analysis indicates that for most of the last million years, the Greenland Ice Sheet had behaved similarly to today.  But in some places, where the ice sheet is cold and frozen to the the rock below, itÆs a whole different story.  If the ice does not slide and move on a film of liquid water or sediment, it cannot erode rock.  In these more northern locations, we find ancient landscapes, preserved over millions of years under ice.     Our work has illuminated the long and varied history of the ice sheet while training two students, a post-doctoral associate, and developing the career of a young scientist.  We have shared our results in numerous publications and with the public in news stories that resulted from our finding ancient soil buried beneath 3000 meters of Greenland ice.
