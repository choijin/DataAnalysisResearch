<AbstractNarration>Technical: The objectives of this project are (i) to determine the changes in interface electronic structure and properties as one scales from planar to nanowire geometries for organic and inorganic materials bound to Ge, and (ii) to examine, more generally, the impact of surface/interface chemical modification on hybrid heterostructure device properties, using both planar and nanowire configurations. The goal is to develop the conceptual tools, synthetic methodologies, and engineering strategies needed to design and chemically modify interfaces central to multi-component nanoscale devices. The research will concentrate on atomic and monolayer scale 'band alignment' as device geometries scale from planar to nanowire. The research will address key interface issues that must be understood when these materials are combined in nanoscale heterostructures. Studies will examine interfacial interactions of Ge with organic and inorganic layers in both nanowire and planar structures. The project will explore modification of the interfaces to: i) control oxidation, ii) passivate surface and interface defects, iii) tune band alignment (work function engineering), and iv) bond chemical species to interfaces for specific functionality. Expected outcomes include: A determination of the atomic and electronic structure of nanoscale interfaces; the establishment of an understanding of how chemistry and electronic structure differ between nanowire interfaces and their conventional planar analogues; and development of tools to control the electronic structure of interfaces and the resultant device properties by atomic and molecular modification/functionalization. High-resolution characterization tools that will be employed include surface, thin film, and nanoscale variants of: (i) photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopy, (ii) high resolution ion scattering, (iii) scanning probe microscopy, iv) electron microscopy (with energy loss spectroscopy), (v) optical spectroscopy, and (vi) electronic transport. Bilayer, multilayer and simple prototype devices will be examined. Results will be characterized in terms of current understanding of interface control, thus elucidating the important variables of size and dimensionality of the material constituents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. Research findings are expected to impact a range of technological applications including CMOS nanoelectronics, photovoltaics, organic electronics, and chemical/biochemical sensors. A solid fundamental understanding of interfacial materials chemistry and physics of ultrathin films and nanowires is expected. The materials being explored offer low-cost and/or higher performance alternatives to traditional devices. A strong set of educational activities include: (i) the development of new courses in energy materials with a focus on interfaces, (ii) the expansion of Rutgers student internships and industrial exchanges, (iii) the development of a new set of interactions between Rutgers and African institutions (facilitated in part by a new NSF-IGERT), and (iv) the development of nano and surface science oriented educational modules. The modules will target middle school students and teachers, coupling with the Liberty Science Center and the Rutgers Math-Science Learning Center. Outreach will also emphasize the mentoring of women and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

The primary focus of the research was to examine atomic/molecular structure, chemistry, thermodynamic stability, and electronic structure at interfaces.  This required the use of surface and thin film methods, as well as some "bulk" methods that reveal information about interfaces. The broad goal of the program was to develop conceptual tools, synthetic methodologies, and engineering strategies needed to design and chemically modify interfaces central to multi-component nanoscale devices. Intellectual merit objectives of the work included:  A determination of the atomic and electronic structure of nanoscale interfaces. The establishment of an understanding of how chemistry and electronic structure differ between nanowire/nanostructure interfaces and their conventional planar analogues. Development of tools to control the electronic structure of interfaces and the resultant device properties by atomic and molecular modification/functionalization.   Most of these objectives were achieved, although some of materials systems explored were different from what was originally envisioned.  The four sub-projects (materials systems) supported by this award are outlined below.  In ZnO-organic hybrid PV materials work, one exciting result has involved studies of electropolymerization of polythiophenes within a high-density ZnO nanowire matrix.  We demonstrated a new method of growing highly integrated hybrid nanostructured materials, and we showed how the chemistry of electro-polymerization impacted materials and device properties and efficiency. The electropolymerization ensures optimal coverage and interaction, a problem in past studies of spin-coated or drop-cast organic deposition. We now better understand how electro-polymerization is related to electrical connectivity of the polymer to the ZnO. The films were used in model photovoltaic devices. We also performed careful studies of interfaces between PT and ZnO as a function of electrochemical anion species, time, voltage, current, etc.  Both chemistry and film structure did have a correlation with PV efficiency (and band offset between materials).  Another project involve studies of rubrene and it's rather unique properties (it holds a record for the highest reproducible hole mobility in organics).  Our rubrene work was the first to use SIMS to quantify oxygen content and depth profiles, and to clarify the mechanism of oxygen reactivity of this material.  In our rubrene oxidation studies, the main result was that oxidation occurs primarily at defects (including steps) on pure high quality single crystals, and that the defects once formed resulted in further oxidation in the form of defect propagation.  Defects grew into the film, resulting in oxidation as much as one micron into the bulk, while much of the surface between steps remains defect/oxidation free. This work has important broader impact implications for device stability.  Production of high quality, high conductivity graphene remains a major challenge for the translation of graphene from academic laboratories to production of devices that incorporate graphene.  Our graphene exfoliation work with done in collaboration with Prof. Huixin He of Rutgers-Newark has demonstrated a creative new way to exfoliate graphene without resulting in a high oxygen content.  This leads to a higher mobility graphene sheet and a better optical behavior. We believe that our methods development work in this project may have broader impact in electronic, photonic and photoacoustic applications if scale up can be efficiently achieved.  Finally, in our LAO/STO project, we have shown through careful ion scattering and related studies that interdiffusion often occurs at oxi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
