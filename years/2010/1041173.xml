<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;During cell division, the cytoskeleton reorganizes itself rapidly to align and separate chromosomes, and then cleave the cell in two. Cell division itself is mediated by contractile proteins, whose assembly is controlled by the signaling protein Rho. The mitotic apparatus, which sorts the chromosomes, is based on microtubules, and somehow provides the spatial information to pattern Rho activity, and hence contractile protein assembly, in space and time. A long-standing hypothesis proposes that molecular motors carry signals along microtubules of the mitotic apparatus to tell the cell surface where to contract. This project will directly test this hypothesis by investigating the quantitative conditions under which motors of the kinesin family can translate the information immanent within the rapidly-changing microtubule array into a pattern of Rho signaling at the cell surface. To do this, the investigators will create hybrids between motor proteins and photoactivatable fluorescent proteins and measure their biochemical properties. They will measure motor motility parameters by observing single motors attaching to and moving along single microtubules in vitro. These same hybrid motor probes will be introduced into cells, and live imaging will be used to measure their dynamic behavior during cell division at high resolution. Meanwhile, advanced 3D computer simulations will be developed to predict how these same quantified agents should behave in the context of the whole cell, either normally or when the geometry of the microtubule array is experimentally altered; in turn, assays in live cells will test these predictions. By combining live-cell imaging, single-molecule measurement, and computer simulation of hypothetical outcomes, the project will produce an account of the physically-plausible conditions under which the cell's toolkit of molecular motors and cytoskeletal assembly regulators could add up to a mechanism for robust spatial pattern formation during cell division. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will train undergraduate and graduate students in high-resolution live-cell microscopy. The research also involves development of a sophisticated agent-based computer simulation program that is expected to have broad application to many other fundamental problems in cell biology, beyond the specific research goals of this project. This software and computer code will be made freely available to other researchers. Likewise, the research is expected to produce several useful molecular probes that will facilitate broader studies of the behavior of the cytoskeleton by other researchers. These probes will be distributed freely to researchers using Addgene.org, a non-profit plasmid repository which makes constructs available for the cost of shipping. Finally, this research will generate, as by-products of the specific experiments conducted, numerous microscope images and videos which the investigators will make freely available via both lab websites and public collections for educational and other research use.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the course of this project the Wordeman Lab (University of Washington, Seattle) has created a series of kinesin motor proteins that have been evaluated in vitro for motility parameters such as velocity, processivity and dwell time. These proteins are Kif18A, Kif4A and Kif22, Kif9 and Kif25. We have analyzed the motility of these proteins in vitro and also evaluated their distribution in mammalian cultured cells. We have purified these proteins for microinjection into echinoderms as part of the Collaborative Research portion of the proposal. In collaboration with George von Dassow (University of Oregon), we found that these motors localized correctly in echinoderms (Image 1) and exhibit rapid relocalization using fluorescence recovery after photoactivation. These proteins can be used to evaluate the advection of motor proteins in large cells (such as eggs) versus small somatic cells. In other words, do the motility parameters associated with the motors enable them to travel to their sites of actions in very large cells (100 microns in diameter) compared to their localization in small cells (15 microns in diameter). We have also prepared instantaneously relocalizing versions of MCAK/Kif2C, Kif18A, Kif25 and Kif9 to evaluate the rapamycin-dependent relocalization of these motors and compare them to natural advection in living cells. These constructs also allow us to evaluate the instantaneous changes in microtubule (MT) assembly dynamics when MT regulators and motors are rapidly relocalized. Image 2 shows the instantaneous relocalization of the kinesin MCAK/Kif2C upon addition of rapamycin. We found that instantaneous relocalization of these motors to neutral regions of the cell (such as from the microtubules to the plasma membrane) significantly influenced microtubule assembly rates. In the case of MCAK/Kif2C, microtubule assembly rates were significantly increased. We hypothesize that an instantaneous rise in microtubule assembly rates is accommodated by a decrease in microtubule nucleation rates. This is difficult to unambiguously confirm in live cells because microtubule nucleation and length are difficult to impossible to quantify. However, we have used in silico modeling using the Skeledyne program developed by Garret Odell to predict how increased microtubule assembly rates affect microtubule nucleation (Image 3). In conclusion, these data show how kinesins regulate microtubule dynamics in both time and space. In silico modeling of complex microtubule assembly kinetics is a valuable tool to use when existing assays do not have the sensitivity to measure parameters in live cells. The observations correlating changes in microtubule assembly rates with nucleation capacity are significant because alterations in microtubule assembly rates have been correlated with chromosome instability and cancer development. These data reveal the underlying mechanism for chromosome instability arising from subtle alterations in microtubule dynamic parameters. Finally, the project has assembled all the tools to investigate the advection of motors in small and large cells. In the future we plan to further investigate, using microinjected motors and in silico modeling, the relationship between protein levels, diffusion and subcellular localization in large versus small cells.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/18/2015<br>      Modified by: Linda&nbsp;Wordeman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <l...]]></DRECONTENT>
