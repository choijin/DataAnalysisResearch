<AbstractNarration>This collaboration among TCUP colleges Cankdeska Cikana Community College Community &lt;br/&gt;College, CCCC, Ft. Berthold Community College, FBCC, Turtle Mountain Community College , &lt;br/&gt;TMCC, and Sitting Bull College, SBC, and North Dakota State University, NDSU, is the &lt;br/&gt;culmination of more than 11 years of active engagement in STEM education on the reservation, &lt;br/&gt;including a year-long academic sabbatical at TMCC by an engineering professor.  It supports a &lt;br/&gt;tribal college vision of expanded life-choices for reservation residents that could provide more &lt;br/&gt;technical competency for tribal decision-making, infrastructure improvement and the &lt;br/&gt;opportunity for personal and tribal advancement without loss of cultural heritage.  For NDSU &lt;br/&gt;the benefits would include expanded participation of culturally diverse students, shared &lt;br/&gt;fulfillment of the 1862/1994 land grant mission, improved faculty-student communication and &lt;br/&gt;interaction and expansion of the talent pool entering STEM professions.  The heart of the &lt;br/&gt;proposal is the interaction of tribal high school, tribal college, mainstream University and &lt;br/&gt;engineering profession stakeholders to facilitate the recruitment, education and support of &lt;br/&gt;tribal students to acquire and hone the skills that will allow them to enter the engineering &lt;br/&gt;profession or contribute in some other fashion to their communities and the nation.  The &lt;br/&gt;proposal will accomplish this vision by impacting students through interactions with faculty/ &lt;br/&gt;staff, curriculum and supporting functions/agencies.  All of this will be accomplished in a &lt;br/&gt;culturally supportive fashion.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The North Dakota Pre-Engineering Education Collaboration: 2+2+2+Infinity: Pipeline for Tribal Pre-Engineering to Society, PEEC: PTiPS, started September 1, 2010. It linked four tribal colleges in the state, Turtle Mountain Community College, Belcourt, ND, Cankdeska Cikana Community College, Fort Totten, ND, Sitting Bull College, Fort Yates, ND and Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College (formerly Fort Berthold College) in New Town ND, with the state&rsquo;s 1868 land-grant institution, North Dakota State University, in Fargo, ND. These institutions are as spread out as the islands of Hawaii, and the winds here can blow as hard as on the ocean. There were 2 significant goals to the project: one was to establish a sustainable pathway for recruiting and supporting Native American students to graduate from accredited engineering programs and enter into the profession, perhaps helping their local community. The 2<sup>nd</sup> objective was to inform the tribal community of the utility of having community members within the engineering profession.</p> <p>Because of the rural nature of the state of North Dakota, and the very small numbers of Native American students considering engineering as a career choice, the educational process had to consider ways to unite and support these students across hundreds of miles of separation in ways that allow them to maintain identities in their own communities while acknowledging challenges of engineering education anywhere. As a result, the program naturally involved tribal community colleges in the development of engineering capacity within their own systems which was done through the facilitation of hiring engineering educators at these remote locations. This proved difficult in its own right, but the utility of using a pre-existing system located within native communities with an understanding of students backgrounds and opportunities and having resources to provide a small-class-size experience in difficult science and math courses, seemed to be the logical way to go. Initially the concept was to form cohorts at each school and each year group and as the year groups advanced to transfer to the mainstream institution, the cohort would move on with the participants. It soon proved to be more functionally viable to group all students into a single cohort that would have a tribal college component and a mainstream institution component. This would also allow a focus on problems related to the 2 classes of institutions. Pre-engineering classes would be taught to students at the tribal colleges through the use of an existing intrastate video networking system, IVN. After providing some accommodation for student adaptation to this remote education through the use of periodic face-to-face meetings, this educational model proved to be functional.</p> <p>During the first 5 years of the program&rsquo;s operation, 3 students were able to navigate the entire pipeline from tribal college through mainstream institution to graduation with the BS in engineering degree. One of those 3 was able to go on in their studies and complete a master of engineering at a first-tier engineering school. All 3 of the graduates have spent the last year working in or around their local communities and positions that either directly supported projects on their reservations or contributed to the infrastructure on or around their reservation. Currently there are 9 more students in the mainstream cohort who are working toward their own graduation. The system&rsquo;s efficacy can be considered by comparing the numbers graduating from the program to the 11 or 12 students that transferred to the mainstream institution but are no longer in an engineering major.</p> <p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> goal, illustrating the utility of engineers within a tribal community, is still in evaluation because of the short time since graduation and is influenced by the energy of new graduates wanting to explore and experience new things. It seemed as though a perfect opportunity to illustrate this potential to tribal communities came with the recent activities associated with the Dakota Access Pipeline occurring here in North Dakota. The results of these activities are still being evaluated with respect to the tribal impact.</p> <p>A resource containing a more detailed description of the North Dakota program as well as the other 3 NSF supported programs is a book:<em> The PEEC Experiment: Native Hawaiian and Native American Engineering Education</em>, edited by Suzette R.
