<AbstractNarration>The Physics of Cancer Metastasis Meeting to be held in Arlington, VA on Nov. 1-2, 2010 will discuss the prospects for defining a set of short term (3-5 year) projects, which could be successful in leading the way to deeper understanding of the fundamentals of the metastatic process and possibly to radical new treatment ideas. The discussion will be held between leading cancer researchers and leading physicists working at the interface of biology and physics. The physics community working at the physics-biology interface is excited by the possibility of contributing to the fundamental understanding of cancer, which is a failure of multi-cellularity, but is also an essential byproduct of evolution. The meeting is sponsored by the Physics Division at NSF.</AbstractNarration>
