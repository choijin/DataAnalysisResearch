<AbstractNarration>1043057&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abramson, Oklahoma State University  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary of Proposal:  The project for support of a U.S.-Turkey workshop: EuroBee 2010: International Symposium-workshop on Honey Bee Behavioral Plasticity-an Integrative Approach, Ankara, Turkey, September 2010.  The organizers are Dr. Charles Abramson of Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma and Dr. Aykut Kence, Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey. The meeting is to promote the creation of an international network of scientists involved in honey bee research. This will be the first international meeting to focus specifically on integrative study from the level of the nervous system to that of the ecosystem, and only the second international meeting on learning and memory of honey bees since the 1980s.  The placement of the workshop at the end of the IVth Biennial European Honey Bee Conference at Ankara, Turkey September 7-9, 2010 will help minimize travel expenses and take advantage of the workshop to draw greater, particularly local participation, especially those interested in diversity in honey bee behavior. Turkey is a center of honey bee subspecific diversity (20% of world subspecies), and the workshop will include visits to sites where four of the five subspecies of honeybees in Turkey can be observed. In addition to the NSF support, several international participants have been able to secure partial or complete support for their attendance at the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This meeting will emphasize integration of approaches from neurobiology, development, ecology, and evolution, as well as different behavioral research traditions. There seem to be few examples of this integration due to lack of communication among researchers with various approaches, especially those in different countries. The proposed workshop will help to advance our understanding of (1) how animals with small brains are able to achieve a high level of cognitive sophistication, specifically complex learning and memory abilities and (2) how behavioral variation within and between different species of honey bees, an important model organism, is related to their evolutionary history and ecological adaptations. The PI is an expert in the field of honey bee learning and memory and has extensive experience with foreign collaborations. The meeting will foster collaborative research between scientists from the U.S., Europe and Turkey.  The proposed topic for the research is very creative, interdisciplinary and will have a major impact upon the study of honey bees. The logistics of the meeting in Turkey have been well planned.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The meeting will significantly enhance the study of honey bee biology, by focusing on an integrative approach to behavioral plasticity through physiological, ecological, and cellular mechanisms. The results will include the creation of an international network of scientists who are studying behavioral plasticity in a model system that features an animal, the honey bee, which has major significance to human life.  The meeting will include the participation of graduate students, women, and others who are members of underrepresented groups.  The results will be broadly disseminated through the publication of the proceedings in an edited volume and the preparation of a concept paper for Nature or Science.  Both the PI and co-PI have a good record of publication in international, peer-reviewed journals, including the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA.</AbstractNarration>

The symposium-workshop was divided into two symposia. One, titled "Mechanisms of learning and memory in honey bees," consisted of 8 papers, and the other; "Development and behavioral plasticity in eusocial bees," contained 9 papers. Topics included "Mechanisms of learning and memory in honey bees," "Optic flow informs distance but not profitability for honey bees," "Some issues in the cognitive interpretation of invertebrate behavior," "Modification of olfactory learning and memory induced by siRNA targeting nicotinic acetylcholine subunits in the honeybee," "Foraging preference and flower handling in honey bee subspecies," "Memory dynamics of honey bees," "Operant conditioning protocols in honey bees," "Olfactory learning in honey bees," "Behavioral plasticity underlies the solitary-eusocial transition in the socially polymorphic sweat bee Halictus rubicundus," "Functional Genomic approaches to unravel the physiological basis of honey bee caste development," "Flexibility of division of labor in honey bees: all explained by a simple model," "Proteotyping division of labor in worker honey bees," "Effects of carbohydrates on the development and sugar responsiveness of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) reared in vitro," "The putative role of male sex pheromones in bumblebee cuckoo-host interactions," "Larval and nurse worker control of developmental plasticity in honey bee queens and workers," "Socially-mediated plasticity in circadian rhythms and the molecular clockwork," and "Functional mapping of the circadian network and its role on the sleep-like state."  The presentations were preceded by an introductory session in which two pioneering scientists studying honey bee behavioral plasticity, Dr. Brian H. Smith and Dr. Monique Gauthier, gave overviews of their work on olfactory processing and invertebrate cognition, respectively.   A unique aspect of the symposium was a tour of several Turkish honey bee research centers. Turkey has much to recommend it for honey bee research, such as the presence of at least five subspecies, including Apis mellifera syriaca, A.m. anatoliaca, A.m. meda, A. m. caucasica, and a subtype of A. m. carnica.  The honey bee research facilities visited were those at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Namik Kemal University in Tekirdag, and the protection area for the Turkish subtype of A.m. carnica in Kirklareli.  The symposium-workshop met several goals, including:  1. Exposing the honey bee community to a conceptual model that emphasizes deep connections between ecology and behavioral processes, and the resulting dynamics of social behavior.  Bringing together experts with diverse backgrounds to think about their own work in a broader context is one of the first steps towards integration across disciplines.   2. Sharing the diverse work on honey bee behavioral plasticity to search for a common language and understanding of approaches to probe bee behavioral plasticity.  This sharing focused on an audience coming from nations in which honey bee biology ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
