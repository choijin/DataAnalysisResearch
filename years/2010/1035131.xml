<AbstractNarration>California State University, Dominguez Hills' School of Education and College of Natural and Behavioral Sciences, Los Angeles Unified School District's Local District 7 and Local District 8, and the Los Angeles Education Partnership are collaborating to recruit, train, support and retain 30 master science teachers of biology and chemistry in two cohorts of 15 each. The project's objectives are to: 1) increase content knowledge of participating fellows; 2) increase the pedagogical skills of participating fellows; 3) increase the leadership skills of participating fellows; 4) improve science teaching by mentees of the fellows; and 5) improve science achievement in participating schools.  The Master Teaching Fellows receive $10,000 stipends annually for five years as they fulfill program requirements. These master teachers are improving science teaching and achievement in low-performing, hard-to-staff schools in high-poverty South Los Angeles including three high schools, five feeder middle and 10 feeder elementary schools that enroll more than 26,000 students, nearly all Latino or African American. Fellows support and mentor fellow teachers in their schools; support and mentor preservice teachers who are preparing to teach in high-need schools throughout LAUSD;  mentor and model good teaching for undergraduate Noyce Scholars; broadly disseminate science knowledge and pedagogical strategies to district teachers through various professional development activities; and disseminate results of their long-term action research projects and inquiry-based lesson designs at local, regional and national conferences. Fellows each have an advising committee of experts to help develop and monitor the implementation of an individualized plan to meet the competencies in content, pedagogy and leadership. Fellows complete a three-semester sequence of new graduate-level courses designed for secondary teachers that combine content knowledge and teaching strategies to effectively correct misperceptions frequently encountered in assessments of secondary-level science students. Participation in a monthly professional learning community reinforces and expands pedagogical skills while providing training in inquiry-based lesson design, Lesson Study, action research, Cognitive Coaching and leadership skills. Fellows are becoming well prepared to mentor and train in-service and preservice teachers in existing programs in which the partners currently collaborate. In addition, Fellows participate in a summer research internship at a laboratory, take additional science coursework, conduct a long-term action research project, and present their work at local and national conferences.</AbstractNarration>

LESSON STUDY &amp; ACTION RESEARCH: On exit surveys, the majority of Cohort 1-2 fellows reported that engaging in the lesson study process and the completion of their individual action research projects had promoted their professional growth some to a great extent.   PORTFOLIO DEVELOPMENT: One requirement of the program was for fellows to collect their work for the program in a portfolio, e.g., lessons designed and revised, action research, student assessments, presentations, videos of teaching, summaries and results of research internships, etc. The portfolios are intended to showcase fellows? pedagogical growth over time and how their reflection leads to changes in instruction. One hundred percent of fellows completed a portfolio and uploaded it to an online platform (Taskstream) by the program?s end.  INCREASE THE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT OF THE MTF PARTICIPANTS  LEADERSHIP ACTIVITIES/ROLES: In Spring 2015 during the final Noyce survey administration, 20%-60% of fellows indicated participation in the following types of leadership activities:  &bull; Participation/Presentation at Local and/or National Conferences (60%) &bull; School/District Committee Participation (50%) &bull; Curriculum Development (33%) &bull; Research Opportunities (30%) &bull; Science/Math Supervisory Roles (20%)  IMPROVE SCIENCE TEACHING BY MENTEES OF THE MTF PARTICIPANTS   MENTORING EXPERIENCE &amp; IMPACT: Almost half of Cohort 1-2 fellows reported mentoring new teachers at the time of the last Noyce survey administration (spring 2015). Cohort 1-2 fellows were asked to share the value added of the MTF program for themselves professionally. A common response for fellows was that it built their confidence particularly around cognitive coaching (a supervisory-peer coaching model) and mentoring others.   DELIVERY OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR PRE- AND IN-SERVICE TEACHERS: Ninety percent of fellows across Cohorts 1-2 indicated developing and providing professional development (PD) activities for other pre- and in-service teachers at the time of the final Noyce survey administration (spring 2015). PD was provided in schools at the department-level, in professional learning communities and school-wide; some PD was provided at the district-level.   IMPROVE SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT IN PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS  STUDENT IMPACT: Fellows were asked to describe the value added of the MTF program on their students. As a result of the pedagogical skills and content knowledge/training obtained through the program, especially in the areas of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and engineering, many fellows felt they improved in their teaching abilities which had a direct impact on their students.   IMPACT ON PARTNER SCHOOL SITES/SCIENCE DEPARTMENTS: Another area in which fellows were asked about the valued added of the MTF program was for their school site or science department. Common responses included serving as a resource/expert on NGSS implementation at one?s site as well as planning and/or provision of professional development for site teachers.  ADDITIONAL PROJECT OUTCOMES  In interviews with MTF program administration/staff, the impact of the MTF program on the institution of higher education involved in the partnership (CSUDH) was described as being four-fold:  &bull; Provided Qualified Course Instructors for Pre-Service Teachers &bull; Created an Opportunity to Partner with a Local Education Agency (LAUSD) and Nonprofit Organization (LAEP) to Meet the Dire Need of Expert Teachers to Teach in High Need Schools.  &bull; Developed a Pool of 30 Master Teacher Fellows to Meet K-16 Education Needs. &bull; Increased Collaboration Among University Faculty          Last Modified: 11/30/2017       Submitted by: Kamal Hamdan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
