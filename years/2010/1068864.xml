<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award will establish the first interdisciplinary doctoral training program in the United States that directly addresses the interface between engineering, environmental science, and policy as it relates to renewable energy. Offshore wind energy is a promising solution to many of the world?s looming energy problems, yet the installation of new wind projects faces numerous barriers. This project addresses these barriers by focusing on the intersection of three key challenges: 1) engineering offshore wind energy systems; 2) mitigating environmental impacts; and 3) incorporating economic, social, and policy concerns into design for public acceptance, grounded in a philosophy of stakeholder engagement and equity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Key features of the program include: novel interdisciplinary research; shared coursework; an innovative real-time case study of the design, evaluation, and implementation of an offshore wind installation; the use of studios in which interdisciplinary teams work interactively to address real issues in the case study; and research experiences at leading international offshore wind energy institutions. The IGERT will recruit student participants using a multi-tiered approach with particular attention to strong participation by under-represented students. Broader Impacts: The shared experience of the students in the program is designed to provide the intellectual flexibility, cross-disciplinary training and professional skills necessary to move the science, engineering, and development of wind energy forward, leading to the creation of renewable energy projects that are technically and environmentally sound while also being suited to neighboring communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our project developed a community of rising researchers working on a wide range of topics related to offshore wind energy, including engineering, wildlife safety and regulation, and public acceptance. These doctoral students developed an ability to talk and work across disciplines, leading to innovative approaches to complex problems. This group used their communication skills and enthusiasm to engage the public, especially middle school and high school students and policy makers. Our students were an example of diverse, inclusive excellence, including 43% women and 25% underrepresented minorities.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;The synergy between students of different disciplines and backgrounds led to transformative and translational interdisciplinary research. &nbsp;Our students helped form a large collaborative network, the Motus Wildlife Tracking System, which uses coordinated arrays to collect information from nano-tags on birds, bats, and insects at local, regional, and hemispheric scales. This information will help to site wind farms in places that will minimize their impact, and also to better understand the impacts of wind energy at multiple scales.&nbsp; An engineer and a bird biologist worked together to design a spatial planning tool using the nano-tag data to find good sites for offshore wind farms. Another engineer and a bat biologist worked together to design a bat whistle to protect bats from wind turbines. These are a few of the examples of the ways this interdisciplinary group provided innovative solutions to complex problems.</p> <p>&nbsp;Our students gained an international perspective through international research experiences in Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, and The Netherlands in Europe, as well as in the Bahamas and Mexico. Upon their return, these students presented their insights gained from working in another culture and political environment to the wider IGERT group.</p> <p>&nbsp;A centerpiece of the program was the course Wind Energy: Environmental Assessment, Monitoring &amp; Regulatory Requirements.&nbsp; This class used a case study approach, focusing on a potential offshore wind development site each year, including one each in Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The class included working site visits, where students learned firsthand about the nature of the marine and terrestrial environments and performed hands-on site assessments. Students met with stakeholders, including non-government and government agencies, to develop a better understanding of how environmental assessment and monitoring cannot be decoupled from the public policy and engineering aspects of offshore wind energy.</p> <p>&nbsp;Public engagement is key to successful offshore wind energy development. A new graduate-level course titled "Public Engagement and Communication" introduced students to concepts and tools related to engaging diverse public audiences with science and technology. Students developed a more nuanced appreciation for the many ways in which the public engages with science and for the many ways in which they, as scientists-in-training, can meaningfully and productively engage with the public.&nbsp; Inspired by this course, the students organized "STEM Slam" for three consecutive years, a speaking competition for science and technology college students. In a similar vein, an IGERT Fellow collaborated with faculty from the school of public policy to design a series of Science and Policy workshops, with over 40 graduate students participating in at least one of the workshops. Following this, a group of IGERT students, spanning political science and industrial and civil engineering, traveled to Washington DC to meet with a variety of people involved in the policy process, in order to foster a deeper understanding of how scientific information informs policy making. This prepared the students to more effectively support the policy process.</p> <p>Offshore Wind Energy is a promising solution to many of the world?s looming energy problems; however, the installation of new wind projects faces numerous barriers.&nbsp; This IGERT program has addressed many of the barriers faced by offshore wind, helping to make it a successful new technology in the US.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Erin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Baker</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1068864/1068864_10124203_1542831480124_image006--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1068864/1068864_10124203_1542831480124_image006--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Denmark International fieldtrip"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1068864/1068864_10124203_1542831480124_image006--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Denmark International fieldtrip"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In early summer 2016 a group of 15 IGERT fellows and three affiliated faculty members traveled to Denmark to share our research with Danish scholars and to learn more about the unmatched success of the Scandinavian nation's domestic wind industry.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rodrigo Mercado</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Erin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Baker</div> <div class="imageTitle">Denmark International fieldtrip</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1068864/1068864_10124203_1543435010237_UMaine_Test(3)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1068864/1068864_10124203_1543435010237_UMaine_Test(3)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Visit to UMaine floating offshore wind prototype"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1068864/1068864_10124203_1543435010237_UMaine_Test(3)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Visit to UMaine floating offshore wind prototype"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">IGERT students and faculty visited VolturnUS, a 65-foot-tall floating turbine prototype designed and built by UMaine, which is the first grid-connected offshore wind turbine in the Americas.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rodrigo Mercado</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Erin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Baker</div> <div class="imageTitle">Visit to UMaine floating offshore wind prototype</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1068864/1068864_10124203_1543435471669_IMG_0746--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1068864/1068864_10124203_1543435471669_IMG_0746--rgov-800width.jpg" title="IGERT Fellow helps Girl Scouts earn Inventor badge"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1068864/1068864_10124203_1543435471669_IMG_0746--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="IGERT Fellow helps Girl Scouts earn Inventor badge"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">IGERT Student and Graduate Women in STEM Outreach Committee Co-Chair, Destenie Nock, hosted an event for 20 girl scouts in the 3rd and 4th grade.
