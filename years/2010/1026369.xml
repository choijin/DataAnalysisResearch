<AbstractNarration>This International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program in the Division of Chemistry supports work by Professors Paul Champion and Timothy Sage at Northeastern University, in collaboration with Jasper van Thor and Michael Bearpark at Imperial College, London, to carry out fundamental studies on excited state proton transfer in green fluorescent protein (GFP).  The project exploits the occurrence of excited state proton transfer in GFP, which allows the reaction to be triggered with a laser pulse and followed on ultrafast time scales.  Measurements over a wide range of time and temperature will reveal the influence of thermally activated vibrations and quantum mechanical contributions to the reaction.  Students will gain international experience and be trained in cutting edge optical and biological techniques.  Proton transfer is a crucial component of many enzymatic reactions, and GFP provides a unique opportunity to isolate this biologically ubiquitous process for detailed study.  These investigations will contribute to understanding how biological systems control metabolic processes and the ability to manipulate proton transfer will ultimately facilitate the tailoring of enzymes involved in energy generation and in global biogeochemical cycles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have been studying the role of quantum mechanical tunneling in proteins. This is a phenomenon that allows electrons and protons to move to different locations and break and form bonds without having to surmount potential energy barriers.  It is kind of like moving a massive object through a hill rather than over a hill. Quantum mechanics allows this to happen even though it might seem impossible at first.  Biological molecules such as proteins and enzymes have found important ways to utilize "tunneling", even at room temperature, in order to carry out their important functions to support life. We have shown in our experimental studies that proton tunneling is happening in the green fluorescent protein, which is an important model system that helps us to understand thsi phenomenon. Most surprising is that the tunneling process is very fast and takes place in nanoseconds at room temperature. Usually tunneling is dominating the transport of protons at much lower temperatures, but it now appears that this process may be much more common than previously suspected and that it is taking place in our bodies all the time!  In orer to understand the tunneling rates that we measured, we also developed a theoretical model that predicts these rates by taking into account the hydrogen bond that forms between the oxygen atom that is the "donor" and the oxygen atom that is the "acceptor".  When these oxygen atoms vibrate, they change the distance that the proton has to tunnel (kind of like changing the width of "hill") and this lets the proton pass through the "hill" much more quickly than would ordinarily be expected.  Because the oxygen atoms vibrate with more amplitude at higher temperatures, the "hill" gets unexpectedly thin and tunneling takes place in nanoseconds!  This is the first time that measurements of tunneling have been made in proteins over such a large range of temperatures and times and also the first time that theory has successfully predicted the rate of the tunnel process on an absolute scale, without using arbitrary factors.  In addition to the proton tunneling studies on the green fluorescent protein, we also studied other proton transport systems like "Dronpa" and we developed computer codes for calcuating how large protein molecules vibrate in terms of their "normal modes".  The vibrational analysis is done, using novel mathematical methods, by separating the part of the protein, where photochemical reactins take place, so it can be treated with quantum mechanics.  The rest of the proteins can be treated with classical molecular mechanics.  This approach allows a much larger assembly of atoms (like a protein, which has many interconnected atoms) to be understood and related to experimentally observable quantities like the infrared absorption spectra.  Finally, this grant helped to address the need for a scientifically proficient workforce that has international experience by the exchange of students and by frequent interactions with our colleagues in the United Kingdom.
