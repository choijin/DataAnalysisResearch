<AbstractNarration>SES-1030291&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Ryan&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dale W. Wimberley&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Thomas N. Ratliff&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project tests dominant approaches to protest event analysis, presenting an integrated model identifying the conditions for violent protests in the U.S. from 1989-2009. It addresses the following questions: What tactics do police tend to use against certain forms of protest? What protester performances and policing styles tend to intersect violently? Do certain social movements disproportionately encounter violent repression? How do countermovements and their ?counter? performances at protest events contribute to violence? Data will be collected on protest events and law enforcement characteristics from Census Data, City and County Data Books, the Department of Justice, and four major U.S. newspapers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This project will inform activists about strategies for expressing dissent while avoiding significant confrontations that pose the risk of becoming violent. This research also addresses how certain policing styles may influence levels of violence at protests, thereby providing insights for police on how to avoid violent confrontations at protest events.</AbstractNarration>

The images held in the collective memory of many Americans or even "common sense" notions of what occurs at protest events&mdash;be it the actions of protesters or police officers&mdash;often include violence. People who participate in protest events are often viewed as violent mobs, agitators, and dangerous riff-raff. This empirically inaccurate view of social protest casts its net broadly over "professional" activists, religious leaders, mothers, school children, and union members, to name only a few. Likewise, police behavior is often cast as "repression," neglecting the fact that most of the time police do not even show up at protest events. In fact, my research suggests a much different picture of social protest in the United States&mdash;a portrait of mostly peaceful control and dissent where just over six percent of social protests have any form of violence at all, be it from protesters, counterprotesters, or police.

Thus, this research focuses on how qualities of police, protester, and counterprotester actions intersect to influence behavior at protest events.

In sum, this projectÆs intellectual merits include: (1) the extension of our knowledge regarding social protest in recent years as well as the theories we use to understand them, and (2) providing a database for future research on data collection methods for protest event analysis.
