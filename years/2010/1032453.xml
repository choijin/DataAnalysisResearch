<AbstractNarration>1032453&lt;br/&gt;Oehlschlaeger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project an experimental shock tube investigation of the ignition and oxidation kinetics of a wide range (C3-C18) of biodiesel-relevant alkyl esters at engine-like conditions, high pressure with air as the oxidizer will be conducted. Shock tube measurements of macroscopic oxidation kinetic targets, ignition delay times and carbon monoxide time-histories, will be made for the neat alkyl esters, alkyl ester blends, and blends of large esters with petroleum-diesel surrogate mixtures. These measurements will provide information about the overall reactivity of the different alkyl esters and the temporal evolution of the oxidation process, allowing development and assessment of kinetic mechanisms for these compounds, and a test of the PI?s central hypothesis that the organic structure of these alkyl esters will strongly influence reactivity and reaction pathways. In particular, the measurement of CO will provide insight into the combustion behavior of alkyl esters in the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime, where CO production prior to ignition is expected. Additionally, these measurements will provide insight into the kinetic differences between bio- and fossil-derived diesels, allowing assessment of the impact a transition to biodiesel will have on engines. The proposed experiments represent the first CO measurements for hydrocarbon fuels in shock-heated gases and the proposed experiments for large esters (C11-C18) represent the first shock tube measurements for esters of this size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ignition and oxidation kinetics of biodiesel-relevant esters at high-pressure engine-like conditions have not been deeply investigated. With the possible future wide scale commercialization of biodiesel fuels, kinetic mechanisms describing their oxidation are needed for the development and optimization of high-efficiency clean combustion engines operating on biodiesel. Macroscopic kinetic targets (ignition delay and CO time-histories) will aid in the development of ester oxidation mechanisms, provide fundamental understanding on the influence of different organic ester structure on oxidation, and provide an understanding of the differences and similarities biodiesels have with their fossil-derived counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad societal impact of a transition to biofuels could be enormous. The proposed research seeks to provide experimental insight into the ignition and oxidation kinetics of large alkyl esters relevant to biodiesel which currently does not exist and will have broad impact on the combustion kinetic modeling community who need such targets for mechanism development and validation and the engine community who need basic insight into the reactivity of biodiesel, the differences of bio- and fossil-diesel, and reduced kinetic models for engine simulations. The proposed research program is closely coupled to educational and outreach activities. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will be recruited, mentored, educated, and provided the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art experimental techniques and explore a modern energy problem. Efforts will be made to attract students from traditionally underrepresented groups. Research topics and results will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses. Energy presentations will also be made available online.</AbstractNarration>
