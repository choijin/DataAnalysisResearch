<AbstractNarration>Plants are sessile organisms that must sense and respond quickly and effectively to changes in their environment.  The outer membrane of the cell (the plasma membrane) is the interface between the plant cell and its environment, and receptors in this membrane can sense changes in the environment and transmit this information to the cell nucleus to trigger acclimation responses in order to react optimally to the change in conditions. In addition, the plasma membrane is the site where nutrients and metabolites are exchanged (transported) selectively between the cell and its environment. These processes of signal recognition and transport are carried out by thousands of proteins in the plasma membrane, and in order to achieve these functions they directly talk with each other by physical interaction and cooperation with one another in complex ways. These membrane protein interactions (collectively defined as an "interactome") are critically important but not well understood. This project will describe, comprehensively, the membrane protein interactome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and use this information to deduce the structure of the underlying interaction networks. The interactions will be defined and validated using a variety of methods: split ubiquitin and split luciferase assays, as well as a novel microfluidic platform-based assay. The screening pipeline will generate data on over 18 million potential protein interactions, and the data generated will be made publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will generate and make available to the research community the most comprehensive membrane protein interactome described for any organism. The project will provide training at the interface between high throughput biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics and cell biology for high school students (including members of minorities under-represented in science), undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Communication between proteins govern many aspects of the cell-cell and cell-environment interactions of all organisms, such as signaling processes in which, for example, kinases interact with a substrate protein to phosphorylate it and to change is properties and the gating of transporters is controlled by posttranslational modifications. The analysis of interactions between soluble proteins has dramatically advanced our understanding of the regulation of biological processes. Some of the most important proteins are embedded into membranes, specifically receptors and transport proteins. However, due to their hydrophobicity, their biochemistry and the analysis of protein/protein interactions is challenging and we have a lot less information in this highly relevant area. To address this challenge, we developed a high throughout system for systematic analysis of membrane protein/signaling protein interactions in eukaryotes. We cloned thousands of coding regions for relevant candidate proteins and subjected them to analysis by a mating-based split ubiquitin interaction test system. The key product of this project is the first compendium of membrane protein/signaling protein interactions for a multicellular organism, here the reference plant <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>. The experimental protocols, the analysis system including strains and vectors, the over 3000 ORF clones generated here, and the MIND database are publically available and have been widely disseminated (https://associomics.dpb.carnegiescience.edu/Associomics/Home.html). Our data have been integrated into many public proteome databases, have been published in leading journals, and are widely used by the community. At the same time the project trained high school and undergraduate students; almost all of the technicians who contributed to the success have started graduate school, and postdocs have obtained some of the most competitive professorship positions worldwide. Importantly, the training also included minority students. The interactome data provide a significant advance that helps advance our understanding of transport and signaling processes in plants, which is relevant to development of new strategies for improving agriculture, and since so far the only database available with this kind of data in animals and humans, but many proteins are conserved, the results are also relevant for the medical field.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/06/2016<br>      Modified by: Wolf&nbsp;B&nbsp;Frommer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1052348/1052348_10081552_1452119036404_shapeimage_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1052348/1052348_10081552_1452119036404_shapeimage_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Membrane protein interaction network"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1052348/1052348_10081552_1452119036404_shapeimage_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Membrane protein interaction network"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Three dimensional protein interaction network obtained by analyzing membrane protein signaling protein interactions.
