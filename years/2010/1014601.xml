<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes fellowship in Singapore under the advising of Prof. Casey Chan, MD, at the National University of Singapore Tissue Engineering Department helped guide my training and research career in three major areas:  - I began to build international network of colleagues with unique qualifications and specializations to aid in collaborations and partnerships which were initiated a year ago are ongoing still today.  - I was given access to unique facilities and equipment for which I received training from some of the most skilled experts in the field of tissue engineering and biomedical materials.  - I gained an understanding for how research is conducted in Singapore and other locations in Southeast Asia which has already begun to help inform my interactions with colleagues and collaborators in the US and abroad.     The results of my time spent at the National University of Singapore included significant advances in engineering two novel systems for studying wound healing and advancing treatment options. We initiated an ongoing study which sought to utilize an in vitro culture system which mimicked normal and wounded skin. This system would allow us to study the interaction between multiple types of skin cells and stem cells which are often employed in wound care. The second material system was a nanofiber network which could be selectively modified and used as a filter to rapidly capture a relatively pure population of stem cells from bone marrow tissue. The captured stem cells can then be applied to a wound along with the intact fiber network to function as a biological gauze-like dressing. We made further modifications to this fiber network in an effort to achieve controlled release of growth factors from an inner core within the fibers. These growth factors are associated with driving more rapid regeneration of wounded skin. Taken together, these two technological advances provide a broadened perspective for me and, potentially, a diversity of future wound treatment options which may develop from these studies.
