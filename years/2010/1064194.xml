<AbstractNarration>This work examines the role of university research in chemical sciences in the post Bayh-Dole era by combining unique data about funding sources, scientific publishing, invention disclosing, patenting and licensing, and utilization and commercialization of university inventions. The work sheds light on: &lt;br/&gt;(1) The relationship between the nature of research funding sources and university research, knowledge utilization and technology transfer; &lt;br/&gt;(2) The interplay between government funding and industry funding in university research; and&lt;br/&gt;(3) The relationship between IP protection and technology transfer and utilization of university research and inventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The project advances understanding of the multiple dimensions of University technology transfer. It addresses not only publishing and patenting, but also licensing, further patenting and indicators of commercialization, and relates all these to funding sources of university research.  The research offers a clearer picture of the links between research support, research, and invention, and the ways in which inventions and publications are used in further research by licensees and nonlicensees. The research  investigates not only whether patenting and exclusive licensing are encouraging commercialization by licensees, but also whether they are leading to further research, in the public or private sector. It provides new information about the effect of exclusive licensing on nonlicensee research to obtain a fuller comprehension of the overall effect of exclusivity. The project also provides a methodological platform for future research on university research and technology transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts  Few public policy issues are more important than technology transfer of research by the nation's universities to users who convert it into further advances, and development and commercialization of products. The Bayh-Dole Act has been an important factor in the rapid increase in university patenting and licensing in the United States, and has contributed to the current leadership position of the United States in high technology industries including biomedicine and pharmaceuticals, advanced materials and chemistry. It informs further deliberations on university patenting policy by providing better information on the ways in which effective technology transfer is actually occurring. Finally, the project supports the move to "evidence-based" decisions by government on funding and on the merits of increased private sector research support.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is a broad consensus that corporate sponsorship of academic research involves a tradeoff between the benefits of efficiency and the social costs of reduced knowledge externalities and exclusive control of intellectual property rights by the sponsor. We bring some empirical content to this debate, using inventions disclosed to nine university campuses and three leading national research laboratories. Relative to federally sponsored inventions, corporate-sponsored inventions are more likely to be patented and licensed, which was to be expected.   But other findings are surprising: (1) half of all licenses to corporate-sponsored inventions go to third parties; (2) excluding licenses to sponsors, inventions with corporate or federal sponsorship are similarly likely to be licensed to third parties; (3) overall, licenses to corporate-funded inventions are no more likely to be exclusive; (4) corporate-funded inventions generate greater knowledge flows, measured by subsequent patent citations; and (5) inventions with joint federal and corporate sponsorship are not licensed less exclusively, nor do they generate more knowledge flow per invention than purely corporate-sponsored inventions. Our findings challenge some common assumptions about the disadvantages of private versus public research funding and about the virtues of public-private partnerships. These findings have been published in a March 2014 issue of Nature. We also had several other findings. Issue of a license seems to inform other researchers about the invention, and increase citation of the patent. Early publication seems to encourage further research on related topics. And examiner citations may be less useful  in indicating research value than is currently assumed. Clearly we should pay more attention to development of data sets that allow deeper investigation of the merits of privately funded academic research. Our results do not support  common apprehensions about the biases induced by private funding, at least at the University of California.
