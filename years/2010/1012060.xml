<AbstractNarration>As one of the most promising emerging concepts in Information Technology, outsourced computation (also known as cloud computing) is transforming our perception of how IT is consumed and managed, yielding improved cost efficiencies and delivering flexible, on-demand scalability. Cloud computing reduces IT resources and services to commodities acquired and paid-for on-demand through a fast-growing set of infrastructure, platform, and service providers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the relatively fast growth and increased adoption of clouds, our understanding of aspects related to their security, privacy, and economic value proposition -- and hence our ability to trust them -- is lacking.  This project addresses this challenge by (a) extending cloud service-level agreements to govern aspects such as integrity of outsourced services, information leakage control, and fair market pricing; (b) developing mechanisms that allow providers to guarantee and users to verify that such trust-enhancing service-level agreements are being followed; and (c) exposing trustworthiness guarantees and tradeoffs to cloud customers and system integrators in ways that are both practical and usable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research work pursued in this project is timely as it addresses the issues of cloud trustworthiness early enough to avoid having the conflicts among its various stakeholders develop unchecked -- as was the case with the Internet decades ago. Doing so has the potential of improving the utility and hardness of our cyber-infrastructure, with significant benefit to our economy and society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will ultimately lead to a better marketplace for computing resources, in which users are assured that the services they acquire satisfy their performance, security, and privacy expectations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As one of the most promising emerging concepts in Information Technology, outsourced computation (also known as cloud computing) is transforming our perception of how IT is consumed and managed, yielding improved cost efficiencies and delivering flexible, on-demand scalability. Cloud computing reduces IT resources and services to commodities acquired and paid-for on-demand through a fast-growing set of infrastructure, platform, and service providers.  Despite the relatively fast growth and increased adoption of clouds, our understanding of aspects related to their security, privacy, and economic value proposition &ndash; and hence our ability to trust them &ndash; is lacking. This collaborative project involving Boston University,  Brown University, and the University of California, Irvine has addressed this challenge by (a) extending cloud service-level agreements to govern aspects such as integrity of outsourced services, information leakage control, and fair market pricing; (b) developing mechanisms that allow providers to guarantee and users to verify that such trust-enhancing service-level agreements are being followed; and (c) exposing trustworthiness guarantees and tradeoffs to cloud customers and system integrators in ways that are both practical and usable.  The main research results the Brown investigators are as follows:  Verifiable cloud computing. We have developed methods that allow a user of cloud services to verify the integrity and completeness of the computations performed by the cloud server while keeping a small amount of metadata in secure private storage. We have also developed a new family of error-correcting codes that can be used to protect cloud storage and client-server communication against data-corruption attacks. Oblivious algorithms and storage in the cloud. To protect the privacy of outsourced computations, we have developed efficient data-oblivious algorithms where data-dependent operations are performed inside a small tamper-proof device. Combined with standard encryption techniques, these algorithms can be executed in a privacy-preserving manner on a cloud server. Configurable datacenter networking. We have developed the concept of participatory networking, in which entities in a higher level of abstraction, such as virtual machines or end-user applications such as a MapReduce service, can participate in the configuration of the network in a dynamic way.  Resource management and protection in shared cloud systems. We have introduced resource isolation principles and a resource management framework called Retro, demonstrated in several components of the Hadoop stack. Retro monitors per-tenant resource usage, detects contended resources, throttles tenants responsible for slowdown and overload, and fairly distributes the remaining cluster capacity.  Outsourcing cryptography to tamperable and leaky hosts. We have showed that it is impossible to realize a secure cryptographic functionality on a tamperable host or device with a personal identification number (PIN) where a user is allowed to make up to a fixed number of incorrect consecutive attempts to enter her PIN, with no total limit on the total number of incorrect PIN attempts. We have also developed techniques for defending cryptographic computations against certain classes of hardware attacks. Password-protected cloud storage. We have given practical methods for password-protected cloud storage in the presence of malicious servers. Our methods rely on several different hosts in such a way that no minority of hosts store or receives any data that allows it to perform an off-line attack. These hosts could be the user's own devices, services in the cloud, or a mix of these.  Thus only on-line dictionary attacks are possible, the effectiveness of which can be limited by slowing down or refusing access altogether after too many failed attempts.   Regarding broader impacts, the results from our work have been incorporated in the courses taught by...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
