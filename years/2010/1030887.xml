<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to formulate a methodology for the design of elasto-fluidic systems (EFSs). EFSs utilize fluid pressure to deform a material envelope with tuned flexibility. They are ubiquitous in nature and may be found in organisms ranging from trees to worms to octopi. These systems achieve a wide range of functionality including desired structure, complex motion, flexibility, and efficient transmission of energy. There are numerous potential applications for elasto-fluidic systems in robots, machines, medical devices, and consumer products. To address the primary goals of the proposed research, it will be necessary to investigate a broad range of technical fields to characterize the salient physical phenomena that govern the behavior of EFSs. The characterization will be utilized in developing a systematic and general method to create EFSs at multiple scales with various materials. The design method will be validated through the design and fabrication of novel proof-of-concept prototypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the broader impacts of the research are extensive. The systematic synthesis of EFSs represents a paradigm shift in mechanical design. EFSs operate on a completely different set of assumptions that facilitate a wider range of functionality and benefits including lower power and maintenance requirements, simplicity and elegance in design, lower long-term cost, and increased precision. These benefits may prove to be far reaching to other fields in engineering. Beyond the impacts of the research on other technical fields, the PI?s have a vested interest in engaging the next generation of engineers at both the high school and undergraduate levels. In collaboration with local high school teachers, the PI?s have will create, implement, assess, and disseminate modules in high school physics courses that integrate mechanical engineering and biologically inspired design. These activities will be made publically available, and their results will be disseminated at educational conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Soft-bodied animals, such as worms, starfish, and octopus lack any skeletal support, yet they can move vigorously and gracefully. Utilizing elasto-fluidic principles of soft-bodied animals, or hydrostats, we developed new methods to create soft robots and other devices that can safely interact with humans and the environment for a variety of industrial and medical applications.      Hydrostats consist of a patterned arrangement of the connective tissue fibers and muscle fibers combined with a liquid filled cavity to generate hydrostatic forces for movement.  The cross-helical arrangement of fibers, which is most commonly found, serves as an antagonist against fluid pressure generated by muscle contraction and determines the range of motion while allowing for equal distribution of forces throughout the hydrostatic body.  A special case of hydrostatic skeleton is a muscular hydrostat, such as arms of octopus and elephant trunks employ a tightly packed array of muscle fibers around a hydrostatic body. Several other types of hydrostats can be found in nature.     In this NSF-funded research carried out at the University of MichiganÆs Complaint Systems Design laboratory, we employed pressurized fluid (air, water or other liquids) inside a fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosure (FREE). The FREE is a hollow cylinder of elastic polymer reinforced with two or more layers of fiber mesh. The angles at which the fibers wound around the cylinder determine how the device changes its shape or generates different types of forces and/or motions when the fluid inside is pressurized.
