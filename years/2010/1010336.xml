<AbstractNarration>Experiments in which subjects reach from one point to another are one of the workhorses of movement science. Many questions ranging from basic neuroscience (How do neurons represent movement?) to clinical (How do patients with Parkinson's Disease move differently from healthy controls?) to behavioral (How does loud noise lead to movement errors?) are studied using this paradigm. Moreover, many models have been constructed to describe reaching, and these models have strong links to robotics and computer science. This project will develop a database that contains both experimental results as well as models of reaching movement. The database will make it easier for experiments to falsify models and for models to be designed so that they overcome the limitations of previous models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the joint database design is that multiple models should be able to make predictions for a given experimental dataset, and likewise, multiple experimental datasets can be used to constrain a given model. The project will start with a relatively narrow set of experiments and models, widening the scope gradually over the course of the project. Research on reaching spans a broad set of questions and a broad set of experimental methods; however, many experimental approaches share significant aspects. The objective of the project is to enable inclusion of the results of a broad set of communities while keeping the database sufficiently coherent to be useful. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To enable the inclusion of a broad set of participants who will share models and data the proposed project will include summer schools, workshops and competitions where participants can compare models. Access to the database will be free and open, and this possibility of access to high quality data promises to allow scientists from any movement related discipline to productively interact with movement data and models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The general question of how people and animals move and learn to do so is one of the most challenging questions in neuroscience, biomechanics, computer science, statistics and psychology. Probably the most active model system for movement research are reaching experiments. Scientists within this community study movements made by humans and non-human primates asking about learning and adaptation, the role of the biomechanics in the control of movement, and sensory integration.   When the project started there were substantial barriers of entry to research in this area as well as limitations in experimental and theoretical work. Namely, data was not available openly, data was not standardized, and there was no access to fittable models.  Over the course of the project we have accumulated datasets from a large number of laboratories. We have normalized the data so that it is always in exactly the same format. We have linked it to electrophysiological data. And we have published a paper that describes the dataset in detail. This makes it easier for scientists from outside of the field to model the data. It makes it easier for theoreticians to compare to data. And it makes it easier for experimentalists to compare their data to models and across labs.  The effort in developing databases was complemented by an effort in organizing summer schools on computational motor control. More than 100 students participated in summer schools where they learned how to use the database. In this context, the database has proven to be very useful for teaching.
