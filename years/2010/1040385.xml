<AbstractNarration>The National Education Workshop (NEW) is a special professional development forum that convenes two- and four-year instructors, K-12 teachers, and industry to further Material Science and STEM education.  The three-day event reflects a K-20 integration model in the way it is organized, implemented and presented.  Each Workshop features an expert panel discussion and a facility tour of cutting edge manufacturing in action along with plenary talks and breakout sessions that feature hands-on teaching and learning.  The National Resource Center for Materials Technology Education (MatEd) housed at Edmonds Community College administers and implements expanded annual NEW events at three different strategically chosen host sites across the country that promote partnerships with K-20 educators, economic development organizations and key manufacturing industries that are critical to America's competitiveness.  Co-branding NEW with MatEd strategically advances the potential for sustainability for both entities resulting in better service to their national audience.  The workshops provide valuable opportunities for K-20 STEM teachers to broaden their perspectives and knowledge and expand their professional development venues.  MatEd supplies the materials education community with current, valuable aids for teaching and research, which can be used immediately in the classroom.  NEW has significant benefits and impact in terms of career awareness for students, technical upskilling for faculty, and the sharing of successful practices in pedagogy.  The evaluation measures the effectiveness of the workshops to meet the goals set.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    DUE #1040385   The National Educators Workshop (NEW) 2011-2014  In mid-2011, the National Resource Center for Materials Technology Education (MatEd, DUE 0903112) housed at Edmonds Community College, Lynnwood, WA, was awarded funds to take over management, operations, and production of the National EducatorsÃ† Workshop (NEW), a unique faculty professional development workshop and forum focused on materials science and STEM education.  NEW provides participants with the latest topics, strategies, and methods for teaching materials science and technologies, and unites participants at all levels with a materials science focus offering classroom-tested hands-on labs, demos, and modules.  This workshop had previously been administered by a consortium of colleges, and while it was thought to be effective, it was not a focused goal of any of the supporting institutions.  The overarching goal of this grant is to capture the synergistic advantage of NEWÃ†s unique features and established identity with MatEdÃ†s strengths by expanding the NEW event and in so-doing to sustain and further scale NEW and the MatEd Resource Center. To achieve this, MatEd completed the following:  1. Administered and implemented 3 enhanced NEW events at 3 strategically chosen host sites across the country;  2. Promoted the NEW model in partnership with host sites and demonstrated working partnerships with K-20 educators, economic and workforce development entities and key manufacturing industries that are critical to AmericaÃ†s competitiveness.  3. Created a business model whereby NEW becomes profitable and is established as a sustainability component for the MatEd Resource Center.  INTELLECTUAL MERITS   Workshop      provided access to timely, relevant modules.  As a result      of this project,  twenty-three      modules in materials science have been collected and are published on the      MatEd website at http://materialseducation.org/educators/matedu-modules/#order=title Twelve additional materials science modules are      recommended for future development from the 2014 workshop.  The NEW      2014 theme was Materials and      Innovation: Building the Future. At the workshop educators had the      opportunity to:      Gain        unique learning experiences (tours of the Boeing Company, the Future of        Flight museum, Designing and Virtually Testing a Jet) Learn        new ways to accelerate learning with innovations in materials science        and gather information on strategies to engage students, including        models, tools, and techniques that address critical needs of individuals        in the classroom (Ex: The Toothpick Factory: A Simulation Activity to        Teach and Reinforce Teamwork ) Access        tools that support student recruitment and retention Ex: Teaching about        Nanowires to Middle School Students Attend        sessions that foster professional development opportunities. The        workshop focused on 3 state of the art strands (1) Introduction to Composites, (2) Nanotechnology Principles, Applications, and        Careers, and (3) Structures: Training        Introducing Shop Safety, Product Quality, Tools &amp; Equipment   By working together and with multiple presenters, attendees were able to gain different perspectives, updates on materials, learn new pedagogy, and participate in hands-on labs in a very strategic way.  BROADER IMPACTS  The conference team worked with the Latino Leadership Initiative which resulted in increasing attendance of students underrepresented in STEM and successfully introducing 24 Latino students to STEM careers.   NEW actively      recruited eight NSF ATE Centers to participate in a variety of ways such      as presenting sessions, exhibiting, networking, and providing information      about their Center. MatEd and NCA&amp;TÃ†s ERC partnership continues to      promote and share this event not      only within ATE but also across other NSF directorates.
