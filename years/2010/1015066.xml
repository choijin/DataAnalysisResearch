<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to develop novel algorithms that are required to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles for better understanding the structure of forest ecosystems in relation to fire risk assessment. The algorithms will enable unmanned aerial vehicles to assist in identifying high fire-risk regions in a given area, aid fire managers to monitor and respond to fire propagation in real-time and map large areas for post-fire assessment. &lt;br/&gt;The approach is to 1) develop algorithms for creating surface fuel maps using tools by remote sensing, 2) develop approximation algorithms and heuristics to efficiently allocate the resources and plan the motion of the vehicles such that the regions that need to be monitored are visited within a desired time. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  With regards to remote sensing, the proposed methods will provide an affordable way of obtaining precise estimates of forest surface and canopy fuels that is currently not available. With regards to resource allocation and motion planning, the methods will advance the state of art in the development of fast, sub-optimal algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  Fire managers will be able to swiftly identify high fire-risk regions in a given area using the developed tools and efficiently respond to fire propagation in real-time. Controlled burning has ecological, societal and economic benefits: enhanced ecological processes in fire-dependent ecosystems, abated risk of catastrophic fires, reduced property damage and loss of life. This project will provide an opportunity for students to learn tools from diverse disciplines and valuable teaching material for courses in remote sensing and robotics.</AbstractNarration>

For a general collection of heterogeneous UAVs, this guarantee       increases linearly with the number of UAVs (and not the targets).

The novel       feature of our work is that it involves lower bounding a problem that is       quintessentially a combination of variational and combinatorial       optimization problems. Suboptimal routing with       limited fuel-tank for each UAV while allowing refueling: We developed       novel, easy to compute suboptimal solutions that enable a collection of       heterogeneous UAVs to be routed when their fuel tank capacities and       locations of the refueling stations are known a priori. Suboptimal routing of UAVs       with information constraints: Since power on-board is limited, a pair of       UAVs may not be able to communicate unless they are within a specified       distance of each other. In GPS-denied environments, the problem of       localizing UAVs is a difficult problem; in this problem, we dealt with       routing UAVs with beacons on the ground that can communicate with UAVs       only if they are in their proximity so as to enable UAVs to localize.       Each UAV not in the proximity of a beacon can localize only if it can       triangulate its location with other localized UAVs. We developed       real-time implementable suboptimal routing algorithms for UAVs in such       GPS-denied environments while providing a guarantee on the suboptimality.
