<AbstractNarration>Computer storage systems are exploding in size and are vulnerable to an ever-increasing variety of failures.  Without measures to anticipate these failures, the systems will lose data, an outcome with dire and tragic consequences.  Protecting the storage systems of today and the next decade from failures that can lead to lost data is of paramount importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Erasure codes are mathematical entitities that protect computer storage systems from losing data when they fail.  With an erasure code, one computes and stores extra information from the data that is already stored, so that when disks fail or become corrupted, the original data may be recalculated from the survivors.  Optimal erasure codes are well-known for small storage systems.  However, larger systems exist today and will be more prevalent in the future, and the current erasure codes that protect them are suboptimal.  This project attacks the unknown to develop, evaluate and implement improved erasure codes for large-scale storage installations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project begins at the threshold of what is currently known and explores codes for larger and more complex systems.  The exploration is multi-pronged, addressing the mathematical framework, structural properties and implementational features of the codes.  The result will be new codes that perform better and are safer than current ones.  Besides formal presentations of the codes, the project will implement and disseminate them as open-source software libraries, so that the practitioners that need them can leverage the work without having to master the complex math that underlies them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We as a society rely heavily on computer storage for personal data, business data and scientific data.  Our demand for storage has grown to the point where the devices that store our data can break with alarmingly high probability.  This project focuses on the problem of keeping data from being lost when storage devices break.   The central technology to protect data is called erasure coding.  Erasure coding adds redundancy to a storage system by enriching the system with coding information, calculated mathematically from the data that is stored.  When storage devices break, the data that they held may be recalculated from the surviving devices and the erasure code.   In this project, the PI performed research to improve the state of the art with respect to erasure coded storage systems.  The following outcomes resulted from the project.  Their intellectual merit arises from pushing the envelope of our knowledge about erasure codes and the storage systems that benefit from them.  Their broader impact lies in implementations of the codes and systems in question.   Outcome #1: Making the calculations faster.  Erasure codes are mathematical, and require computational horsepower to encode and decode.  The PI performed several projects that improved the computational overhead of erasure codes.  Some of the projects identified ways to structure the mathematics to require fewer processing operations.  Others improved the way that the mathematics are mapped to the processing system.   Outcome #2: Reducing the storage burden.  When storage devices fail, their contents must be calculated from the surviving devices.  This is called "reconstruction." When a storage system has been designed to tolerate a large number of device failures, and a smaller number of devices break, there are a variety of ways that the system may perform reconstruction.  With this outcome, the PI derived ways to analyze these situations to minimize the amount of storage required to reconstruct after small numbers of failures.   Outcome #3: Blending erasure codes with cryptography.  The PI designed and implemented a scheme where erasure codes and cryptography are blended to make a system impervious to both devices breaking and devices being stolen.  In the former case, the data may be reconstructed.  In the latter case, so long as the number of compromised devices is below a threshhold, the attackers gain no information about the devices that they have stolen.   Outcome #4: Erasure codes designed for how today's storage systems actually fail.  Traditional erasure coded storage systems tolerate disks that break.  However, disks have grown to the point where not only do the disks themselves break, but certain sectors on non-failed disks will also break. The PI designed an erasure coding paradigm called "SD" (for Sector-Disk) codes that focuses on combinations of disks and sectors breaking.  Finally, during the period of the award, the PI delivered several tutorials and primers on erasure codes to practitioners in the storage community.
