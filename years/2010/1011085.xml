<AbstractNarration>The objective of this youth media project is to provide 14-24 year olds with training and hands-on experience in engineering, and the physical and biological sciences. The project is designed around core practices that engage youth in original research and inquiry through experimentation, development, and creative use of new technologies and tools to communicate STEM to the public. Youth Radio project participants in Oakland, CA, Atlanta, GA and Washington, DC include 540 youth, 80% of whom are low-income and/or youth of color, plus another 400 youth via off-site outreach in schools and community centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core deliverables include: (1) "Brains and Beakers," eight live events per year where a visiting STEM researcher brings his/her work out of the lab and onto the stage at Youth Radio facilities, demonstrating key principles and discoveries and interacting with youth participants; (2) "Youth Radio Investigates," an annual 6-part multimedia series, where youth partner with university and industry-based researchers to explore the veracity of  scientific claims applied to products and services and they use every day; (3) The "Application Development Lab," where youth develop, create and disseminate online embeddable and downloadable applications (12 annually) that serve real needs in youth communities. The digital media produced by the youth will be broadcast by National Public Radio and distributed online through various sites including iTunes and BoingBoing.net, one of the most frequently visited technology-focused sites on the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project advisors include STEM researchers in universities as well as highly experienced and successful new media technology developers.  Project partners include National Public Radio, KQED, the California Academy of Sciences, and the Oakland Unified School District.  This project builds on the successful prior work (NSF #0610272) that initiated a Science and Technology program within the Youth Radio organization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summative evaluation by Rockman et al will measure how the program affects students' science and technology knowledge, skills, and attitudes. It will build on the evaluation from the prior NSF funded project (#0610272) that highlighted the organizational and staff growth processes as Youth Radio discovered how to design and implement successful, sustainable STEM programs.  Rockman will evaluate the new programs (Youth Investigates, Brains and Beakers, and the Application Lab), measuring the following STEM-related student outcomes/impacts:  perceptions of selves as producers/creators of science or technology; attitudes toward science and perceptions of scientists; understanding the process of scientific inquiry and research and/or technology skills development; and understanding or interest in careers in science or technology (based on National Research Council report, 2009).  Data will be collected from the youth at the Oakland site and from the other Youth Radio bureaus to determine which aspects of the program transfer to multiple sites and which ones are unique to a specific location or set of circumstances.  Methods include surveys of student attitudes, participant focus groups, interim assessments, objective skills assessments, and interviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides an innovative new model for collaborations between STEM researchers and under-represented youth resulting in digital media that impacts the youth as well as the public's understanding and engagement in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In 2010, Youth Radio launched an ambitious, 3-year initiative with support from NSF to create robust and transformative STEM learning opportunities for underserved youth. Called DO IT!, the initiative operated at the intersection of science, media, and technology. Young people partnered with peers and STEM professionals to carry out authentic, relevant scientific inquiry and to create media and technology products out of those experiences that reached mass audiences online and on the air.   As the nationÆs premier producer of youth stories for public media, a regular contributor to National Geographic online, and NPRÆs Youth Desk, Youth Radio was uniquely positioned to drive this work. In addition to generating award-winning STEM media content, DO IT! enabled Youth Radio to launch the Mobile Action Lab, among the first programs worldwide to partner young people with professional designers and engineers to create mobile apps that engage and inform communities. Anticipating and helping to lay a foundation for the current groundswell of enthusiasm for "teaching kids to code," the Lab took the innovative approach of embedding computer science inside a youth-driven production company. App development was a way for youth to make meaningful technology that mattered to them and their communities.   DO IT! developed a new model for informal STEM learning with a proven track-record for engaging underserved youth. Youth Radio teens and adult staff shared that model through high-impact gatherings including SXSW, the Digital Media and Learning Conference, and the American Educational Research Association; and via publications in books and refereed journals. Youth Radio is further disseminating its STEM learning model with support from a new NSF grant that funds the creation of curriculum toolkits to replicate our approach in a range of learning environments nation-wide.   Eighty percent of Youth RadioÆs students are low-income youth and young people of color&mdash;precisely the population that has been marginalized from STEM learning and career opportunities. The young people who attend Youth RadioÆs free, after-school programs in Downtown Oakland and at our bureaus nationally are endlessly curious about and profoundly affected by conditions in their communities that can be exposed, explained and changed through the disciplines of science. Rarely are they given the opportunity to raise the questions, lead the discovery process, network with leading thinkers, and report results.   Intensively training on average 250 young people annually and--through workshops and visits--exposing well over a thousand others to STEM concepts, DO IT! created that opportunity, through three programs:     Youth Radio Investigates (YRI): This innovative series of 22 multi-media segments paired young people with science journalists and disciplinary experts to collect data and produce stories for major online and broadcast media outlets, reaching audiences in the tens of millions. Topics included the safety of water in schools, effects of PTSD on the adolescent brain, and the science behind advertisingÆs influence. Relevant STEM disciplines included biology, neuroscience, criminology, and environmental science. Evaluation data show that YRI reporters learned to organize, analyze, and extrapolate from data; gained in-depth understanding of science content and methods; and increased their confidence for communicating science to the community.     Brains and Beakers: Designed to take science "out of the lab and onto the stage," this series of 24 demo/dialogues brought STEM investigators and inventors into conversation with youth. Youth Radio students researched and hosted the Brains and Beakers events, and then published videos that spread the STEM learning experience sparked by the event to wide audiences. Among other STEM-rich activities, participants got to create a "gripping hand" using a sand-filled balloon, test consumer products for possible lead contamina...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
