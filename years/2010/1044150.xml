<AbstractNarration>This Research and Training Group (RTG) award for the Logic group at Caltech/UC-Irvine/UCLA supports a variety of initiatives designed to increase the number of US citizens and permanent residents who pursue careers in mathematical logic and mathematics as a whole, and to tighten the connection between training, studies, research, and professional skills. Specific initiatives supported by the award include: recruitment and training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in mathematical logic; better preparation of these students and postdocs for their future careers through inter-campus meetings that concentrate on professional development; undergraduate summer schools in mathematical logic with the multiple aims of drawing students to the subject nationwide, preparing them for graduate school, connecting them with graduate students, and improving the teaching, mentoring, and leadership skills of graduate student assistants in the schools; graduate summer schools, again aimed at students nationwide, with the aim of bridging studies and research for graduate student participants, connecting them with postdoctoral scholars, and preparing the postdoctoral scholars who assist in the school for mentoring and leadership in their future careers; summer session courses for transfer students from community colleges, to help them bridge the gap between&lt;br/&gt;lower- and upper-division courses; enrichment lectures and activities for middle school girls, high school students, and undergraduate students including in community colleges, exposing them to the many creative aspects of mathematics, with the aim of drawing them to further studies in the subject; and an online library of videotaped talks available for downloading, in mathematical logic at levels ranging from general audience to graduate seminar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These initiatives will enhance training, increase participation, and increase the visibility of mathematical logic and mathematics as a whole, at a wide spectrum of training stages, both locally and nationally.</AbstractNarration>

Outcomes include:  Five undergraduate summer schools at UCLA, aiming to introduce future mathematicians to key results and methods from mathematical logic.  Five graduate summer schools at UC-Irvine, going deep into specific topics in mathematical logic.  Summer courses at UCLA to provide a bridge between lower division and upper division courses in mathematics, aimed mainly at entering transfer students from community colleges.

The goal of this very successful program is to encourage and enable students to pursue STEM careers, and more generally to increase their interest and knowledge of STEM fields.  A series of lunch-time seminars for undergraduates at UC-Irvine, on topics of current research in mathematics. The goal of the series is to encourage the students to pursue higher degrees in mathematics. Several lectures at nearby undergraduate colleges (4 year and community colleges) on mathematical logic. Summer REUs (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) at Caltech, that allowed undergraduate students to work on topics of current research in mathematical logic.  A series of quarterly half-day conferences, rotating between Caltech, UC-Irvine, and UCLA, where graduate students and postdocs presented their work. These conferences allowed the students and postdocs to practice their presentation skills and prepare for professional meetings.  Additional graduate students at the three campuses, whose training was supported by the grant, and additional postdoctoral fellows.   Tele-conferencing equipment that allows the three groups to more easily hold joint seminars with remote participants.    Overall it is estimated that the grant supported over 170 undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs, through the summer schools, summer courses, REUs, and fellowships. In addition attendance at the various lecture series is estimated at over 1200, the K-12 outreach is estimated to have reached several hundred students and their families, and UC-Irvine college visit days have attendance of over 100 students and families per year.
