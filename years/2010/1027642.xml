<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy was held in Oakland CA on May 16 &ndash; 19, 2010. Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for the presentation of developments in computer security and electronic privacy, and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field.  This grant provided funding to assist 12 US-based students to attend this meeting. Participation in symposia like this is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field.  The support requested in this proposal enabled the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.   The amount of support provided to each student was on average $850.  This amount covered a portion of the studentÃ†s travel (economy airfare), lodging for two nights and conference registration.  Selection Process  The recipients of the travel awards were selected by a committee chaired by PI Terry Benzel, USC Information Sciences Institute and included the conference General Chair, Ulf Lindqvist , the Program co-chair David Evans, the TC Chair Hilarie Orman and the Registration Chair Deb Frincke.    In 2010 students with accepted papers were not given priority.  Instead priority was given to:  Small and underrepresented institutions Undergraduates  Women  Multi-discipline students   The reason for this was that the majority of the students with accepted papers were from large well established institutions with existing NSF grants. In addition, the committee felt that when a student and her advisor submit a paper to the conference that there is some assumption about the availability of travel funds.  Thus, the travel funds from this grant were reserved for students who did not have accepted papers.   Students were required to submit a CV and a short paragraph on why they would benefit from attending as well as an email from their advisor. The advisor email did not need to be a formal letter but rather needed to verify that they are students in good standing and they would recommend them for the grant.  Statistics  The combined funds from the three grants provided funding for 29 domestic and 2 international students from 22 institutions.  Grants were given to 10 women, 2 undergraduate students and 4 masters students.  A total of 53 applications were received from 29 institutions.  Of the applications 16  were from students with accepted papers from 10 institutions.  When multiple students were given grants from the same institution or faculty advisor the faculty at those institutions were consulted directly.   This is summarized in the table below:                               Applications Received           Funded                  Totals           53           31                  Institutions           30           22                  With Accepted Papers           16           0                  Women           12           10                  Under Grad           2           2                  Masters Students           5           4                 Last Modified: 10/11/2011       Submitted by: Terry V Benzel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
