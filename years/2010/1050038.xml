<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to write a book summarizing 25 years of NSF-funded research, that will explore the influence of natural selection and other micro-evolutionary (short term) forces on macro-evolutionary (longer term) patterns. The book will focus largely on a model study system consisting of birds, feather-feeding lice, and symbiotic bacteria in the lice. The authors are particularly interested in how natural selection acting among these groups influences patterns of joint speciation and diversification. The book will synthesize results from over 50 papers published by the investigators over the past 25 years. It will include re-analyses of data in light of more recent studies and comment on a similar evolutionary patterns in a range of other systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed volume will synthesize one of the most integrative studies of co-evolutionary dynamics, to date, ranging from extensive work on ecological interactions to the explanation of long-term evolutionary patterns. Major conclusions and fun examples from the book will be disseminated to Utah K-12 teachers and students in collaboration with the Utah Museum of Natural History, where the lead investigator is an adjunct curator. The PIs will also create a new "teaching toolbox" - and conduct associated workshops - concerning host-parasite co-evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main outcome of this project is a book:  Clayton, D. H., S. E. Bush and K. P. Johnson.  Coevolution of life on hosts:  Integrating ecology and history. University of Chicago Press (Interspecific Interactions series edited by John N. Thompson). 323 pp text, 14 boxes, 125 figures, 16 color plates.  Currently in press (due autumn 2015)     This book provides an introduction to coevolution in both microevolutionary (ecological) and macroevolutionary (historical) time.  It emphasizes the integration of cophylogenetic, comparative, and experimental approaches for testing coevolutionary hypotheses. Recent work in coevolutionary biology has been successful in demonstrating coadaptation between species in response to reciprocal selection.  Fewer studies have tested the influence of coadaptation on the diversification of interacting taxa. We review studies that attempt to do just this.  The overriding question addressed is "how do ecological interactions influence patterns of codiversification?"  We focus on the coevolution of interacting species, particularly those involving external parasites that live on hosts.  Such parasites include a diverse assemblage of organisms, ranging from herbivorous insects on plants, to monogenean worms on fish, to feather lice on birds.  Ectoparasites are powerful models for studies of coevolution because they are easy to observe, mark, and count.  Many of the examples in the book involve parasitic lice of birds and mammals.  Lice and their hosts are unusually tractable systems for studies that attempt to integrate coevolutionary ecology and history.   Some chapters in the book are broad in scope, introducing coevolutionary concepts that apply to all interacting species.  Other chapters focus more narrowly on the biology and coevolution of lice and their hosts.  The overall goal of the book is to integrate coevolutionary concepts with tests of coevolutionary theory in micro- and macro-evolutionary time.  The book concludes with a framework for better integration of coadaptation and codiversification.          Last Modified: 03/11/2015       Submitted by: Sarah E Bush]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
