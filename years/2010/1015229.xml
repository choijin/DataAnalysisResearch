<AbstractNarration>The interaction between the Earth's mantle and climate systems occurs through complex processes and over disparate time scales.  On the geological time scale, the tectonic cycle buffers CO2 through mountain building and weathering, providing Earth with a temperate climate.  The operation of plate tectonics, however, is not impervious to climatic conditions.  Although liquid water is thought necessary to lubricate plate tectonics, recent theories postulate that a cool surface promotes lithospheric failure or damage, which then permits plate-like mantle flow on Earth, but not Venus.  On human time scales, the rapid efflux of carbon from burning fossil fuels is possibly best mitigated by effectively returning CO2 to the mantle, i.e., by carbon sequestration in mafic and ultramafic rocks.  Such processes of mantle-climate interaction, whether natural or man-made, involve multi-phase physics with the additional complexities of chemical reactions, grainsize evolution, and damage mechanics.  This proposal is for the PI's on-going work on the development and application of two-phase damage theory; here we propose to address two issues:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. How plate tectonics initiated and plate-boundaries evolve remain unsolved questions in geodynamics, and provide tests of plate generation theories that go beyond modeling instantaneous present-day plate motions.  Moreover, such plate-generation questions are possibly linked to climate evolution.  If plate generation and a temperate Earth-like climate are mutually required of each other, then there is probably a critical surface temperature at which a planet does or does not achieve a cool/plate-like state, i.e., somewhere between Earth and Venus; this has implications for terrestrial planet evolution both within and outside our own solar system.  The timing and vigor of plate initiation on early Earth would also have influenced Archaean climate, estimates of which are highly variable.  The formation of new plate boundaries and plate evolution (shrinkage and reorganization) is also associated with climate variation (e.g., by changes in CO2 flux balance, the effect of continental configurations on ocean circulation, weathering, ice-formation, etc.).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. How can damage enhanced percolation facilitate carbon sequestration in mantle derived rocks?  In particular, how are fresh mineral surfaces for carbonate reactions generated by propagating damage fronts during injection of solutions of CO2 in mafic settings?  For example, pulses of pressure or porosity waves in these settings would be associated with both void-generating and grainsize-reducing damage that would then enhance CO2 reactivity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These topics bracket the end-member time-scales in mantle-climate interactions. However, the natural long term processes can inform us how to mitigate short-term imbalances. Mitigating anthropogenic CO2 increases without pushing the problem to future generations requires a geologically long-term solution, and is best addressed by mimicking natural carbon buffering by weathering of mantle minerals.  This proposal will combine long-term, planetary-scale perspectives with useful approaches to treating the Earth's mantle-climate system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Geophysics Program and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure's CI-Reuse Venture Fund.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The interaction between the Earth's plate tectonic activity and climate occurs through various processes and over a wide range of time scales.  On the geological time scale, the plate tectonic cycle buffers CO2 through mountain building and weathering, providing Earth with a temperate climate.  The operation of plate tectonics, however, is not impervious to climatic conditions.  Although liquid water is thought necessary to lubricate plate tectonics, recent theories suggest that a cool surface promotes plate-tectonic-like mantle flow on Earth (but not on Venus).  On the human time scale, the rapid efflux of carbon from burning fossil fuels is possibly best mitigated by effectively returning CO2 to the mantle, i.e., by carbon sequestration in metal-rich volcanic (mafic and ultramafic) rocks.  Such processes of mantle-climate interaction, whether natural or man-made, involve complex physics of rock-fluid interaction and how rock grains evolve with time.  This project involved development of ``damage" theories of  how mantle rocks flow and deform and give rise to plate tectonics, and also allow us to understand how fluids injected underground interact with their bedrock.     One major project outcome is a theory for how rock grains evolve during deformation, which gives a predctive model for how Earth developed its unique form of plate tectonics.  Mineral grains in rocks can become smaller when the rock is deformed under the driving force of mantle convection (wherein hot material rises, cold material sinks), and this causes the rock to get weaker.  The weakness causes more rapid deformation and thus drives the grains to smaller sizes, and causes even more intense and focussed weakness.   Such a weakening feedback is what allows plate tectonics to form, since plate boundaries are very narrow focussed weak zones on which all the activity (volcanoes, earthquakes) occurs, while the plate interiors are vast and strong and barely deform.  However, damage is offset by healing of rocks, which takes place if the grains grow (much as bubbles in foam will eventually grow), and healing depends on temperature of the rocks in the near surface (hotter temperatures lead to faster healing).  The theory developed allows us to apply the basic physics of how rock grains at a millimeter scale evolve to influence how the entire plate behaves.  We have applied this theory to understand how plate tectonics first arose 4 billion years ago on Earth because of its relatively cooler surface,  but not on Venus, whose surface has always been extremely hot.    A second major project outcome is understanding how rocks are damaged when fluid is injected into them, as might occur in storage of CO2,  or extraction of unconvential fuels (i.e., natural gas by "fracking").  Without damage fluid gradually diffuses into rock pore spaces. But with damage the rock near the injection site tends to be more easily deformed and absorbs more fluid, and less leaks away, which is important for storage technology.
