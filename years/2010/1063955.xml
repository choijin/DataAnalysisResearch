<AbstractNarration>1063955  &lt;br/&gt; Shah, University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary of Proposal:  This project is for support for 12 US participants, including professors and students -to a workshop on Environmental Nanotechnology and Ethics to be held in Lahore, Pakistan on March 28-31, 2011.  The workshop is part of longer collaborative activities on nanotechnology research and education supported by the U.S. and Pakistan, and it has a new dimension related to environmental and societal implications of nanotechnology, in addition to synthesis of nanomaterials.  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The workshop deal with environmental and ethical issues associated with the emergence of science and engineering at the nanoscale. This topic provides a unique perspective that is not fully addressed at many existing conferences.   The meeting will provide exchange of information, contribute to developing personal connections, and will contribute to strengthening scientific and engineering research.   The PI has already sought/obtained local financial support in addition to this NSF funding for the travel of US participants.   Preference in travel support will be given to those who have not traveled to Pakistan before.  The planned technical programming and slate of invited speakers are strong.    &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The workshop is designed to introduce emerging topics in environmental nanotechnology and ethics to a scientific community within Pakistan and nearby regions.  Ten US students are expected t attend this workshop.  The workshop provides a unique forum to stimulate collaborations between US and Pakistan in the areas of environmental and ethical issues associated with nanotechnology.  The US participation in the workshop is important considering the value of exchanges with Pakistan and neighboring countries, recognizing the increased level of funding and overall research for nanotechnology in Pakistan, and the potential of the workshop to address new topics on environmental and societal implications.</AbstractNarration>

Ismat Shah   Awardee: University of Delaware   Award Number: 1063955     The grant was for organizing an International Conference on Environmental Nanotechnology &amp; Ethics, in Pakistan.

The NSF group from USA included 7 professors and students.     Outcome of the Conference and Workshop:  Several new contact and collaborations started as a result of the interactions between the US and Pakistani Scientists. Some examples are as follows:  Prof. S. Ismat Shah (PI: University of Delaware) and Prof. Salamat Ali (GCU, Lahore, Pakistan) have started a new collaboration focused on research on organic photovoltaics. A proposal was written and submitted to National Academy of Sciences (NAS), USA, and Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan. The proposal was funded. Several Pakistani students and scientist have visited the University of Delaware as short-term (2 weeks &ndash; 1 month) and long term (1 month &ndash; 1 year) scholars. Professor Arshad Bhatti, COMSATS Institute of Information Science and Technology (CIIT) served as the Pakistani host for the Conference and workshop. Prof. Bhatti and Professor Hamid Zaman, Boston University, USA, who was one of the invitee for the workshop, have started a new collaboration on materials for drug delivery. Professor Bhatti and Professor Zaman are in the process of submitting proposal to NSF for funding for a new workshop in biomedical materials in Pakistan. At the Workshop, which was attended by upper administration personnel from various Universities in Pakistan, a joint resolution and action plan was agreed upon. The salient features of this resolution are as follows:       Each academic unit unilaterally introduce courses in ethics which, at first, will be optional but in the near future will become required course(es). The inquiry into ethics and public policy should not vanish with the end of these conferences/workshops. All academic institutes, particularly those which are involved in the research in nanoscience, should provide other options to their students, beyond the courses, to keep students involved in discussions of safety, ethics and public policy. Institutions, with the help of HEC, ought to provide options for training in safety, ethics, and public policy for the faculty.  As interest is academia and industry liaison is increasing, both parties ought to keep the issues related to ethics and safety in mind during the discussions of science and technology. Government, through existing offices of HEC, Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and other such institutions, should move to form a regulatory body to implement any new policy that will come out as research in nanoscience and technology advances. HEC should gradually implement policies that would require a write-up in each proposal on possible implications of the proposed work on environment. Following the example of NSF each proposal will be required to have "Broader Impact" section where the impact of the research beyond the immediate science is described.
