<AbstractNarration>The prediction of ice crystal nucleation in clouds has been a long-standing problem in atmospheric science.  The difficulties in identifying ice nuclei that initiate ice crystals in a cloud may be due to 1) lack of information regarding chemical composition and activation spectrum of ice nuclei, 2) the multiple mechanisms by which the nucleation might occur, and 3) the limits of past instrumentation in estimating the number of the smallest ice particles.  Past observations often exhibit a discrepancy: far fewer ice nuclei are observed than ice crystals, and especially so in maritime clouds at higher temperatures.  Laboratory experiments and observations in clouds suggest that secondary ice production (where multiple ice crystals are produced by the activation of a single ice nucleus) may act under certain conditions, sometimes explaining the enhanced number of ice crystals, but not always.  This deficiency of knowledge propagates into uncertainties in the prediction of precipitation in mixed phase clouds, where liquid and ice particles interact in a myriad of ways to form precipitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to acquire new knowledge regarding primary and secondary ice crystal nucleation in maritime clouds, considering the influence of the warm rain process as a leading explanation for the first ice, and the high number concentrations of ice crystals sometimes observed in the past.  Other candidate hypotheses to be explored include enhanced ice nucleation in evaporation zones&lt;br/&gt;resulting from entrainment, additional ice nuclei supplied by intrusions of desert dust, and artificial enhancement of ice crystals by passage of a research aircraft through the clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit.  In this study, an unprecedented dataset will be collected that will have a detailed documentation of ice nuclei and the earliest appearance of the first small ice particles in maritime cumuli.   Then the data will be analyzed considering both the dynamical and microphysical evolution of the clouds.   High-resolution 3D numerical cloud simulations and Lagrangian microphysical calculations will also be conducted, critical for differentiating among the hypothesized ice nucleation mechanisms.  The cloud dynamics control the temporal scales involved in ice crystal nucleation and growth, the transport of particles through the cloud, and the regions where different phases of hydrometeors can interact.  The observations alone cannot capture the cloud motions and evolution in their entirety, making the numerical modeling essential to understand the evolution and transport of liquid and ice particles below and above the freezing level.  Bulk (Eulerian) microphysics, including a 10-class ice scheme, will also be run in the simulations to test the ability of different microphysical processes to explain the observations.  Finally, simulations initialized with and without desert dust will be compared to elucidate its effects on primary and secondary ice nucleation mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts.   Numerous areas in atmospheric science will benefit from the understanding of ice crystal nucleation and its effects on convective precipitation, such as global and regional climate model predictions of clouds, numerical weather prediction of daily precipitation events, and predictions of tropical storms and hurricanes.  Graduate students will benefit from participating in a field campaign, gaining experience in both observational analysis and numerical modeling, and presenting their research findings at scientific workshops and conferences.  An outreach program conducted during ICE-T for university students at a local institution in the Caribbean will also benefit under-represented groups in atmospheric science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award sought to fill holes in our present understanding of ice production in maritime cumuli. It has long been a mystery why so much ice can form in these clouds, given the clean air over the ocean.  (Certain particles in the air called ice nuclei initiate ice in the clouds.)  Ice is important because it can influence the longevity of the cloud and the amount of precipitation that falls, affecting not only daily weather prediction but also climate and climate change; ice in clouds over the ocean may also affect hurricane longevity and strength.  We have helped gather an unprecedented data set on ice formation on maritime cumulus clouds, where we have documented how quickly and in what amounts it initially appears and the precursors to its formation, in more detail than ever before found, due to a special cloud radar mounted on the aircraft in addition to the standard aircraft instrumentation.  We have also used these new data to help constrain our numerical models of ice formation in these clouds.  Through the modeling, we have shown that not only the ice nuclei in the air, but also secondary ice formation processes (producing more ice than one per ice nucleus) can indeed play an important role as has been suggested in other studies, and this seems to be enhanced in maritime clouds because they have so much more rain than land-based clouds.  We have developed models with extra details included to study these processes.  We can explain the ice that was observed if we add more ice nuclei to the model than what we measured, suggesting that those scientists studying ice nuclei should continue to look for new sources, as they have been. Our numerical modeling has also shown how models predicting precipitation resulting from ice processes might be improved.  This award was used to support a female student while she attained a Ph.D., that included her participation in the data gathering part of the field campaign, her learning to use numerical cloud models, and her gaining experience in giving presentations on her work at two different conferences.  This award also gave some support to two other Ph.D. students that allowed them to gain some experience analyzing cloud observations.  This award also allowed the PI and her graduate student to help organize and execute, with the help of the other ICE-T participants, an outreach day on the island of Puerto Rico where we talked about the science of the ICE-T field campaign, and gave tours of the research aircraft and its instrumentation to groups of school children and other members of the general public.
