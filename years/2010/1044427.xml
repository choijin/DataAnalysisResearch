<AbstractNarration>Development is underway of intelligent resource management and collaboration tools to increase the use of NSDL resources by middle school teachers of mathematics and science within the Middle School Portal 2: Math and Science Pathways (MSP2). MSP2 is a social networking site that promotes collaboration among teachers. The project builds on prior projects on automatic document classification, forum participant profiling and connecting help seekers to peer mentors within online forums. The add-on tool processes content posted by individual teachers according to their activities and interests and recommends use of matching NSDL resources. The automatic analysis of online forum content enable reuses of content that is difficult to access currently. The potential for wide adoption of the technology in any pathway portal is present. Such adoption is likely to entice more users to a portal because of the value-added recommender services.</AbstractNarration>
