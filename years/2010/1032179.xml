<AbstractNarration>SES-1032179&lt;br/&gt;PI: Beverly J. Silver&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Shaohua Zhan&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Johns Hopkins University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study investigates the causes of rapid rural economic growth in China during the 1980s and early 1990s. The researchers hypothesize that post-1949 governmental policies improving the status and welfare of lower classes created the preconditions for the later emergence of small-scale, labor-intensive rural enterprises. Data will be gathered from official statistics, government policy documents, and field research in two villages (one in Jiangsu Province and the other in Inner Mongolia). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The rapid rural economic growth in China lifted more than 200 million people out of poverty. This research lays the foundation for asking whether and to what extent this labor-intensive, resource-saving model is sustainable in China and can be replicated elsewhere as a solution to global ecological constraints and mass under-employment worldwide.</AbstractNarration>
