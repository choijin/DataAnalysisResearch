<AbstractNarration>The Science Coordination Office (SCO) serves the scientific community, NSF/OPP, and the arctic logistics contractor by coordinating input and providing an organized mechanism for OPP to consult with regarding decisions at Summit Station. SCO makes recommendations to CPS about ways to accommodate or mitigate conflicting requests from different science teams, as well as suggesting ways investigators might accomplish science objectives with smaller logistical impacts. SCO advocates on behalf of the community, suggesting science-based priorities for capital investments by OPP at Summit that will maintain and enhance the value of the site for research while striving to keep the station financially sustainable. This proposal includes two new members to SCO in order to represent the broader research community and diversify generations of researchers. This proposal adds functionality to the existing SCO. SCO will discuss research projects on the Greenland Inland Traverse and future research sites on the Greenland Ice Sheet hosting investigations similar to work done at Summit Station. Activities that expand communication in this proposal include significant updates to the current GEOSummit webpage such as incorporation of a virtual tour, Summit bibliography, and Summit GIS. SCO will create a Summit Listserv and host communication events such as a town hall style meeting at the Fall AGU meeting, increased effort at informal direct contact, and semi-annual teleconferences involving the scientific community. The SCO role in long-range and annual planning is to focus on the economic and environmental sustainability of the station in parallel with the preservation of core station scientific activities. These objectives are captured in a developing Long-range Plan for Summit Station.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes report: Science Coordination Office for Summit Station and the Greenland Inland Traverse  The nature of this project is ongoing coordination of the science effort at Summit and on the Traverse, but we have achieved several key outcomes.  Aside from increased cooperation among investgators at Summit and the support contractor with the goal of reducing emissions at Summit and decreasing the logistical footprint, we produced several works that will have lasting impact.      First, we redevloped the www.geosummit.org website into a much more dynamic, current, and readable format, with links to recent data and information for prospective Summit PIs, interested laypeople, and the general public. Not only is the revamped website improved now, but the architecture undeerlying the site will allow easy and frequent updates in the future.      Second, we developed a Geographic Information System (GIS), again for use by the support contractor, PIs, and the general public, showing current and historical locations of buildings, experiments, cargo, and other materials that may leave disturbances on the snow.  The GIS is available to anyone at any time through a web browser, and so people can view station configurations over multiple years.      Finally, the SCO authored or helped author numerous reports, summaries, and white-papers, to help consolidate and clarify the importance of clean science at Summit.
