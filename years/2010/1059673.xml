<AbstractNarration>1059673 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This EAGER award is to support collaboration by Dr. Magdi Iskander, University of Hawaii, Manoa and Dr. Hala Elsadek, Electronics Research Institute, Cairo, Egypt as well as with Dr. Christian Pichot, University of Nice, France and Dr. Zhijun Zhang, Tsinghua University in China. They plan to develop novel non-invasive microwave vital signs sensor and low-cost wireless tele-healthcare system for monitoring remote patients.  Based on results from this EAGER grant, the PI plans to submit a multi-institution proposal to NSF PIRE and the US-Egypt Joint Fund programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  This project is to develop wireless monitoring system for several vital signs. The scientists plan a comprehensive study, which includes the sensors, the DSP algorithms for data-transfer capabilities, and design and implementation of the microwave integrated circuits. They plan to use an array of distributed microwave sensors to simultaneously and continuously monitor several functions at multiple organs. Their aim of using reflection measurement, instead of transmission measurement, could eventually simplify the system, which leads to significant cost reductions. The described research falls strongly into the innovation category, which is a priority for NSF funding. The concept of a microwave stethoscope instrument, which is based upon reflection and absorption of microwave energy is novel, with good prospects for success. A qualified team of researchers has been assembled, and all are well positioned to perform the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The PIs will develop the proposed system in collaboration with researchers from international institutions in France, Egypt and China. The international collaboration appears to be genuine, and enriches the potential research outcomes. The tasks to be performed by the collaborators are clearly outlined. The possibility of producing low-cost monitoring systems is of particular interest to countries participating in this project.  Several students will be trained on the various technical aspects of this project. The interactions with international researchers and students in other countries can only enrich their educational experience.  This award is co-funded by the US-France Program and the US-Egypt Program in the Office of International Science and Engineering, and by The Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems.</AbstractNarration>
