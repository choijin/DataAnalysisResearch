<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will advance the field of "energy harvesting" by creating a low profile, high-energy electromagnetic device at a low manufacturing cost point.  The concept is a multi-pole energy generator to convert mechanical energy from vibrations into electrical energy for use in wireless sensor applications (lighting, smart phones, digital cameras).  It will replace or supplement battery power in these kinds of units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project will be the reduction of the use of standard batteries currently being used.  This will result in less hazardous waste, longer-lived devices, and, possibly, conservation of global fossil fuel supplies.  The need for standard batteries will be reduced, the lifespan of batteries will be enhanced, and it is expected that the smaller size, reduced profile, and increased energy voltage of the solution will ultimately reduce manufacturing costs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ EcoHarvesterÃ†s goal was to provide more effective energy harvesting solutions for the wireless sensor and portable electronics markets.  To this end we have developed a Multi-pole Energy Generator (MEG) based on electromagnetic energy conversion.  Specifically, the MEG technology provides a higher energy density than current solutions, inherently lower manufacturing costs, and a flat form factor that fits unobtrusively in wireless applications.  Phase 1 of the project entails the development of a motion based self-sustaining power module consisting of the MEG component and power conditioning circuit.   Our basic goals for Phase I were to develop the technology to a point where we could implement a MEG based energy harvesting prototype, develop a power circuit, integrate the two into a power system, and develop relationships with key stakeholders.  In all cases we have significantly exceeded these goals.  We have developed a series of prototypes and designs targeting three product spaces:  wireless light switches in support of new LED lighting systems, portable device and mobile phone chargers, and vibration based energy harvesters for wireless sensor networks.  In addition to the strict economic advantages of our technology for end users, there are compelling motivations to promote this technology for reasons of sustainability. Locally generated power is highly desirable due to the inherent inefficiencies of transmission and storage.  Because of its unique value proposition, our switch is an enabling technology and one of the key applications enabled by our devices are state of the art LED lighting systems which aim to dramatically reduce the energy usage of lightings that contributes to 20% of total energy usage of buildings.  The ability of installation without costly re-wiring also enables more effective retrofitting of some of the least efficient systems of the past and reduces the usage of copper wires. For smart phones, currently 2 million disposable chargers are sold and abandoned every year. The total environmental footprint of cell phone power can be reduced significantly by adopting our chargers.       Last Modified: 01/15/2011       Submitted by: Eri Takahashi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
