<AbstractNarration>Gene flow is a potent evolutionary force. Gene flow among populations and between species (hybridization) can have important applied consequences such as the evolution of invasive species and extinction by hybridization.  This project will result in a monograph that synthesizes the PI's career body of research on the consequences of gene flow both within and between species. The work will be broadened in perspective through consultation with other experts whose research on gene flow supplements and complements the PI's research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has inherent societal benefits because it focuses on the applied consequences of gene flow and hybridization. For instance, gene flow can result in new invasive species, the extinction of rare ones, and the unintended spread of engineered genes. Thus, the project will improve our understanding of the role of gene flow in issues of societal importance. The monograph to be produced will communicate useful scientific synthesis to a broad audience of scientists, civil servants, and the public, including policy-makers, Congressional staff, resource managers, and industry scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Gene flow (the successful transfer of genes from one population to another) is one of the four evolutionary forces, but one that is underappreciated. The specific objectives of the project were (1) to synthesize the investigatorÃ†s prior research on plant gene flow within species and between species (hybridization), (2) to make sense of those findings in an applied context, and (3) to set the stage for his future research by considering the new evolutionary genomic tools available for the analysis of plant gene flow.  Major Outcomes: To attain these objectives, the investigator took a research leave to consolidate the results of his prior gene flow and hybridization research. To gain a broader perspective and receive further training, the investigator visited and consulted with several plant gene flow experts (both in the United States and abroad) whose research has followed other pathways. Collaborations have been built with these researchers. Resulting papers have been published along the way. The investigator has given numerous talks both in the United States and abroad about his research synthesis. Also, a monograph is almost complete that will soon be published in a venue accessible to evolutionary biologists, applied scientists, and appropriate decision-makers.     Key outcomes:  Intellectual Merit: The project has focused on and demonstrated the significance of plant gene flow as an evolutionary force and as a natural phenomenon that has important implications for certain areas of applied plant science, such as plant conservation, evolution of invasiveness, and plant biotechnology.  Impact on technology transfer: The wide dissemination of the final product - the monograph - will make decision-makers in conservation and plant biotechnology more mindful of the likelihood of unintentional gene flow in their systems, likely to lead to some changes in existing practices.  Impact on society beyond science and technology. Gene flow is revealed in my monograph as a common and evolutionarily significant natural phenomenon. As the public and decision-makers outside of science become more mindful of gene flow as a natural component of ongoing evolution, they will realize that it is not a hazard in itself (as some have claimed) nor is it insignificant (as others have claimed). Thus, the findings disseminated in the monograph should have an impact on public policy (especially with regards to questions about the risks of plant biotechnology) that go beyond science per se.  Training and development of human resources: The PI has now received training in evolutionary genomics from visiting and interacting with scientists at meetings and other institutions. The PI mentored six undergraduates, one female Ph.D. student, and one female post-doc from under-represented groups as well as a female graduate student.
