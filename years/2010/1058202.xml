<AbstractNarration>This project explores how information processing by neural circuits is organized to use the resources of the brain efficiently.  The proposed theoretical studies apply fundamentally new approaches to analyzing the organization of cortical maps, by investigating how emerging principles of efficient design pertain to the computational mechanisms employed by the central brain. One aim studies how the "place map" in the hippocampus (where individual cells are tuned to fire in particular locations of an environment) should be organized to efficiently support general goal-directed navigation.     A second aim studies how the "shape map" in Inferotemporal Cortex (where individual cells are tuned to fire in response to particular visual shapes) should be organized to efficiently support shape perception, given the distribution of shapes in natural visual scenes.  These theoretical studies will lead to directly testable predictions of the distribution of tuning curves in cortical area IT and hippocampus. In this way, the theory will provide a lever for further experimental exploration of the architecture of form vision and spatial navigation in the brain.  Population codes also involve interactions between the different neurons, but techniques are not yet available to comprehensively study these interactions in cortex.   Thus, a third aim uses the retina (a piece of the central brain that has projected out into the eye) as a model system to theoretically and experimentally ask two basic, and as yet unanswered questions:  (a) Do neural networks adapt their interactions to stimulus statistics and noise as predicted by optimization theory?; (b) Is noise, as measured from single neurons, simply a mis-reading of correlated activity?     By asking and answering these questions, this project will also explain key aspects of how the retina prepares visual input for central processing.  Knowledge of how retinal circuits respond to natural and synthetic stimuli will be useful in designing effective prosthetic devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project strengthens the research connections between disciplines by bringing together analytical and theoretical methods from physics and machine learning with experimental techniques from neuroscience.  Students and postdocs who thus develop proficiency with both biological and quantitative physical techniques will be better able to cope with scientific and industrial challenges of coming decades.  The educational component of this proposal also addresses this national need directly by developing pedagogical materials for a course on "Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience".  The PI will give presentations to K-8 and high school students and to the general public with a view to broadening public knowledge of the field.  Outreach to historically disadvantaged communities will be carried out through established programs at Penn.  Finally, the PI is active in organizing lecture series and conferences that engage physicists to work within quantitative systems neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Using support from NSF grant "Neural Population Coding in the Brain", Balasubramanian made fundamental advances in our understanding of how large populations of neurons encode and transmit information.   On the experimental front, he carried out recordings in the retina that helped to understand how the retina adapts its responses to the structure of the visual field.   Several new theoretical discoveries were made.  The most important of these was a finding that explained the architecture of the "grid system" in the brain which provides animals with a GPS-like coordinate system for familiar locations.  Another key finding was an explanation of human sensitivity to some visual textures and not to others.  By studying the statistics of natural images, Balasubramanian demonstrated that sensitivity of the human brain to visual patterns is directly related to how much these patterns vary between patches of images, and hence to how informative these patterns are about the world.   All of these results contributed to a general theoretical explanation of the allocation of computational resources in the brain.  There were many broader outcomes too.  Balasubramanian gave many public lectures explaining his findings to the general public.  He also developed a course teaching students to applying the quantitative methods of physics to neural circuits.  Finally, he organized a new annual school in quantitative biology for graduate students at the International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy.
