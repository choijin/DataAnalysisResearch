<AbstractNarration>The PI requests MRI RAPID funding to Acquire a Hitachi S-3400N-II Variable Pressure Scanning Electron Microscope with an Analytical Quantitative Element Detector. This instrument will support a wide range of faculty and student research projects, including analysis of volcanic material ejected from the currently erupting volcano; analysis of locally-collected plankton, micro-molluscs, and botanical samples; sediment cores showing evidence of paleo-tsunami activity; analysis of Native Hawaiian artifacts in use-wear studies; and chemical / structural analysis of pharmaceutical crystal characteristics using SEM/EDS technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The equipment will enhance a new graduate program, several science programs and over twenty courses at the university. It will provide unique learning opportunities at the only 4 year college on the Big Island of Hawaii, a population base of great ethnic diversity. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory collaboration should be fruitful and opportunities for pre-college students are described. The multi-ethnic nature of the population of students (and everyone really on Hawaii) is clearly demonstrated, so NSF support would enhance the utilization of tax payer funds to under-served portion of the US population. And an SEM is an instrument which easily lends itself to outreach to high school and broad community application/ appreciation as "(microscopic) pictures are worth 1000s of words"</AbstractNarration>

Located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean on Hawai`i Island (the æBig IslandÆ), UH Hilo strives to broaden its impact on Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islanders and other minorities in STEM disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) including women. Many UH Hilo faculty maintain active research programs in addition to teaching, and faculty research is widely used as a means to engage students in experiential learning experiences. The development of the new SEM/EDS laboratory facilitated by this grant has greatly facilitated both research and experiential learning among our students in several disciplines on our campus.  Providing training and experience on the SEM  One of the mechanisms that was developed in order to help undergraduate and graduate students gain familiarity with SEM/EDS was a lower-division introductory course on the principles and general operating procedures of the instrument. This class covers broad principles of SEM/EDS and was designed to emphasize hands-on experience with the instrument. Although taught from within the Marine Science department, this course was designed to allow students interested in SEM/EDS from any discipline to participate. Additionally, several undergraduate classes now use the SEM/EDS facility for either an æintroductory tourÆ in lower division classes or for hands-on laboratory modules in upper-division classes.  Revealing new perspectives on marine ecosystems  Although the large charismatic organisms of the marine environment can immediately attract the attention of undergraduates, the availability of SEM/EDS capabilities at UH Hilo has enabled students to see and better understand the importance of microbes (Fig. 2), leading to several research projects such as examinations of marine plankton (Fig2A, 2B, 2C); the chemical composition of plankton micro-molluscs (Fig 2D, 2E); the presence and composition microbes on æmarine debrisÆ that accumulates in the central Pacific ocean and regularly washes up on our shores; and even microscopic examination of corals (Fig 2F).

SEM aids archaeologists working at ancient Hawaiian dig sites  Faculty and students from the UH Hilo Anthropology Department have used SEM to examine different types of wood charcoal looking for diagnostic morphologies (Fig 3).

One of our undergraduate students took on a project of cataloging SEM of known charcoal types, which may then be used to identify unknown fragments collected at dig sites.

Revealing the unseen side of familiar ??hi?a forests of Hawai`i Island  While many people have familiarity with the majestic ??hi?a (Metrosideros polymorpha) forests that exist on Hawaii Island, fewer have ever seen or given much thought to the microscopic organisms living on an ??hi?a leaf. The image in Fig 4 was taken and false-colored by a UH Hilo undergraduate student as part of a project to allow online examination of an ??hi?a forest from the macro- to microscopic-scale.
