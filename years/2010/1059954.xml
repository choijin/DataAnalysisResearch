<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  The College of Wooster Math, Computer Science, Physics, and Chemistry (WMCSPC) program provides scholarships to 30 individual students to complete a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree and prepares them for careers and graduate work in STEM fields. The program's objectives are to: have every WMCSPC student be involved in a learning community cohort; have a senior student as a mentor in the first year, along with a STEM faculty mentor; and participate in career counseling and advising. Given the College's Independent Study Program, its strong record of graduating students who pursue PhDs, and faculty who publish regularly in peer-reviewed journals, the WMCSPC Program can increase the number of students who pursue careers and graduate studies in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The strong growth in high tech jobs in northeastern Ohio necessitates the education of more students in the fields of mathematics, computer science, physics, and chemistry. The WMCSPC Program is achieving this goal, with special emphasis on women and minorities, first-generation college students, and those from low-income and disadvantaged families. The program allows these students to enroll full-time, complete degrees, and enter the workforce and graduate school virtually debt-free. Students are recruited from schools with large numbers of minorities in urban areas (e.g. Cleveland and Atlanta), as well as from Appalachia, where many families of lower socio-economic status reside. Key to the success of this program is the experience the college has in mentoring students and in its collaborative research partnerships with other institutions (e.g. Ohio State University). Accomplishments of WMCSPC students are disseminated through national conferences and peer-reviewed papers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of Wooster?s S-STEM program was to provide the necessary financial and other support for interested students with demonstrated financial need to ensure their continued success as they pursue majors, and eventually careers, in the specific STEM fields of Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics and Chemistry.   Each S-STEM student became part of a learning cohort that provided academic support and encouragement.  Students met twice per semester with the faculty mentor, Pamela Pierce, to check on student progress and to ensure that students were getting the required academic support from the STEM Zone, the Learning Center, the Math Center, Chemistry Tables, and the peer tutoring program.  We also encouraged our S-STEM Scholarship students to get involved with mentored undergraduate research during early stages in their college careers. Upperclass students gave talks on their research experiences to the younger students, and mentors offered further encouragement during regular meetings.  Ultimately 34 students from the classes of 2015-2019 were offered S-STEM scholarships for at least one semester of their college career.  One student left the college, 2 students switched to majors not included in the S-STEM Scholarship program, and 2 students left the program due to a low GPA.  Of the remaining 29 students, 23 have successfully completed their undergraduate degrees in STEM at The College of Wooster, and the other 6 are on track to graduate successfully.  Of these 29 students, all but one of them participated in a summer research experience of some kind, either on-campus or off campus, likely one of the major reasons that these students have persevered in their chosen fields of study.  Of the 23 participants who have graduated, 12 of them are pursuing Ph.D.s in fields such as Physics, Chemistry, Engineering or Mathematics. Two students have continued on to Medical School, while one plans to enroll in Dental School this fall.  Six students are employed in jobs that directly use their STEM college majors (software developer/software engineer(4), chemist(1), data analyst(1)).  Only 2 of the 23 alumni are currently pursuing non-science related careers.  In addition to the senior thesis written by every senior at Wooster, the S-STEM students have been quite successful as co-authors and co-presenters with faculty, as seen below.
