<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Atlantis, a 274? general purpose Global vessel; the R/V Knorr, a 279?general purpose Global vessel; and the R/V Oceanus, a 177?, general purpose, Intermediate vessel. All three vessels are operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The request includes four items listed by priority:&lt;br/&gt; 1) LADCP Instruments&lt;br/&gt; 2) SWR/LWR Met Sensors&lt;br/&gt; 3) Soutar Box Core&lt;br/&gt; 4) Knudsen 3260 Echosounder&lt;br/&gt; 5) SBE 19+ CTD&lt;br/&gt; 6) Multi-Channel LSC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
