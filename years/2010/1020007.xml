<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the combined effects of top predators and ecosystem size on the coexistence of species in food webs. Using numerous forest fragments of varying size that have been naturally created by lava flows in Hawai'i, the researchers will test the hypothesis that, as top predators, non-native rats alter food webs consisting of native birds, insects and spiders, with greater effects in smaller forest fragments. The study will involve experimental removal of rats, experimental exclusion of birds, stable isotope analysis of arthropods, and remote sensing analysis of forest size, complexity and productivity, all across a 100-fold gradient of forest fragment size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many forests around the world have been fragmented by development and pastoral land use, and also invaded by rats and other non-native predators. This project will improve the scientific basis for making management decisions, especially with regard to how non-native species removal can be used to restore native forests and how the effect may depend on forest size. This project will also enable the researchers to train a number of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows through their participation in research. Students will be recruited through internship programs at Stanford University and the University of Hawai'i, Hilo, which has a successful record of training under-represented students in environmental sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Habitat fragmentation by land use and development is a serious threat to persistence of biodiversity worldwide; it is also a natural process in the volcanic shield-building phase of oceanic islands.  A more recent impact to oceanic island systems is the introduction of non-native species, the impacts of which may be particularly severe because introduced species fill roles that did not exist previously. This project investigated the interactions of species in food webs, and how the effects of introduced predators may be contingent on ecosystem size. Using numerous forest fragments created naturally by volcanic lava flows (known as Hawaiian ækipukaÆ) that ranged 100-fold in area, we tested the hypothesis that non-native rats alter food webs consisting of native birds, insects and spiders. We expected greater impacts of invasive rats in smaller forest fragments.  In this ækipuka projectÆ, we experimentally removed black and Polynesian rats (Rattus rattus and R. exulans) with continuous snap-trapping for 4 years, June 2011-June 2015, in 16 of 34 monitored kipuka ranging in size from 0.1 to 12 hectares.
