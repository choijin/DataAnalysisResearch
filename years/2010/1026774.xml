<AbstractNarration>The Texas A&amp;M University System (TAMUS) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) will sponsor a Bridge to the Doctorate Program (BD) at Texas A&amp;M University during the 2010-2012 academic years.  The program involves collaboration with the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (COALS), the College of Science (COS), and the College of Engineering (COE) at the institution as well as participation in research projects at partner institutions such as TAMU-Kingsville.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TAMUS LSAMP BTD Program aims to increase the pool of science, technology, engineering or mathematics STEM PhDs among underrepresented minorities (URM) in STEM fields and to create a cohesive community of graduate students across different disciplines within the university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program benefits society by providing opportunities and activities at the graduate levels that lead to educational and career enhancements of graduate students. The TAMUS LSAMP BTD program will also enhance the infrastructure of research and education by advancing pursuit of graduate and doctoral STEM degrees at alliance institutions.</AbstractNarration>

Currently, 75% have matriculated into doctoral degrees of study. Fellows won seven (7) awards Fellows published three (3) articles Fellows participated in eight (8) presentations at numerous conferences Fellow participated in one (1) internship Fellows participated in two (2) study abroad research opportunities                         Last Modified: 10/30/2013       Submitted by: Karan L Watson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
