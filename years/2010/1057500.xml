<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Ned Porter of Vanderbilt University for kinetic and thermodynamic studies of free radical oxidation reactions of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The goals of this work are to understand the role of tyrosyl radicals in mediating these oxidative processes, to confirm or refute the involvement in this chemistry of a previously proposed radical-oxygen bound complex, and to investigate the interaction of radical oxidation products with proteins. These oxidation reactions play a role in the development of many neurological diseases and other human ailments associated with oxidative stress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research include its biological significance and connection to cellular function. Studies of antioxidants involve the determination of absolute rate constants for reactions of peroxyl radicals to the examination vitamin E and C, nature's antioxidants. Professor Porter's work also provides insight into the probable role of peroxidation in the progression of host diseases. Professor Porter is the associate director of an interdisciplinary center of chemical biology at Vanderbilt who has a strong track record of training female and minority scientists. His research group is active in undergraduate research through an REU program, and has been recognized for public outreach activities through the Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science organization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The reaction of oxygen with organic free radicals has been one of the continuing themes of research that has been supported by the NSF in my laboratories over the past forty years.  Much of the early scientific work on free radical oxidation was carried out because of the importance of this process in the degradation of commercially important materials such as natural and synthetic rubber.  In more recent years, however, the focus of studies has shifted to the free radical reaction of molecular oxygen with the molecules of life, particularly in the investigation of the reaction of fats and oils.   Fats are made up of a mixture of molecules that include fatty acids and derivatives of these fatty acids such as triglycerides and sterol esters. Fats and sterols, including cholesterol, belong to an important class of biologically important molecules desginated as lipids. Some fats and sterols are particularly prone to undergo a reaction with molecular oxygen.  This process proceeds via intermediate free radicals and antioxidants act to inhibit the chain oxidation reaction known as lipid peroxidation.  Lipid peroxidation occurs in living organisms under a variety of conditions that are the result of various stresses, many of which come from environmental exposures.  With the advent of modern analytical techniques that became available over the decades of work supported by NSF grants, we focused most of our work on the chemical mechanisms of lipid peroxdation.  One of the advances made in our studies was to develop a catalog for the reactivity of various lipids toward reaction with molecular oxygen.  For example, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are among the most susceptible of lipids to free radical oxidation and the products of PUFA oxidation can be used as markers of an environmental threat, such as exposure to cigarette smoke or ozone. We have also shown that a sterol that the body synthesizes on the way to cholesterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, is the most reactive molecule known towards lipid peroxidation. 7-Dehydrocholesterol is an important species in a devastating human genetic disorder that is now thought of as a lipid peroxidation disease, principally because of work supported by the NSF.  As a result of work supported by the NSF, we have published over 100 scientifically refereed journal articles on free radical oxidation and our work has been recognized by awards from the American Chemical Society (Cope Scholar and Norris Awards) and the Chemical Society of Great Britain (C. K. Ingold Medal).       Last Modified: 05/05/2017       Submitted by: Ned A Porter]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
