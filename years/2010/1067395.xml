<AbstractNarration>Proposal Review Analysis &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Wilson Merchan-Merchan&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CBET-1067395&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Oklahoma&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Analysis of Carbon Particulates Produced in Combustion of Biodiesels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the large energy demand of traditional fuels and therefore its limitations, the urgent need for energy from renewable/sustainable sources such as biofuels has emerged.  Liquid biodiesels, bioalcohols, vegetables oils of different kinds and bioethers have the potential to address the energy need and at the same time are believed to lessen the adverse effects on our environment.  It has been reported that biodiesel can significantly reduce gaseous harmful emissions and volatile organic compounds.  However, little is known regarding the carbonaceous particles (soot particulates) produced from biodiesels and/or vegetable oil/diesel blends.  Due to their nanometer-size, carbon particulates have great potential for environmental contamination and health effects, even at greater levels than other gaseous combustion emissions.  Particles of nanometer size (billionth of a meter) that are inhaled have a high probability of deposition into the lungs and are likely to trigger or exacerbate respiratory diseases.  In some cases these hazardous ultra fine particles can pass directly through capillary walls into the bloodstream initiating severe diseases in addition to respiratory health effects.   The smaller the size of the particles, the more harmful they become.  Moreover, due to their size and light weight, these particles can be suspended in the air for weeks before settling.  The PI?s preliminary results show that carbon particulates produced from two different biodiesels have significantly smaller diameters compared to those produced in diesel fuel under the same experimental conditions.  The preliminary findings contradict the notion that combustors running with oils are likely to produce large (less harmful) or coarse particles.  Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the growth processes of these ultra-fine hazardous particulates generated from these new emerging fuels.  A co-flow burner is used to create the flames.  The approach of this project will be as follows. Objective 1: study the effect of soot concentrations (particle population) using different biodiesels and blends with various percentages of diesel fuel using the laser extinction technique.  The effect of soot concentration will also be studied by creating the flame medium with different oxygen contents ranging from 21% to 100% O2.  The laser extinction technique allows for an instantaneous, non-intrusive measurement of local soot concentration in a variety of flames.  Objective 2: obtain particle distributions and study the particle morphology (size, nanostructure, and degree of agglomeration) of the carbon particulates by extracting them using the thermophoretic sampling technique.  To accomplish objective 2, samples of carbon particulates will be analyzed using electron transmission microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM.  Objective 3:   Efforts will also be devoted to obtain concentration profiles of major gaseous chemical species, including CO, CO2, O2, SOx, and NOx.  The emissions concentrations will be obtained by scanning the flame in axial and radial directions as a means of producing spatially resolved data.  This research seeks to obtain a fundamental understanding of carbonaceous particles and other harmful gaseous emissions produced from various biodiesels and blends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the fact that this research project will take place in Oklahoma which is historically known for its Native American heritage and population, the broader impact of this proposal focuses on the recruitment of Native American students into science and engineering.  The first Educational Proposition focuses on a plan to stimulate interest and as a result increase the participation of Native Americans in undergraduate and advanced level engineering education.  In order to have a broader impact, this Educational Proposition will also focus on the mentoring of secondary level students.  The second Educational Proposition focuses on stimulating and increasing the participation of domestic students in an advanced education in engineering.  Efforts will be targeted toward highly talented students who are in their third and fourth year of their undergraduate studies.  OU has an exceptional pool of talented undergraduate students to draw from as evidenced by the fact that OU is consistently ranked #1 in National Merit Scholars per capita for public universities in the nation.  Approximately half of these National Merit Scholars matriculate in the College of Engineering, thus constituting a large number of potential graduate students to be recruited locally as well as nationally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project at the University of Oklahoma (OU) showed that carbon particulates or soot formed from the combustion of biodiesel have unique characteristics (diameter size, degree of agglomeration and population) compared to conventional fuels. The understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the formation of these ultrafine particulates in new emerging fuels is vital for many industrial processes and for the environment and human health.  Biodiesel has been identified as a new alternative form of energy and as a potential replacement given the limited reserve of petro-fuel.    However, very little information is known regarding the characteristics of the carbon by-products formed in a combustion process in biodiesel compared to petro-fuels.      Background:  In recent years many research efforts have resulted in the development of new types of biodiesel derived from various vegetable oils and animal-fats.  Biodiesel is considered renewable, biodegradable, non-toxic, and environmentally friendly (cleaner) compared to petro-fuels. Due to the nature of being a new fuel, the literature is limited on the emission produced in the combustion of biodiesel.  Outcomes of this project significantly contribute to the fill the knowledge gap on the formation of particulate matter in biodiesel and its blends.      Results:  One of the principal objectives of this research project was to obtain a database of carbon particle formation and evolution of flames formed using biodiesel. The obtained profiles represent a unique database and can help understand the underlying mechanisms of soot formation.  The obtained carbon particulate evolutions of flames formed with various types of biodiesel, No. 2 diesel, biodiesel-diesel blends presented information on their size diameter, population, nanostructure and complexity of its aggregates.   Strategic Outcome Goals  Discovery: Soot properties and propensity in evaporated biodiesel formed flames behave quite differently than those present in a flame formed using No. 2 diesel. The profiles of vaporized biodiesel include large droplet-like particles (at the lower regions of the flame) and fully carbonized soot agglomerates in the upper region of the flame.  These agglomerates are very large and complex (multi-branched) compared to those formed in the Diesel flames.  Learning: This NSF-Funded project provided an opportunity for training and research of one PhD student, four MS students, several undergraduate and high school students.  Transformative Research: The outcomes of this research project showed the main differences existing in the formation of carbon particulates  in a new type of fuel that is considered clean, biodegradable and renewable.   These findings may provide scientific knowledge to industry and policy makers on the production of these carbon particles that can have impact on the environment and human health.   Intellectual Merit:  The formation of carbon particles and evolutions were obtained in flame experiments conducted with various types of biodiesel, No. 2 diesel and blended fuel mixtures using air and various content of oxygen as the oxidizer.   The evolution profiles of the physical characteristics of soot revealed the sequence of the morphological changes along the flame centerline.  The database shows the impact of fuel concentrations in the blended mixture and oxygen content to inhibit or suppress carbon particle formation in these oxygenated fuels.      Broader Impacts   Benefits to society: The obtained experimental database can be directly applied to develop and validate numerical models and aid in understanding the underlying mechanisms of soot formation in combustion-based biodiesels.  Broadening participation of underrepresented groups: This grant provided undergraduate students belonging to underrepresented groups in engineering with an opportunity to conduct research.  Many of the UG students involved in this research project were members of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, McNair Scholar Program and the American Indian Science and Engineering Society OU Chapters.     One UG student (Native American) working on this project was able to leverage his research findings and was awarded the prestigious NSF Graduate Fellowship.  Advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning:   The unique research experience cemented the decision of some of the undergraduate students to pursue an advanced degree in Engineering. Two of the UG students are currently pursuing a PhD program in Mechanical Engineering outside OU.  This research project also provided opportunities for several high school students to become involved in research early in their academic careers. Some of these high school students are pursuing a STEM discipline at different universities (including OU, Duke, Boston University and Georgia Tech).       Enhancing the infrastructure for research and education: Experimental systems for studying the emission of carbon particles formed in the combustion of biodiesel have been developed as the result of this project.  Results disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding: The results of this research project have been published in a chapter book (CRC Press Taylor &amp; Francis), three journal articles and presented at 11 national conferences (7 conference papers, 4 with abstract review).  One manuscript is currently in process for a journal publication. Furthermore, the findings of this research were presented through six poster presentations.
