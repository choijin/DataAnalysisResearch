<AbstractNarration>This grant will support the participation of US-based Ph.D. students at the first Gene Golub SIAM Summer School (G2S3), which is also the Second International Summer School on Numerical Linear Algebra (ISSNLA).&lt;br/&gt;The G2S3 2010 will take place in Fasano, Italy, during the two weeks of June 7-18, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;The ISSNLA is organized by the SIAM Activity Group on Linear Algebra. The local organization is in the hands of researchers from the Universities of Bari and Bologna. The purpose of the ISSNLA is to acquaint doctoral students with recent developments and novel applications in a subfield of Applied Mathematics called "Numerical Linear Algebra". By design, the summer school is forward-looking: the courses cover topics&lt;br/&gt;that are too recent to have been included in textbooks or doctoral courses; these topics include nonlinear eigenvalue problem, and tensor analysis and computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target audience of the International Summer School on Numerical Linear Algebra are doctoral students in any field that requires results and methods from Numerical Linear Algebra.  The courses will be self contained, and taught at a level that is accessible to a wide audience. They will be of interest to graduate students in science and engineering. The lecturers are leading experts who are also well known for their expository skills.  They were chosen by an Advisory Committee composed by leading international scientists.&lt;br/&gt;NSF support for US-based participants will have a positive impact on the continued strong competitiveness of the US in this crucial discipline, with its connections to virtually every area of scientific computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Prestigious summer schools take place regularly and are well established in many disciplines, where Ph.D. students are expected to attend a summer school at least once during their graduate studies. Summer schools offer several advantages including the broadening of  the students' view of a research area, and the building of a sense of community among the students.  However, there are few summer schools in the field of Numerical Linear Algebra. The SIAM (Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics) Activity Group on Linear Algebra, organized its second international summer school on numerical linear algebra (ISSNLA) in conjunction with the first Gene Golub SIAM Summer School (G2S3). Gene Golub left a substantial estate to SIAM, who decided to use these  funds to partially fund international summer schools for graduate students.  The ISSNLA/G2S3 2010 took place at the hotel Serra Silvana, in Selva  Di Fasano, Brindisi, Italy, during the two weeks of 7-18 June 2010.   Four courses were taught during the summer school by world-renowned researchers. Each course consisted of 15 contact-hours, of which  ten hours were lectures, and five hours were exercise sessions.  The lectures were videotaped, and they are available at the school  website: http://issnla2010.ba.cnr.it/  Over 100 students applied to attend the school. The ISSNLA Steering Committee made the selection, and 52 students were accepted and attended the school (39 men and 13 women). The school was truly international in nature. The geographical distribution (home institutions) was as follows: Austria 1, Belgium 3, Canada 4, P.R. China 2, Croatia 1, France 2, Germany 5, Iran 1, Italy 3, The Netherlands 1, New Zealand 1, Slovenia 1, Spain 1, Sweden 1, Switzerland 2, UK 4, USA 19.  While most of the funding for the school came from SIAM, and from several European sources, NSF funds were used to pay for the travel of the nineteen students from all over the US who were accepted (four women and fifteen men).  Local expenses in Italy were covered by the SIAM funds.  The students benefited highly from the courses, the close connection with the lecturers, and the new contact with the other students, from the US, and from the rest of the world, all in the same area of research. In fact, it is known that some research collaborations have already started among a few of them. From the feedback received from the students and the lecturers, it is clear that the summer school was a great success, and that the nineteen students from the US, partially funded by this NSF grant, benefitted tremendously from the experience.
