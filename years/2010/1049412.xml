<AbstractNarration>This award supports undergraduate students attending the Laser Science  Conference to be held  October 24-28, 2010. The student's participation will be via the 'Symposium on Undergraduate Research'. The students will present the results of their research and discuss these with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One broader impact is the opportunity for these young students to attend a national meeting and give their first public talks. A secondary benefit arises because collaborations among them are often born in these sessions. A third impact is the networking among these students that will be so vital to their future careers as professional scientists. Also, this meeting encourages them to continue along such a career path.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The tenth annual DLS Symposium on Undergraduate Research at LS-XXVI took place in Rochester, NY on Monday, 25 October, 2010. The Symposium has grown from ten presentations in 2001 to forty-five this year on projects  at more than 30 universities or  institutes in  US and Europe.  They have brought nearly 300 students to the DLS annual meeting to present what are often the first research papers of their budding careers.  Programs, articles, and photos from past symposia are at the DLS website http://www.aps.org/units/dls/meetings/symposium/ .  The 2010 Symposium began with a buffet-style dinner on Sunday , 24 October, at the Radisson where most of the students were housed. This was an especially convenient location because the students who arrived at any time during the evening could check in and then go to the dinner. The high point of the evening was a talk by optics entrepreneur Arthur Davis describing his career.  He was followed by several of the faculty mentors who did likewise, including session chairs Amy Sullivan and Hong Lin.  After these talks, students and mentors lingered for hours in conversations with each other and other conference attendees who stopped by.  The FiO/LS conference events began Monday morning with Plenary Session talks by several outstanding people, including Joe Eberly on the Bell inequalities, Steve Block on optical tweezers in the biological sciences,  and Alain Aspect on a Hanbury-Brown Twiss experiment.  Many of the students attended and were impressed and inspired by both the excellent talks and the seemingly vast audience of professional scientists.  The Symposium events began at noon with a box lunch for its participants and honored guests, who included several of the speakers at the Plenary-Prize session earlier in the morning.  The students heard inspiring remarks and lively discussion from several distinguished guests, including Alain Aspect, Joe Eberly, Henry Kapteyn, Jenny Magnes, Margaret Murnane, and Martin Richardson.   There was a large volume of traffic by conferees throughout the entire poster session, that occurred during what would normally be the FiO/LS lunch break.  The entire area was abuzz with conversation and discussion as the delighted presenters talked about their work to interested scientists and fellow students.   The oral presentation sessions began at 2:30 and lasted until after 6:00. The first one was presided by Prof. Hong Lin of Bates College in Maine, and the second one was presided by Prof. Amy Sullivan of Agnes Scott College in Georgia. Besides students and mentors, the audience included quite a few regular conference attendees over the course of the afternoon.   The quality of the talks was uniformly very high, and the two oral sessions were an unqualified success.   The final Symposium event was a leisurely buffet dinner at the Golden Port, an Asian restaurant about 10 minutes walk from the Convention Center. Students, mentors, scientists, and conference organizers were joined by several Symposium sponsors, who greatly enjoyed this opportunity to network with students who will be future leaders of the field.  It was gratifying that these very young scientists could give their first presentations at a professional meeting, and it was clearly a memorable event for them. Forty percent of this year's presenters were female, a fraction well above the national average among undergraduate physics students.  Many of the students remained at the meeting one or more extra days to hear talks or visit exhibits. Some were thrilled to meet famous and/or highly visible scientists, including the authors of some of their textbooks.  Judging from the enthusiastic notes that accompanied their final expense reports, the student participants will surely remember this opportunity throughout their professional lives.                 A significant part of the total cost was provided by the departments and colleges of many of the participants.  Sincere thanks go to Agnes Scott Col...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
