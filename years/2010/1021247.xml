<AbstractNarration>Ranid frogs, comprising 23% of frog species, are declining globally, and their evolutionary relationships remain poorly understood. This project will address conflicts in previous phylogenetic studies of ranid frogs by compiling a dataset of DNA sequences for eleven genes and 400 morphological characters, for 250 species, representing all major lineages. Phylogenetic analysis of complementary morphological and molecular datasets will address contemporary analytical challenges (DNA sequence alignment, algorithm choice, optimization criteria), while re-evaluating legacy data with newly generated data. The analysis will provide a rigorous, independent assessment of recent molecular hypotheses, produce a revised classification of ranid frog families and genera, and test hypotheses of character evolution, life history, ecology, behavior and biogeography concerning ranid frogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A postdoctoral researcher will lead the project and collaborate with colleagues at four participating institutions. One graduate, nine undergraduate, and six high school students will be mentored. An international workshop will be held. Fieldwork will be conducted in Africa and Asia. A project website will host research products, including bibliography, illustrations, photographs, descriptions, identification keys, atlas and glossary of terminology. Data will be archived in open web repositories. These resources will facilitate future studies on ranid frogs and assist biologists, laymen and conservationists to identify them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is part of a 10-year effort to digitize and mobilize the scientific information associated with biological specimens held in U.S. research collections. The images and digitized data from this project will be integrated into the online national resource as outlined in the community strategic plan available at http://digbiocol.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/digistratplanfinaldraft.pdf.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research focused on assembling and analyzing data to determine the evolutionary history of ranoid frogs (scientifically named "Natatanura"), a group comprising about a quarter of all living frogs, found on all continents except Antarctica. The global amphibian extinction crisis highlights the urgency of understanding the relationships between major lineages of frogs, so that informed decisions can be made regarding their conservation planning. This is important for rare, old lineages with few living representatives.  Molecular genomic data and information from morphology (osteology and external morphology of adult frogs, and tadpole data) were gathered from all ranoid lineages, on a global scale. These data were used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of these frogs and investigate how they evolved and diversified into the environments they inhabit today.  A large Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) dataset of ca. 367,000 base-pairs from the nuclear genome was assembled for 427 species representative of all 13 globally-distributed families of ranoid frogs. This dataset, which is roughly two orders of magnitude larger than previously published datasets (based mostly on the smaller, maternally-inherited mitochondrial genome, not the larger recombining nuclear genome), provided resolution deep in the frog tree of life, for evolutionary events that previously resisted discovery, and plotted the course of morphological character evolution on the molecular tree. The dataset can be mined in future to discover mechanisms of nuclear genomic evolution in a relatively simple vertebrate system.  3D Computed Tomography scanning was used to assess the adult osteology, while Scanning Electron Microscopy was used for tadpole imaging, to produce high quality images for all studied species, which was archived online and publically accessible to future researchers. The morphological dataset, which compliments the genetic data, is the largest ever assembled for frogs, and will help paleontologists identify frog fossils to family or genus, and assist with molecular dating analyses used to study their evolution.
