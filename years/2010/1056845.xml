<AbstractNarration>Professor Adam Fiedler of Marquette University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) Program in the Division of Chemistry to design and synthesize transition metal complexes that mimic the function of metalloenzymes. More specifically, the PI is mainly targeting Fe(II) complexes with polyimidazole ligands to mimic the 3His motif found in several iron oxygenases which use O2 to cleave the C-C bonds of pollutants. Complexes with a range of electronic and steric properties will be prepared using a flexible synthetic approach, and their ability to catalyze dioxygenation reactions will be explored under various conditions. An array of spectroscopic and computational tools will be used to obtain detailed geometric- and electronic-structure descriptions of the resulting complexes. In addition, the PI will employ a series of biologically-relevant ligands with non-coordinating groups capable of forming intramolecular hydrogen-bonds, thereby providing insight into second-sphere interactions that are known to be significant in enzymatic function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal-containing dioxygenases are capable of incorporating oxygen atoms into hydrocarbons, thus initiating their degradation process. The proposed research will have a significant environmental remediation impact, in that it could potentially lead to complexes that are capable of facilitating the aerobic degradation of single and multi-ring hydrocarbons which are a major class of environmental pollutants. Research opportunities will be provided to students from underrepresented and low-income groups through outreach programs already administered at Marquette University, and laboratory experiments on environmental remediation and oxidation catalysis will be prepared for pre-college and undergraduate science laboratory programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Found in all aerobic organisms, dioxygenases activate molecular oxygen (O2) for the purpose of incorporating both oxygen atoms into a particular substrate. The majority of dioxygenases require an iron cofactor (heme or nonheme) for activity, although other first-row transition metal ions (Mn, Co, Ni) are sometimes employed.  Dioxygenases with mononuclear nonheme iron sites are critical for the metabolism of amino acids in humans, the synthesis of complex natural products, and the bioremediation of organic pollutants by soil bacteria.  The goal of this project has been to advance of understanding of mononuclear nonheme iron dioxygenases (MNIDs) through the development synthetic models that replicate key structural and/or functional properties of the enzyme active sites. The geometric and electronic structures of the resulting biomimetic complexes were examined with an assortment of crystallographic, spectroscopic, computational, and electrochemical techniques.  We also explored the reactivities of the complexes with O2 (and other small molecules, such as nitric oxide) to uncover possible mechanistic strategies employed by the biological systems.  Using this approach, we were able to: i) elucidate the role of the protein-derived ligands in tuning the reactive properties of the iron center, ii) evaluate the likelihood of substrate radical formation during the catalytic cycle, and ii) explore the relationship between proton transfer and O2 activation.   During the funding period, we also generated novel ligand scaffolds that incorporate some of the complex features of metalloenzyme active sites, including intramolecular hydrogen bonding networks, heterobimetallic units, and redox-active ligands.  The ability of these complexes to activate O2 and perform electrocatalytic reactions (e.g., H+ reduction to H2) was examined.   The project resulted in 17 peer-reviewed publications (to date) and nine conference presentations.  One postdoctoral researcher, seven graduate students, and six undergraduates participated in this project, gaining interdisciplinary training in inorganic synthetic methods, spectroscopic and crystallographic characterization, electrochemical techniques, and computational chemistry.
