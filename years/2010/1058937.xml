<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;It can be argued that the primary adaptive function of memory is not to remember the past, but to predict the future.  Knowledge of past experiences combined with an understanding of the present state gives organisms the ability to anticipate future rewards or avoid impending danger.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a mathematical theory describing how people use past history and a representation of the present to predict the future.  The theory will be built on a mathematical model of how the history leading up to the present moment can be efficiently compressed into a representation that could be maintained by the brain.  The investigators pursue the development of the theory using three techniques.  First, in order to see if human learners behave in a way consistent with the hypothesis, the investigators will conduct a series of behavioral experiments using undergraduate students as research subjects.  The experiments present the subjects with a series of symbols chosen according to a hidden sequence and ask them to predict the symbols that will follow at various stages.  Second, the investigators will conduct computer simulations to train the equations on a large body of naturally-occuring language.  Language has a rich temporal structure defined by the way words, and combinations of words, follow one another.  Third, the investigators will work to extend the mathematics of the hypothesis to enable it to describe a wide range of phenomena in learning and memory.  The large scale goal is to reorient several subfields of cognitive psychology---episodic memory, semantic memory, conditioning, and interval timing---around an understanding of how temporal history is represented and utilized by the human brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed research could have far-reaching practical impacts.  It could provide insight into how children and adults learn, leading to better instructional tools.  If successful, it would also represent a large step forward in completely automated natural language processing.  The rise of electronic communication has led to vast quantities of text---more than could ever be read by even a small army of human readers.  Algorithms that can extract knowledge from large quantities of text currently find use in applications as far-ranging as essay grading and other educational applications to intelligence uses.  The investigators anticipate that the equations will be much better at extracting knowledge from natural text than several widely-used algorithms.  Finally, there may be useful technologies that exploit the ability to predict the future from the past and the present with the level of efficiency that humans can.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the last several decades the field of memory research has focused on different memory systems supported by different parts of the brain.  For instance, ``episodic memory,'' vivid long-lasting memory for specific events from ones life is believed to depend crucially on the medial temporal lobes whereas ``short-term memory'', active maintenance of recently-experienced stimuli, is believed to depend crucially on other brain regions, including prefrontal cortex and inferotemporal cortex.  This award supported the development of a unifying mathematical hypothesis in which many different ``kinds of memory'' can be understood as operations on a common neural representation.  This representation takes the form of a scale-invariant timeline.  We have tested this hypothesis by comparing it to behavioral findings from a range of different tasks and also by comparing the predictions of the equations to the firing of neurons in the brain.  Figure 1 shows a cartoon illustrating the way this hypothesis works.  In the same way that a musical score provides a record of the history of stimuli leading up to the present moment, a set of neurons maintains a record of what stimulus happened when leading up to the present.  Crucially, this record is compressed by ``foreshortening'' the past (bottom).  This property results in time being represented on a logarithmic scale, as are many sensory dimensions, and is crucial in enabling the description of many behavioral results across different domains.    According to this hypothesis, different memory systems all work on the same form of representation, but specialize in different operations on that common form of representation to support behavior in different kinds of tasks.    Figure 2 summarizes the kind of neural data that address this hypothesis.  If a set of neurons supported a timeline for the past, we would expect a given neuron to fire when a particular stimulus is a certain distance in the past.  Because different neurons are responsible for different parts of the timeline, we would expect to see a sequence of neurons fire as a salient stimulus recedes into the past.  This figure summarizes three studies showing such sequences.  Crucially, these figures are from three different brain regions, each of which is conventionally believed to support a different memory system.    Taken together, the award supported the development of a neural hypothesis in which time is analogous to a sensory dimension.  This could be the start of a general physical theory of cognition.  The same kinds of cognitive mechanisms used to direct attention to a subset of spatial locations or pitches of tones could be used to direct attention to a particular subset of past times.  We expect that other dimensions, such as physical space, or numerosity, should give rise to the same Weber-Fechner form of representation, so that a set of operations for one form of representation could be reused for many different domains, leading eventually to a theory of human-like cognitive computation.
