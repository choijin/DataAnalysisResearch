<AbstractNarration>This project will support the activities of the Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) Science Steering Committee (CSSC), whose members are appointed by NSF to provide a formal mechanism for communication between the CEDAR community of researchers and NSF's Aeronomy and Geospace Facilities Programs. The CSSC is tasked with developing and supporting the future directions for the broad areas of upper atmospheric and geospace science and has as its direct task the coordination of these plans with larger national and international programs.  Activities during the term proposed include the convening of the annual CEDAR Workshop and an annual CSSC meeting and to publish the CEDAR Post, a community newsletter.</AbstractNarration>
