<AbstractNarration>This proposal aims to secure student travel support for the sixth ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS), to be held in San Diego, CA (Oct. 25 - 26, 2010).  The PI proposes providing travel support totaling $12,000. This will permit support of about 20 U.S.-based graduate students at about approximately $600 per student. Priority will be granted to those students without existing travel support that would not otherwise be able to attend. This will include students who are not presenting papers at the conference, but are doing research on ANCS relevant topics.</AbstractNarration>
