<AbstractNarration>Increased temperatures in Northern Alaska over the past 50 years have been accompanied by an increase in the frequency of wildfires, with over half of the fire activity on the North Slope in the past 60 years occurring since 2000.  The effects of fire on carbon and energy balances in this region are poorly understood, as the fires have occurred in remote regions, been small in size, and are relatively infrequent.  Arctic ecosystems store twice the amount of carbon currently in the atmosphere and affect the local and regional climate by exchanging carbon with the atmosphere and through their impacts on the reflectivity of the tundra surface and heat penetration into permafrost soils.  Fires have potential to alter the balances by releasing carbon into the atmosphere through combustion, reducing carbon sequestration through vegetation and soil changes, and influencing climate by darkening the surface and allowing more solar energy to be absorbed.  The goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of the short-term (daily to annual) and long-term (decadal to centennial) effects of fire on Arctic tundra. The goal will be met by combining field measurements made at burned sites of different age on the North Slope and Seward Peninsula of Alaska, along with recent and historical satellite and aircraft remotely sensed imagery, into predictive models of how fires influence carbon and energy cycling over time across the Arctic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The models developed in this project can be used to inform future management decisions by predicting the impacts of future changes in the frequency of fires on ecosystem services in the Arctic.  It will reveal processes and interactions that are relevant not only to the global human population as related to climate change, but also to the local Native American populations that depend on the North Slope landscape to sustain their subsistence lifestyles.  Several postdoctoral and undergraduate researchers will be trained and contributions made to outreach programs currently run by the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research project and the Marine Biological Laboratory.  These contributions include internet-based distribution of data collected and models created, as well as public lectures and classroom exercises in local Native Alaskan communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: Increased temperatures in Northern Alaska over the past 50 years have been accompanied by an increase in the frequency of wildfires, with over half of the fire activity on the North Slope in the past 60 years occurring since 2000.  The effect of fire on carbon and energy cycling in this region is poorly understood as until recently the fires have occurred in remote regions, been small in size, and relatively infrequent.  Arctic ecosystems store twice the amount of carbon currently in the atmosphere and affect the local and regional climate by exchanging carbon with the atmosphere and through their impacts on surface reflectivity and heat flux into permafrost soils.  Fires have the potential to alter these services by releasing carbon into the atmosphere through combustion, altering carbon sequestration through vegetation and soil changes following fire, and influencing climate by darkening the surface and allowing more solar energy to be absorbed by the surface.  The goal of this research was to develop a better understanding of the short-term (i.e. daily to annual) and long-term (i.e. decadal to centennial) effects of fire on the ecosystem services of the Arctic, such as carbon sequestration and climate regulation.  This goal was accomplished by collecting and combining field measurements of carbon and element cycling from various fire scars of different age on the North Slope of Alaska with contemporary and historical remotely sensed imagery to create predictive models on how fires influence carbon and energy cycling over time and across the arctic, and how carbon balance recovers over time following burning.     One important conclusion of the research is that the recovery of carbon stocks following wildfire in tundra is initially limited by redistribution of other essential elements like nitrogen and phosphorus from unburned organic matter stocks in the first years following fire, while on longer time scales (centuries), increases in carbon stocks are limited by inputs and accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus by deposition, fixation, and weathering.  A second key conclusion is that although wildfires burn over only a small percentage of the area of the northern landscape, dramatic changes in carbon stocks and turnover in these relatively small areas may be significant at the scale of large regions such as the North Slope of Alaska or the entire Arctic.     Broader Impacts: This research developed methods and models to determine fire induced changes in the ecosystem services of AlaskaÆs North Slope.  These models can be used to inform future management decisions by predicting the impact of future changes in the frequency of arctic fires on ecosystem services.  All data collected during the project are readily available to scientists and to the public via the LTER Network Information System and the Arctic LTER data base. Funds from this project were used to train several postdoctoral and undergraduate researchers and included contributions to teaching and learning through outreach programs in collaboration with the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research (ARC LTER) project based at Toolik Lake, Alaska, and the Marine Biological Laboratory.  Lastly, this project revealed linkages and dependencies due to the interactions of fire and biogeochemical processes that have received little attention in the past and that are relevant not only to the global human population as related to climate change, but also to the local Native American population, who depend on the North Slope landscape to sustain their subsistence lifestyles.
