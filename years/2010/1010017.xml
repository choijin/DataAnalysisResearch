<AbstractNarration>In this project, Dr. Fortney and his collaborators will create a new code to compute the thermal evolution histories of Neptune-class and Jupiter-class giant planets.  Within the solar system, this standard theory fails to explain the current luminosity of three of the four giant planets.  The main strength of this new code will be its ability to treat the evolution of planets with inhomogeneous interior structures. The new planetary code will include high-pressure equations of state, molecular and atomic opacities, irradiated model atmospheres, and advanced treatments of convection in regions of composition gradients. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the work will improve our understanding of planets in our solar system and around other stars.  The team will release the new codes code to the community of planetary science researchers.  This project will also support efforts to inform the public through public presentations and on the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our work was to use new state of the art models for the thermal evolution of giant planets to better understand planetary interior structure and composition.  We are now in a new era where we have more just than our solar system's 4 giant planets study; we have hundreds of extrasolar planets (or "exoplanets") where was can examine their masses and radii for clues about their composition and structure.  This helps us to understand giant planets as a class of astrophysical object.  An important outcome of our work is that we were able to show that all giant planets do not share the same composition as their parent star.  This is true in the solar system, where our giant planets are enhanced in the non H-He ("gas") compoments, often called "heavy elements."  This suggests that a seed core of heavy elements is needed to trigger giant planet formation.  We were able to show that all giant planets studied had heavy element "enrichments" that depend on mass, as in the solar system.  We also used our models to understand the population of "small" giant planets, often called "mini-Neptunes" of around 3-15 Earth masses.  These intermediate sized planets are extremely common in our galaxy -- much more common than Jupiter or Saturn-sized gas giants.  We have shown that if these planets are close to their parent stars, that they will be stripped of much of the H-He mass that dominates their thick atmospheric envelopes.  When we look at this current planetary population we actually see a remnant population of initially more massive, but fluffier, planets, that have been sculpted by the high energy radiation from their parent stars.  This work has really helped us to place our solar system in context, by allowing us to understand the composition, formation, and evolution of these "mini-Neptune" planets that have no analog in the solar system.
