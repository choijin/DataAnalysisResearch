<AbstractNarration>1033732&lt;br/&gt;Buchholz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bed-mounted obstacles, or discrete roughness elements extending into a flowing fluid, are ubiquitous in a broad range of natural and engineered systems.  This simple geometry creates a very complex, three-dimensional and unsteady flow field that can significantly increase bed shear stresses and heat transfer, and affect sediment fluxes in fluvial environments.  While it is apparent that the dominant flow patterns are qualitatively quite robust under a broad range of parameters, there is still much that is not well understood about the dynamics of these structures, the resulting distribution of bed stresses surrounding the body, and the turbulent transport mechanisms that govern these stresses, especially in shallow flows.  In steep mountain streams, naturally-occurring obstacles or boulders are of comparable length scale with flow depth and river width, which introduces a new and primary parameter: the relative submergence H/D (where H is the flow depth and D is the obstacle characteristic dimension).  These naturally-occurring obstacles typically have H/D&lt;1, and under these conditions the sediment depositional patterns are strikingly different than at large H/D.    &lt;br/&gt;This work seeks to characterize the effects of relative submergence on bed shear stress distributions, and mean flow and sediment depositional patterns surrounding the obstacle, and to elucidate the physical mechanisms governing these processes. These objectives will be achieved in a parametric study of a spherical obstacle on a rough bed in shallow open-channel flow.  Particle image velocimetry will be used to obtain quantitative measurements of the velocity and vorticity fields, and turbulent stresses surrounding the obstacle.  Spectral analysis and conditional averaging of the flow will help to elucidate the fluid-dynamic mechanisms responsible for the observed stresses.  For the same flow conditions, sediment deposition patterns around the obstacle and corresponding sediment trapping efficiencies will be characterized.  The flow and sediment studies will be combined to provide insight on aggregate measures of bed shear stress that can be used to predict sediment transport characteristics in more complex riverine environments involving large obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This investigation addresses a highly relevant region of the parameter space which has so far received little attention, and will provide fundamental insights into the physical mechanisms governing recent observations about sediment transport in fluvial systems.  Therefore, this will lead to a new array of powerful tools to more effectively manage the nation's rivers.  Fundamentally, the work will provide a clearer picture of the complex interactions between flow structure dynamics, turbulent stresses, and sediment movement in the vicinity of an obstacle, which can have implications far beyond the prototype class of problems on which this work is based.  Despite many decades of research on flow around obstacles, the proposed work has great potential due to the integration of researchers in fluid dynamics and sediment transport, and the use of advanced measurement methods.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Due to the ubiquity of flow over wall-mounted obstacles, the technical impacts of this work have the potential to affect a wide range of applications in the areas of river management, aerodynamics, urban planning, industrial plant design, heat transfer, and many others.   The project also provides an invaluable multi-disciplinary educational opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students studying environmental hydraulics and fluid dynamics, and therefore provides an ideal environment for the training of the next generation of scientists.  Community outreach in schools and community colleges will support the theme "Science Based Restoration Approaches for Rivers".</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bed-mounted obstacles, or discrete roughness elements, are ubiquitous in a broad range of natural and engineered systems.  This presumably  simple roughness element, when deeply submerged in a flow, creates a very complex, three-dimensional and unsteady flow field that can significantly increase bed shear stresses, interact with other obstacles, and affect sediment fluxes in fluvial environments.  The impact of large boulders on sediment fluxes in mountain streams is the primary motivation for the present study.  This project consisted of two complementary experimental studies in which the structure and dynamics of the flow fields were investigated around obstacles broadly representative of large boulders in mountain streams.  The first study focused on a simplified case in which semi-ellipsoidal and spherical obstacles were investigated on a smooth bed in a basic, laminar oncoming flow.  The second study focused on a spherical obstacle placed on a rough bed in turbulent open-channel flow, representative of a mountain stream.  In both cases, "high relative submergence" (HRS) flows representative of rare flood conditions, and "low relative submergence" (LRS) flows, representative of typical stream conditions in which the boulder is not fully submerged, were investigated.   The relative simplicity of the first study allowed detailed measurements of the flow structure and dynamics, which were used to inform the second study.  A comprehensive model of the vortex structure of the flow, and its dynamics was constructed.   It was shown that, for the HRS case, the wake is dominated by arch-shaped vortices for both the semi-elliptical and spherical bodies, which evolve in their shape and orientation according to a balance between their own self-induction and the influence of the shear distribution in the surrounding flow.  In the wake of the sphere, for the LRS, strong streamwise vortices are formed near the bed, due to the deformation of the arch structures, which significantly enhances the bed shear stresses in that region, and therefore is a potential mechanism for erosion and transport of bedload sediment in the wake of the obstacle.  It was shown that, at HRS conditions, a relatively symmetric wake was shed by the obstacle; however, at LRS conditions, vortices were vigorously shed in an antisymmetric pattern, similar to a two-dimensional bluff body.   Measurements of the obstacle wake in the turbulent open channel flow were found to be highly consistent with those of the former experiments.  These flow field measurements were also used to estimate the distribution of shear stresses acting on the rough bed in the vicinity of the obstacle.  The measurements and knowledge of the flow structure provided a physical explanation for the hitherto unexplained patterns of sediment deposition in which sediment particles were observed to accumulate in the wake region of obstacles in the HRS case, but were conspicuously absent from that region in the LRS case, and instead accumulated upstream of the obstacle (stoss region).  Further measurements of the mean flow and turbulent fluctuations in the flow along the obstacle center plane were used to estimate the bed shear stress distribution, due to the obstacle, upstream and downstream of the obstacle, in order to estimate the impact of boulders on the reach-averaged bed shear stress distribution in mountain streams.  It was found that, for a single boulder, the effects of the boulder on flow dynamics in its vicinity reduces the bed shear stresses available for transporting mobile sediment by approximately 33%, thus explaining the often significant over-prediction of sediment fluxes in rivers using standard engineering models.  Similarly, it was found that the bed shear stresses would be over-predicted by approximately 20% in the LRS case.  Beyond the present application, the knowledge of the flow structure and bed shear stresses gained in this study has provided significant new fundamental insig...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
