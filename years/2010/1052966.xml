<AbstractNarration>Miscommunication between people from different racial and ethnic groups represents one of the most fundamental challenges to improving intergroup relations. Miscommunications fuel tensions and distrust, hinder rapport building and cooperation, and help to sustain prejudice and discrimination. Understanding how to promote more effective intergroup communication is crucial for improving race relations. The proposed research will examine the process of communication between two newly acquainted individuals by utilizing experimental methods that consider the perspectives of both Whites and ethnic minorities in tandem within the context of the same interaction, and will examine both "single-shot" and repeated laboratory interactions.  In addition, the proposed research program will contribute to current theoretical models of interracial communication by drawing from theory and research from the domains of person perception, close relationships, and goal pursuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has implications for how communication operates within multiple interracial interaction contexts including groups of individuals working toward a shared goal (e.g., co-workers, classmates, and teammates), authority figures and subordinates (e.g., bosses and employees, teachers and students, police officers and civilians), and two individuals of equal status who are working toward building a relationship (e.g., college roommates, neighbors, and friends). In addition, research findings from this research will not only be disseminated in scholarly outlets, but will also be shared with non-academic and administrative organizations at the investigator's university.  Lastly, the research will involve mentoring and training ethnic minority graduate and undergraduate students to prepare them for careers in psychology and related fields, with a particular emphasis on understanding issues of diversity and interpersonal and intergroup communication.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Miscommunication between Whites and ethnic minorities in the US represents one of the most fundamental challenges faced by scholars who seek to improve intergroup relations. Understanding how to promote more effective communication between Whites and minorities is therefore crucial for improving race relations; yet to date, we know surprisingly little about what the most effective strategies are. One factor that sets interracial interactions apart from same-race interactions is the level anxiety experienced by both Whites and racial and ethnic minorities. Interracial interactions are often more anxiety-provoking and distressing than are interactions between two individuals of the same race, particularly during the initial, getting-acquainted stages of the relationship. Anxiety not only reduces the desire for long-term relationship development, it can also interfere with communication processes, such as the ability to accurately read one&rsquo;s partner&rsquo;s interest in forming a relationship. The funded research examined how anxiety&mdash;both that perceived in one&rsquo;s partner and that subjectively experienced&mdash;interferes with relationship development during the initial getting-acquainted stage of interactions by interfering with communication processes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The initial goal of the funded research was to establish that anxiety plays a unique role in shaping relationship development within dyadic interracial interactions (i.e., interactions between two individuals who identify as different races). Study 1 of this research examined how the anxiety that individuals believe their partners feel, above and beyond how anxious those partners actually feel, can interfere with the ability to read one&rsquo;s partner&rsquo;s thoughts, feelings, and intentions. Using a sample of college roommates who were unacquainted when they first moved in together, results from this study indicate that as the level of perceived anxiety in one&rsquo;s roommate increases (i.e., how anxious people believed their roommates felt), the tendency to systematically underestimate roommates&rsquo; interest in developing a friendship also increased, and particularly so for Whites and minorities in interracial roommate relationships. Moreover, perceived roommate anxiety was also associated with inaccurate judgments in perceptions of roommates&rsquo; stated interest in developing a friendship, as indicated by a weak relationship between the perception of interest, and the roommates&rsquo; actual interest. The effect of perceived anxiety on inaccuracy was not replicated for same-race roommate relationships, indicating that anxiety plays a unique role in shaping communication processes in interracial relationships.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A second set of studies focused on developing an intervention for reducing the negative effects of anxiety on interracial relationship formation. In three studies, individuals were provided with specific if-then plans (i.e., implementation intentions) prior to watching an interracial interaction (Study 2), engaging in a structured anxiety-provoking task in the laboratory with a different-race partner (Study 3), and engaging in everyday interactions with strangers of different races than oneself (Study 4). Generally speaking, if-then plans spell out when, were, and how a set goal is put into action by indicating the specific cognitive or behavioral response that is to be made when the cue that interferes with the goal is perceived (i.e., &ldquo;If situation x arises, then I will do Y&rdquo;!). If-then plans are more effective at promoting goal attainment than goal intentions alone because they address how to cope with obstacles that interfere with attaining the goal.
