<AbstractNarration>Lichens are symbiotic organisms that are highly sensitive to environmental change, and have been used for decades as bioindicators to monitor air pollution. Their past, current, and future patterns of distribution in Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems are likely to be reflective of significant ecosystem change in temperature, water and nutrient cycling, as well as population dynamics of migratory animals such as caribou. Most of the data concerning current and historical distributions of Arctic lichens presently resides in the literature and within the natural history collections of North America, the two largest of which reside in the herbaria of the University of Alaska Museum (Fairbanks) and the University of Wisconsin State Herbarium (Madison). This project would identify, update nomenclature, barcode, georeference, and database this pair of collections. At the same time, an updated checklist of all Arctic &amp; Subarctic lichen species will be generated, photographs will be collected, and taxonomic characters for each species will be coded for use in creating dynamic taxonomic keys and species descriptions. Together, this dataset will be integrated using the Symbiota software package to generate an online virtual Flora of Arctic Lichens. Virtual floras, with their interactive keys, color photographs, species descriptions, real-time distribution maps, and direct access to complete specimen metadata, represent a revolution in the way that biodiversity information is shared in a democratic manner with all who are interested. The creation of what promises to be a relatively comprehensive Flora will expose the discipline of lichenology to a larger community, and help to further advance an appreciation of ecological complexity within the Arctic biome. In addition to the online databases and information technology tools that will be generated, data gathered for this project will be disseminated through a series of regional and national workshops. The project will also serve as the basis for Arctic lichen-themed science camps, exhibits, lectures, and activities created for the greater public, including the K-12 student/teacher audience. Finally, the collaborative effort includes both undergraduate and graduate students who will receive training from a diverse team of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lichens are symbiotic organisms formed between algae and fungi that dominate some 8% of the EarthÆs land surface, but nowhere are they as important as in the Arctic &amp; Subarctic. They are a critical component of the Arctic food chain, and are excellent sensors of climate change; lichens are especially sensitive to air quality. For these reasons alone, documenting lichen diversity and trends in distribution patterns are of global importance. Fortunately, major regions of the American and Old World Arctic have already been well collected by botanists in the past, and these historical specimens can be used to provide important scientific baseline data for the Arctic lichen flora as a whole. A free, open-access, internet web portal (http://lichenportal.org/arctic/) has been constructed through a partnership between scientists and students in the herbaria of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks and the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  These two institutions hold some of the worldÆs most impressive collections of Arctic lichens, nearly all of which are now fully databased, barcoded, imaged, and georeferenced.  The web portal has been established in conjunction with the Consortium of North American Lichen Herbaria, and continues to grow.  For example, major museums in Norway and Sweden, as well as many North American institutions, have now added their specimen data as well.  The virtual Arctic lichen flora presents vouchered herbarium specimen data in the form of a database that can be queried in various ways.  Pre-established checklists of lichen species from particular areas (e.g., Denali National Park) can be explored, or users may construct their own species checklist for a given locality.  Species lists are generated automatically, and presented along with interactive keys of diagnostic characters, color photographs, black and white line illustrations, detailed scientific species descriptions, real-time distribution maps, and direct access to complete specimen metadata.  An overview of the portal and its applications has been presented at several national and international scientific meetings, and the importance of lichens to ecosystem services was featured at public science outreach events held on the UW-Madison campus.    Together, the tools developed via this collaborative effort have served to further advance an appreciation of lichens and ecological complexity within the fragile Arctic biome.
