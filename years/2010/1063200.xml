<AbstractNarration>This award, which is cofunded by three programs in the Division of Mathematical Sciences (Analysis, Geometric Analysis, Algebra &amp; Number Theory) and the Americas Program in the Office of International Science and Engineering, will provide support for US participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the "Fifth Iberoamerican Congress on Geometry" that will be held from December 10-13, 2010, in Pucon, Chile. (Conference website: http://www.geometry.cl/)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this meeting, like those of its four predecessors in this series, is on geometric analysis, broadly construed. The special topics of emphasis for this particular event are the following: Kleinian groups and Teichmuller theory; the geometry of group actions; and algebraic curves and complex dynamics. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities, especially in the seven workshop-like sessions that the conference will feature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The aim of the V IberoAmerican Congress on Geometry in Chile, the main activity for this grant, was to bring together many different researchers in areas with the common theme of Riemann surfaces.  The main focus was  the presentation of important new results inthe inter-related areas of  Algebraic curves and moduli, Kleinian groups,Teichm\"uller theory and group actions on Abelian varieties.   The breadth of the conference made it possible for both specialists and graduate students to find out what is going on in areas related to, but not too close to their own research.   The large  number of women speakers (13)  served as role models for the younger participants.   The number of women active in the IberoAmerican mathematical community is relatively larger than in the US community and exposure to the large number of women attending was a good experience for all the US participants.    Similarly, exposure to the number of hispanic mathematicians, both the US minority hispanics and those from the IberoAmerican countries was broadening  and encouraging for all the US participants.    In addition to support of US participants to this Congress, the grant supported male and female graduate students and women faculty who had no other support to attend the Ahlfors-Bers, AWM 40th Anniversary and several other conferences.  The Ahlfors-Bers conference centered around Riemann surfaces with more of an emphasis on topological rather than algebraic aspects.  Those who went to the AWM conference attended special sessions on geometry and on Kleinian groups.    The women students  supported were excited to see so many women at a single conference.                   Last Modified: 12/16/2013       Submitted by: Linda Keen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
