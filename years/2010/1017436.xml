<AbstractNarration>The goal of the research is to determine the fundamental, information theoretic limits of when and  how to  layer multiple wireless networks on shared and/or unlicensed bands in a seamless and spectrally efficient manner.&lt;br/&gt;Wireless networks are everywhere: WiFi, Bluetooth, cordless phones populate increasingly dense unlicensed frequency bands. Cellular, satellite, military and first-responder networks occupy exclusively licensed bands that are gradually giving way to dynamic, secondary spectrum sharing forms of licensing.  For both types of licensing,  it is crucial that multiple wireless networks co-exist in the same finite spectral resources in an intelligent, efficient and scalable manner.&lt;br/&gt;The time is ripe for a fresh look at how to optimally layer wireless networks, reaching far-beyond today's ``interference-limited'' solutions which combine orthogonal access and the treatment of interference as noise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The research moves away from classical information theoretic single-layer, homogeneous networks to include realistic oblivion constraints on  how different layers should interact in a hierarchical fashion.  Understanding how to best layer networks constitutes a major step towards eliminating current spectral inefficiencies.  The fundamental bounds on the performance of layered networks developed  will reveal when incentives for networks to adopt a layered policy exist, which is expected to significantly impact the design of future networks.&lt;br/&gt;Both distributed and centralized layered networks are investigated, with goals to:&lt;br/&gt;1)  develop a structured framework for layered networks, &lt;br/&gt;2)  derive capacity regions for deterministic layered networks and associated Gaussian layered networks to within a constant gap, &lt;br/&gt;3)  understand layered networks through asymptotic metrics by considering the  generalized degrees of freedom of the layered network, the  throughput scaling laws with number of nodes in each layer, and the  throughput scaling law with number of layers.</AbstractNarration>

Cellular, satellite, military and first-responder networks occupy exclusively licensed bands that are gradually giving way to dynamic, secondary spectrum sharing forms of licensing. For both types of licensing, it is crucial that multiple wireless networks co-exist in the same finite spectral resources in an efficient and scalable manner. This project looked at the fundamental, information theoretic (technology independent) limits of when and how to layer multiple wireless networks on shared and/or unlicensed bands in a seamless and spectrally efficient manner. The idea is to understand what is possible beyond the current status quo of having users of wireless networks transmit while avoiding interference , but rather transmit at the same time, but do more intelligent processing at the transmit and receive sides.  To do so, the research moved away from classical information theoretic single-layer, homogeneous networks to include realistic oblivion constraints on how different layers (devices are grouped into layers based on their capabilities and/or right to the spectrum and/or quality of service guarantees for example) should interact in a hierarchical fashion. We then studied the mathematical, information theoretic limits of such networks,  which provide bounds or goals on what we should be able to engineer in practice.  Our main technical  (intellectual merit) project outcomes include: 1. State of the art results on the 2-user cognitive interference channel: when two independent pairs of users wish to communicate simultaneously, but interfere with each other when they transmit, one models this as an information theoretic interference channel. The 2-user cognitive interference channel is a variation of this in which one pair is more "capable" than the other; in our model one transmitter knows the others' message prior to transmission. The two pairs are the two "layers" of this network, one the "primary" layer, and the second more capable one the "secondary" or "cognitive" layer.  We studied the capacity region for this scenario, and derived the best known capacity results for this network. 2. State of the art results on the K-user cognitive interference channel: to model future networks in which multiple users will transmit and receive simultaneously, we obtained capacity results for networks with an arbitrary number of transmit and receiver pairs (thus an arbitrary number of layers) which interfere with each other, and transmitters have different levels of knowledge of the other transmitters' messages, modeling a variety of scenarios.  We have the best known bounds for such channels and one of the most comprehensive treatments of the topic. 3. State of the art results on the ergodic cognitive interference channel: in practice, the strength of wireless links change over time. We considered a 2-user cognitive interference channels where the channel gains change over time, but are known to the transmitters and receivers. In this case, the transmitter can change its power according to the channel gains it sees. We obtained the sum-capacity for such networks.  4. State of the art results on interference channels with lack of interfering codebook knowledge at one or more receivers: in all previous results, we assumed that some transmitters in the network possessed knowledge of the messages of other layers. Messages are mapped to codewords transmitted over a channel through a codebook, i.e., the codebook lists all messages and the corresponding transmitted codewords. In this last thrust, we removed the assumption that transmitters know the messages and looked at what rates would be possible in networks where certain receivers know all codebooks in the networks, but receivers in other layers might only know their own codebook. We came up with surprising results in this scenario: for the practically relevant Gau...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
