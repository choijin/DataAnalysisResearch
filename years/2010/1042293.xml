<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to organize and conduct a two-day workshop to enable and promote collaborative research agendas between architectural and engineering design researchers. The intellectual merit of this workshop lies in the knowledge gained by aggressively engaging the issues at the contested border between engineering design and architecture.  The objectives of this workshop are to: 1) provide a forum to identify and discuss the barriers to effective collaboration between architecture and engineering design researchers; 2) allow participants to share best practices and successful collaborative strategies; 3) examine how the barriers and best practices identified should impact design education; and 4) identify collaborative research directions for architectural and engineering design researchers to pursue at NSF. The workshop will engage 50 people from academia, industry, and government agencies by inviting participants from a wide range of architectural design and engineering design communities. The results of the workshop will be documented in a report that will be distributed through a website and emails to appropriate communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this workshop will promote design pedagogy to improve educational practices in both engineering design and architecture.  Synergies between communities will be explored and identified, with new research agendas being developed. The workshop has the potential to significantly impact the way in which architects and engineers approach the design of complex building structures, particularly in light of the present emphasis on green design. The attractiveness of project-based learning will be explored and emphasized to attract the best and brightest to the design professions. Representatives from Philadelphias Charter High School for Architecture and Design (CHAD) will be invited to participate in the workshop, extending Penn States current outreach partnership and presenting the challenges and opportunities from offering pre-college design education to a diverse population of students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The need for a workshop specifically focused on the relationship between architectural and engineering research in design grew out of a conversation between CRDI members and NSF Program Director (Engineering Design &amp; Innovation) Dr. Christina Bloebaum in early 2010. We immediately identified a number of barriers to effective collaboration between the two disciplines, as well as a number of cultural, language, and methodological obstacles faced by architects seeking NSF funding for their research.  With support from NSF, we created the present workshop, Collaborative Practice: When Engineering Design Meets Architecture, as an attempt to cultivate a common research language and to foster cross-cultural understanding amongst architects and engineers, with the aim of overcoming many of the historic barriers that have hindered our effective collaboration. Over one-and-a-half days, approximately 50 architecture and engineering faculty, along with a few deans and other academic administrators, and representatives from industry formed connections with other like-minded researchers, and learned from their experiences developing funded research programs from NSF and other sources. Break-out groups tackled specific issues aiming to identify effective strategies for increasing the range of collaborative opportunities available to architects and engineers in the area of design.  This workshop was motivated by the belief that the greatest potential for discovery and transformational innovation in the design of buildings exists at the contested border between engineering and architecture design practices. In keeping with the findings of The 2004 National Innovation Initiative Report [1], the most innovative findings, methods, and products are likely to come at the intersection of disciplines, rather than&mdash;in the case of engineering and architecture&mdash;by either operating in isolation.  Consequently, the intellectual merit of this workshop lies in the knowledge gained by aggressively engaging the issues at the border between engineering design and architecture.  This workshop was intended to provide a starting point for an open discussion of collaborative research possibilities and the pitfalls of interdisciplinary work.  The broader impacts of the workshop stem from advancing design pedagogy to improve educational practices in both engineering design and architecture.  The attractiveness of project-based learning should be utilized to attract the "best and brightest" to the design professions. There are opportunities to develop cross-disciplinary approaches to design education, such as in PennDesignÆs Integrated Product Design course, or in Penn StateÆs "X-Disciplinary Creativity Smart Products" course (http://www.design.psu.edu/education.php).  The teaching of design should also extend to K-12 education to ensure a robust pipeline of future designers.  Representatives from PhiladelphiaÆs Charter High School for Architecture and Design (CHAD: http://www.chadphila.org/) were invited to participate in the workshop, and the leader of Penn State's "Iron Lion" Design Challenge (http://www.openlab.psu.edu/ironlion10.php) attended the workshop.  In addition, the keynote address was open to the public and publicized as part of the PennDesign's Architecture Lecure Series.  Presenters from engineering design, architecture, and related disciplines discussed the borders and language barriers between their accepted research and practice methods. Workshop participants had the opportunity to observe both a live architectural critique or "jury," and an engineering design project review.  These two means of determining quality, each endemic to its discipline, were then discussed and contrasted through presentations and a panel discussion involving both design researchers and practitioners.  In addition, successful interdisciplinary teams of researchers explained their strategies for obtaining NSF support for research in design. Workshop particip...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
