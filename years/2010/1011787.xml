<AbstractNarration>Currently, there is a growing need to bridge the divide between technological advances and applications of new technologies to in situ ecological studies.  This is particularly true in freshwater ecology where field conditions often inhibit use of fragile instrumentation or status quo techniques are assumed to be adequate.  New microelectrode instrumentation is being constructed for expanded use in ecological studies.  Because microelectrodes have great potential for advancing ecology through a better understanding of microbial processes and chemical dynamics, this instrumentation development fills a void in ecology currently needed in multiple research areas.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microelectrodes being constructed include oxygen, sulfide, and nitrous oxide microelectrodes uniquely packaged specifically for in situ applications. This newly developed instrumentation is tested in a distinctive ecosystem in the Mojave Desert, which is home to the endangered Devils Hole pupfish (approximately 100 individuals remaining).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newly developed microelectrode instrumentation will also be packaged as a mobile unit for broad dissemination and use in myriad applications by other interested researchers.  It is expected that more than ten researchers will use this new instrumentation within the first two years of the project with continued availability after the project duration.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected outcomes of these activities include expanded use of microelectrodes in ecology, which would enable development of strategies for conservation, for example in the case of the Devils Hole pupfish.

Lastly, project activities fostered broad dissemination of this novel instrumentation by developing a field kit and instruction manual. The instrumentation was shipped to 13 different institutions over the project period for use in research activities aimed at understanding chemical movement in ecosystems.  Users were provided preliminary calibration information, all necessary supplies (as a mobile unit) for extensive field-based research, and post-calibration. Thus, the novel instrumentation developed achieved broad use and application.   Specific to the objective assessing microbial biofilms in Devils Hole, Nevada, &gt;500 microbial biofilm profiles were measured during the study period.  Measurements in this extreme habitat have elucidated several interesting findings.  For example, despite this ecosystem being characterized by low oxygen concentrations, oxygen concentrations measured within microbial biofilms of Devils Hole were higher than previously reported for any ecosystem.  The Devils Hole ecosystem consists of heterogeneous microbial biofilms, with differential potential for oxygen production and retention, which influence survival and recruitment of the endangered pupfish in this ecosystem.   Research associated with dissemination of the novel instrumentation to other scientists yielded insights on the role of wetting and drying on sediment nitrogen in wetlands, generation of greenhouse gases in multiple ecosystems, temporal variability of production in desert freshwaters, sediment characteristics associated with mussel abundance, wetland phosphorus retention and release, chemistry of sandy bottom streams, the role of surface algae in freshwater nutrient dynamics, and microbial response to freshwater contaminants. Thus, the unique instrumentation developed fostered diverse research during the project period and will continue to be used by, and disseminated to, the broader scientific community.  The primary educational activities associated with this project were the training of six graduate students and three undergraduate students on instrumentation development as well as scientific research.  All students developed independent research questions that were addressed using the newly developed instrumentation and disseminated widely as student-authored scientific presentations and publications.  Educational activities were also associated with dissemination of the instrumentation as users of the mobile microelectrode instrumentation unit, including additional students as well as principal investigators, participated in training workshops and/or seminars.
