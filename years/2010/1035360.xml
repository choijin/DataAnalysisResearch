<AbstractNarration>STEM and education faculty of SUNY-Buffalo State College (BSC) are working together with 99 Western New York school districts grouped into 5 Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES), the BSC Center for Excellence in Urban and Rural Education, other SUNY colleges and high-need LEAs to build on a successful Noyce Phase I project that has supported 42 new STEM teachers since 2003. This Phase II project is significantly increasing the number of preK-12 teachers by at least another 35 individuals who are certified and well-qualified to teach mathematics, physical science and physics, by recruiting and fostering new STEM teacher candidates, and by financing their attendance for up to 2 years in existing regular and alternative certification programs.  The Phase II activities are centered upon the continued support and extended analysis and characterization of efforts recruiting nontraditional candidates from STEM disciplines to teacher preparation programs at BSC, including regular and alternative certification programs. The project is using the  Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol for classroom observations to be correlated with school student State assessment scores for at least the first 2 years of teaching of Phase II S&amp;S scholars. Project activities continue to include the support of professional STEM community events attended by scholarship candidates and others, supporting  the participation of Noyce scholars in state and national professional STEM teacher organizations and induction experiences, and research and publication upon those issues particular to the STEM professional switching into the teaching profession.  The project is continuing to document and iterate studies and models of the concerns and methods of professional preparation for STEM professional candidates who switch into the STEM teaching profession. These latter studies and models are transferrable to and have been broadly informing other colleges and universities specializing in teacher preparation, high-need LEAs seeking to meet projected and current staffing shortages for STEM teachers, and candidates and potential candidates themselves.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Buffalo State NSF Phase II Noyce Award (1035360), entitled The Noyce Scholars Partnership at Buffalo State: A Noyce Phase II (S &amp; S) Proposal, 2011-2016, has awarded 36 STEM stipends/scholarships for STEM teacher professional candidates to receive initial certificates.   The certification area of the 36 students is as follows; 8 Biology, 4 Chemistry, 13 Earth Science, 3 Physics, 6 Mathematics, 2 Elementary Science, and 1 Engineering. Forty percent of the awardees are STEM career changers. According to recent data tracking, 28 are teaching in STEM areas.   This project has been prolific in terms of presentations at local, state, national and international science education conferences and meetings.  The project team has presented over fifty times over the course of the past five years and significant to this is the fact tover half of the presentations included Noyce scholars.  The close collaboration of Buffalo State STEM faculty participants working together for the greater good of the NSF funded project has strengthen the ability to generate ideas and to share observations about the progress of our Noyce Award.     Unique to the evaluation process was the use of an instrument called the reformed teaching observation protocol or RTOP that is designed to reflect the degree of student-centered, reformed instruction. Noyce researchers applied this tool to local classrooms and through remote observations to accommodate students teaching in other states and countries.  Results indicated that in there were demonstrated reformed teaching results in four out of the six Noyce scholars evaluated.
