<AbstractNarration>This project is to validate and refine the use of incoherent scatter radar (ISR) to measure atmospheric properties of the mesosphere (65-90 km), a key region for energy and momentum transfer between the lower and upper atmosphere.  Based on existing data from both the Arecibo Observatory and the AMISR array located in Alaska, as well as new data acquired during the course of this work, this project will improve interpretation of radar backscatter from the collision-dominated mesospheric plasma, a long-standing problem owing to the presence of heavy ions, negative ions, and layer structuring.  Specifically, this project is to compare theoretical scattering models with experimental data from the two sites and to compare chemistry models with the derived parameters.  Analysis of the resulting mesospheric parameters will be conducted to investigate open questions on mesospheric chemistry and dynamics, particularly regarding the role of minor constituents, as well as climatological dependencies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    There are two major objectives for the proposed research: (1) to demonstrate the viability  Of the incoherent scatter technique in the D-region, determine its capabilities and limitations and  (2) To understand the mesospheric aeronomy by studying the diurnal, seasonal, solar and aurora  induced variations in the mesospheric parameters.  TASKS ACCOMPLISHED DURING THE PROJECT::  DATA ACQUISITION/ANALYSIS:  P. I made several visits      to Arecibo and collected new data as well as analysis of existing      data.  Dr. Nicols at SRI,      International has provided assorted data from AMISR radars based on the      earlier requirements provided to him. Currently none of the facilities      (Arecibo or AMISR) have real time data processing or data pre-processing      arrangements in place.

This is now complete and we have at      our disposal a set of mesospheric programs which can be used to perform      preliminary analysis of any mesospheric data from any facility.  SCATTERING MECHANISM:   AMISR data collected by Nicols et al (personal communication) appear to indicate a significantly large radar cross section for the so called incoherent scatter signal at AMISR. This raises the question whether it is due to a strong hi-latitude mesosphere or due to non-thermal scattering. Similar doubts about the scattering from the EISCAT have been raised by Hansen et al and others.  The Bragg scattering scale sizes are of the order of lambda/2 and based on our understanding of the inertial sub-range for viscous damping, the scattering process should be thermal. Presence of coherent DN/N process is unlikely, but may not be totally ruled out.  A novel experiment has been designed and the data taking and analysis programs have been developed to test these hypotheses.    The experiments were planned, but could not be carried out due to scheduling problems at Arecibo during the last years.  AERONOMY:  Existing D-region data from Arecibo available with the P.I. have been analyzed for a strong solar flare event and for several instances with clear presence of vertically propagating gravity waves.  For the first time evidences of negative ion variations during the solar flare, particularly during the decay phase has been obtained. This qualitatively confirms the effectively large time constant of the negative ion chemistry. Simplified chemistry model for the D region including the negative ions has been developed and is currently being extended for the time dependent analysis. Simulation with the time dependent model will provide quantitative estimates of negative ion reaction rates.  Data with gravity waves have also been searched out and analyzed. The gravity waves manifest themselves in several parameters of the incoherent scatter signals from the mesosphere: vertical velocity, electron density and approximate ratio of Neutral temperature and neutral density are the most prominent indicators. Good quality data have been analyzed for height ranges 65 to 90 Km. and with time resolution of about 1 minute. The data have been interpreted in terms of the passage of gravity waves and all the perturbed quantities during the passage have been determined. Comparison with theoretical models has been performed and a manuscript is ready. The manuscript will shortly be submitted for publication in JGR.
