<AbstractNarration>The proposed research project will conduct a longitudinal study of students who took different middle school mathematics curricula. The proposed study will analyze data from over 4,000 students enrolled in the 10 Milwaukee public high schools. The students will be tracked over four years of high school through their completion of 12th grade. The study has two research questions: 1) How do Connected Mathematics Program (CMP) and non-CMP students perform on various tasks measuring a broad spectrum of mathematical thinking and reasoning, with a focus on algebra in high school? 2) What are the similarities and differences between the curriculum and instruction that CMP and non-CMP students are receiving in high school and the curriculum and instruction they received in middle school? The research will be conducted by a team at the University of Delaware and Marquette University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quasi-experimental research design will be used to compare students with a CMP background to students with a more traditional mathematics approach. The project design includes using multiple measures for student achievement along with observations of classroom practices. Data will be analyzed using multivariate statistics including HLM and ANCOVA with nested data. The initial sample size will be nearly 1000 students who took CMP in middle schools who enrolled in one of the 10 high schools and over 3,000 students to took some other mathematics curriculum in middle school. Since students will be followed through their four years in high school, it is anticipated that the group who will be taking mathematics through 12th grade will decline by at least 25%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the research will report on the longer term impact of a NSF supported middle school mathematics program on students' algebraic conceptual knowledge into high school up to four years after leaving 8th grade. Findings will be disseminated at conferences and through journal articles. The project addresses a research problem of compelling national importance deeply rooted in mathematics education by analyzing the efficacy of the long range impact of a mathematics program.</AbstractNarration>

We also investigated the development of the studentsÆ algebraic thinking throughout the middle and high school years. The main focus of our project was to investigate the following research questions: (1) How do the performances compare of high school students who previously used either a CMP or a non-CMP curriculum in middle school on various tasks measuring a broad spectrum of mathematical thinking and reasoning, with a focus on algebra?  (2) What are the differences in attitudes toward mathematics between high school students who previously used either a CMP or a non-CMP curriculum in middle school?     How do the performances compare of high school students who previously used either a CMP or a non-CMP curriculum in middle school on various tasks measuring a broad spectrum of mathematical thinking and reasoning, with a focus on algebra?  We used various student learning outcome measures to examine the impact of middle school curriculum on studentsÆ learning in high school. In general, on all of the student learning outcome measures, CMP students performed better than or as well as non-CMP students in high school.  For example,  all 10th grade students in the school district are required to take a state standardized test. This test was specifically designed to coordinate with the stateÆs mathematics standards. We found that CMP students had significantly higher 10th grade state test scores than the non-CMP students when prior achievement was controlled.  When controlling for their prior achievement, CMP students appeared to have greater success algebraically abstracting the relationship in the task than non-CMP students.

Eighteen (41%) of the interviewed students had used the CMP curriculum in middle school and 26 (59%) had used a non-CMP curriculum. Our analysis of the interviews indicated that the students who had used the CMP curriculum in middle school harbored attitudes toward the following six features of mathematics that were significantly more positive than those of the non-CMP students: (1) like vs. dislike of mathematics, (2) preference for reform over traditional modes of instruction,  (3) preference for conceptual over procedural approaches to learning, (4) perceived difficulty of specific mathematics topics, (5) perceived nature of mathematics and algebra, (6) perceived utility of mathematics and algebra.
