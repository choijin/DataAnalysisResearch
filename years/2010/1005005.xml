<AbstractNarration>This three year REU Site program at Oakland University will engage ten undergraduate students each year in hands-on research projects focused in the area of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  The research projects will address technical challenges in biomedical engineering, nanotechnology, autonomous land and aerial vehicles, and medical image processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the REU program are the following: 1) to provide students with long-term collegial relationships with research faculty and experts from industry and other research organizations; 2) to provide women and minority students as well as students from non-research/liberal arts institutions with exciting research experience; 3) to increase the students' understanding of the nature of research and scientific reasoning; 4) to motivate students to pursue careers in research and graduate studies in science and engineering related fields; 5) to provide participants from Detroit, Michigan and surrounding areas and opportunity to be involved in projects beyond the traditional Detroit automotive industry; 6) to improve the student's oral and written technical communication skills, 7)to improve the student's teamwork and collaboration skills in a multidisciplinary environment, and ) to provide the department and faculty involved with  valuable experience in incorporating undergraduate students into research programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;The PI intends to recruit 70% female and underrepresented minority students for the REU program.   Students will be encouraged to pursue graduate studies in STEM related areas. The lessons learned from the program about successful retention and mentoring of students in a research environment, particularly the underrepresented; will be disseminated in appropriate conferences/journals.</AbstractNarration>
