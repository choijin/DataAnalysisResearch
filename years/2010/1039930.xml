<AbstractNarration>The PI requests MRI funding to develop an instrument that is capable of providing a high degree of control over the temperature, the CO2 levels, and the oxygen levels in seawater that is being used to grow organisms for ocean acidification experiments. Furthermore, the proposed system will be able to vary these parameters dynamically, allowing investigators not only to study perturbed steady-state conditions, but also to control the variability of these parameters so as to be able to mimic natural conditions more closely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work are very great. As documented in the proposal there are numerous top-quality scientists that already signed up to use this system in their work. These folks can now focus on their biological experimentation with the assurance that the marine chemistry of the experimental system is properly controlled and described. A lot of very important results in many fields (phytoplankton, benthic inverts, pelagics, etc.) are likely to come out of this system. The proposal also entrains undergraduates in the design process of the aquarium system via a capstone engineering design course and through summer internships, and will likely involve a graduate student throughout its development. Undergraduate students will be involved in the design and testing of various components, particularly the gas mixing systems and/or the gas equilibration system using membrane contactors. This will be done at no cost to the proposal by integrating the design of some of the components into a 2-quarter undergraduate Mechanical Engineering capstone design course and by involving summer interns through the Marine Physical Laboratory Intern Program. Publication of the design and specifications of the proposed instrumentation in a peer-reviewed journal is a very strong component of the proposal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the period of this award, the grantee, Dr. Dickson and his graduate student Ms. Emily Bockmon, dsigned and built a prototype system (See Figure) for the control of CO2 and oxygen levels in seawater aquaria that were subsequently used for a variety of simple expeeriments studying the sensitivity of marine organisms to changes in CO2 and oxygen levels.   In addition further prototyping work was carried out to develop techniques to dynamically modify the pH of seawater aquaria so as to replicate time-varying conditions such as are found in the natrual environment (with the goal of being able to carry out more realistic laboratory experiments to study ocean acidification).   One side-benefit of this work was realized in another project run by Dr, Dickson with funding from the National Science Foundation: the preparation, certification, and distribution of reference materials for oceanic CO2 measurements. Our new-found expertise in controlling CO2 levels in seawater samples allowed us to prepare rference materials with high CO2 levels that could be distributed to other laboratories as test samples to ascertain their measurment proficiency. One such test was run in 2014, and another is now in preparation (2016).     Unfortuantely, after Ms. Bockmon graduated with a Ph.D. the worksubstantially slowed down due to problems with availability of suitably skilled personnel and - in the end - this MRI project was abandoned and the residual funds were returned to the National Science Foundation.
