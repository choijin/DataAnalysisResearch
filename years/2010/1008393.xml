<AbstractNarration>Networks form the infrastructure for the functioning of modern societies and economies. In particular, transportation networks allow for the move of commuters, mail, and material goods, and communication networks (e.g., Internet) accomplish the same for the transmission of information. When users independently choose their routes in the network, their objective is to minimize their costs (measured in time, money, or energy) without explicitly considering the negative externalities they impose on others. Almost inevitably, over time the demand placed on the network, its topology, or both undergo changes. We do not know if and how network users, who are bounded rationality, susceptible to various biases, and who may not coordinate their decisions, adapt to these changes by choosing new routes. In this research, the PIs will systematically manipulate network structure in an experimental setting to  learn how highly motivated network users - human subjects who volunteer to take part in network experiments for payment contingent on their performance - react to these changes.&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this purpose, six projects will be undertaken.  The theoretical benchmark that drives the investigation is the Nash equilibrium solution concept of game theory. Under this solution, each strategy chosen by any member of the population is a best response to the strategy choices of the other members.  The PIs will construct complex networks in a computer-controlled laboratory with multiple routes connecting pre-designated origins to pre-designated destinations, derive the equilibrium solutions for these networks, display them on computer screens, and ask subjects to independently choose routes that minimize their individual cost. The patterns of behavior elicited will then be compared with the Nash equilibrium predictions before and after manipulation of the network, deviations from equilibrium play, if any, will be identified and accounted for using new theories based on concepts and ideas from economics, psychology, and organization science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader signficance, the findings from these studies will be useful for planning the expansion of networks to meet changes  in demand or in the structure of the network, for increasing efficiency in networks, and for determining what information on network conditions to display on-line to network users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research program combined theoretical and experimental streams of research and applied methods and procedures of operations management and behavior economics, thereby contributing to both areas of research.  Theory provides insights that are potentially of practical importance as well as testable implications. Experiments provide evidence about systematic and replicable patterns of behavior by participants who are financially motivated to maximize their earnings. They serve as test-beds to some of the predictions derived from theory. It is in this way that our research projects contributed to the development of the emerging discipline of Behavioral Operations Management.  We examined theoretically various topics that are of major concern to the field of operations management. They include route choice decisions and information provision and its impact on travelersÆ behavior. Optimization techniques and equilibrium analysis were the primary theoretical tools in these investigations.  Our models yield implications that, in addition to be insightful and of potential practical value, are experimentally testable. We studied experimentally route choice in different settings. Our focus was on studying the effects of information on the decisions made by the players and their social welfare.  We observed that when players were only informed about the congestion on routes they chose and when they received information about the congestion in the entire network, over iterations of the a basic and a more complex augmented traffic network, aggregate route choices converged to equilibrium. We also showed that a simple learning model can account quite well for the observed decision patterns.  We extend the definition of Price of Anarchy (PoA) and illustrated how it can be used to characterize the extent of inefficiency in a large class of social dilemmas. We also introduced a class of social dilemmas that occur when individuals selfishly choose routes in traffic networks, and illustrated how the concept of PoA can be helpful in measuring the loss due to decentralization.  We reported theoretical results where full information about route conditions given to commuters prior to choosing a route may either increase or may decrease cost of travel. We then found experimental evidence obtained in computer-controlled experiments with large groups that supports the theoretical unintuitive predictions derived from the model.  We found strong support for equilibrium play and strong evidence supporting the existence of the Braess Paradox in the laboratory when network users are divided into cohorts and control multiple flow units (e.g., vehicles) in the choice of routes in a directed network. We also show for the first time that the equilibrium solution in this class of networks accounts for both aggregate and individual choice of routes.  We rejected the hypothesis that providing players with en-route information about the distribution of commuters over the network as they traverse it results in a different choice of routes than when they have to commit to a route before departing.
