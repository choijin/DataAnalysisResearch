<AbstractNarration>Mountaintop mining with valley fill (MTM/VF) in the Appalachian region of the eastern US represents a significant alteration of the landscape with a multitude of accompanying processes impacting water quality as well as the risk of floods.  In spite of its widespread use and its acknowledged impact on water quality and quantity, the changes in the basic stream processes are poorly defined.  This project will collect hydrologic and meteorological data, sample and analyze stream and precipitation for O-18 and deuterium beginning August 2010, prior to the start of mining operations.  The project will also measure streamflow and chemistry at the outlet of Sycamore Creek and continually track stream stage.</AbstractNarration>

The reframed objective of this study therefore is to compare streamflow generation processes in MTM-impacted catchment to an undisturbed forested catchment. Though this design is not ideal, it does provide basic information to move forward on understanding mining impacts and developing a rigorous approach for future proposals.   Preliminary analyses of fall season storms indicates that as much as 51% of streamflow can be attributed to precipitation (event water) in the undisturbed, forested catchment (Sycamore) whereas event water accounted for 79% of streamflow in the MTM impacted catchment (White Oak).   Mean transit time in Sycamore Creek was 10 hours compared to 5 hours in White Oak Creek.  The greater proportion of event water during storms and a shorter storm transit time in White Oak was attributed to mountain-top removal mining and valley fills that occupy nearly 34% of the catchment area.

Currently we are exploring the relationship between event water transit times through surface mines and valley fills, geochemical evolution of streams that drain mountaintop mines, and benthic organism responses to mining. Thus, we are contributing to ecology by linking streamflow generation processes, water quality, and ecosystem response.  The research funded by this award is ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
