<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Christopher A. Makaroff at Miami University (Ohio) for three summers, commencing in 2010.  The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program.  The research projects focus on collaborative research in interdisciplinary areas of chemistry and biology.  Sample projects include:  (1)  the recently-discovered system that transports fully-folded proteins into the thylakoid lumen; (2)  the development of polymeric columns for separations of chemical species; (3) the synthesis of biologically-active natural products; (4)  the elucidation of the fate of tannin under in vivo conditions; (5)  the synthesis and study of reconfigurable surfaces, responsive to light and/or chemical stimuli; (6)  the study of heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria; (7) the study of the structure and dynamics of integral membrane proteins with NMR methods; (8) the study of proteins involved in chromosome condensation and sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis and mitosis; (9) the design and development of tools to effectively measure student learning .   Besides being exposed to cutting-edge research at a research-active institution, the students participating in this program will participate in site visits, professional development activities, and ethical training.  Students targeted for the recruitment to the proposed site will come from schools without significant opportunities for research as well as schools with large populations of students underrepresented in chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide practical, hands-on research training to a significant number of students who might not have this opportunity at their home institution.  The interdisciplinary projects that the students will work on while at Miami University (Ohio) are excellent examples of the kinds of cross-disciplinary work that is becoming more and more typical of the most fruitful avenues for modern laboratory research.  Students participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of Miami UniversityÃ†s REU program was to promote research in chemistry and biochemistry as a career, especially for students underrepresented in the physical sciences.  To this end a total of 36 students participated in ten-week research-intensive programs during the summers of 20011-2013.  In addition to working closely with a faculty mentor in the research lab on an independent research project, students participated in group meetings and professional development workshops where scientific ethics, the scientific method, oral and verbal communication skills and career development topics were discussed.  A number of cohort building exercises were also conducted.  The program met its goal of impacting populations under-represented in the physical sciences with participation rates of approximately 70% and 60% for women and students of color, respectively.  In addition to the 30 participants supported by this award, individual grant supplements and university funds supported an additional six students.  Students demonstrated success in their research by publishing their results and/or presenting the results of their work at regional or national conferences.  Nine peer-reviewed publications have been published with 2011-2013 cohort student co-authors.  Several additional manuscripts are either in review or in preparation.  In addition, all students presented their work during a Miami symposium and either at their home institution or at a professional conference (many multiple times).  For example, 14 students presented posters at ACS meetings, two presented posters at PittCon, one at SERMACS and one gave an oral presentation and won the best talk award for their session at the 2013 ABRCMS conference.  Pre- and post-program evaluations on topics related to student familiarity with research, their inclination to pursue a career in (bio)chemistry, program satisfaction and student perception of the various components of the program were administered each year.  Results indicate that the program had the desired effects.  At the end of the program students were more inclined to attend graduate school and understood the application process and requirements better than they had before the program.  Students were also more confident in their abilities to understand a research problem and conduct the appropriate experiments required to address a specific question.  Likewise they indicated that they had a better appreciation of the scientific method, how to design experiments to address a specific problem and the ethical considerations/problems that can arise in science and in working in the research environment.   In support of these findings the vast majority of 2011-2013 cohort students who have completed their undergraduate degree report that they are currently either working in chemistry-related fields or in graduate or professional school.
