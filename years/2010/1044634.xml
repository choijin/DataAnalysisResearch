<AbstractNarration>This project is to study knowledge transfer oriented data mining (or&lt;br/&gt;KTDM). Given two data sets, the idea of KTDM is to discover models&lt;br/&gt;that are common to both data sets, as well as models that are unique&lt;br/&gt;in one data set. These common and unique models with respect to the&lt;br/&gt;two data sets will provide a tool to leverage the already-understood&lt;br/&gt;properties of one data set for the purpose of understanding the other,&lt;br/&gt;probably less understood, data set. This EAGER project is to&lt;br/&gt;concentrate on models in the form of a diversified set of&lt;br/&gt;classification trees. The KTDM approach is useful for real-world&lt;br/&gt;applications in part due to its ability to allow users to narrow down&lt;br/&gt;to particular models, guided by known knowledge from another data set.&lt;br/&gt;It will help towards realizing transfer of knowledge and learning in&lt;br/&gt;various domains. The project will support a graduate student and will&lt;br/&gt;seek collaboration with experts in the medical domain. These will&lt;br/&gt;increase the impact of the project.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project studied knowledge transfer oriented data mining (KTDM); KTDM refers to data mining that is aimed at helping scientific and medical researchers to gain better understanding of challenge domains by utilizing mined knowledge concerning similarities between the challenging domains and well understood domains.

This project focused on mining decision trees shared by two domains.
