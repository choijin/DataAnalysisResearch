<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Division of Materials Research (DMR) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Arne Gericke at Kent State University for three summers, commencing in 2010.  The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program.  The research projects focus on research in the chemical and materials science, with an emphasis on "soft materials" including liquid crystals.  Sample projects include:  (1)  the biophysical characterization of phosphoinositide and phosphatidic lipids; (2)  the study of the piezoelectricity of lipid bilayers; (3) the study of ordered nanoporous materials; (4)  the study of gold-organic nanocomposites; (5)  the synthesis and study of environment-responsive catalysts; (6)  the fabrication and study of plasmonic nanostructures; (7) the synthesis and characterization of molecular materials to test the structural boundaries of liquid crystallinity; (8) the study of vanadium-vitamin B12 conjugates for the potential treatment of diabetes ; (9) the synthesis and study of new metal-organic complexes; and (10) the synthesis, characterization and fabrication of electronically tunable filters.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a variety of professional development activities, including clean-room training, oral and written communication skills.  Students will also receive some training in ethics, in a research context.  Students will be recruited both regionally and nationally, with a special emphasis on recruiting students from community colleges.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide practical, hands-on research training to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity.  The possible projects span a wide range of topics in current chemical and materials research -- from investigations of new kinds of materials with technologically-useful properties to fundamental studies in traditional areas of chemistry.  The REU students participating in Kent State University's REU site will receive excellent training on state-of-the-art equipment.  Students participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.  Many of the student participants will come from groups traditionally underrepresented in the chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
