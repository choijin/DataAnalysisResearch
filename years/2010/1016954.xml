<AbstractNarration>This research addresses issues arising from the convergence of two important trends in embedded systems. One, many safety-critical applications are subject to certification requirements. Two, there is an increasing trend towards integrated architectures that support multiple functionalities, often of different criticalities, upon a single computing platform. As such systems become increasingly more complex, obtaining required certifications becomes more challenging.  This project investigates the following thesis: Scheduling theory in its current form is unsuited to the design of such mixed-criticality (MC) systems that are subject to multiple certification requirements; efficient resource use in such systems requires the development of fundamentally new scheduling techniques. The methodology adopted in investigating this thesis is to first identify major weaknesses with current approaches, that render certification cumbersome.  Once these weaknesses are understood, new models are proposed for representing MC systems, and metrics derived for quantifying the effectiveness of techniques for building these systems. A systematic study of resource allocation and scheduling issues in certifiable systems is then conducted, aimed at providing quantitatively superior resource allocation methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of this project will enable embedded safety-critical systems designers to provide systems that make far more efficient use of platform resources than is currently possible, and that pass certification at a significantly lower cost.  Technology transfer will be achieved via ongoing and new industrial collaborations, and by continued participation in industry initiatives aimed at improving the certification process.  Results will be disseminated via publications, presentations and tutorials, and distribution of software over the internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed a framework for the design, analysis, and implementation of embedded real-time systems of mixed criticality: systems in which different functionalities, of different degrees of importance (or criticalities), coexist upon a shared implementation platform.  The framework is based upon exploiting the insight that less critical functionalities are often required to have their correctness validated to lesser levels of assurance that more critical ones -- for instance, certification requirements in several safety-critical application domains classify functionalities into Safety Integrity Levels or Design Assurance Levels according to criticality, and require that functionalities assigned greater criticality levels have their correctness validated to higher levels of assurance.  In our framework, a single mixed-criticality system, whose run-time behavior is governed by a single deterministic run-time algorithm, is therefore modeled separately multiple times, each time in a manner consistent with the requirements of a different criticality level, and only the functionalities of criticality at or above the modeled criticality level are validated under each model.  (Thus for instance, the execution of a piece of code may be modeled as having a very large execution time, as determined by a very conservative worst-case execution time[WCET] analysis tool, for the purposes of validating the correctness of a highly safety-critical functionality; however, the same execution of the piece of code may be modeled as having a smaller execution time that is determined by a less conservative WCET tool, for validating less critical functionalities.)  Modeling techniques, scheduling and resource-allocation algorithms, and implementation strategies based upon this framework were developed in this project, and demonstrated to result in more resource-efficient implementations of mixed-criticality systems than was previously possible.  Thus was done by both theoretical methods -- by quantifying the  effectiveness of these newly-developed strategies via metrics such as utilization bounds, speedup factor, etc., and comparing with prior implementation strategies  -- and via implementation efforts and experimentation.  Collaboration with industrial partners have facilitated the transfer of results and ideas from this project to industrial practice; collaboration with international academic partners have helped spur increased research efforts into developing better implementation strategies for mixed-criticality real-time embedded systems.
