<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project uses numerical simulations to study the likely behavior of tropical cyclones (TCs, which include Atlantic hurricanes, Pacific typhoons, and cycones in the Indian Ocean), at the height of the last ice age (about 21,000 years ago) and during the mid-holocene warm period of about 6,000 years ago. Much attention has been devoted to understanding the impact on TCs of the warming of the world's oceans over recent decades and the likely response of TCs to future global warming. This study seeks to further understanding of the impact of climate change on TCs by looking backward to past climates which are comparably different from today's climate, although in different ways. Four specific questions are addressed: 1) How do the factors that influence tropical cyclone genesis vary under LGM and mid-holocene forcings? 2) Are there significant variations in how different models resolve these large-scale factors? Which changes appear attributable to model variability and which to variations in external forcing? 3) How do the TC-like vortices found in climate models change in LGM and mid-holocene simulations when compared to preindustrial or present-day conditions? 4) How does a higher resolution, regional model's simulation of a paleoclimate environment handle genesis? How do storm counts and track densities vary as the climate forcing changes? The research is based on preliminary results which find evidence that the climate of the last ice age may have been relatively favorable for TC development in some regions, despite the generally colder sea surface temperatures worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has broader impacts in the scientific community as it will inform research into the emerging science of "paleotempestology", the interdisciplinary study of the behavior of TCs and other storms in past climates. The work will also inform efforts to understand the impact of global warming on landfalling TCs including hurricanes along the US coastline. In addition, the work will fund and train a graduate student and a postdoctoral researchers, thereby providing support and training for the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most important challenges in assessing the risks of anthropogenic climate change is to understand the potential for changes in the climatogy of hurricanes (tropical cyclones) as the climate warms.  Over the last decade, several approaches have been developed to use indices derived from climate model output, which is too coarse to explictly resolve tropical cyclone circulations, to assess such changes in tropical cyclone climatology.  While these have proved successful, there has been a lingering question as to the validity of these indices across the broad range of different climate states the Earth has experienced.  The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21,000 years ago) and the mid-Holocene (6000 years ago) are two such periods of particular interest because the LGM was much colder than the modern climate and the mid-Holocene was subjected to substantially different solar forcing than the modern climate.  The goal of this study was to use a high-resolution climate model (WRF) to downscale paleoclimate GCM output from these periods and to compare the climatology of the downscaled tropical cyclones to the large-scale indices.  The results of the study show that (1) the tropical cyclone climatology of these past climates in the Western Pacific was not significantly different from the 20th century climatology of tropical cyclones and (2) the downscaled climatologies were consistent with genesis indices derived from the GCM output.  This study demonstrates the capacity to reliably downscale paleoclimate GCM output, with potential application to other studies of the geological evolution of active sites like the Western Pacific, and demonstrates the utility of tropical cyclone genesis indices across a broader range of natural climate variability than has previousy been recognized.
