<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will explore the use of a distributed temperature sensing monitoring system (DTS), using fiber-optical (FO) technology, as the basis of a sustainable, sub-ice cavity sensing array. FO cable systems, such as may be deployed through a hot-water drilled hole through an ice shelf, passing through the underlying cavity to the sea floor, are capable of measuring temperatures down fiber at 1 meter intervals, and at time frequencies as high as 15 seconds. DTS FO systems operate via optical time domain reflectometry along the fiber waveguide using inelastic  backscatter of coherent laser light as a probe beam in the FO environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The introduction of new technologies to the harsh environmental conditions of the Antarctic are often associated with high risk. However, the potential rewards of this approach (e.g. multiyear capability, minimal submerged mechanical or electrical components that may fail, relative simplicity of deployment and measurement principle, yet yielding distributed real time and spatial observation) are attractive enough to conduct a pilot project at a field-ready location (McMurdo). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current indications are that the instability of some of the world's largest ice sheets located around the Antarctic and Greenland may be caused by the presence of warming, deep ocean waters, shoaling over continental shelves, and melting the underside of floating ice shelves. Additional knowledge of the temporal and spatial variability of the temperature fields underneath terminal ice shelves, such as those draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, are needed to accurately project future global climate effects on ice-shelf ocean interactions, and in order to inform societal and technological aspects of adaption to changing sea-level.</AbstractNarration>

However, measuring this melting, which occurs 100's of meters beneath the floating ice is a very challenging measurement to obtain.  This collaborative project with the University of Nevada, Reno, New York University and the Ohio State University, for the first time successfully deployed and monitored a fiber-optic temperature sensing mooring through 200 meters of the McMurdo Ice Shelf and into almost 700 meters of ocean below the ice.  The fiber optic system measures the fiber optic temperature along every meter of the mooring cable from a surface sensor; eliminating the need for instrumentation to be submerged or frozen into the ice. The mooring cables were installed using a specially designed lightweight drilling system that combined traditional ice coring methods with a novel hot point melting system for the final penetration into the ocean.  All mooring instruments were designed to be installed quickly through the small (~50 mm) diameter boring before it refroze with seawater.  Figure 1 shows a schematic of the mooring site, with both the shallow mooring (BH1) and the deep mooring (BH2)  The mooring was operated for 14 months, including the Antarctic winter and retrieved almost 5 million measurements of temperature from both within the floating ice shelf and in the ocean-filled ice shelf cavity.  Figure 2 shows the evolution of the ocean temperatures through the 14 month deployment from the deep mooring, clearly documenting the arrival of warm Ross Sea water almost 20 km from the ice shelf edge. This warm water (greater than the ice shelf freezing temperature) originates in the Ross Sea during the summer months and is driven under the ice shelf by currents, where it melts the ice shelf from below.

The ability to measure such small melt rates is a product of the fiber sensing system's ability to measure the temperature gradient, i.e. change in temperature through the ice shelf, with excellent accuracy.  The development of a simple and robust method to continuously measure ice shelf melting from below can significantly improve our ability to predict the impact of climate change on Antarctic ice stability.   Because the fiber optic system does not rely on sensors suspended in the ice or ocean column, but rather simply on the optical properties of the frozen optical fiber as it warms and cools, it can be used to measure shelf melting continuously and for long periods of time. Changes in the melt rate of ice shelves can therefore be easily monitored from one season to the next, and evidence of accelerating melting can be quickly assessed.
