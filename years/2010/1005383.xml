<AbstractNarration>The Conference on "Topology and Geometry in Dimension Three: Triangulations, Invariants, and Geometric Structures" will be held at Oklahoma State University, June 4-6, 2010.  The conference brings together experts and emerging researchers to report on recent results and explore future directions in the study and understanding of 3-manifolds. Geometric structures on 3-manifolds are known to exist but relatively little is known about direct construction of these geometric structures; specifically, constructing the geometry from a description, such as a Heegaard splitting or triangulation of the manifold.  This conference will highlight finding direct connections between topological structures on 3-manifolds (triangulations in particular) and geometric structures and expanding the use of these structures to a study of new invariants and applications of hyperbolic geometry to 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three-dimensional space provides the local space-model for much of science and engineering.  Three-manifolds are locally modeled on three-dimensional space and their study and understanding leads to better predictions and understanding in science and more effective applications in engineering and technology.  Recent advances in our understanding of three-manifolds has generated new energy making it one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas in mathematics; and making this Conference very timely for reporting on emerging results and plotting future directions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The conference, held in Stillwater, Oklahoma, June 4-6 2010, brought together over 80 topologists and geometers from around the globe. There were 15 plenary talks attended by a wide range of participants: from long-standing collaborators to the latest generation of graduate students. This group produced an atmosphere rich in ideas and energy, most fitting to celebrate a career with such qualities in abundance.  With the recent establishment by Perelman  of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture for $3$--manifolds, it is known that a compact, irreducible $3$--manifold can be decomposed by tori into submanifolds, each of which has one of eight possible geometric structures.  The major aims of this Conference and of research in $3$--manifold theory is to advance our understanding of suitable triangulations of 3--manifolds so that their geometric structures can be built constructively and so that more practical algorithms can be produced to identify key properties of the spaces; to develop relationships between geometric structures, new invariants, and the ideas from quantum field theory; and to explore the connections between these ideas and methods to establish the virtual Haken and virtual fibering conjectures for hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  The conference is a continuation of the effort to bring active researchers into the region and to foster cutting-edge research in topology and geometry, after the Conference on Topology and Geometry of Knots held on March 20-21, 2009 at Oklahoma State University.  A Contemporary Mathematics Volume from the conference is to be published. The proceeding volume contains 13 papers presented at the conference, and/or papers inspired by the conference, with one problem list discussed in the conference.
