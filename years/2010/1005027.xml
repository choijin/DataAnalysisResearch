<AbstractNarration>This award, made to Johns Hopkins University, is supported by the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences.  Johns Hopkins University will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students for summers 2010-2012.  The organizing scientific theme for this intense and immersive research program is the application of imaging and structural techniques to achieve better understanding of biological systems.  In the course of pursuing a research project, students will be exposed to reading scientific literature, designing experiments and controls, learning various experimental techniques, and collecting and analyzing data.  In addition, students will engage in activities designed to improve oral and written communication skills as they build a sense of community.  Students will be instructed in research ethics and the responsible conduct of research and will be expected to conduct their research accordingly.  Participants will be recruited nationally through the NSF REU website, informational booths at SACNAS and ABRCMS meetings, and contacts at various institutions across the country and in US territories, in addition to the program website.  Students having limited research opportunities at their home institutions, or belonging to groups underrepresented in academics will be especially encouraged to apply.  Selection will be based on recommendation letters, grades, and a statement of career goals.  Following the program, participants will be contacted annually to determine their progress toward a degree, their career plans, and enrollment in graduate or professional school.  Outcomes of the program will be determined using an NSF-supported assessment tool.  Information about the program may be obtained from the director, Joel Schildbach (phone: 410-516-0176; e-mail: joel@jhu.edu), or at the program web site (http://www.bio.jhu.edu/sure).</AbstractNarration>
