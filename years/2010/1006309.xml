<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-1006309&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Christopher Bishop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will study the geometric properties of conformal and quasiconformal maps, with an emphasis on the connections with other areas such as numerical analysis, computational geometry, complex dynamics and geometric measure theory. He will continue his work on fast conformal mapping algorithms, including the class of Schwarz-Christoffel iterations. These include Davis' method and the CRDT algorithm of Driscoll and Vavasis as special cases, and other methods involving the medial axis and quasiconformal mappings.  One of the basic themes is to start with certain quasiconformal maps that approximate the desired conformal map, but are easier to compute and have better properties. These maps have natural connections to several well known problems such as Brennan's conjecture, and the PI will investigate these connections. The PI will also continue his work on various related problems involving optimal meshing algorithms, diffusion limited aggregation, the geometry of Brownian motion, the quasiconformal Jacobian problem and conformal welding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental problem of mathematics and engineering is to quickly and accurately solve various differential equations related to fluid flow, heat conduction and wave propagation on complex regions.  For 2-dimensional surfaces, a standard method is to use a conformal mapping (i.e., angle preserving on small scales) to replace the region with a simpler one, such as a disk or rectangle. This approach has been studied for over 150 years, but not until the 1980's did computers made conformal mapping practical for highly complex regions.  The PI will investigate how to improve existing methods and develop new ones that are faster and more reliable. He will also investigate the theoretical behavior of conformal maps on extremely complex domains such as fractals and the connections between conformal maps and probability theory. The PI has already applied the insights gained from these problems to meshing. This is the process of dividing a complex region into simple pieces such as triangles.  Meshing is a basic part of most numerical methods and the usefulness of a mesh in applications depends on the number of pieces (fewer is better) and their shapes (better to avoid small and large angles).  It is difficult to construct a mesh which is good in both respects, but PI has used non-Euclidean geometry to construct 2-dimensional quadrilateral meshes with optimal size and shapes for simple polygons and is working to extend this to more general domains.  Greater generality is needed in various problems involving crack formation, interfaces between materials and computer learning.  Efficient meshing also has numerous applications in high-performance computing such as modeling surfaces for engineering and computer graphics.  This award is jointly funded by the programs in Analysis and Geometric Analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project used ideas from complex analysis and hyperbolic  geometry to solve some long standing open problems about  how to divide a planar polygonal domain into simple shapes  (triangles and quadrilaterals) with good control of the angles.  In earlier work the PI had used results from discrete geometry  to give a fast algorithm for computing conformal (angle preserving)  maps between a disk and a polygon. Such maps have been   the subject of investigation for over 150 years due to their central  place in mathematical analysis and a large number of connections  to areas such as fluid flow, probability theory, electrostatics and   shape recognition. In the current work, the direction is reversed   and ideas from conformal analysis  are used to resolve questions  about discrete mathematics, namely, optimal meshing.     A polygonal domain in the plane is one that is bounded  by a finite number of line segments (but the boundary need  not be connected; it may have holes or cracks that run through  it). A simple polygon is one where the boundary is a single  connected polygonal curve. For various applications, such as  numerically solving a partial differential equation, it is desirable  to lay a grid over domain. The elements might be triangles (giving  a triangulation) or quadrilaterals (giving a quad mesh) and we wish  these pieces to exactly fill up the domain without overlapping each  other or the boundary. For computational reasons, it is also highly  desirable to use angles that are not  too large (they should bounded  strictly below 180 degrees) and for efficiency we wish to use as few  pieces as possible.  It turns our that the best upper angle bound  that is practical is 90 degrees and it has been known for about  20 years that domains with simple polygonal boundaries can be  efficiently triangulated using angles with maximum size 90 degrees.  In the more general case of polygons with holes or cracks (which  can be used to model the interface between different materials)  it has been known since the 1990's how to efficiently triangulate  with angles less than 132 degrees. The current work improved this  to the optimal 90 degrees, giving the first polynomial time algorithm  for doing  non-obtuse triangulation in this generality.     Several other open problems involving meshes and triangulations  were also solved in this project, e.g., it was shown how to create a  quad-mesh for a general polygonal domain with N sides that  uses at most about N^2 pieces and so that all angles are less than  120 degrees and all new angles are bigger than 60 degrees (smaller  angles in the domain boundary must remain but are not  subdivided). Both the angle estimates and the size of triangulations  are sharp, i.e.,   there are examples that show that these estimates  cannot be improved in general.     At present the algorithms described above are mostly theoretical  in nature, giving worst case  limits that practical implementations  will try to meet or beat. However, there are a variety of applications  (e.g., numerical solution of differential equations) where high quality  meshes improve the accuracy and speed of the calculation, and the  meshing results above, even if only partially implemented, could  improve on current methods used in practice.     In addition to the meshing problems described above,  the PI  also obtained new results in the theory of quasiconformal maps   (maps that distort angles by a limited amount).  He gave new  examples of quasiconformal maps related to fractal behavior and  used the theory of quasiconformal maps to build new examples  of holomorphic maps, resolving by counter-examples  some open  long standing open problems in holomorphic dynamics.
