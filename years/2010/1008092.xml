<AbstractNarration>Grabovsky&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1008092&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator studies problems related to composite&lt;br/&gt;materials, martensitic phase transformations, and morphological&lt;br/&gt;stability in materials.  First, he considers exact relations and&lt;br/&gt;links for effective tensors of fiber-reinforced elastic&lt;br/&gt;composites, by applying the general theory developed by him and&lt;br/&gt;his collaborators.  The general theory provides a strategy for&lt;br/&gt;finding every relation and link.  However, the actual execution&lt;br/&gt;of that strategy is far from trivial.  The case of&lt;br/&gt;fiber-reinforced elastic composites is both important for&lt;br/&gt;applications and incredibly challenging technically, because the&lt;br/&gt;microstructure is two-dimensional while the properties of the&lt;br/&gt;composite are represented by three-dimensional fully anisotropic&lt;br/&gt;elastic tensors.  This topic builds on the successful solution of&lt;br/&gt;a similar, simpler problem in the context of Hall-effect&lt;br/&gt;conductivity.  A second problem concerns morphological stability&lt;br/&gt;of phase boundaries in materials capable of undergoing&lt;br/&gt;martensitic phase transformations.  The investigator studies the&lt;br/&gt;possibility of a configuration in which the only mode of&lt;br/&gt;instability is the global motion of the phase boundary. &lt;br/&gt;Mathematically this corresponds to the failure of the generalized&lt;br/&gt;second variation to stay positive.  The difficulty is that all&lt;br/&gt;other stability criteria are required to be satisfied.  The&lt;br/&gt;resolution of this issue opens the way to a complete&lt;br/&gt;understanding of all instabilities of configurations with smooth&lt;br/&gt;phase boundaries.  In the context of periodic composites,&lt;br/&gt;morphological instabilities may occur locally within a period&lt;br/&gt;cell.  Their interaction with the effective behavior of a&lt;br/&gt;composite is investigated, following prior work for structural&lt;br/&gt;and material instabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Heterogeneous media, or media with internal structure, are&lt;br/&gt;of great importance in applications.  Composite materials, which&lt;br/&gt;have by now become ubiquitous, are one example.  Another example&lt;br/&gt;is shape memory alloys and other smart materials.  These two&lt;br/&gt;groups of materials are very different, yet have some important&lt;br/&gt;common features.  A well-known connection between the two&lt;br/&gt;theories can be used to shed light on the less well-understood&lt;br/&gt;theory of martensitic phase transformations responsible for much&lt;br/&gt;of the shape memory behavior.  One aim of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;understand elastic properties of fiber-reinforced elastic&lt;br/&gt;composites.  Such composites may combine two cheap but imperfect&lt;br/&gt;materials to produce a new material that is either rare or not&lt;br/&gt;found in nature at all.  For example, modern skis use composites&lt;br/&gt;to create a material that bends easily but is incredibly stiff&lt;br/&gt;with respect to torsion.  However, there are limitations to what&lt;br/&gt;can be achieved by composites.  The investigator maps out those&lt;br/&gt;instances where the benefits of creating composites are&lt;br/&gt;dramatically reduced due to the presence of "exact relations,"&lt;br/&gt;i.e. relations between material moduli that cannot be altered by&lt;br/&gt;making composites, no matter how hard one tries.  The present&lt;br/&gt;work focuses on a very widely used class of fiber-reinforced&lt;br/&gt;composites.  Another aim of the project is to understand&lt;br/&gt;instabilities in models of non-linear elasticity and shape memory&lt;br/&gt;alloys.  One widely known type of elastic instability is&lt;br/&gt;buckling.  Martensitic phase transitions responsible for shape&lt;br/&gt;memory behavior are another kind of instability.  These examples&lt;br/&gt;show how important instabilities are in applications.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator classifies all possible instabilities in a&lt;br/&gt;systematic way, with the secondary goal of solving one of the&lt;br/&gt;long-standing mathematical problems: finding "correct" sufficient&lt;br/&gt;conditions for stability.</AbstractNarration>
