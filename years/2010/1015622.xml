<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report: Beijing Water Ecosystem Services  NSF EAPSI 2010- Beijing, China  Christina Wong  Contact's NSF ID: 000553165                 The NSF EAPSI 2010 China program introduced me to a unique case study for my dissertation research in Beijing, China. I am examining the use of ecological engineering in cities to promote sustainable development. Designed ecosystems or ecological restoration can come in the form of parks, green spaces, lakes, wetlands, etc. They can be important recreational and community spaces for urban residents and can provide valuable cooling and stormwater benefits.  For my dissertation I am evaluating the potential tradeoffs of the Yongding Green Ecological Corridor, an ecological engineering project, in Beijing China.  The main objectives of my research are to increase our understanding of ecological engineering in cities, the connection between ecosystem services and human welfare, and environmental management in China.              The NSF EAPSI 2010 program afforded me the opportunity to work with Professor Ouyang Zhiyun at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) State Key Laboratory of Urban &amp; Regional Ecology, Research Center of Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES).

Professor Ouyang is the director of the State Key Laboratory of Urban &amp; Regional Ecology and the co-director of the RCEES. In 2005, Arizona State University, my home institution, formed a Joint Center on Urban Sustainability with CAS.  Professor Ouyang is a member of the collaborative since he manages the Beijing urban ecology station, which is equivalent to the NSF urban long-term ecological research sites in Phoenix and Baltimore.  In 2009, Professor Ouyang with several other experts helped lead the first comprehensive assessment on BeijingÃ†s water ecosystem services, which was authorized by the Beijing Water Authority. Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems, such as water purification, aesthetic landscapes, and climate change mitigation. For my dissertation I wanted to work on urban water ecosystem services in China, hence Professor Ouyang and the State Key Laboratory of Urban &amp; Regional Ecology were a perfect match.  Based on my research interests Professor Ouyang suggested I examine the potential ecosystem services from the Yongding Green Ecological Corridor.  Worldwide experts deem water the most limiting factor for Beijing to meet its current and projected growth (UNEP, 2009). Water scarcity however is only one of several sustainability dilemmas facing Beijing since it also aims to resolve air pollution from dust storms, heat waves exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, carbon-dioxide emissions from automobiles, citizen demands for environmental and cultural amenities, and equitable economic development (Zhou et al. 2006).

The potential Corridor benefits are: i) flood control, ii) water quality improvements, iii) artificial groundwater recharge &amp; subsidence prevention, iv) elimination of sandstorms, v) local temperature reductions, vi) functional wetlands, and vii) aesthetic improvements for economic development.  For my 2010 EAPSI fellowship, I familiarized myself with the Yongding Corridor plan and conducted a preliminary field survey to guid...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
