<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this travel supplement is to develop a plan for a new research partnership between GridStat and INSPIRE.  The proposal is to support two trips. The purpose of the proposed visits is to form a collaborative research between the PI and participants in the INSPIRE (INcreasing Security and Protection through Infrastructure Resilience), a Collaborative Project, co-funded by the European Commission, which focuses on SCADA systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Introduction and Background  This $18K travel grant was supported the US travel for development of a detailed collaboration plan, including how GridStat and INSPIRE can be integrated and the resulting benefits, and will foster transatlantic collaboration.  (This was a partial match of the &euro;132K  that the EC funded for their researcherÆs travel on this international effort.) Outcomes of this project  On May 18, 2010 the INSPIRE group hosted an International Cooperation Workshop in Naples, Italy. Dr. Bakken was the only non-EC participant in this meeting that had approx.. 50 attendees from industry, academia, and government (including EC PM Angelo Marino, with whom Bakken had many previous dialogues with. The brochure from this meeting is an appendix to this document. Bakken briefed the audience on GridStat and related R&amp;D in the US. He had many discussions with participants throughout the day.     Also, taking advantage of the hindsight allowed by this very-late report, there are two significant outcomes that occurred after the project. First was a very successful workshop co-organized by Drs. Bakken and Suri. The workshop, Trustworthiness of Smart Grids (ToSG)[1], was held in conjunction with DSN[2], the #1 international conference in dependable computing. The workshop featured deep interactions between cyber and power researchers involving how ICT behavior and anomalies affect the stability of power.     Dr. Miroslav Begovic is the President of the IEEE Power &amp; Energy Society. He gave a keynote presentation and also served on a panel at the end.
