<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Sergey Vyazovkin of the University of Alabama at Birmingham will explore the effect of nanoconfinement on the kinetics and mechanisms of chemical reactions, in which heating of a single solid reactant yields solid products without participation of any gases and/or liquids. The idea is to prepare the solid reactants as micron and nanometer size particles. A comparative study of the reactions in the two types of particles by means of calorimetry and infrared spectroscopy may lead to the discovery of presently unknown effects of nanoconfinement on reactions that proceed entirely in the solid phase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project will involve enhancing chemistry education, advancing research training of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and engaging minority students in scientific research. Potential practical impacts include controlling the reactivity of chemical reactions performed without solvents and developing environmentally friendly technologies for the creation of solid materials.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project has produced a new knowledge of fundamental significance. It has discovered how the size of a solid reactant affects the rate of chemical reactions. The knowledge has filled an important gap in the field of physical chemistry and enriched the field with some new creative and original concepts. The project has promoted education on several levels, involved underrepresented groups, broadly disseminated the results, and produced societally beneficial results. The latter are related to the fact that the solid &reg; solid reactions studied under the project occur without a solvent and, therefore, the studies of nanoconfinement as a means of controlling their rate is relevant to the task of finding environmentally friendlier ways of synthesizing materials. The results of the study have been broadly disseminated via presentations at conferences and publications in major physical chemistry journals such as <em>J. Phys. Chem. C</em>, <em>Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys</em>., <em>Chem. Phys. Lett</em>., and <em>Macromol. Chem. Phys</em>. The NSF award has been acknowledged in 9 peer-reviewed papers (+1 final paper in preparation) and a book26 written by the principal investigator during 2014. The results have been publicized in 22 conference presentations (8 posters at 2 ACS meetings, 1 oral and 1 poster at the APS meeting, and 5 orals and 6 posters at 4 NATAS meetings, and 1 plenary talk at CEEC-TAC3 conference). The project has promoted education on several levels, from high-school to postdoctoral. Its results have been included as examples and case studies in teaching materials of undergraduate Instrumental Analysis course and graduate Thermal Processes and Methods course. The project has directly contributed to education and training of 6 students: 1 postdoc, Ben Yancey (accepted a job as a staff scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory); 2 grad students, Reza Farasat and Rachel Prado; 2 undergrad students: Kahleah Walker and Calla McCulley; and 1 high school student: Graziella Camata). It has also promoted full participation of women in science as the majority (4 out of 6) students recruited by the PI are female.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/09/2015<br>      Modified by: Sergey&nbsp;Vyazovkin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
