<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Early-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to apply topological optimization methods to create feasible bone replacement forms for large segmental defects in craniofacial reconstruction. Restoring normal function and appearance after massive facial injuries due to blast or tumor removal with bone loss still remains an important unresolved problem in craniofacial reconstruction surgery. The current methods are heuristic in nature and ad hoc design of bone replacements is done by the operating surgeon at the time of surgery. Within a given space defined by the wound, bone replacements have to be designed to meet structural functions, to maintain permanently a specific three-dimensional shape, and to support soft tissues and prosthetic appliances. A multi-level topological optimized method will be applied and tailored to create new bone replacement forms that not only meet requirements for load-bearing, but also position tissue elements in the proper locations in space to support soft tissues and prosthetic appliances.  The integration of the replacement forms in the deformity regions and validation of the feasibility of using the tailored craniofacial design shapes will be carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project is a synergy of tissue engineering research, clinical surgery and computational mechanics. The adopted interdisciplinary approach combines the biomechanics of the mid-face with topological optimization techniques and finite element methods to build a technique for creating patient-specific topologically optimized bone replacement alternatives for craniofacial reconstruction. If successful, this research has the potential to improve the quality of life for individuals with large bone defects. The project can contribute to a global methodology for designing an optimized, patient-specific treatment protocol for tissue engineering with maximum treatment outcome in clinical applications in other anatomical defects. Elucidating the relationship between the structure and function of the craniofacial skeleton will enable advances in tissue engineering, prosthetics design and approaches to encourage prosthetics fixation, and design of engineered material systems. A multidisciplinary approach to study such problems will be exploited as a tool to develop undergrad and graduate student's critical thinking skills by using engineering concepts and tools to study biological and medical problems.</AbstractNarration>
