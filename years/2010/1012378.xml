<AbstractNarration>With this Renewal Award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program continues to support Michael R. Wasielewski of Northwestern University in a project involving investigations of the factors controlling spin interactions and dynamics in organic multi-spin systems.  In these studies, photoexcitation of organic radicals will be used to generate multi-spin systems which will be manipulated by optical and microwave pulse techniques to study their spin dynamics. The properties of these multi-spin systems in tailored covalent organic structures will be investigated to determine if their spin dynamics can be used to control spin polarization transport. These experiments, aimed at controlling the spin dynamics in multi-spin systems, will contribute to an understanding of the fundamental factors affecting electronic communication in organic molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These investigations have the potential to make major contributions in light harvesting technology, energy storage and the development of quantum computers.  The project will train students in modern spectroscopic and synthetic techniques.  Collaboration with Professor Mark P. Niemczyk of Wheaton College will allow undergraduate students from that institution to participate in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Spintronics, that is, spin-based electronics, uses the quantum spin property of electrons and/or nuclei to manipulate and transfer information. It thus offers the possibility of massively parallel information processing to address computational problems that would take todayÃ†s computer technology years to execute. Controlling the spin dynamics of complex multi-spin systems is a major goal in the quest for molecule-based spintronics. Developing a fundamental understanding of how to control charge and spin transport through organic molecules is critical to the future of electronics, computers, and energy production. The use of organic materials and bio-inspired approaches to these problems offers the possibility of developing solutions that are not only versatile, but are cost effective and environmentally benign as well.    Modern pulsed magnetic resonance techniques provide an important means of manipulating spin systems for potential spintronics applications. Moreover, photo-excitation of organic molecules has been shown to control their properties in a wide variety of photonics applications.  Photo-excitation of organic molecules can be used to produce well-defined initial spin states. For example, photo-initiated electron transfer on a picosecond time scale from a donor molecule to acceptor molecule that are covalently-linked to enforce a specific distance and orientation results in formation of a spin-correlated radical pair (SCRP) in which the initial spin state is well defined and the two spins of the SCRP exist in an entangled coherent state. A greater fundamental understanding of the factors controlling spin dynamics in complex, yet versatile organic multi-spin systems is necessary before construction of spintronic devices based on them is feasible. The specific goals of this project are to investigate four questions that are important for understanding spin coherence in organic SCRPs and their potential for the development of organic spintronics:     Can the spin dynamics of SCRPs be manipulated to control spin polarization transport?   Can coherent spin states be transported over long distances using SCRPs?   Can spin coherence be transferred by optical excitation of a SCRP?   Can a SCRP be used to gate spin coherence transport between two radicals?   We have demonstrated that the spin dynamics of covalent SCRPs can be controlled using the influence of a third stable spin. Since organic SCRPs display coherent spin motion for tens of nanoseconds at room temperature and longer at low temperatures, it possible that this coherence can provide the basis for new organic information processing devices. We have also demonstrated that a SCRP state can be transported to a different location within a molecular array by applying short laser pulses. Another prerequisite for spintronic device fabrication is understanding how to make ordered arrays of the active molecules. We have demonstrated that anodic aluminum oxide membranes provide an inexpensive, effective way to orient the molecules at room temperature, yet maintain the desirable coherence properties of the photo-generated SCRPs. We have also developed and extensively explored more complex structures based on mechanically-interlocked molecules that may ultimately serve as platforms on which to build nanoscale devices from the "bottom up" where several photo-generated SCRPs interact to process quantum information.
