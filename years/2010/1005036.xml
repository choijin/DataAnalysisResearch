<AbstractNarration>This award supports the International REU site for Gravitational Physics hosted by the Physics Department at the University of Florida, Gainesville.   Detection of gravitational waves requires extremely sophisticated techniques in experiment and analysis; it also involves large facilities, significant manpower and international collaborations. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and NSF supported Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatories (LIGO) projects take advantage of a growing number of research-able faculty at small and minority colleges in support of their research efforts. At this REU site, undergraduate students will have an opportunity to establish contact with, experience the research environment of, and work beside, international collaborators involved in all aspects of gravitational wave detection. They will be encouraged to develop, on their own accord, ongoing projects with their international partners. Exposure to research will help cultivate their independence, while the experience in an international setting will furnish them with contacts within a global network, as they pursue their future research.   Research projects will take place at a variety of locations, including the Albert Einstein Institute, Hannover; APC, Paris; the National Astronomical Observatory, Tokyo; University of Glasgow; University of Birmingham; Cardiff University; University of Adelaide; Australian National University, Canberra; the University of Western Australia, Perth; and INFN laboratories, Italy - all in conjunction with the University of Florida.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the life of this grant, over eighty students were supported to travel to world renowned international laboratories working in Gravitational Wave Physics and related fileds.  Almost half of out particilants were female, and more than half of all students came form small schools with no PhD program.  Some of our students are the first in their families ever to attend college.  While less than a dozen were minorities, we have taken measures to improive this.  We now have a record number of laboratories participating.  During the course of this grant, we have added hosts in:  South Korea Korean Gravitational Wave Group (KGWG),   the Netherlands Nikef Gravitational Wave Group, Amsterdam,  Orsay LAL (Laboratoire de l'Accelerateur Lineaire), Orsay,  Melbourne University of Melbourne, Australia, and  Monash Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.  We presently offer over fifty projects each year in more than twenty host laboratories. Our students get exposure to astrophysics, computing, electronics, mechanical systems and optics (including lasers and squeezing). They develop maturity, experience the excitement of research and develop international networking.  Some even end up going to graduate school abroad.  Knowledge and expertize they gain is brought back to the US and awareness of their whole experience can (and does) excite others to follow.
