<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The objective of this CAREER award, co-funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), is to understand a recently developed non-aqueous layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of nanostructured thin films by studying the fundamentals of electrostatic interactions in non-polar media.  This work bridges the fundamental investigation of electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged materials at the single particle level to the prediction of the composition and structure of nanostructured LbL thin films based on the charge characteristics of individual nanoparticles. The nature and significance of electrostatic interactions in non-polar media at the single particle level will be studied using atomic force microscopy, which will also reveal how the surface potential and charge of oppositely charged particles change at small separations.  The thermodynamic nature of LbL assembly of oppositely charged materials in apolar solutions will also be investigated using isothermal titration calorimetry to uncover whether the nanoparticle assembly is an entropically or enthalpically driven process.  Knowledge from these studies will be combined and translated to quantitatively predict and understand the composition and structure of LbL thin films based on the charge characteristics of individual nanoparticles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Nanostructured thin films are thin layers composed of multiple materials such as nanoparticles and polymers, and possess distinctive combinations of properties that make them useful for advanced applications such as energy conversion and storage. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly, which involves the sequential deposition of oppositely charged species, provides a simple yet versatile method for the generation of functional nanostructured thin films; however, this technique, to date, has been primarily used with water-soluble materials. This practice places a major obstacle to generating functional nanostructured thin films for alternative energy applications, because a large number of useful and unique nanomaterials are synthesized and stable in non-aqueous non-polar solvents only.  The PI has recently successfully imparted surface charge to various nanomaterials in non-polar media and fabricated functional nanostructured thin films based on LbL assembly. The aim of this CAREER award is to understand the fundamental aspects of electrostatic interactions in non-polar solvents, which will further extend the new LbL technique for alternative energy applications. This CAREER award also integrates educational activities into the research plan with the goal of fully utilizing visual and hands-on aspects of layer-by-layer assembly to enrich the educational experiences of pre-college students and educators.  Under-represented minority and female undergraduate students will participate in "Research Abroad" program at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in Korea, which will provide them with opportunities to broaden their view of the world and develop scientific communication skills.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Nanostructured films composed of nanoparticles or nanoparticle-polymer mixtures exhibit unique functionality that make them useful for numerous advanced applications including energy storage and conversion, water purification, photonics and optics. Several challenges, however, impede their broad utilization in our daily lives. For example, many nanoparticles with useful functionality cannot be easily incorporated into films because their processing requirements are very stringent. Manufacturing nanocomposites with extremely high fractions of nanoparticles also presents a major challenge due to their poor processability. Moreover, poor mechanical reliability and durability of these nanostructured films limit their industrial and commercial applications, and methods of mechanical reinforcement typically require harsh conditions such as high temperature treatments. The goal of this project is to enable the incorporation of various nanoparticles into functional films, and to mechanically reinforce these structures without compromising their functionality. &nbsp;The specific objectives of this work include understanding charging behavior of nanoparticles in non-polar solvents, understanding the interactions between nanoparticles in such media, and exploring the methods for mechanically reinforcing nanoparticle-based films.&nbsp; We have successfully shown that nanoparticles in either water or organic solvents can be assembled into functional films by using small soap-like molecules to aid their processing.&nbsp; The soap-like molecules, also known as surfactants, impart or modulate the charge characteristics of nanoparticles, enabling a powerful processing technique known as layer-by-layer assembly to build functional nanoparticle films. &nbsp;We have shown that even a trace amount of water can drastically change the charging behavior of nanoparticles in non-polar solvents. We used atomic layer deposition (ALD) to enhance the mechanical properties of nanoparticle films at a relatively low temperature without drastically changing their original structure and functionality. We demonstrated that an extremely thin layer of ALD (less than 2 nm) can drastically enhance the damage tolerance of nanoparticle films. Our results demonstrated that the mechanical properties of ALD-reinforced nanoparticle films are dominantly affected by the mechanical properties of the ALD materials rather than by the compositional matching between ALD and nanoparticle materials.&nbsp; We also reported a versatile method for generating nanocomposite films with extremely high loadings of nanoparticles. Our method, called capillary rise infiltration (CaRI), consists of two simple steps: 1) preparing a two-layer film, consisting of a porous layer of nanoparticles and a layer of polymer and 2) annealing of the bilayer structure above the temperature that imparts mobility to the polymer. The second step leads to wicking of the polymer into the interstices of the nanoparticle layer, reminiscent of the capillary rise of simple fluid (e.g., water) into a narrow capillary or a packing of granules. Interestingly, we found that capillarity at the nanoscale significantly reduced the mobility of the polymer.&nbsp; Besides these efforts, we have also shown that multifunctional microcapsules can be prepared by inducing interfacial complexation between two oppositely charged polymers at the interface between oil and water.&nbsp; This nanoscale interfacial complexation in emulsions (NICE) method circumvents some of the major challenges presented by the conventional methods of functional microcapsule preparation.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project had significantly positive impacts on the technological developments and educational mission. The fundamental understanding on the processing and properties of nanoparticle films led to the development of robust photonic and anti-fogging/anti-reflection coatings, which were subsequently used to enhance the light harvesting properties of dye-sensitized solar cells and enhance their energy conversion efficiency. Supported by NSF-NIST Interaction in Basic and Applied Scientific Research Supplemental Award, the PI, in collaboration with Dr. Chris Stafford&rsquo;s group at NIST, developed nanoparticle-based membranes for water treatment. The PI&rsquo;s group also presented exhibits and demos showcasing &ldquo;All-in-One&rdquo; nanoparticle coatings at the Philly Materials Science and Engineering Day held at Drexel University between 2011 and 2014.&nbsp; This exhibit showed the multifunctionality of nanoparticle films by demonstrating anti-fogging and anti-reflection capabilities using hands-on demos. In collaboration with Nano/Bio Interface Center (NBIC) at the University of Pennsylvania, the PI&rsquo;s group played a major role in the development of an exhibit on &ldquo;Microfluidics and Nanofabrication&rdquo; in 2015 and 2016. Students from local high schools attended the event and participated in exhibits and demonstration. &nbsp;Overall, this project has enable the PI to supervise 19 undergraduate students including 5 female and 3 minority students as well as 1 high school student. A significant number of these students are currently pursuing advanced degrees in science and engineering. In addition, eight undergraduate students participated in Research Abroad program to perform summer research at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in Korea. The program provided the students with broadening their cultural and educational experience. The impacts of this program on the students&rsquo; technical skills and knowledge, and cultural experience were assessed by students&rsquo; reports, which were used to enhance the program&rsquo;s structure each year.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/27/2017<br>      Modified by: Daeyeon&nbsp;Lee</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055594/1055594_10072378_1493300609258_IMGL0007--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055594/1055594_10072378_1493300609258_IMGL0007--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2015 NanoDay@Penn"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055594/1055594_10072378_1493300609258_IMGL0007--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2015 NanoDay@Penn"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Science of Microfluidics Exhibit and Demo at the 2015 NanoDay@Penn</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daeyeon Lee</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daeyeon&nbsp;Lee</div> <div class="imageTitle">2015 NanoDay@Penn</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055594/1055594_10072378_1493300703972_IMGL0535--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055594/1055594_10072378_1493300703972_IMGL0535--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2014 Philly Materials Day"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055594/1055594_10072378_1493300703972_IMGL0535--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2014 Philly Materials Day"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">"All-in-One Coatings" demo and exhibit at the 2014 Philly Materials Day</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daeyeon Lee</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daeyeon&nbsp;Lee</div> <div class="imageTitle">2014 Philly Materials Day</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055594/1055594_10072378_1493300915575_IMG_3755--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055594/1055594_10072378_1493300915575_IMG_3755--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2013 Philadelphia Science Festival"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055594/1055594_10072378_1493300915575_IMG_3755--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2013 Philadelphia Science Festival"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">PI (Daeyeon Lee) presents a Science Cafe lecture titled "Bubbles, Beers and Beyond"</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andrew McGhie</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daeyeon&nbsp;Lee</div> <div class="imageTitle">2013 Philadelphia Science Festival</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055594/1055594_10072378_1493301028094_IMG_3279--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055594/1055594_10072378_1493301028094_IMG_3279--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2012 Philly Materials Day"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055594/1055594_10072378_1493301028094_IMG_3279--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2012 Philly Materials Day"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">"All-in-One Coatings" exhibit and demo at the 2012 Philly Materials Day</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daeyeon Lee</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daeyeon&nbsp;Lee</div> <div class="imageTitle">2012 Philly Materials Day</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
