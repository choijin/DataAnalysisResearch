<AbstractNarration>This Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will test the hypothesis that ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) can degrade wood.  This would resolve a contemporary debate among scientists and indicate that these fungi play a greater role in carbon cycling than previously thought.  This will be done by using a monoclonal antibody method to demonstrate that wood-degrading enzymes specifically produced by EMF do, in fact, bind woody components in soils.  The PIs will use a model system in which they will attempt to develop monoclonal antibodies to laccase, lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase from a model EMF, and then use them against the soils from lodgepole pines in Yellowstone National Park.  They predict that, in a controlled field experiment, enzyme binding of substrate will increase when photosynthetic capacity of the host tree is decreased. This experiemental approach entails considerable risk due to the difficulty associated inherent in the methodology and it's application to natural soil samples.  If this project is successful, it would lead to a reconsideration of the biology of this abundant and broadly distributed group of microorganisms, and the role that they play in forest ecosystem function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support a PI who is a member of an underrepresented group in science.  The research research will involve a partnership between California State University Dominguez Hills (a Hispanic-Serving institution), and NASA Ames Research Center and will include research training for one or more undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have several major outcomes from this funding.  First, we addressed a firmly held notion that top soil layers are dominated by wood rotting fungi, and that ECM hyphae are restricted to lower soil layers.  This belief is so firmly held that funding is often wittheld on this bases.  We tested this notion using molecular methdos in 4 forest stands at 2 stages of succession and found that this is not the case in Yellowstone soils.  Rather, exaclty the opposite is true.  Thus, the dominant paradgm needs to be tested on a case-by-case bass.  We also addressed the issue of whether not species complexity can buffer against environmental change in an ECM system.  We reduced photosynthetic capacity of only pine in a mixed pine/spruce system and as a control performed the same experiment i a pure pine system.  We found that the addition of a second, unrestricted tree species did in fact buffer agains the signfcant changes seen in ECM species diversity and switches in functional groups measured in the single tree system.  Finally we discovered a new type of endosymbiosis between an extremophile fungus and bacterial/archaeal endosymbionts. The fungus sequesters sulfur and in doing so creates an environment analagous to that of early Earth.  We discovered several new microbial lineages living within this environment that represent not only several new Bacterial phyla/Divisions, but also an apparent new Kingdom of microbes, sister to both Archaea and Bacteria.  This is a major new discovery that provides new insight into the origin of life on Earth.        Last Modified: 02/15/2014       Submitted by: Ken Cullings]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
