<AbstractNarration>The University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) proposes a second extension to the STARS (Students &amp; Technology in Academia, Research, and Service) Alliance. STARS is a  national community that uses regional partnerships to broaden the participation of women, under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities in computing.  Its signature and catalyzing program is the STARS Leadership Corps, which provides students with mentoring, professional development and opportunities for research and service, resulting in higher computing student diversity, enrollments, and graduation rates. The extension will scale the Alliance from its current size of 20 universities and colleges to 50, each the center of their own regional alliance of K-12 schools, community colleges, industries, and community organizations. The scaled alliance will focus on &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-  Institutionalizing the STARS Leadership Corps (SLC) as a multi-year curricular program that catalyzes regional partnerships through the tiered participation of students, professionals, and educators in research and civic engagement. &lt;br/&gt;-    Enhancing the STARS Celebration, a national forum to connect regional communities for collaboration on the SLC, STARS demonstration projects, and other BPC initiatives. &lt;br/&gt;-    Creating the STARS Social Network with pioneering technology to support a vibrant community of practice integrated with mobile games and CONNECT technology. &lt;br/&gt;-    Demonstrating a new Tiered Research Experiences for Undergraduates (TREU) program&lt;br/&gt;-    Scaling the STARS Mentoring and Pair Programming demonstration projects &lt;br/&gt;-    Creating an SLC Practices Collection within the BPC Digital Library at BPCPortal.org &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the extension will spawn the STARS Institute, a nonprofit that  will sustain the annual STARS Celebration and Community Meeting.</AbstractNarration>

STARS member colleges build regional partnerships as part of an inclusive national community of practice, with a shared focus on using computing to benefit society. STARS faculty support STARS students as they lead computer science service-learning activities, including near-peer outreach that introduces K-12 students to computing and within-department peer tutoring, mentoring and research collaborations.</p> <p>Since 2006, STARS has engaged over 2600 undergraduate students and 80 faculty at 53 academic institutions. STARS members have conducted outreach programs in elementary, middle, and high schools reaching over 140,000 students. STARS college student members benefit from their actions as change agents for an inclusive computing community; STARS student show significant academic gains, develop a strong sense of identity and community, and enhance their technical and professional skills. Faculty also benefit, reporting that STARS has helped to integrate actions for BPC into their careers by supporting and lending credibility to efforts to enhance recruiting and technical practices to broaden participation.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual merit</span></strong>: The STARS Alliance identified effective practices and demonstrated their applicability for BPC across a variety of national institutions. We contributed to the knowledge and assessment base for BPC efforts at institutional, regional, and national levels through disseminating over 480 publications, products, and tools. &nbsp;We determined the most important factors in building lasting relationships and infrastructures that support and sustain BPC practices, and established annual Celebration conferences. We have also demonstrated a model for building capacity for BPC research through our evaluation assistants program, which has trained over 150 undergraduate students in human subjects research and provided experiences in conducting BPC research and evaluation. A new peer-reviewed research publication venue, IEEE RESPECT, has been established by STARS faculty, that provides opportunities to evaluate and disseminate recommendations that affect BPC.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader impact</span></strong>: The principal outcome of this project was expected to be an increase in the enrollment in, and retention and graduation of, under-represented populations from post secondary information technology, computer science, and computing-related programs.&nbsp; STARS schools have retained 99% of its students in computing, and produced a disproportionately higher number of computing graduates. STARS Alliance schools have produced a significantly higher proportion of CS degrees since 2010 than across US higher education institutions. When comparing the bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees conferred from 2010-2016 (IPEDS currently available) in computer science degree programs, STARS institutions, which comprise only 2% of 4 year and higher institutions, produced 6% of the total degrees awarded.&nbsp; When comparing&nbsp;the bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees conferred in CS from 2010-2016 in HBCUs, STARS HBCU institutions comprise only 14% of all HBCU CS degrees, yet produced 26% of the total degrees awarded.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/31/2018<br>      Modified by: Jamie&nbsp;Payton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1042468/1042468_10063246_1522505242836_programs.Haiti3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1042468/1042468_10063246_1522505242836_programs.Haiti3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="STARS student leader teaches app development to middle school students in Haiti"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1042468/1042468_10063246_1522505242836_programs.Haiti3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="STARS student leader teaches app development to middle school students in Haiti"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">STARS student leaders traveled to Haiti during their spring break to install WiFi, distribute donated computers from One Laptop Per Child, and teach computing concepts to middle school students.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Osa Omokaro</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jamie&nbsp;Payton</div> <div class="imageTitle">STARS student leader teaches app development to middle school students in Haiti</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1042468/1042468_10063246_1522505889131_celebration2014-113-arduinoflower--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1042468/1042468_10063246_1522505889131_celebration2014-113-arduinoflower--rgov-800width.jpg" title="STARS students demonstrate their service learning projects at the STARS Celebration annual conference"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1042468/1042468_10063246_1522505889131_celebration2014-113-arduinoflower--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="STARS students demonstrate their service learning projects at the STARS Celebration annual conference"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The STARS Celebration  conference is designed to build capacity for student and faculty action to broaden participation in computing and to strengthen connections across our community.
