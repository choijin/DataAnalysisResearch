<AbstractNarration>Since 1963, the rates of commercialization of ideas by women and African Americans have lagged those of U.S. inventors. Although the gap has closed at the largest publicly-traded firms, it is still wide for broad commercialization activity and much wider for patent activity.  The research focuses identifying the sources of breaks in the progression from basic research to invention to commercialization of ideas. The analysis combines surveys of women scientists with unique new data on women and African American inventors to explain differential commercialization and patenting patterns. The analysis is enhanced by targeted interviews and site visits to firms and organizations, including in the government sector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This research extends the new and growing literature on the factors affecting knowledge creation and use. Little research is done on long-term commercialization patterns and on these groups and has never been systematically done on African Americans. A particularly novel contribution is the expansion and combination of data sets that can be used both to address the main research question and related questions, such as the long-term entrepreneurial and commercialization patterns of these groups and more generally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This research provides an important public good - additional data - to researchers and new analysis on groups that are underrepresented in the sciences and among patent-holders and entrepreneurs.  The results are integrated into the course material in the regular course of training graduate and undergraduate students, especially macroeconomics.  Researchers at museums and libraries have expressed interest in disseminating findings from this research through their educational programs related to science and invention.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Innovation is critical to economic growth and to rising living standards. Yet, the process of innovation remains poorly understood. The goal of this research is to examine the process of innovation from patent application to commercialization by assessing the inventive activity of PhD inventors over time.  The essential question is:  What are the determinants of participation at each stage of innovative activity?       Using data from three waves of the NSF Survey of Doctorate Recipients, the researchers create a panel of inventors from a sample of 91,255 PhD-holders in STEM fields between 2001 and 2008.  The evidence both corroborates and sheds light on the findings of Cook and Kongcharoen (2010), the first study to systematically evaluate the racial and gender gap in patent activity.  The current research finds that each stage of the innovation process is positively correlated with the field of engineering and firm size and negatively correlated with inventor research productivity.  Patent applications, patent grants, and commercialized patents are also negatively correlated or uncorrelated with being female or African American. Both studies find large gender and racial gaps in patent and commercialization activity.  The current research also investigates how inequality may enter at each stage of the process of innovation.     The broad, timely impact of the current research comes from at least two sources.  First, evidence presented by the researchers suggests substantial implications for economic activity.  They estimate that GDP per capita could be 0.88 percent to 4.6 percent higher with greater inclusion of women and African Americans in STEM fields.       Second, this research has been disseminated broadly and has contributed to a national dialogue on innovation and participation in STEM fields.  The research has been presented to groups of girls in the local community, entrepreneurs and inventors at fora organized by the US Patent and Trademark Office, graduate and undergraduate women studying STEM fields, members of the public at a public event at the Smithsonian Institution, and readers of an edited volume on innovation intended for wide distribution.
