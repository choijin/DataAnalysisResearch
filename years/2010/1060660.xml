<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An S-STEM Renewable Energy Scholarship program is initiated for talented students with demonstrated financial need to complete four year bachelor degrees in STEM disciplines at the University of Kansas (KU).  An interdisciplinary STEM faculty team is assembled to provide training in renewable energy and mentorship for professional development. The students are recruited from KU, Haskell Indian Nations University (Haskell), and Johnson County Community College (JCCC). The proposal objectives are three-fold. First, an aggressive plan is in place for recruitment of a group of 16-20 students each year (with at least half from Haskell and JCCC) in relevant STEM disciplines with a special emphasis on recruitment, training, and mentoring of students from underrepresented groups. Second, interactive teaching/mentoring is building strong personal interactions between the faculty mentors and their students who experience a diverse set of activities. These activities include cohort courses, video seminars, focused lectures (at all three campuses), field trips to local renewable energy facilities, and interdisciplinary research projects and energy related internships crafted specifically for STEM students. Third, a diverse spectrum of outreach activities utilizes and assists the recruited scholars, including visits to local high schools and colleges, participating in K-12 Nanotech workshops (through KU's Natural History Museum), and public dialogs organized through existing REU (undergraduate research) programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project was to develop of an interdisciplinary S-STEM faculty mentor network and through which to establish a highly integrated STEM education program for recruitment and support of STEM students of diversity.  The 6 core faculty members are: Judy Wu (PI, Physics, KU), Barbara Anthony-Twarog (Astronomy, KU), Cindy Berrie (Chemistry, KU), Val Smith (Biology, KU), Susan Stagg-Williams (Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, KU) and Lucas Miller (Math, Haskell).  This team has coordinated the following activities: (1) Mentoring and advising efforts to assist our scholars in progress towards their degrees, academic careers counselling, and other important issues such as personal time and fiscal management, have been performed continuously throughout the grant period.   These efforts have been accomplished through mentor-scholar meetings, individual discussions, interactions on our STEM Scholarship Facebook page, and e-mails; and (2) Engaging and advising our STEM scholars in undergraduate research to further broaden their knowledge and training in renewable energy, nanotechnology and in STEM related fields in general.
