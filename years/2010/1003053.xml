<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for participants in the conference "Frontiers in Nonlinear Waves," held at the University of Arizona on 26-29 March 2010.  The conference centers on:&lt;br/&gt;1. Soliton theory and applications&lt;br/&gt;2. Coherent structures and wave collapse&lt;br/&gt;3. Wave and hydrodynamic turbulence, atmosphere and ocean dynamics&lt;br/&gt;4. Pattern formation in materials, fluids, and biology&lt;br/&gt;5. Nonlinear optics, laser physics, and optical communications&lt;br/&gt;6. Waves in random media&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting features plenary lectures from twelve leaders in the field, and over thirty invited lectures by other leading researchers.  An afternoon session is scheduled for talks by young scientists, and there is an evening poster session for contributed papers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference brings together experts from a variety of fields in which methods of nonlinear wave theory are making important contributions.  The meeting will attract a diverse audience, expose junior researchers to state of the art research and to important future challenges, and establish connections between researchers working on singularity formation in different areas of applied mathematics.  Results of the meeting will be disseminated via publication and video recording.  The conference encourages and supports participation by members of groups under-represented in mathematics, junior researchers, and graduate students without other sources of support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  http://math.arizona.edu/~nrw/FNW_2010/</AbstractNarration>
