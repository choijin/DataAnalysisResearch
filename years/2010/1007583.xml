<AbstractNarration>This research is motivated by numerous real life problems whose modeling and analysis involve functional data, i.e., data where the measurements per subject/replicate correspond to values of a function (referred to as sample trajectory).  In particular, this research is motivated by functional clustering problems and functional data which are dynamical in nature. Functional principal components analysis (FPCA) has been widely used in analyzing functional data. In spite of its success, FPCA tends to be inefficient if the geometry of the trajectory space is non-Euclidean, especially when sample trajectories are only observed at sparse sets of time points, as is the case for many scientific studies. Sources for such nonlinearity include but not limited to the existence of underlying clusters of the sample trajectories, or the sample trajectories being governed by a nonlinear dynamical system. The investigator proposes a new strategy (referred to as the local FPCA framework) for analyzing sparsely and noisily observed functional data.  It aims to derive more efficient localized representations for sample trajectories which take into account geometric structures of the trajectory space. This framework combines the principles underlying functional principal components analysis with the notions of functional clustering and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Specific aims of this research include: (a) Develop a local FPCA framework which clusters the sample trajectories into homogeneous subgroups and applies FPCA within each cluster to derive more efficient representations of the sample trajectories. (b) Fit ordinary differential equation models with random parameters by a model-based local FPCA approach.  (c) Study theoretical aspects of the proposed methods and apply them to various scientific problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will produce a new set of statistical tools for scientists working in various fields such as plant biology, ecology and epidemiology who must analyze longitudinal/functional data. In particular, this research is a stepping stone toward understanding complex dynamical systems. The PI is collaborating with scientists on studying HIV disease dynamics at a population level, and this research helps achieving a better understanding of these systems which hold important implications in the pathologies of AIDS. The computational and analytical tools resulted from this research are also likely to stimulate further studies in related fields. Moreover, this research develops open source software that is freely available to the whole scientific community. Facing complex data and challenging questions, a new generation of researchers needs to be trained in an inter-disciplinary manner. The broader training component includes exposing statistics/biostatistics students to real scientific problems involving functional data.  On the other hand, through collaborations, scientists working in related fields are able to enhance their quantitative analysis skills.</AbstractNarration>
