<AbstractNarration>Geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS) is considered one of the most effective and promising mitigation strategies for increasing anthropogenic CO2. The proposed research will provide the underpinnings for understanding long-term sustainability of geologic CO2 sequestration strategies with a focus on nanoscale interfacial geochemical processes. Nanoscale reactions at fluid-mineral interfaces strongly influence the mechanisms and kinetics of important environmental processes, and these reactions can also be crucial in understanding processes in GCS systems. The proposed research plan will provide the basis for resolving discrepancies in reaction kinetics among data of different scales (from nanoscale to macroscale), and among laboratory and field site data in geologic CO2 injection systems. The proposed research will focus on acquiring new and more accurate information on reaction pathways and rates, including identification of critical nanoscale-mesoscale processes not previously detected, using a range of methods matched to the scale of reaction space in porous media: complementary aquatic geochemistry; the unique and powerful tools of in situ time-resolved synchrotron-based x-ray techniques and in situ flow-through atomic force microscopy. Although currently some data are available, the different scales of data for geologic CO2 injection systems have not been linked. Understandably, this creates confusion for policy makers, engineers, and local populations developing, working on, or living near CO2 sequestration sites. In establishing linkages between different scales, investigator will perform reactive transport modeling which will combine experimental and computationally-simulated data from multiple scales. Furthermore, by identifying geochemical reactions that facilitate self-fracture filling in CO2 storage, the proposed work will help us design new, secure, and sustainable CO2 sequestration. The findings will also improve academic and public understanding of climate change and geologic CO2 sequestration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating recruiting, training, and outreach programs, the research and education plans will reach a diverse audience and broaden the participation of underrepresented minority groups in environmental science and engineering. The project expands the infrastructure for research and education by developing, in collaboration with K-12 teachers, research-based educational kits for a ?lending library? and related teaching modules devoted to energy and environmental issues for local K-12 schools. It encourages direct involvement of high school and undergraduate students. The project will enhance graduate education by including international collaborative research activities through the McDonnell Academy Global Energy and Environment Partnership (MAGEEP) at Washington University. Finally, it will conduct outreach activities to increase public awareness of the energy-environment nexus and greenhouse mitigation strategies, including public lectures and hands-on demonstrations in collaboration with Washington University?s Tyson Living Learning Center.</AbstractNarration>

The project aimed at providing the underpinnings for understanding long-term sustainability of geologic CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration strategies, with a focus on nanoscale interfacial geochemical processes. Nanoscale reactions at fluid-mineral interfaces strongly influence the mechanisms and kinetics of important environmental processes, and these reactions can also be crucial in understanding processes in GCS systems. The project provides the basis for resolving discrepancies in reaction kinetics among data on different scales (from nanoscale to macroscale), and among laboratory and field site data in geologic CO<sub>2</sub> injection systems. This project focused on acquiring new and more accurate information on reaction pathways and rates, including identification of critical nanoscale-mesoscale processes not previously detected. It used a range of methods matched to the scale of the reaction space in porous media: complementary aquatic geochemistry, the unique and powerful tools of <em>in situ </em>time-resolved synchrotron-based x-ray techniques, and atomic force microscopy. The project integrated molecular-scale fluid chemistry and solid and interfacial chemistry with macroscale geophysical aspects, and it has provided clear quantitative and qualitative information on the reactive interplay of chemical reactions of caprocks, formation rocks, and wellbore cements with injected supercritical CO<sub>2 </sub>(scCO<sub>2</sub>) and brine. Furthermore, the PI&rsquo;s team has investigated the effects of important environmental factors&mdash;such as salinity,&nbsp;different cations in brine, temperature, the extent of water, and the presence of organic compounds and oxyanions&mdash;on the interactions of scCO<sub>2</sub>, water, and caprocks and formation rocks (or wellbore cement). One of the most striking new findings is that under GCS conditions nanoscale amorphous silica can form by the dissolution of clay minerals and subsequent precipitation after only 5 hours. The reactions can also accompany the formation of fibrous illite within only several hours of reaction, which can significantly increase flow-path tortuosity, extend deep into pores, and possibly cause a large permeability reduction for a given bulk volume. Although currently some data are available, the different scales of data for geologic CO<sub>2</sub> injection systems have not been linked. In establishing linkages between different scales, we utilized reactive transport modeling which combines experimental and computationally-simulated data from multiple scales.

The PI&rsquo;s team disseminated their research outcomes through 38 invited presentations and 39 contributed presentations at national and international conferences, universities, laboratories, and industries. Five doctoral dissertations will result from the project. Three dissertations have been published, and two will be completed by spring/summer 2017.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the years of this CAREER project, the PI successfully strengthened her main research expertise and established herself as a rising leader in geochemistry. The PI served as the lead guest editor of a Special Issue of <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em> (January 2013).
