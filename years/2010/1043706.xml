<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to investigate the impact of earth surface processes on the application of cosmogenic exposure dating in Antarctica by combining multi-nuclide techniques, detailed field experiments, rock-mechanic studies, and climate modeling. They will analyze cosmogenic-nuclide inventories for a suite of six alpine-moraine systems in inland regions of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. This area is ideally suited for this study because 1) the targeted alpine moraine sequences are critically important in helping to reconstruct past temperature and precipitation values over the last several million years, 2) the production rates for cosmogenic nuclides are typically high and well-known, and 3) the complexity of surface processes is relatively low. Their work has two specific goals: to evaluate the effects of episodic geomorphic events in modulating cosmogenic inventories in surface rocks in polar deserts and to generate an alpine glacier chronology that will serve as a robust record of regional climate variation over the last several million years. A key objective is to produce a unique sampling strategy that yields consistent exposure-age results by minimizing the effects of episodic geomorphic events that obfuscate cosmogenic-nuclide chronologies. They will link their moraine chronology with regional-scale atmospheric models developed by collaborators at University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This research is interdisciplinary and includes two early career scientists. Results of this work will be used to enhance undergraduate education by engaging two female students in Antarctic field and summer research projects. Extended outreach includes development of virtual Antarctic field trips for Colgate University?s Ho Tung Visualization Laboratory and Boston University?s Antarctic Digital Image Analyses Laboratory. The PIs will continue to work with the Los Angeles Valley Community College, which serves students of mostly Hispanic origin as part of the PolarTREC program. This project will contribute to the collaboration between LDEO and several New York City public high schools within the Lamont-Doherty Secondary School Field Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The detachment of thin flakes from exposed rock surfaces, or spallation, is a common erosional process occurring across a range of rock types and climatic settings. Understanding the precise mechanisms responsible for spalling helps characterize rates of long-term erosion and landscape evolution, assists in the development of process models that help interpret measurements of cosmogenic-nuclides for dating and geomorphic-process studies, and documents the potential for ongoing degradation of building stones, monuments, and rock walls exhibiting prehistoric art.  The primary mechanisms responsible for the natural formation and detachment of surface flakes varies according to local conditions, and includes oscillations among temperature, moisture availability, and salinity, as well as variations in the target rock mineralogy and texture.  In high porosity rocks where water can easily penetrate the surface, spalling may be caused by the hydration of near-surface clays or salts. Alternatively, rock flakes can be produced through the actions of biological weathering or by the application of high thermal gradients to dry rock surfaces. In hyper-arid, polar deserts, such as ice-free regions in Antarctica, the detachment of surface flakes from locally sourced rocks has been hypothesized to be, at least partially, the work of thermal stress weathering, but to date no targeted studies into this process have been conducted. The process is important in extremely dry areas, where it may be the dominant form of denudation and long-term landscape evolution.  In this study, we examined the role of thermal stress weathering in the spalling of rock surfaces in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) of Antarctica, an area where the availability of liquid water is limited, and ambient air temperatures rarely exceed 0&deg;C. Although relatively thin and small in size, the detachment of millimeter-scale, spalled flakes represents one of the most aggressive forms of physical weathering in this extremely dry and cold environment &ndash; one envisaged as an excellent terrestrial analog for Mars.  Field measurements show that flaking may contribute ~ 9 cm/Myr of surface erosion, which is 60% of the total erosion rate currently assumed in Mullins Valley.  If correct, this finding corroborates the notion that in hyper-arid, cold-desert climates, thermal fatigue may be one of the most effective denudational agents in physical weathering.  The process is self-limiting, however, because surface flakes add to the surrounding sediment package and cover portions of the rock, creating a negative feedback that promotes self-burial and increasingly shields the remaining intact rock from further thermal variation.  The work highlights the importance of thermal fatigue on rock weathering, and has implications for the interpretation of cosmogenic-nuclide inventories and chronologies for surface-rock exposure in Antarctica and landscape evolution on Mars. One student earned her PhD conducting this research.          Last Modified: 10/27/2015       Submitted by: David R Marchant]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
