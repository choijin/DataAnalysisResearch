<AbstractNarration>The PIs are working on developing and evaluating a data-driven three-phase adaptive, sparse multicore data mining framework for scalable and efficient supervised classification and statistical analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase-I seeks to characterize data attributes in terms of sparsity, graph-theoretic structure and geometric and numeric measures toward data transformations with a focus on dimensionality reduction. The goal is to explore the trade-offs between quality of solution (accuracy and precision of classification) and total work (sequential computational costs) toward faster, yet improved methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase-II operates on the transformed data to increase the degree of fine to coarse grained concurrency while restructuring the data for enhanced reuse and locality of access. This phase provides a weighted annotated graph model of the computations indicating dependencies, data sharing measures and computational costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase-III utilizes this model to formulate and explore architecture-aware mappings of data mining computations to the multicore processors, including cache and bandwidth aware thread-to-core mappings that consider both performance and power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs thus seek adaptations to utilize data set attributes, including approximations and concurrency of computations latent in the sparsity structure, toward improved utilization of processor and memory hardware on current and future multicores with larger core counts, complex cache hierarchies and off-chip bandwidth constraints.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the emergence of multiple processing units (called "cores") on a processor, it has become increasingly important to advance information technologies for harnessing such hardware to  process large volumes of data. In fact, many data-intensive applications can potentially achieve impressive speedups by exploiting these multiple processing units and on-chip data storage capabilities. However, achieving this potential in practice has been proven to be very challenging.  Motivated by these observations, this research project developed several techniques with the goal of improving the performance and energy consumption of "kernels" which represent key sets of calculations that are essential for widely-used data-intensive applications such as clustering, classification and graph mining schemes. More specifically, this project optimized the performance of such kernels on emerging parallel architectures with deep memory/storage hierarchies. The  main contributions are new data  mapping and task scheduling schemes that sought to deliver high performance by  exploiting both (i) the properties of the data including sparsity, high dimensionality, irregular access pattern,  and (ii) the properties of multiple core processors including  network topology, non-uniform memory architectures, bandwidth constraints, and variable latencies of data access.     The detailed experimental evaluations of the new optimization techniques demonstrated by tuning several features of the architecture and algorithms one can take full advantage of emerging parallel architectures. In particular, it is possible, in some cases, to achieve a factor of 20 performance improvement on a 32-core parallel computing system. Further, the results from this project identify new and promising directions for the performance engineering of computing systems so that increasingly higher fractions of the ideal execution rates of the raw hardware can be delivered to end-user applications.  The project trained 6 graduate students and 1 post-doctoral researcher at the Pennsylvania State University. Three graduate students and the post-doctoral researcher are employed in industry. One graduate student is employed as tenure-track assistant professor in a US university while a second is employed as a post-doctoral researcher at a US university.

For several decades, performance gains to end-user applications from successive generations of general purpose computing hardware were naturally realized through CPU frequency-scaling.
