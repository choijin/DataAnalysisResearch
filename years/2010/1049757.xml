<AbstractNarration>The Gulf of Mexico oil leak has the potential to cause lasting harm to the plant populations along the Gulf coastline. To better understand those effects, and to discover the genetic bases for stress responses, this project will produce a detailed, genetic map of Louisiana Irises and their hybrids. The work will incorporate sampling of previously identified coastal populations from Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana and populations north of the Gulf in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya watersheds. In addtion, the project will use previously constructed hybrid populations that will be transplanted into contaminated and uncontaminated sites. Using previously identified genetic markers, the project will then identify possible genes that are involved in stress responses. This project has the potential to contribute to plant restoration projects that will be necessary following the cleanup of this ecological catastrophe. In addition, it will provide  training for a postdoctoral scholar.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Detailed, field analyses were carried out in areas designated by BP and the United States government as sites most likely to be seriously and immediately impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (i.e. the Breton Sound area of coastal Louisiana.  Serious, longterm affects are now coming to light, and sadly, this region is still likely to be an area of major impact.  Our studies using reciprocal transplants and genetic analyses of the native Louisiana Irises, Iris fulva, I. hexagona, I. brevicaulis and their hybrids incorporated three genetic mapping populations (two I. fulva x I. brevicaulis first generation backcross populations and one I. fulva x I. hexagona F2 population, already constructed for ongoing studies) for reciprocal transplants.  We have ongoing monitoring of the transplants, and we have now produced detailed, comparative genetic maps by applying the newest chip-based genotyping technologies to the experimental hybrid populations as well as &gt;450 individual plants from a natural hybrid zone.  These studies have resulted in 1) the identification of genomic regions that have been preferentially incorporated between the species that help the recipient plants to survive in various habitats and 2) provided the basis for further analyses of the effects of ecological perturbations from both man-made catastrophes such as the Deepwater Horizon spill as well as the worldwide effect of climate change.     Broader Impacts  This project provided important training for Postdoctoral Fellow, Dr. Amanda Brothers at the University of Georgia. Specifically, funding provided a six-month salary for Dr. brothers, during which time she was trained in the production and analysis of genomic data, and also helped establish each of the transplantation fieldsites.  The experiments carried out also formed the basis for an ongoing restoration project in an area near Labadieville, Louisiana.
