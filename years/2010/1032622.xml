<AbstractNarration>The Web10Gig Project enables ordinary users, from the broadest range of fields and technical abilities, to effectively use the network to its full capacity.  The research associated with the Web10Gig project builds upon the very successful Web100 project, whose prototype software is still heavily used six years beyond the end of the project funding.  Under Web10Gig, the investigators produce a produce a production quality implementation of standard TCP instrumentation, based on the existing Web100 prototype, and groom it for inclusion in the Linux main line.  It eliminates barriers to development associated with the original Web100 software suite, addresses a number of weaknesses in the Web100 prototype implementation and migrates the non-kernel code to a public open source code development site where anyone can contribute future additions and improvements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Web10 Gig code propagates out to all Linux users it enables network measurement and diagnosis underneath all types of Internet applications.  Like the autotuning software developed before it, it will be replicated in other operating systems, such that everybody, Linux user or not will reap to the benefits of having standard TCP instrumentation. Once incorporated into the Linux main line, the TCP instrumentation passes beyond the control of the Web10Gig investigators where maintained by the commercial world through production implementations and the researchers and developers actually using the code.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Web10G project adds a family of performance statistics to the implementation of the network protocol TCP, thereby allowing diagnosis of performance problems both in the network and in networked applications.  The statistics in question have been previously defined in the standards track document RFC 4898. The Web10G project has instrumented these statistics in the network code of the Linux operating system, implemented communication of this data from the system internals to the system user, and provided a software library and tools for the Linux developer.  These results can significantly impact network research and engineering, and the deployment of the results have led to early collaboration with researchers and developers of network monitoring tools.  The project outcomes comprise: modifications to existing code (the Linux kernel); loadable additions to the Linux kernel (kernel module); user library (API) and examples using the library to read and set the network statistics.  Testing done internally and by third parties have shown the code extensions to be conservative in added overhead to the running systems and complete in providing the defined statistics.  Availability of all source code through the Web10G website, and planned adoption by projects relying on the earlier Web100 code, allow for sustainability of the outcomes following project completion.
