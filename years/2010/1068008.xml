<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Christopher Carone, Joshua Erlich, and Marc Sher at the College of William and Mary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Standard Model of particle physics was developed 35 years ago, and has survived numerous experimental tests.  Nonetheless, many aspects of the Standard Model remain mysterious:  What is the origin of the masses of the known elementary particles?  What accounts for the hierarchical structure of their mass spectrum?   Why is the gravitational force so much weaker than the electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear forces?  What is the mysterious dark matter that seems to be pervasive in our universe?   Professors Carone, Erlich, and Sher aim to address these and related questions by considering possible physics beyond the Standard Model,  including new particles (for example, their proposed work on extended Higgs sectors), new symmetries (for example, their proposed work on models of neutrino masses), and new structures of space-time (for example, their proposed work on higher-dimensional models and holography).    It is exciting that much of the work proposed by these principal investigators might be tested at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  The LHC, which is the highest energy proton-proton collider in the world, has begun full operations. Data from the LHC is imminent and is likely to lead to nothing less than a new Standard Model for the next generation of particle physicists, i.e., a new theoretical picture of the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions.  In addition, the PIs have proposed work on dark matter, mysterious particles that will be studied not only at the LHC, but also at numerous direct detection experiments around the world.  The PIs will consider possible models of a "dark sector", which may involve fairly light particles with very weak couplings to matter.  To study such a sector experimentally, one requires high-intensity particle beams at low energies, and the PIs will consider how these models may be explored using the high-luminosity electron beam at Jefferson Lab. This effort may lead to new connections between the nuclear and high-energy physics communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  Professors Carone, Erlich, and Sher will involve graduate students and a postdoc in their research, providing critical training to junior physicists who are beginning research in this field.  The postdoc will be jointly funded with Jefferson Lab, and will facilitate a synergy between two different disciplines in physics.  The PIs also intend to give public lectures on their research results and involve undergraduate students in their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the past three years, this project has addressed some of the major issues in particle physics and cosmology.  Following the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron collider, this project uncovered some novel scenarios in which more than one Higgs doublet field could be responsible for the masses of the fundamental particles.  This included the possibility that the Higgs boson discovered at the Large Hadron Collider is the heavier of more than one Higgs boson and the that the observed Higgs boson is partly composite, i.e., not a fundamental particle at all.  Myriad cosmological observations indicate that the universe is filled with dark matter and dark energy, which are likely to have very different  properties and interactions than known particles. This project considered various scenarios for new dark sectors that could be responsible for the observations of an anomalous excess of cosmic ray positrons near Earth.  This included the possibility that new classical symmetries that are violated quantum mechanically could explain why dark matter might decay preferentially to positrons and have a sufficiently long lifetime to explain the data.  The project also explored the possibility that dark matter is related to symmetries that associate the three generations of matter with one another. This project also considered potential experimental signatures of other dark sectors not related to the excess positrons addressed by the previous models.  Motivated by the prospect of discovering the effects of gravitational waves produced during the first inflationary instant of the universe, this project discovered new models that demonstrate how one can consistently formulate inflationary scenarios that produce large enough power in gravitational waves to be detectable in curent experiments.  This project also considered novel explanations for why the Higgs boson is much lighter than the value one would expect based on standard quantum field theoretic calculations. These scenarios include the possibility of Lee-Wick type particles (particles with an unusual form of their kinetic energy) supplementing the particles of the standard model, and the possibility that a classical symmetry known as conformal invariance is manifested at high energies.  This project also considered new ways that model-building tools motivated by string theory (the AdS/CFT correspondence) could be used to derive properties of strongly interacting particles in unusual environments (e.g. inside neutron stars) and in condensed matter systems (e.g. high-temperature superconductors).  This project involved both undergraduate and graduate students in addition to a postdoctoral researcher, and the work produced in this project has been published in major physics journals. Due to his expertise on the subject, one of the researchers on this project (Marc Sher) was frequently interviewed by news outlets following the discovery of the Higgs boson by the Large Hadron Collider. All of the senior researchers on this project gave presentations about particle physics for the purpose of outreach, and two have been involved with the QuarkNet program, which works with high school teachers and students to bring particle physics into the classroom.
