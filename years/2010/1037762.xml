<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will study the impact of a unique educational model on the engagement and retention of veteran students in their first year of engineering study. The model centers around the creation of a veteran engineer's Learning Community and establishing active learning pedagogies for students who are veterans.  The project seeks to understand how each of these interventions impacts learning outcomes, retention, and transition of veterans from two year college to other programs or careers.  The model proposed may be widely transferable to other schools who also seek to target veterans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project are to inform other colleges about effective interventions for veterans.  The proposed program seeks to create balanced, long-term, incremental improvements.  The program specifically targets outreach efforts towards low income, first generation students, Native Americans, rural veterans.</AbstractNarration>

The intent of this course is to increase students&rsquo; exposure to practical hands-on exercises in the early part of their postsecondary engineering studies. Research has demonstrated that integration of the more practical elements of engineering early in students&rsquo; careers can be effective in increasing student engagement and retention in the field.

The project-based curriculum resembles courses offered in many high schools, colleges and universities throughout the country. However, this course takes a unique approach by focusing more on the development of project-oriented communication and soft-skills than on the end products of the projects themselves. And thereby meets general education requirements in communications.Further, the rules and regulations and course culture described in this handbook aim to emphasize the training of specific &ldquo;soft skills&rdquo; often identified by private-sector organizations as a consistent void in their entry-level employees. Specifically, this course incorporates lessons focused on creativity, cooperation, discipline, attitude, order and determination.This handbook is designed to provide faculty, unfamiliar with the course and regardless of previous experience, a step-by-step guide to implementation of a projects-based course. The breadth of exercises included in this handbook allows a faculty member to pick and choose projects best suited to the skill base of their students while emphasizing a common skillset based on specific learning objectives. The course design and materials are intended to support a three credit course that is a semester in length.In the end, this handbook is intended to be a tool to aid in teaching a fun, team-oriented, hands-on engineering and manufacturing course that emphasizes workplace soft skills and communication. We hope you find it useful.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/25/2014<br>      Modified by: Lynn&nbsp;Farris</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
