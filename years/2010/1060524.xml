<AbstractNarration>Juniata College, a highly regarded liberal arts college in Pennsylvania, is using its S-STEM award to make it possible for community college transfer students to attend Juniata for their last two years of college while studying for STEM majors.  Cost and admissions requirements make such transfers rare, but with the assistance of S-STEM scholarships and through active recruiting at local community colleges, with which Juniata has transfer agreements, the PI and his team identify high achieving STEM students inviting them to apply for scholarships as they apply for admission.  The presence of such students representing a diversity of backgrounds and ethnicities enhances the education of all students.  A wealth of support systems and mentoring ensures that the Scholars are included in the campus community, while co-curricular events, some specifically for the Scholars, help to retain them in their STEM major preparing them for scientific careers.  In the summer between the junior and senior year, Scholars participate in the Summer Undergraduate Research Program, a key feature of most programs showing success in STEM recruitment and retention.  Over the five years of the grant, about 24 students will become Scholars in four cohorts of 6 students each.  In addition to preparing these students for STEM careers, the experiences of the challenges and opportunities of working with community college transfer students will inform aspects of advising and pedagogy that can be widely shared.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Juniata College?s S-STEM project was a five-year  (plus an one-year no-cost extension) NSF DUE project with the goal of providing academically outstanding transfer students with demonstrated financial need who show the potential for, and interest in pursuing graduate study in a STEM discipline, scholarships of $10,000 per year for two years towards the completion of a B.S. degree.  In 2014, the program was expanded to include financially at-risk students who were already at Juniata when there was not a pool of qualified transfer students.  A center piece of the project was to offer each of these students individual mentorship through a paid summer research experience in the summer between their junior and senior years (and extended support throughout the years).  Each of these students had significant decrease in the need to bypass research and other academic pursuits due to reduced financial demands on them due to the scholarships and the paid internships.  This allowed them to engage fully in the research and mentor/mentee relationship and bypass the urge to get high-hour part-time jobs while in school and avoiding the need for unrelated-highly paid summer employment.  We credit the research experience, the financial support, and the individualized mentorship for resulting in outstanding retention rates in the STEM fields, graduation rate, and admission to graduate programs.    The overall retention rate at Juniata College for students completing any major is 76% and 72% for students completing a degree in a STEM discipline; further, within the institution, 72% of those transferring from a two-year college and 77% of those transferring from a four-year college are retained.  Seventeen S-STEM scholars have graduated, one student transferred from Juniata to another institution leaving the S-STEM program, and  two students are on track to graduate within the year, resulting in an overall retention rate of 95%.  Of the seventeen students who have graduated, ten are pursuing graduate school in either STEM, medical, or medical research fields in the fall after graduation.    In addition to strong placement into graduate school, while pursuing their undergraduate research projects, the nineteen successful S-STEM students collectively authored or co-authored 33 research presentations at regional or national conferences, and so far there is one published paper and a second in review in a scientific journals.  In addition, all of the S-STEM students presented in the annual Liberal Arts Symposium held at Juniata College each spring.  Juniata College?s Enrollment Office had made the recruitment of transfer students a priority, and with College support, the number of inquiries and transferred almost doubled across the College, including in STEM fields.  However, efforts made at the college level as well as the extra financial support provided within the S-STEM program suggest that the assumptions about why students attend community colleges are not broadly valid, including the assumption that tuition cost is a primary limiting factor.  Many students appear to choose community college because it offers the benefit of education while remaining near family and other social supports.  Asking such students to matriculate to a primary residential institution in a rural community identified unforeseen hidden concerns.  While community-college transfers into the S-STEM noted the value of the educational opportunities and all such students remarked of the horizon-opening experiences through research and individualized mentorship, a portion of these students needed substantially more social support than anticipated.  This is an important finding for small, private, liberal-arts institutions attempting to recruit and retain academically strong community college students.  Thus, while the S-STEM program did not achieve the original goal of significantly increasing the number of transfer students pursuing STEM majors at Juniata, this project has revealed that the goal of increasing access of community college students to four-year institutions like Juniata is multi-faceted and in need of further study.
