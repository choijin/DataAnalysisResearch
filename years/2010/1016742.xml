<AbstractNarration>Although theoretical results predict that significant gains can be&lt;br/&gt;achieved from node cooperation, current wireless systems are exclusively&lt;br/&gt;built on point-to-point communication, where transmissions are separated&lt;br/&gt;in time, frequency, or space. Before cooperative techniques can be&lt;br/&gt;implemented, two key questions need to be addressed: How do they perform&lt;br/&gt;in the context of a larger network, and how do they perform in actual&lt;br/&gt;experiments?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at providing answers to both these questions by&lt;br/&gt;combining theory and experimental work. On the theory side, the&lt;br/&gt;investigators use a rigorous analytic approach that combines tools from&lt;br/&gt;stochastic geometry and information theory. The stochastic geometry&lt;br/&gt;approach permits statements about ensembles of networks, rather than&lt;br/&gt;just a single fixed network geometry, which is often more tractable and&lt;br/&gt;leads to more general results. On the experimental side, performance&lt;br/&gt;measurements are taken on small cooperative networks of software&lt;br/&gt;radio devices. They are used to derive analytical models that can be&lt;br/&gt;used at higher layers in the protocol stack and to determine the overhead&lt;br/&gt;and control traffic required to set up the cooperation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the insight gained from both theory and experiments, novel&lt;br/&gt;cooperative protocols for wireless networks are derived.&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the project will enable significant improvements in the&lt;br/&gt;performance of wireless systems, thereby helping to overcome the&lt;br/&gt;spectrum scarcity. The results are be disseminated in form of conference&lt;br/&gt;and journal articles, tutorials, and short courses, and some ideas will&lt;br/&gt;hopefully lead to patents.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Background. In the last decade, it has been established that in theory, cooperative wireless communication schemes can significantly outperform traditional point-to-point communications. In most cases, however, these studies were restricted to the physical layer, and it was not clear if larger wireless networks still derive benefit from cooperation if interference, channel access, routing, traffic burstiness, and overhead and control traffic are considered.   Intellectual merit. This project addressed this question from both a theoretical and practical point of view. The theoretical techniques were based on stochastic geometry, which has proven to be a powerful tool to determine the  performance of large wireless networks with random node placement. The existing theory, largely restricted to point-to-point networks, was extended in this project to cooperative networks and applied to their analysis and design. The theory was complemented by experiments on small networks of software-radio devices. A particular focus was on broadcasting with superposition coding and a novel virtual full-duplexing scheme called rapid on-off division duplex (RODD).  A key outcome of the work is that interference significantly deteriorates the performance of cooperative systems. In some cases, the increased interference due to the larger number of concurrent transmitters in cooperative networks completely erases the gain from node cooperation, even if the overhead associated with cooperation is ignored. As a result, care is needed to properly evaluate network architectures that involve joint transmission, relaying, full duplexing, and multi-packet reception. On the other hand, successive interference cancellation is a powerful technique that allows for an increased transmitter density (or transmit power) without a negative effect on the overall interference. In the context of receivers of broadcasting schemes using superposition coding, it has been demonstrated in this project that successive interference is not only theoretically promising but yields gains that can be experimentally validated. A critical issue related to interference that is often neglected is the spatio-temporal correlation structure of the interference. It is often assumed that two spatially separated receivers of a transmission observe independent interference, or that two transmissions of the same message will be subject to independent interference at the receiver. This is not the case since the interference stems from a common set of potential transmitters in both cases, thus the interference is both spatially and temporally correlated. This correlation results in a significant loss in diversity; in some cases, it erases the diversity gain completely, even if transmissions occur over independently fading channels. An important result in this context is that joint transmission of multiple base stations in a cellular network does not provide diversity gain, unless channel state information is available at the base stations. This insight has significant consequences on the design of interference-limited wireless networks.   Impact. Through the combined theoretical and experimental efforts, this project has shed new light on the design of wireless networks. In contrast to the many earlier studies that claimed without qualification that cooperation greatly enhances wireless network performance, the results show that in a fair comparison, when network-wide interference is considered, cooperation may or may not be helpful. To come to that conclusion, novel analytical techniques were developed, mostly based on stochastic geometry, in combination with information and queueing theory. In terms of network modeling, new point process models were proposed for the node locations, since in cooperative networks, independence between concurrent transmitters, as implied by the ubiquitous Poisson point process model, no longer holds.
