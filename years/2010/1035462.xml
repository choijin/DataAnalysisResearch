<AbstractNarration>During this five year project, The University of Texas at Tyler (UT Tyler) is providing scholarships to 31 students majoring in mathematics, biology, chemistry, or computer science.  Students are being supported during their junior and senior years of undergraduate study and will be prepared not only as strong mathematicians and scientists, but also as highly qualified secondary teachers able to meet the specialized needs of students in rural districts in East Texas. A particular strength of the UT Tyler teacher preparation program is its emphasis on training teacher candidates to effectively employ active-learning pedagogies.  UT Tyler is partnering with Tyler Independent School District (ISD) to provide field placements for undergraduate teacher candidates. Through its Ingenuity Center, UT Tyler is also working with Tyler ISD and other districts to provide mentoring for beginning teachers.  The project is supporting novice teachers for five full years, gradually moving them from the role of mentee to mentor.  Support includes helping novice teachers utilize professional learning community environments, mentoring of novice teachers by master teachers and university faculty, and preparation of novice teachers for leadership roles in their schools.  Each year, the project is also supporting 10-week summer internship experiences for five or six lower division undergraduates who will work with STEM teacher professional development programs and STEM outreach activities with K-12 students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is helping to address the need for highly qualified science and mathematics teachers in rural districts across East Texas, many of which have large proportions of their students from families whose incomes are below the poverty line.  In addition, this project is developing best practices both for preparing teachers to teach in high need rural areas, and for assisting novice teachers in developing skills to assume leadership positions in their schools and professional communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Texas at Tyler supported 46 preservice teachers during their professional certification sequence at the junior and senior level over the five years of the grant through NSF Robert Noyce Phase I funds.  This included 21 additional preservice teachers above the 25 preservice teachers that funds were requested for in the proposal.   Funds also supported summer stipends for 5 students per year for working with STEM teacher professional development programs and STEM outreach activities with K-12 students in both formal and informal settings.  These funds acted as a recruitment tool for students into the Noyce Phase I program.  The project outcomes and findings were: 1. Certified 46 preservice STEM teachers over the course of five years who 1. had knowledge and skills appropriate to teach STEM fields using best practices, 2. experienced teaching students who had high needs during field placements in high need school districts, and 3. were employed in high needs school districs for at least four years. 2. Provided support to the 46 novice teachers during their first five years of teaching by 1. utilizing professional learning community environments, 2. facilitating teacher and faculty mentors for them through the network, and 3. preparing them for leadership roles through professional development networks. 3. Recruited additional preservice STEM teachers through summer experiences with STEM education which provided stipend support.  Broader Impacts.  Locally, the result of the project increased the number of certified STEM teachers in Tyler and other areas of East Texas.  More importantly, because of the unique interrelationships The University of Texas at Tyler has with impoverished schools, rural schools and East Texas STEM Academies, it can serve as a national model for preparation of STEM teachers prepared to teach students living in poverty and in rural settings.  In addition, the research discussed below provided a knowledge base describing the growth of preservice STEM education students from college students through novice teacher to experienced teacher and leader in STEM education.  Intellectual Merit.  The preservice STEM teachers participated in research-based preparation for teaching and were part of an ongoing research about teacher preparation.  Data related to the ongoing changes as the preservice teachers became novice inservice teachers and grew into becoming teacher leaders were collected to answer the following questions:  1) What is the impact of the support systems developed by The University of Texas at Tyler to enhance the teacher preparation experience of Noyce Scholars? and 2) What is the impact of participation as a Noyce Scholar on novice's teaching and on the schools where they work?  Observations, interviews, and surveys were used as data sources to answer the questions.       Last Modified: 12/12/2015       Submitted by: Fredericka D Brown]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
