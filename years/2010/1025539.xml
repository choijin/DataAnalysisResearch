<AbstractNarration>Over the past two decades the geosciences have acquired a wealth of new and high quality data from new and greatly improved observing systems. Because this volume of data poses a major challenge for traditional analysis methods, only a fraction of their potential has yet been exploited. Similarly, results of many advanced numerical simulations of earth processes are only partially analyzed.  Hence neither the data nor the modeling are being used to their full potential, leaving crucial questions unresolved. This situation arises in a wide range of areas including earthquake and volcano dynamics, earth structure and geodynamics, climate and weather, and planetary science. Addressing this situation calls for the application of mathematical methods not currently used, which requires a deeper and long-term dialogue and interaction between the mathematical and geoscience communities. To this end, the PIs propose to host a three-day workshop to study the feasibility of establishing a semi-virtual institute in Chicago to facilitate a fruitful interaction between a broad and geographically distributed group of mathematicians and geoscientists. Its goal would be for earth scientists and mathematicians to identify and explore jointly crucial unsolved problems amenable to mathematical approaches not currently used. This seems feasible if both groups develop a long-term relationship giving each reasonable sophistication with the other's language, problems, and techniques. They will explore various means of accomplishing these goals including the use of modern web technology, which can be brought to bear for broadcasting lectures to both communities, holding virtual mini-meetings, and research interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems the team seeks to advance understanding of have enormous societal impact in the areas of natural hazard forecasting and mitigation and energy resources. The communication and collaboration will expose undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from both disciplines to new ideas and develop young earth scientists and mathematicians with deeper and broader training for interdisciplinary studies than current programs.</AbstractNarration>
