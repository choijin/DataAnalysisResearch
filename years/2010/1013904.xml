<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will evaluate the feasibility of producing bio-based, environmentally benign, products for the prevention and treatment of corrosion and scale from low-value agricultural by-product streams. These by-products are generally available in large quantities and fairly uniform composition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be introduction of a line of relatively high value biodegradable corrosion and scale inhibitors that make use of agricultural by-products that are currently used in low-value applications.  These products will also provide environmental benefits to both producers and users due to the use of renewable feed stocks and the environmentally benign nature of the materials.</AbstractNarration>
