<AbstractNarration>How populations change genetically and adapt to environmental conditions is a fundamental issue in evolutionary biology, plant and animal breeding, and disease.  Such genetic changes occur on two time scales. In the short term, selection acts on existing genetic variation. On longer time scales, adaptation requires the input and selection of new mutations.  New genome-sequencing technologies make it possible to observe directly the genome-wide genetic changes that occur during response to novel environmental conditions. The project will study the genetic basis of adaptation during selection for invasive growth, a trait that is an important aspect of fungal virulence, in populations of the model microbe Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). New technologies for sequencing and analyzing genomes will be used to identify loci that contribute to variation for invasive growth, to study changes in allele frequencies, and to identify novel mutations that occur during selection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide new information about how genome-wide genetic composition both influences and is influenced by evolution in controlled, reproducible experiments that focus on a fungal trait that is ecologically important and related to emergence of pathogenicity. This project will furnish an excellent case study for public education on evolution, the interactions between random and predictable processes in evolution, and the direct relevance of evolution to human health.  Research and outreach activities will provide interdisciplinary and quantitative training opportunities in laboratory experimentation, population genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics for graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Strains of budding yeast vary widely in their ability to penetrate agar when grown in Petri plates in response to starvation for nitrogen.  This response is typical of yeast species that are pathogens, and of strains of budding yeast that can become pathogens of patients with weakened immune systems.  The goals of this project were to identify the genes that contribute to variation among strains in invasive growth, and to identify the genetic changes that result from selecting for better invasive growth, by washing off cells that have stayed on the surface of agar and extracting those that penetrated it.  This experimental-evolution approach allows us to measure adaptation accurately and deduce the genetic changes underlying it, as the ancestral and evolved populations are preserved by freezing.  One goal of this project was to determine how accurately the increase in invasive growth, and the changes in a populationÃ†s genetic makeup, could be predicted from knowing the genetic makeup of the starting populations.  Recent advances in DNA-sequencing technology and methods of analyzing vast amounts of sequence data enabled us to identify DNA sequences that are more abundant in good invasive growers than in weak ones, and these were predicted to increase in frequency under selection for invasive growth.  The increase in invasive growth proved to be consistent and predictable, but which DNA sequences rose in frequency and were responsible for that response to selection were less consistent, and differed between two starting populations that were derived from the same parent strain.  This is probably due at least partly to some sequences having different effects on invasive growth in different genetic backgrounds.  A much longer evolution experiment began with single strains rather than genetically variable populations, so that all increases in invasive growth had to occur by selection for new random mutations.  The main goals of this experiment were to determine how sensitive the evolutionary outcome was to the genetic makeup of the starting population, and whether the mutations that would be selected for would be in the same genes as those that contributed to variation in invasive growth in the first experiment.  The adaptation by those populations has been quantified and their DNA sequenced.  Analysis of the results is still underway.
