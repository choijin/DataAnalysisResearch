<AbstractNarration>Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education on the structural transformations that occur in viral capsid shells. Viral shells have found applications in materials research where they are used as nanocontainers with a stable surface structure that can be genetically altered. Recent biophysical studies of viral shells have shown that viral shells can also be viewed as molecular machines that adopt a range of different structures as part of their natural maturation process. The changes between different shell structures are effected either by successive, cooperative conformational changes of hundreds of capsid proteins or by a sequence of carefully controlled chemical reactions in response to changes in solution conditions or internal pressure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to develop simple analytical and numerical methods firmly based on theoretical physics that can be used to describe these cooperative structural changes and chemical reactions and to apply them in particular to the case of the bacteriophage virus Hong-Kong 97, or HK97. During maturation the protein shell of HK97 evolves from a fragile protein assembly to a chainmail of covalently linked protein domains. Experimentalists working on HK97 have proposed a range of ideas, such as hexon symmetry breaking as an error correction mechanism during assembly, thermal Brownian ratchets as a mechanism for translating chemical reactions into large-scale structural changes and for generating work, and cooperative mobility of groups of proteins as a mechanism for effecting structural change. The PIs aim to develop and evaluate these ideas from a physical perspective. They will apply methods that have been developed to describe collective conformational changes, specifically the Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transitions. The PIs will develop a single Ginzburg-Landau description for the sequence of HK97conformational transitions that could be extended to other viral shells and provide conceptual unity of viral maturation. These methods could provide new theoretical tools and training to young physical scientists interested in working on problems in biological physics. Materials scientists working on virus-based materials applications would be provided with theoretical methods and numerical models for studies of viral shells assembled from active capsid proteins, such as HK97 subunits, that can carry out a controlled program of conformational and chemical change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research that aims to understand the structure of the protein shells that surround viruses.  Scientists have found numerous practical uses for virus protein shells outside the Life Sciences. They are used as support structures for the molecular scale assembly of materials that can be "designed" by directed assembly. Tiny metallic wires, solar cells, batteries, and fuel cells that have dimensions on the scale of large molecules have all been assembled from viral shells. In these applications, the shell proteins play a passive "support" role. A new generation of applications of viral shells will be based on the exquisitely coordinated collective physical and chemical transformations that take place in viral shells, progressively strengthening it. The PIs aim to develop a general description of this maturation process based on the analysis of the best studied case: the Hong-Kong97 virus. This description may act as a guide in the design of new applications of viral shells.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This award supports theoretical research aiming to understand the structure of the protein shells, known as "capsids" that surround viruses. Scientists have found numerous practical uses for virus protein shells outside the Life Sciences. They are used as support structures for the molecular scale assembly of materials that can be "designed" by directed assembly. Tiny metallic wires, solar cells, batteries, and fuel cells that have dimensions on the scale of large molecules have all been assembled from viral shells. In these applications, the shell proteins play a passive "support" role. A new generation of applications of viral shells will be based on a class of viruses that are active, working like tiny molecular machines.  These machine-like viruses carry out a process known as "maturation",  an exquisitely coordinated collective physical and chemical transformation that results in structural remodeling of the viral shell, progressively strengthening it.   The chief outcome of this grant is a general mathematical description by the UCLA research team of the physical principles that govern this maturation process based on the analysis of the best studied case of a viral machine: the Hong-Kong 97 bacteriophage virus (HK97). The capsid shell of HK97 is a lattice tiled from proteins.  During maturation these proteins undergo changes in shape that take them from asymmetric "skewed" shape to a symmetric shape.  In the theory we constructed, we considered these skewing and unskewing motions as acting like the internal gears and wheels in a complex machine.  These motions turn out to be geometrically incompatible with the layout of proteins on the shell lattice, which means that they lattice must allow for some elastic stretching to make it so that the proteins can fit together like pieces of a puzzle.  We relied on the same type of mathematics used to describe irreversible plastic deformation in metals and growth of biological tissues to construct a theory that combined the inner protein "gear" motions together in a compatible way.  The theory that we developed has significant Intellectual Merit: It provides the biology and physics communities with new quantitative knowledge of the physical principles that these viral machines use to turn chemical energy into mechanical motion.  Our research also has Broader Impacts: It will act as a guide in the future design of new materials based on viral shells, or on the same principles that they use. Consistent with the NSF review criteria, our research explored "creative, original, and potentially transformative concepts" by creating an entirely new way to think about "aggregate" type materials, assembled like viruses from many copies of a single basic part.  The use of theoretical methods from metal plasticity and tissue elasticity for molecular aggregates was a creative and original move, that has the potential to transform the way molecular machines are understood, engineered, and employed.  This theoretical advance was only made possible through the unique synergy of the UCLA research team, combining investigators with diverse backgrounds in soft-matter physics and mechanical engineering. As a complement to the main outcome of a theory for viral maturation, the team leveraged its experience to make discoveries in other related problems of biological physics, including:  description of the variations in elastic properties of viral shells theoretical prediction and experimental validation of the existence of "pre-stress" (i.e., stored up mechanical energy) in viral shells new computer algorithms for simulating mechanical behavior in molecular structures simulations of the thermodynamics of protein-based gels that provide structural support to biological cells simulations of the automatic self-assembly of proteins to form viral shells the mechanical principles governing the folded shapes of membranes inside biological cells the role of DNA in the infection mechanisms of HIV  The research u...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
