<AbstractNarration>This Planning Visit grant will enable the development of research and education collaborations between the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory (INL) in Braga, Portugal and the University of Texas Center for Nano and Molecular Science and Technology (CNM). CNM is a nationally recognized facility for research in the nanotechnology field.  The INL is a major new international research laboratory supported by the Spanish and Portuguese governments and structured to foster European cooperation.  Through the support provided under this grant, a team of CNM faculty members and students will travel to Portugal to develop research collaborations focused on the synthesis of biocompatible and nontoxic nanoparticles of magnetite and related materials.  Both groups of investigators have significant records of achievement in this field, and with the complementary experimental facilities available in Portugal and Texas, there is great potential for advances in developing nanoparticles for hypothermic therapies with (1) controlled shapes (spherical, cubic, needles) and (2) coatings of different silica shell thickness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of a collaboration between CNM and INL are substantial.   Because INL is a newly established institution, the project will enable CNM to develop joint research projects and linkages with a world-class laboratory at the ground level.  Graduate students are a key part of the visit, and will have the opportunity to conduct preliminary research using the unique facilities available in Portugal and to start building an international network of collaborators.  Results from the Planning Visit will be used in the development of future proposals to NSF, Portuguese funding sources, and the European Commission.   Finally, CNM and INL will collaborate on technology transfer and establishing academic-industrial partnerships, building on the expertise of UT participants and European networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[CNM/INL Project Outcomes Report: University of Texas Center for Nano Materials and Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory conclude National Science Foundation Joint Research Planning Grant on Hypothermic Nano-materials                      The IC2 Institute and the Center for Nano Materials (CNM) housed at the Cockrell School of Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin recently concluded a research award from the US National Science Foundation (NSF) to explore increasing international research collaborations between the University of Texas and researchers in Portugal.  IC2 and CNM directly applied to and secured funding from the US National Science Foundation to support this effort. This award supported a joint symposium research exchange between INL and UT Austin which was held in Braga, Portugal in the Spring of 2012.  Representatives from all major aspects of engineering disciplines with an interest in nanotechnology research at the University of Texas at Austin were present including biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, and microelectronics.  Co-Investigator for the NSF funded program, Dr. Brian Korgel continued conversations with INL after the symposium which led to a signed letter of commitment between the two institutions. In addition, a post-doctoral student from UT conducted a follow up visit with INL researchers to explore additional research collaboration opportunities between the institutions for research of the "Covalent Attachment of Silicon Nanocrystals to DNA." This award promises to be one of many long term research exchanges between Portuguese and US research institutions which are directly related to the success of the UTEN program.  Currently, it appears that continued exchange of personnel, researchers and advanced scientific exchange in the field of advanced nano-technology research will continue as a part of this support.
