<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator proposes to work on birational models of moduli spaces of curves. Specifically, he will continue his investigation of the relationships among the compactifications of the space of smooth abstract curves arising from the Minimal Model Program, Geometric Invariant Theory, and the deformation theory of curve singularities. In addition, he proposes to study moduli of curves together with maps to projective space; specifically, birational models of the Kontsevich space of stable maps arising from the Minimal Model Program, and also generalizations of Viscardi's construction of moduli spaces of stable maps with domains having singularities other than nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An algebraic curve is, simply put, a polynomial in two variables; and the theory of algebraic curves is largely concerned with the relationship between the solutions of such a polynomial and the geometry of the set of solutions. To fully understand this relationship, we need to study the space of all possible curves 'the moduli space of curves' and its geometry. This in turn requires that we study different models of this space; and this is what the Principal Investigator proposes to do.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this grant was to investigate the geometry of algebraic curves. A key achievement was the proof of the Maximal Rank Conjecture by Eric Larson, settling a fundamental problem in the theory of curves.  Briefly, one of the central problems in the theory of algebraic curves is the Brill-Noether problem, which asks when a general curve of genus g may be embedded in r-dimensional projective space as a nondegenerate curve of degree d. This was settled in the 1960s and 1970s, and leads immediately to the question posed by the maximal rank conjecture: what are the polynomials that define the image of such an embedding?  To answer this, note that the space of all polynomials of a given degree m on projective space of dimension r is known, as is the dimension of the space of their restrictions to a general curve C. The question thus boils down to the rank of the restriction map; the maximal rank conjecture asserts that this rank is maximal -- in other words, the restriction map is either injective or surjective. This allows us to say exactly what the Hilbert function of such a curve is.   One related problem that were also solved in the course of this investigation was the Interpolation Problem, which asks when a curve can be found passing through a given set of general points in projective space.
