<AbstractNarration>The College of Notre Dame of Maryland's Pathways to Excellence Scholars program provides ten scholarships of up to $10,000 annually over a four-year period.  Recipients are academically talented undergraduates with demonstrated financial need pursuing a Bachelor degree in mathematics, physics, computer information systems, or engineering.   The program builds on successes learned from previously funded CSEMS programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selected students are recruited from a pool of current and prospective students at the College of Notre Dame of Maryland's Women's College.  The College has been cited as providing a female friendly environment for the study of physics.  The College extends this female friendly environment to other disciplines using a tri-part mentoring system involving a faculty member in the student's discipline, a peer mentor from the program itself, and an external mentor from among a group of alumnae women professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholarship recipients are trained to deliver effective oral and poster presentations and present scholarly work both in and outside the College.  Each student in the program constructs a career development plan with  her faculty mentor and sets measurable annual goals. In addition, scholarship students participate in experiential learning opportunities in their fields of study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intent of the Pathways to Excellence Scholars program was to build on Notre Dame of Maryland University?s reputation and success at recruiting, graduating, and promoting women from underrepresented groups in STEM fields.  The program aimed to achieve the following objectives:    Increase the number of female students at NDMU successfully completing a bachelor?s degree in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Information Systems, or Engineering.     Increase the academic and experiential opportunities for NDMU students majoring in these STEM fields.     Increase the number of women from underrepresented groups that pursue and achieve successful STEM careers.     Increase retention of NDMU majors in these STEM fields, particularly from first to second year.     Expand the College?s supportive program for the selected students to include mentorship by faculty, peers, and outside professionals.     Increase the opportunities for selected students to attend conferences and present scholarly work.     Provide curricular and co-curricular opportunities for selected students to participate in honors program activities.     Establish an alumnae-student networking system to provide career counseling and support for students in this program.     This program ran from August 1, 2011 through July 31, 2016.  Throughout the program students were given the opportunity to participate in a variety of activities designed to enhance their STEM education and career development.  These activities included Career and Student Success Center Workshops and individual career counseling, including the development of a career plan.  They were given opportunities to attend talks and conferences in the fields of physics, engineering and computer information systems, tour NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center and visit the National Cryptologic Museum.  Scholars in the program participated in a mentoring relationship with an external mentor in their field of study.  The scholars met with their mentors  at specific times during the program and were encouraged to remain in contact and reach out to their mentors for advice and guidance in their schooling and career paths.  In the fourth year of the program, the scholars completed a research project on the topic of their choice and submitted a paper summarizing their work.  In the final semester of the program, each of the remaining scholars gave an individual presentation to their fellow STEM majors and members of the University?s STEM community.   Over the course of the program, 23 scholars participated.  Active scholars in the program received yearly scholarship funding of up to $10,000 towards their tuition.  In addition to their academic potential and performance, the amount of support offered to a scholar was based on unmet need.  Of the 23 participants, sixteen completed the program.  Of these sixteen, thirteen have pursued or are pursuing further STEM education, six are employed in a STEM field, and one is still enrolled in her STEM program at Notre Dame of Maryland University.  Six of these sixteen scholars are from minority groups.   These scholars and the Pathways to Excellence program had an impact that reached the campus community and beyond.  The scholars have had a positive impact on their classmates, helping to create a vibrant classroom environment by sharing their experiences and interest in STEM.  Many of the scholars served as peer mentors and tutors both at Notre Dame and beyond, allowing them to impart knowledge and share their experience with others.

Scholars in the Pathways to Excellence program participated in mentoring and career development planning.  The scholars? participation in peer mentoring contributed to the development of a Peer mentoring Handbook during the third year of the program.  This Handbook, in combination with the Career Development Plan and the Pathways to Excellence Career Development 2014-2015 Summary comprise a package of material that can be shared with others interested in STEM education.
