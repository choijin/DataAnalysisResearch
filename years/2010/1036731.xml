<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The Pennsylvania State University, University Park proposes to apply item response theory to analyze tests given in undergraduate chemistry, physics and biology classes with specific attention to gender as an explanatory factor. The researchers will evaluate the psychometric properties of the assessments using industry standard practices of differential item functioning analysis, longitudinal analysis, and multidimensional analysis. Gender differences in approaches to science learning, and ultimately in achievement, will be explored and interpreted in collaboration with content area specialists and instructors. The findings will be connected on the psychometric properties of the class tests with data on implicit attitudes derived from separate student assessments. The intellectual merit of the project is to provide an exploration of the ongoing dynamics of gender and assessment in undergraduate science. The PIs expect to analyze over 50,000 student test events, and to provide a rigorous examination of the character and basis of gender differences in achievement in early undergraduate classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impact of the project is to foster a more extensive understanding of the subtle (and not so subtle) associations between gender, testing and achievement in undergraduate science. Instructors will be more aware of gender differences in achievement across specific item?]types, or content areas, and can consider whether adjustments to classroom assessments might be desirable.  At the same time, the project will raise awareness more generally about the strengths and weaknesses of the status quo for testing and evaluation in large scale science classes. The PI team will train researchers and instructors to be aware of the psychometric properties of their multiple choice tests, and to appreciate the consequences of their use for assessment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied attitudes and beliefs about gender and science among college students, along with the properties of tests and assessments used in science courses.   More than 5000 students in eight large undergraduate introductory classes, including physics, chemistry and biology, completed a survey and an online reaction time task known as the Implicit Association Test (IAT).  The survey probed attitudes about gender and science, including questions about gender identification, gender science stereotypes, theories of intelligence, and intentions to pursue science.  The IATs measured implicit associations among three main concept pairs concerning identity, knowledge domain, and gender.  The data collection also included item level data from midterms and final exams in the classes.  Implicit associations are revealed by differences in reaction times when responding to pairs of words.  For example, men are much quicker to pair the words "myself - male" than the words "myself &ndash; female", and the reverse is true for women.  Implicit associations among words from three dimensions, self/other, male/female, and science/humanities, may have different implications for men and women.  For men, the pairings self-male, science-male, and self-science, are mutually consistent and reinforcing.  For women, however, there is a possible imbalance in simultaneously pairing self-female, self-science and science-male.  Male and female response patterns to the IATs reflected these differences, with positive associations for men among the three paired associations, and with women showing a negative correlation between the self-science and science-male pairings, suggesting either deidentification with science or rejection of the implicit male-science association.  The survey measures revealed that male students were more likely to endorse stereotypical attitudes about relative science ability between males and females.  Women rejected the stereotype that males were better at science, but they were more likely to report that the stereotype was held among their fellow students.  Neither men nor women believed their instructors held these stereotypes.  The male science ability stereotype was more strongly endorsed among students in physics classes compared with chemistry and biology.  In large undergraduate classes, midterms and final exams are often machine graded multiple-choice tests. Item level responses can be used to examine properties of the tests, including how reliable the tests are and whether there is evidence of differential functioning across different subgroups.  The tests studied here showed good reliability overall, although they were substantially less reliable at high and low ability levels.  Relatively few questions of above average difficulty level appeared on these tests.   We found it useful to cluster students based on the patterns of their exam responses, allowing us to characterize the heterogeneity in student ability and learning.  Comparisons between student clusters can identify key conceptual difficulties, and the student profiles can also be shown to correspond to traditional psychometric analyses.  The project provided graduate students with training in psychometrics and social psychology.   We also conducted outreach to science faculty to raise awareness about basic issues in testing and assessment and the relevance for large college classes.
