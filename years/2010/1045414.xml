<AbstractNarration>The investigators propose to analyze experimentally the processes of initiation, acceleration and self-healing of seismic slip at a patch on the surface of a fault. The experiments will be conducted on a new rotary shear apparatus that allows testing frictional sliding along rock blocks for large slip (a few meters), slip-velocity of ~1 m/s, and normal stress up to 30 MPa. Further, the design of this apparatus allows application of a finite amount of stored energy on a fault surface (up to 107 J/m2) for a short period of time (up to 5 s). Their preliminary results show that these conditions can generate an Earthquake-Like  lip Event (ELSE) along the rock sample with rise time &lt;0.1 s, slip velocity up to 1 m/s, slip-distance up to 3 m, and self-healing (strength recovery and rupture arrest). They propose to use the unique capabilities of this apparatus for an extensive series of ELSE experiments that are analogous to earthquake processes at a fault patch under in-situ loading conditions. These experiments will allow analyzing fundamental earthquake parameters, such as rise-time, weakening, self-healing, slip velocity, slip distance, heat generation and energy dissipation under laboratory-controlled conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project is to improve the apparatus capabilities in two main aspects:&lt;br/&gt;1. Stiffening of the loading frame to eliminate (or significantly reduce) the unstable shattering at&lt;br/&gt;high velocities.&lt;br/&gt;2. Develop and implement the torque control system that will allow us to simulate a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;earthquake scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A typical earthquake starts at a small nucleus and propagates as a fast moving&lt;br/&gt;rupture front along a fault surface. Every patch on the fault surface is at rest before the earthquake, it is&lt;br/&gt;accelerated to slip velocity of about 1 m/s by the rupture front and it stops slipping when the elastic&lt;br/&gt;energy that was stored prior to the earthquake has been dissipated. Thus, the patch experiences abrupt&lt;br/&gt;acceleration and deceleration over periods from a fraction of a second to a few seconds. During this&lt;br/&gt;period of intense acceleration/deceleration, the patch friction changes dramatically without steady-state&lt;br/&gt;velocity. On the other hand, typical experimental studies of fault friction are designed to determine the&lt;br/&gt;steady-state friction that probably does not realized during earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research eliminates this fundamental experimental limitation by utilizing the unique&lt;br/&gt;capabilities of an apparatus that was built recently in University of Oklahoma. The&lt;br/&gt;apparatus is suitable to simulate earthquake-like events as it can load a laboratory rock patch by energy&lt;br/&gt;stored in a massive flywheel (225 kg). This unique, advanced design of the our experimental system&lt;br/&gt;allows simulating earthquake rupture processes under in-situ conditions of (1) high stress and high&lt;br/&gt;velocity; (2) finite energy supply; and (3) stress and velocity control. The proposed experiments will&lt;br/&gt;provide better links between experiments, theory and seismic concepts, and, by doing so, will&lt;br/&gt;significantly advance the understanding of earthquake rupture processes, earthquake energy balance,&lt;br/&gt;physics of fault weakening, and the scaling of slip rates, slip magnitude, and radiated energy.</AbstractNarration>
