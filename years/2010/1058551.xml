<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need for&lt;br/&gt;renewably powered and always available energy for powering personal medical and other&lt;br/&gt;location aware sensors. The project advances wearable thermoelectric generator (WTEG)&lt;br/&gt;technology. The system will yield new advances in terms of miniaturization, increases in&lt;br/&gt;WTEG power densities, application of advanced heat transfer materials, and integration with&lt;br/&gt;cutting edge locator system electronics. The research focuses on matching the thermal&lt;br/&gt;resistance of the thermoelectric generator with the thermal resistance of the skin to air interface,&lt;br/&gt;accomplished through the optimization of thermocouple geometries implemented in thin film&lt;br/&gt;semiconductors applied to a flexible polyimide substrate. The anticipated result of the research&lt;br/&gt;will be a fully functional wristband locator system that is lightweight, adjustable, waterproof, and&lt;br/&gt;renewably powered from the human body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes applications for location&lt;br/&gt;tracking of Alzheimer?s patients, nursing home patients, and elderly home healthcare. As our&lt;br/&gt;population ages, achieving a balance between personal independence while providing for&lt;br/&gt;primary healthcare monitoring will be critical. Wearable thermoelectric generator technology&lt;br/&gt;can be used to power wireless sensors that monitor patient location and help facilities track ?at&lt;br/&gt;risk? residents. Additionally, wireless sensors can help healthcare providers improve treatment,&lt;br/&gt;increase efficiency, and cut costs. A wide range of other follow-on medical applications include&lt;br/&gt;glucose monitoring for diabetic treatment and care, diagnosing sleep disorders, and the&lt;br/&gt;physiological monitoring of first responders, law enforcement, and soldiers. Each of these&lt;br/&gt;applications has been limited by finite and limited battery life. Harvesting body heat and&lt;br/&gt;converting to usable electrical energy opens up a new era of autonomous wearable devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the term of the Phase II project, Perpetua Power Source Technologies, Inc. (Perpetua) successfully achieved several key technology development and commercialization milestones, culminating in a strategic spin-off of the improved thin-film thermoelectric wearable energy harvesting technology into a newly formed, standalone company.     In early 2015, Perpetua announced that it had successfully leveraged the commercialization developments of its wearable energy harvesting technology into several key customer development agreements and decided to use this momentum as a catalyst to spin-off the technology into new company named Thermogen Technologies, Inc. (www.thermogentech.com).     Over the course of the Phase II project, Perpetua successfully collaborated with semiconductor industry technology leaders to publically demonstrate the features and functionality of its technology at various wearable electronic related trade shows and conferences, including International CES and World Mobile Congress.  The positive feedback from industry leaders in the sports and fitness, health and medical, and location awareness businesses, and the resulting customer engagements, helped drive the decision to spin-off the technology into a new company.  Thermogen Technologies plans to manufacture and market its thin-film thermoelectric energy harvesting technology under the brand name of æTEGwear&reg;Æ technology.  Integrated into wearable electronic devices and/or apparel, TEGwear harvests body heat and converts it into reliable energy to extend the life of a battery or replace batteries altogether in certain applications.      Key technology achievements obtained during the duration of this grant include energy harvesting power density improvements, successful field-testing evaluations and feedback, improved design for manufacturing and integration, and volume manufacturing planning.  Thermogen is currently engaging semiconductor manufacturing partners to produce high volume thermoelectric modules based on its wearable energy harvesting technology.
