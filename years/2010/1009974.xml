<AbstractNarration>This project will determine the basic physical properties of proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe).These are objects in transition from the evolved red giants to the planetary nebula phase in the evolution of solar- and intermediate-mass stars. This new study will enlarge current samples to include oxygen-rich stars. It will include some PPNe in the nearby Large and Small Magellanic Cloud galaxies. Combining the variability results with color and radial velocity data will permit a direct determination of the stellar radius and luminosity.  It is also anticipated that the long time-series data set (up to 20 years in some cases) obtained by the end of this project will reveal, for the first time, real-time evolution in pulsation periods, an additional observational constraint on the evolutionary models. Binarity and its effect on the shaping of the nebulae will be investigated through precise radial velocity observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project involves both national and international collaborations.  The activity is also expected to have a positive impact on the training of science students, the education of liberal arts students, and on the infrastructure for science at Valparaiso University. The methods and results from this research project will also be integrated into the general education astronomy classes and some of the observational data will be used in laboratory research experiences. Dr. Hrivnak and student research assistants will carry out a program of public open house viewing at the Valparaiso Observatory and community outreach, and make regular community and professional presentations on astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The scientific goal of this project was to better understand the changes that stars like the Sun pass through near the end of their life cycles.  Stars like the Sun will one day swell to become red giant stars, losing their outer gaseous layers and appearing as so called "planetary nebulae" before the remaining core of the star cools as a white dwarf.  Our Sun will not reach that situation for a long time, about 5 billion years; at present it is stably fusing hydrogen to helium in its core. We chose to study a set of stars called proto-planetary nebulae that are in the relatively short transition time between red giants and planetary nebulae.  We measured the pulsations in these stars as probes of their internal properties.  By observing the variations in their brightness over many years, we found the periods and amplitudes of their pulsations, which range from 30 days for some stars to 160 days for others.  We discovered a set of clear correlations in the data: hotter stars have shorter periods and smaller amplitudes than do cooler ones.  This is a result consistent with expectations of how stars change as they evolved, but these results provide some of the first indications of the rate at which these changes occur.  We also, in collaboration with several astronomers at observatories in other countries, measured the motions of seven of the brightest of these.  Periodic variations over several years could indicate the presence of a companion star.  The presence of a binary companion to these has been proposed by several investigators to explain the unusual shapes that their gaseous nebulae.  Our results do not support the presence of binary companions, a surprise in light of the confident predictions. Viewed in a broader perspective, this project has had a very positive impact on the training of undergraduate science students, the education of liberal arts students, and the infrastructure of science at Valparaiso University.  Over the course of this grant, 15 different STEM majors served as research assistants on the project.  They were trained in the use of modern astronomical equipment, learned to carry out observations and analyze the data, and were mentored in the interpretation and communication of the results.  All of them presented their work in some public forum.  Most of them had the opportunity of traveling to the US national observatory in Arizona and spending several nights working in this research-rich environment.  The excitement of this research project was also integrated into the general education astronomy classes taken by liberal arts students.  The science research infrastructure at Valparaiso University was strengthened by the presence of this active research program and the national and international collaborations that were a part of it.  It served as a good model for carrying out science collaboratively for the benefit of all involved.          Last Modified: 05/19/2016       Submitted by: Bruce J Hrivnak]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
