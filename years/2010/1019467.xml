<AbstractNarration>Phosphorus (P) is a critical element to the functioning of biological systems.  Phosphorous availability impacts plant productivity and, in some ecosystems, is a primary limiting nutrient. Climate change, particularly changes in precipitation and temperature, are likely to alter soil P cycling and availability to terrestrial vegetation.  However, terrestrial P research has long been hampered by an inability to measure aspects of the P cycle and thus relatively little is known about the effects of global change on the P cycle. The major goal of this project is to use innovative isotope tracer techniques to determine the impacts of climate change on the soil P cycle.  Phosphorous availability, mobility, and influence on vegetation productivity will be examined in experimental plots in California grasslands within the Jasper Ridge Global Change Project.  The influences of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, elevated temperature, increased precipitation, and increased nitrogen deposition on P cycling will be assessed in different soil horizons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will contribute to understanding of global environmental change impacts on soil biogeochemistry and the role of linked biogeochemical cycles (phosphorous and nitrogen) in influencing productivity of grassland ecosystems.  New techniques for measuring P cycling will be further developed.   A postdoctoral researcher will be supported, undergraduate students interested in interdisciplinary research will be mentored, and outreach to high school students, and teachers will be conducted.</AbstractNarration>

These include: total P concentrations and N:P ratios of the bulk aboveground biomass and of green <em>A. barbata</em>, and soil enzymes activity to evaluate changes in these indices over time. We also use C and N concentration and C:N and C:P ratios of <em>A. barbata </em>and of the bulk homogenized aboveground biomass. In addition to these measurements, P concentrations in different soil fractions and the oxygen isotope ratio of phosphate (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>P</sub>) in <em>A. barbata</em> and in the soil were measured. Results from this study suggest that similar to observations made only after 3 years of treatment N deposition was the only treatment that consistently increased P limitation but we also show that the P limitation of the system has increased slightly over time. These results suggest that the system responded quickly after the start of the experiment by increasing enzyme activity in the soil which provides more P to the plants and lowering the P content of the plants, and that the rate of change (increasing P limitation) is now progressing slowly. We also see that despite the higher enzyme activities in the soil and the impact on the plants there is relatively little difference between the inventory and distribution of P in the soil among the treatments. It is interesting and worthwhile to note, that despite the duration of the experiment the community composition seems minimally affected by the altered conditions.
