<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to forge a unique partnership between a comprehensive two-year technical college, four regional universities, and industry partners to address significant science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce needs in North Dakota. Upon completion of the STEM Scholars program, academically talented, but financially needy students, earn either an Associate of Science or Associate of Applied Science degree in a STEM field and are prepared to either enter the STEM workforce directly or transfer to university to pursue a baccalaureate degree. Including both pre-professional and career and technical programs (liberal arts programs with a focus in mathematics; chemistry, or engineering; Computer Information Systems programs; Machinist and Toolmaker Technology; and Civil Engineering and Surveying Technology) allow for a comprehensive approach to addressing these needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides financial assistance to students through a scholarship program that includes three scholarship types. The standard scholarship provides financial assistance of up to $10,000 per year to students that have been fully accepted into the STEM Scholars program. Opportunity and Incentive scholarships, in the amount of $500, are designed to provide encouragement to students considering careers in a STEM field, but who do not meet all of the program entry requirements. These scholarships will be awarded for a single semester. If the student demonstrates that they can maintain at least a 3.0 GPA while in a participating STEM program, and while receiving the Opportunity and Incentive scholarships, they become standard scholarship recipients. Lastly, students compete for transfer scholarships upon completion of the STEM Scholars program. A transfer scholarship pool is being established with the intention of providing scholarships of $1,000 - $5,000 each to graduating students upon acceptance and entry into a STEM-related field at a university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is increasing enrollment, retention, and graduation rates in STEM programs that directly address regional workforce needs. It is attracting more students, enabling them to study full-time, relieving financial concerns through significant financial assistance, forming an active learning community, supporting students with robust student services, offering new opportunities for industry and other professional interactions, encouraging and streamlining the transfer to university, and providing career counseling and job placement assistance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project builds on efforts within North Dakota to encourage students to pursue and complete STEM degrees, and is designed to support them through to graduation and job placement. Special emphasis is being placed on recruiting students from underrepresented groups. The project benefits society by placing students into STEM careers; which are in demand and offer competitive wages and excellent opportunities for advancement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The STEM Scholars Program at the North Dakota State College of Science (NDSCS) established a unique partnership between a comprehensive two-year technical college, four regional universities, and industry partners to address significant science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce needs in North Dakota.  Upon completion of the STEM Scholars program, academically talented, but financially needy students, earned an Associate of Science or Associate of Applied Science degree in a STEM field and were prepared to either enter the STEM workforce directly or transfer to university to pursue a baccalaureate degree.  Among the goals of the project were to create an active learning community, increase the number of students to enroll and complete associate degrees in the selected STEM fields at NDSCS, and supply well-educated and skilled graduates to industries where STEM workers are in demand.     Active Learning and Cohort Building  Active learning and cohort building activities occurred through attendance at the annual orientation sessions and participation in STEM Club activities.  The orientation sessions were scheduled at the beginning of the academic year and were designed to provide information about the STEM Scholars program and the available College resources to aid with their success.  It also served as the first cohort building activity for the new STEM Scholars meet the people who will aid in their success&mdash;the Management Team, Faculty Mentors, representatives from Student Success and Enrollment Services, and their STEM Scholar peers.      The STEM Club involved students from a variety of backgrounds to collaborate on projects that focused on outreach.  A life-sized version of the Angry Birds game was designed and constructed by the STEM Club students.  The STEM Club students also collaborated with HVAC/R and precision manufacturing students to design and build a 10 foot RubenÆs tube whose flames respond to sound waves.  The Angry Birds game and RubenÆs Tube demonstration were used at a variety of outreach events and at the NDSCS annual end-of-the-year Agawasie Day celebration.     Enrollment, Retention and Graduation Rates  The STEM Scholar scholarships were awarded to students enrolled in 14 career and technical program areas and 5 liberal arts transfer programs from Fall 2012 semester through Fall 2015 semester.  A total of 173 semester-long scholarships were awarded to 91 students ($ 537,761), and one-time transfer scholarships were awarded to 9 students ($ 30,654).

STEM Scholars had a 90% overall retention/ graduation rate, and only 5 students left the program due to poor academic performance.  The average GPA of the STEM Scholars (each semester) ranged from 3.29 to 3.61 with an overall average GPA of 3.41.     The increase in graduates impacted the college's ability to meet employer demands for employees.  North Dakota is experiencing a serve shortage of workers as the state has an unemployment rate between 2% to 3%.  On average there are six open positions listed with NDSCS Career Services per NDSCS...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
