<AbstractNarration>1039831&lt;br/&gt;Welty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MRI award funds the acquisition of a liquid water isotope analyzer to support research at the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) LTER. The LWIA will be used in biogeochemical watershed research and compliment current instrumentation at UMBC. Due to rapid and robust capabilities, the new instrument will be used to measure oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios in order to constrain urban water and nutrient flow paths, fluxes, and storage. The LWIA can be used to constrain phase change processes (which fractionate isotopes) which impact water cycling and storage. Direct research goals involve evaluating interactions between stream base-flow and urban infrastructure, source apportioning water in urban storm flows, determining impacts from engineered stormwater infiltration practices on groundwater recharge, quantifying evapotranspiration in urban settings and assessing interaction between vegetation and engineered urban structures. This instrumentation will support research efforts of 12 investigators from six educational and research institutions and two federal agencies. The eventual impact should eventually span the 34 co-PIs and 70+ collaborators involved in the BES LTER. Students should have access to the instrument and collected data. Underrepresented groups will be involved as UMBC and the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies REU will interface with this acquisition. In addition, UMBC has an NSF IGERT to foster education for urban water issues. The PI will be responsible for overall management and maintenance. The instrument will be housed in the Technology Research Center at UMBC in recently-renovated space. A half-time technician will be dedicated to day-to-day operation and maintenance. An online scheduling system will be used to schedule instrument time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this major research instrumentation project was to acquire a Picarro 2120i water isotope analyzer for use in hydrologic and biogeochemical watershed research by University of Maryland Baltimore County and the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) Long Term Ecological Research Project. The instrument enables determination of 18O/16O and 2H/1H ratios in liquid-water samples and processing of many samples inexpensively on a routine basis.  These naturally occurring stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen behave as conservative tracers in hydrologic systems.  One goal of the project was to use the new analytical capability to calculate mean transit times of BES LTER watersheds by measuring the isotope ratios in time series of precipitation and stream samples. There is a distinct seasonal variability in precipitation isotopic ratios, which arises from the structure and types of storms passing over the Mid-Atlantic region. Convective thunderstorms tend to be more evaporative, while frontal storms in winter tend to be less evaporative.  In theory, the time series of watershed outputs, as characterized by isotopic ratios of stream samples, should be dampened and lagged compared to the precipitation input, because precipitation water takes flow paths of many lengths as it makes its way over the watershed surface and through the subsurface to the stream.  Mathematical analysis of time series of precipitation and stream isotopic ratios can be used to calculate characteristic mean watershed transit times.  Such analysis was carried out for this project.  We measured water isotope ratios in approximately 3000 samples of precipitation and stream water.  We carried out analysis for mean watershed transit time for 13 subcatchments of the Gwynns Falls watershed, which drains to Baltimore Harbor.  We found mean watershed transit times to be in the range of 1.5 to 3 years. Transit times were most strongly correlated to percent impervious surface area of the subwatersheds.  We hypothesize that this is because impervious surface area causes precipitation to short-circuit surface and subsurface flow paths, hence shortening mean watershed transit times.
