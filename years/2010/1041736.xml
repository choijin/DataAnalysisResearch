<AbstractNarration>This award will support two important workshops to bring together space weather stakeholders from industry, academia, and government agencies.  Space Weather Week is held annually in Boulder, Colorado.  It has evolved into the Nation?s leading conference on all issues relating to space weather. The presentations, poster sessions, and discussions are important for the advancement of knowledge, understanding and needs of the space weather research community. It provides a mechanism to generate actionable information to drive improved space weather science, products, services and application to serve a broad user community. The workshop also fosters coordinated interagency approaches to space weather education and outreach that will lead to better informed decisions regarding support for space weather research and operations. The Space Weather Enterprise Forum is held annually in Washington, DC.  It brings together members of government at all levels, the private sector, and academia, to raise awareness, improve understanding, and educate all participants on opportunities, needs and priorities related to space weather. The forum focuses on the costs of space weather impacts and the benefits of improved space weather services with an emphasis on the anticipated needs of the user community in 2010 to 2020. Space weather scientists and service providers seek to better understand and serve society?s needs for space weather information. The desired outcome is actionable information to drive improved space weather science, products, services, and applications to serve a broad user community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Space Weather Workshop held on April 27 - 30, 2010 in Boulder, Colorado, addresses the remarkably diverse impacts of space weather on todayÃ†s technology. The program highlighted space weather impacts in several areas, including communications, navigations, spacecraft operations, aviation, and electric power. The presentations and discussions at the Space Weather Workshop also focused on identifying the highest priority needs for operational services that can guide future research and identifying new high-value capabilities that can be transitioned into operations. The workshop fosters communication among researchers, space weather service providers, and users of space weather services. Researchers have the opportunity to discuss relevant research in many areas of the space environment. Recent progress in large-scale modeling efforts were featured; while new developments in Sun-to-Earth coupled modeling systems were also highlighted. The Space Weather Workshop is an annual conference that brings industry, academia, and government agencies together in a lively dialog about space weather. What began in 1996 as a conference for the space weather user community, the Space Weather Workshop has evolved into the NationÃ†s leading conference on all issues relating to space weather. The Space Weather Enterprise Forum theme for 2010 was: Building an Informed and Resilient Society &ndash; the Decade Ahead.  As we approach the next peak of solar activity expected in 2013, our nation faces many uncertainties resulting from our increased reliance on space weather-affected technologies for communication, navigation, security, and other activities, many of which underpin our national infrastructure and economy.  We also face increased exposure to space weather-driven human health risk as trans-polar flights and space activities, including space tourism, increase.   The National Space Weather Program (NSWP) must focus on strategic planning for observation continuity. Transition of research to operations is a key component of sustained improvement and it is important to clearly designate a responsible agency and funding, establishing a Research-to-Operations infrastructure for success. We need effective communication, cooperation, and integration with the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. We also recognize a need for a strategy for collaboration with international and foreign organizations and their development of space environmental science and space weather capabilities.  The NSWP recognizes a need for a comprehensive, coordinated and prioritized set of operational and research requirements with the goal of improving space weather services to the nation.  Transition of research to operations leading to new products and services is critical.  What capabilities do we need today and what will be needed in the future to reduce our vulnerability?  What research is on the verge of operational capability and what's in the pipeline?  Although we have been effective in raising public awareness of space weather, much more needs to be done.  A coordinated interagency approach to space weather education and outreach will lead to better informed policy/decision makers yielding more support for research, operational improvements, and better service to the nation. The Space Weather Enterprise Forum held on June 8, 2010 in Washington, D.C., brought together the space weather community to share information and ideas among policymakers, senior government leaders, researchers, service provider agencies, private sector service providers, space weather information users, media, and legislators and staff from Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., to raise awareness of space weather and its effects on society.  The program focused on outreach and critical infrastructure protection, with the support of research, improved products and services, and applications to serve a broad and growing user community.
