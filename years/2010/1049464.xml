<AbstractNarration>Archaeological materials provide a temporally deep perspective on the nature and intensity of warfare among the small-scale, or "tribal," societies that dominated most of human existence. Of particular interest is variation over time and space in the chances of intergroup tensions escalating into outright violence, measured archaeologically using walled settlements and skeletons of casualties.  Sufficient data have been collected from several parts of the world to indicate the existence of long periods when conflicts were common, but also prolonged stretches of relative peace.  Little is known, however, about precisely where and when fighting among groups was likely to break out, and why that occurred.  This subject is of enduring significance as people today continue to confront conflicts involving groups defined along community and kin lines (tribal as opposed to national identities) that can be exceedingly costly in lives and property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year National Science Foundation project, conducted by Dr. George R. Milner and Mr. George Chaplin, will produce the first comprehensive account of when, where, and why people fought each other in prehistoric eastern North America, with an emphasis on the last 1500 years of prehistory (prior to ca. AD 1500).  Dramatic cultural changes occurred during that time as early food-producing communities characterized by relatively egalitarian social relations were transformed into larger agricultural societies, many of which were dominated by hereditary chiefs.  The project completes a multi-year (unfunded) effort to assemble the archaeological (settlements surrounded by palisades) and osteological (skeletons with conflict-related trauma such as arrow injuries) data necessary to understand how warfare was conducted, who was involved (casualties), and how the intensity of conflict varied over time and across prehistoric eastern North America.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first step in the project involves the generation of multiple density surfaces, interpolated through Geographic Information Science (GIS) procedures, that summarize the spatial distribution of archaeological evidence for conflict.  The result can be loosely visualized as a series of overlays at various points over a 1500 year-long period that show areas with abundant evidence of warfare as opposed to those with little or no signs of conflict.  Taken together, the density surfaces, each representing a separate slice of time, will depict the waxing and waning of intergroup conflict across eastern North America.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once assembled, that information will be combined with broadly characterized cultural areas and environmental zones to identify conditions associated with periods and places where warfare was likely to occur and where it was not.  This second component of the project evaluates the correspondence between parts of density surfaces characterized by high and low warfare and a patchwork of cultural and natural areas, which varied in their spatial distribution, resource productivity, the boundaries between them, and their relative isolation from one another. By doing so, it should be possible to establish whether conflicts, at a coarse-grained level, were largely a function of the material conditions of life, social relations defined by particular cultural systems and institutions, or a combination of both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF project also serves as a "proof of concept" for procedures that can be applied to many kinds of archaeological data suitable for conversion to density surfaces for analytical purposes.  It squarely addresses a particularly vexing archaeological problem: how to deal quantitatively with uneven-quality data from the large geographical areas that are the appropriate scale for analyses of many forms of human interaction.  This work complements more focused studies of specific regions and individual sites that emphasize local effects, specific accommodations to social and natural settings, the proximate motivation for fighting, and the ritual and social roles of war or peace-related activities in specific societies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One cannot escape news reports about the many conflicts that break out among and within present-day nations.  In fact, accounts of war dominate much of what has survived in written sources dating back as far as the earliest literate societies, in some places for several millennia.      There are, however, no written records for most of human existence, and for many parts of the world until the last few centuries.  There is only one way to learn about those preliterate societies &ndash; systematically studying archaeological materials.  With regard to warfare, archaeological research has relevance today because an understanding of when, where, and why conflicts arose among tribal societies in the distant past can contribute to a better appreciation of the factional conflict that remains so much of a problem throughout much of the modern world.     This project had three primary goals: 1) assemble archaeological evidence for intergroup conflict in eastern North America during late prehistoric times (ca. AD 1000-1600); 2) identify spatial and temporal patterning in those data; and 3) explore how that patterning is related to geographical and temporal variation in societies, population pressure, and natural environments.  Two readily identifiable archaeological markers of warfare were used: defensive walls surrounding settlements, and skeletons with distinctive forms of trauma.  The distribution of these indicators of conflict across eastern North America were plotted for several slices of time during the half millennium immediately prior to the arrival of Europeans on the continent.     Our understanding of the intensity and conduct of war among preliterate societies has long been hamstrung by persistently popular, but diametrically opposed and poorly supported, impressions of these people as perpetually being in a state of either war or peace.  The culturally and environmentally nuanced picture of warfare among prehistoric small-scale societies that resulted from this archaeological project is at odds with such popular views.      Evidence from eastern North America, once assembled from many published and unpublished sources, show that there was considerable variation over time and space in the intensity of war.  Furthermore, the distributions of places where intergroup conflict tended to break out changed throughout the late prehistoric period.      One result of this project was the identification of an arc of conflict-prone 16th century societies that stretched from the eastern Great Lakes southward along the Appalachians, and then westward to the lower Mississippi River valley.  Within that crescent, population densities in the Midwest had declined during the previous few centuries when frequent and severe intergroup conflict accompanied climatic deterioration.  These centuries-long histories of population change and intergroup antagonisms set the stage for the tumultuous early contact period when native peoples and newcomers struggled over possession of North America.      A noteworthy aspect of the project is a focus on plotting archaeological data across a geographically large area &ndash; the entirety of eastern North America.  The regionÆs size is enormous by archaeological standards.  Nevertheless, it is precisely what is needed when identifying temporal and spatial patterning in conflict among prehistoric tribes and chiefdoms.  Some forms of human interaction, including warfare but also economic exchange and migration, are played out across regions that far exceed the size typical of archaeological projects.  This research, therefore, serves as a backdrop for more narrowly focused regional and site-specific analyses.  It also points us in the direction of the kind of empirically based work that is necessary to advance our knowledge of interactions among widely dispersed groups in the distant past.
