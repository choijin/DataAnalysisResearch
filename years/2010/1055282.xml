<AbstractNarration>1055282-Cherry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and educational activities for this project focus on developing vehicle purchase and use choice models in China to estimate sustainability impacts of various growth scenarios and vehicle technologies and inform a sustainable policy response. This research will include of two major activities: (1) Vehicle purchase and use behavior will be characterized to identify general personal transportation values and potential motorization pathways. This work will use a combination of stated and revealed preference choice modeling methods to quantify characteristics that people choose now, and potential technologies that could be adopted in the near-term. This would ultimately be used to build motorization scenarios with different fuels and technologies, under various economic and policy frameworks.  (2) Vehicle growth scenarios will be extended to quantify environmental impacts through life-cycle assessment (LCA) methods. Each scenario (technological and economic) will have varied impacts from an environmental perspective, leading to policies that could minimize environmental impacts within the bounds of other policy objectives. The project will characterize&lt;br/&gt;transportation choice behavior in a systematic way, across major Chinese cities, which has not been done before at this scale. This insight will quantify factors, beyond national GDP, that influence motorization, leading to more robust vehicle purchase and mode choice modeling. To this end, viability of alternative fuels will be assessable and the sustainability implications quantifiable.  The educational activities will target several audiences, including K-12 students, undergraduate and graduate students. Activities will include a K-12 outreach programs, a freshman seminar, content for new graduate courses, and international experiences at Universities in China. The educational activities will be integrated into the research component by engaging undergraduate and graduate students in the data collection, model development, and policy analysis. This project will be interdisciplinary, so students with varied educational backgrounds will have an opportunity to learn from and teach others to successfully analyze a topic as interdisciplinary as sustainability and transportation choice. The broader impacts of this project include the development of an internationally minded transportation workforce, capable of operating in diverse and challenging environments; the recruitment and inclusion of underrepresented groups in engineering; and the improved understanding of sustainability implications of motorization pathways in China, leading to policy that can reduce local air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy use.  This award is co-funded by OISE-China.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award investigates how China&rsquo;s emerging technologies, and behavior and policies that influence their adoption, will affect sustainability in the transportation system. This award also aims to advance educational opportunities in cross cutting fields of behavioral science, engineering, and technology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Intellectual Merit: This award supported research at the intersection of behavior and environmental sustainability. During the duration of the award, China&rsquo;s rapid urban transportation development and technology revolution demanded new approaches to understanding technology adoption and integrating those models into policy actions. This study investigated the adoption of new fuel technologies, specifically hybrid electric and battery electric cars. We also investigated household vehicle ownership histories and how those histories influence perceptions on emerging fuels and drive technologies. New empirical methods were developed to investigated new mobility technologies, specifically carshare, bikeshare, electric bikes, and micro-EVs. These new disruptive technologies have large impacts on the choices faced by urban dwellers and require new modeling approaches to investigate.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Coupled with the behavioral analysis, we also focused on the environmental sustainability of these modes of transportation. This work aimed at developing China-specific sustainability models that investigated the unique environments in which China&rsquo;s transportation emissions and waste streams are generated. This work aimed at developing new data-scarce modeling approaches to identify the emissions of new technologies on the environment. That work was paired with the behavioral models to identify the overall impact of the choice process related to technology adoption on environmental outcomes. The result is a nuanced outcome &ndash; for example, without improvements to the power sector, short term adoption of electric cars has little environmental benefit, and many of the costs are borne by lower income populations. However, this work pushes policy makers to focus on substantive changes in the energy and transportation system that ultimately improves transportation sustainability. We also investigate non-typical environmental contaminants, for example, lead pollution from e-bike batteries. This work has highlighted an area of improvement to improve the sustainability of this very energy efficient mode.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To date, the results of these studies have been published in 15 journal articles in transportation and environmental sciences, with several others in preparation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Broader impacts: The work conducted under this award has influenced the global appreciation and approach to analyzing technologies that have emerged in China&rsquo;s transportation system. Global development agencies are pursuing initiatives to advance some of China&rsquo;s most sustainable transportation practices in many developing countries, and are drawing largely from the technical analysis produced under this award. The energy and environmental effects of adopting some of China&rsquo;s best technologies, globally, are very large. Moreover, China&rsquo;s adoption of e-bikes for example, are the largest adoption of an alternative fueled vehicle in the history of motorization, with about 150-200 million on the road today. They are also the most efficient motorized mode in existence, about 10-20 times lower emissions than a car. The displaced car emissions from this adoption are large, even if fewer than one quarter of e-bike trips are substituted car trips. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This work has also aimed at improving educational opportunities for students of all ages, through hands-on experiential learning activities. This award has supported middle-school STEM events, aimed at giving children a basic understanding of how advanced technologies and behavioral sciences go hand in hand. High school students used e-bikes to learn about energy conservation (and conservation of energy) sustainability and physics principles. College freshmen learned how to participate in sustainability projects. Masters students wrote sections of UT&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan and PhD students conducted cutting edge research at the intersection of behavior and technology. The work built bridges between US and Chinese institutions, resulting in exchanges of students and post-docs, sharing ideas and experiences to ultimately improve the energy efficiency and environmental performance of our transportation systems.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;Cherry</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055282/1055282_10080537_1498843094942__JMI1869_creditJuliannItter--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055282/1055282_10080537_1498843094942__JMI1869_creditJuliannItter--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mixed Traffic Environment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1055282/1055282_10080537_1498843094942__JMI1869_creditJuliannItter--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mixed Traffic Environment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Electric bikes, electric scooters, cars, and buses vie for space in the midst of new subway construction.
