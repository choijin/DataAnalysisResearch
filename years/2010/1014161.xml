<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore the development and commercial feasibility of a user-friendly cross-platform computing system for multi-scale tissue and organ cardiac electrophysiology and electromechanics modeling. Specific technical objectives include: 1) Assessing the technical feasibility of assembling an automated pipeline; 2) Assessing the technical feasibility of developing a cross-platform graphic user interface (GUI) that integrates cardiac electromechanical model assembly, simulation, and analysis; and 3) Testing and refining the prototype system to meet customer needs and utilizing user input to assess the commercial feasibility of the system. The proposed system will enable the discovery and development of new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease and allow virtual exploration of mechanisms of cardiac rhythm disorder and electromechanical dysfunction, from the protein to the entire organ. The system will include capabilities for direct input of cardiac imaging data. Users will be able to tailor the behavior of individual components of the system to represent specific cardiac pathologies, targets, and interventions. Simulations will be managed with ease,&lt;br/&gt;and a robust cross-platform user-friendly interface will allow effortless visualization of results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from the fact that he proposed system represents an enormous paradigm shift in the way cardiac electromechanical simulation is done. It will not only integrate, in one easy-to-use system, cardiac electrical and mechanical function using the most sophisticated cardiac simulation tools ever developed, but intends to make simulation accessible to a very broad aspect of society. Currently, cardiac modeling is used in the exploration of new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease only in a few academic laboratories. However, cardiac device manufacturing, biotech, and pharmaceutical industries have a significant interest in cardiac tissue and organ modeling. For device companies, it presents an opportunity to develop and test prototype devices and treatment modalities. For pharmaceutical companies, it offers an unrivaled opportunity to quickly screen drugs for proarrhythmic effects. It also provides benefits to academic researchers since sophisticated state-of-the-art simulation tools will open new research horizons, particularly translational research projects in personalized medicine. Finally, the proposed system is expected to become an effective teaching tool, and part of biomedical and clinical curricula.</AbstractNarration>

We generate personalized heart  models from medical imaging data, simulate electrical and mechanical  activity, and interpret the results of such simulations.

In  order to further our mission, the goal of our Phase I proposal was to  develop a user friendly interface for creating, managing, and reviewing  cardiac simulations.  We collected feedback from clinicians and  interested researchers, and constructed a graphical user interface (GUI)  to suit their needs.  Highlights of the completed work include:  Coupling of electrical and mechanical simulations, allowing for more complete and accurate modeling of the heart, especially for heart disease and resynchronization research. Automatic translation of ionic (single-cell) models from CellML into native code that can be used in our tissue simulator. Development of a Python-based pipeline framework for integration of our modeling and data analysis tools, including offline automatic visualization of results. Development of a novel electrode and region definition tool, allowing users to easily and graphically define regions within a heart model. Development of a comprehensive ionic (single-cell) modeling tool for testing and developing such models. Development of a standalone simulation creation wizard, to help users set up new, complex heart simulations. Collection of voluminous feedback from users and potential users, leading us to pivot our development direction to be more clinically relevant, faster.   As a result of the work done under this NSF SBIR, CardioSolv developed  tools to make predictive simulation of the heart more readily  accessible, and helped move cardiac simulation closer to use in a  clinical environment. Ultimately this is a substantial step toward  improved patient care for those suffering from heart disease.       Last Modified: 03/02/2011       Submitted by: Brock M Tice]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
