<AbstractNarration>Type 1 - LOIL02170097: Decadal predictability of extreme events:&lt;br/&gt;Impact of a model error representation and numerical resolution&lt;br/&gt;(collaborative research)&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will implement a stochastic backscatter scheme into the Community&lt;br/&gt;Atmosphere Model and explore how to improve the internal variability and, in particular,&lt;br/&gt;the prediction of extreme events on decadal and regional scales. Only a small number of&lt;br/&gt;publications apply Extreme Value Theory to climate models and many questions remain&lt;br/&gt;open. While some work has been conducted comparing model and reanalysis with constant&lt;br/&gt;greenhouse forcing, the major body of published work in this area focuses on the occurrence&lt;br/&gt;of extreme events in a changing climate and on the robustness of climate trends of extreme&lt;br/&gt;events across di^erent low-resolution models.&lt;br/&gt;The emphasis of the investigators is very di^erent: they will look at the internal variability&lt;br/&gt;of models under a constant greenhouse forcing. The investigators focus both on the ability of&lt;br/&gt;low-resolution climate models to realistically predict extreme events on decadal time-scales&lt;br/&gt;and global spatial scales, and on the feasibility of replacing the missing variability due to&lt;br/&gt;low-resolution with a stochastic model error scheme and if such a scheme can improve the&lt;br/&gt;decadal prediction of extreme events. Model integrations with and without a stochastic&lt;br/&gt;backscatter scheme would be conducted and extreme value statistics be used to determine&lt;br/&gt;the impact of the scheme onto the occurrence of extreme events. For comparison, the same&lt;br/&gt;statistic would be computed using the the ERA40, the ERA-Interim analysis and/or the&lt;br/&gt;NCEP/NCAR reanalysis as best proxy for multi-decadal observations.</AbstractNarration>
