<AbstractNarration>Humans and other animals are host to a variety of microbes.  Different locations such as skin, mouth or digestive system have different communities of microbes.  How microbes adapt to these locations and the special stresses there is not well understood.  Indeed, adaptation to stress is a major factor in determining which microbes are on skin versus mouth, etc.  A striking discovery is that the human-resident yeast Candida albicans senses nontoxic components of saliva (nitrate, thiocyanate) and activates defenses against toxic chemicals (nitrite and nitric oxide) generated in the mouth and stomach.  This finding suggests that microbes sense their local environment and then induce responses to allow more effective survival and growth in that host niche.  To further test this novel hypothesis, components of the yeast signaling pathway that allow ?anticipation? of toxic nitrite/nitric oxide stress will be identified and characterized using genetics and biochemistry.  Another goal is to investigate the molecular mechanisms used by Candida to sense and resist a toxic bleach-like chemical called hypothiocyanite that is produced naturally in the mouth.  This grant will also initiate the Research Apprentice Mentoring Project wherein a minority student from a Houston public high school will conduct research each summer on Candida-host interaction and, importantly, communicate their research results and experience back to peers at the same high school, from which another student will be recruited for doing research and so on.  Two important impacts of this grant are thus the investigations of an exciting new aspect stress anticipation of microbe-host interaction and a potentially transformative mechanism involving peer-to-peer communication - for engaging under-represented minority students in biology research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How a host-resident microbe adapts to its host plus other microbes in the same niche is not well understood.  In research supported by this NSF grant entitled "Niche-activated defense mechanisms of a commensal fungus" (IOS 1052527), we uncovered three potentially transformative concepts to guide thinking about how a microbe, the human resident fungus Candida albicans, colonizes its niche, here the digestive tract.  First, we showed that C. albicans senses a harmless chemical cue, thiocyanate, specific to the mouth and thereby induces an enzyme that protects against the toxicity of acidified nitrite encountered during passage through the stomach.  Thus, this fungus anticipates stress.   Second, we showed that an internally generated oxidant, sulfite, protects cells against host niche chemicals containing reactive sulfur.  This result suggests a model in which internally generated oxidants allow a microbe to better adapt to external challenges of toxic oxidants.  Third, we showed that the common oral bacteria Veillonella and Candida albicans compete, each with a different strategy to inhibit the other microbe.  We discovered that Veillonella species inhibit Candida by a contact-dependent mechanism (see image of Veillonella adhering to Candida).  Although bacteria are known to inhibit other bacteria by a cell-to-cell surface contact mechanism, this is the first example where a bacterium inhibits a fungus by this route.  Veillonella cannot use sugar as an energy source, but relies on lactic acid produced from sugar by streptococci, another common type of oral bacteria.  Candida inhibits Veillonella by converting sugar to ethanol, a carbon source that cannot be utilized by Veillonella for growth.  We hypothesize that the contact-mediated inhibition allows a strict anaerobe such as Veillonella, when binding to an air-exposed surface, to select for an overlying aerobic microbe that not only consumes oxygen but, importantly, is a more compatible metabolic partner.  These new insights into microbe interactions with a host or other microbes enhance understanding of how distinct types of microbial communities develop in a niche.  As part of this NSF grant, we pioneered and ran a program over multiple years to mentor promising high school students from the minority-serving Wheatley high school, the lowest ranked in the Houston area.   We partnered with Wheatley HS teachers who helped select students (rising juniors and seniors) for this Research Apprentice Mentoring Project (RAMP).  The RAMP students did full time research on the aims of this grant over the summer, mentored by graduate students and undergraduates with extensive research experience.  Several of these high school students made significant contributions to the overall progress of our research plus provided insightful feedback to us in improving RAMP each year.  The partnership between Wheatley High School and Rice University, initiated by this NSF funding, led to other productive interactions that extended beyond the duration of the project.
