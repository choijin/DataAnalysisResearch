<AbstractNarration>The effects of contrasting nutrient-input regimes on food-web structure in natural habitats remain poorly understood, despite the increasing fraction of landscapes experiencing nutrient runoff from agriculture and development. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its expansion of  food-web theory to include complex nutrient dynamics that affect not only plant productivity but also interactions among consumers. The investigators will examine the effects of nutrient subsidies on food web dynamics in coastal salt marshes dominated by Spartina cordgrasses using a blend of manipulative field experiments and surveys of marshes that vary in nitrogen inputs. The long-term goal is to understand the relationship between primary productivity and food chain length and trophic composition in a system characterized by extensive omnivory and intra-guild predation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this study extend beyond the testing and development of&lt;br/&gt;ecological theory. Because coastal wetlands play a critical role in the ecology and geology of wave-protected shorelines and are the nursery grounds for commercial fish and shellfish, their conservation is of major concern. Urban development and agriculture are jeopardizing these wetlands; nitrogen runoff increases plant growth, which subsequently has profound effects on all other salt marsh inhabitants.  The resilience of salt marshes to repeated bouts of nitrogen addition is poorly understood.  The proposed research will provide diverse educational opportunities for a postdoctoral researcher, graduate and undergraduate students. The investigators plan to participate in the District of Columbia Summer Youth Employment Program to hire two high school students from the metropolitan Washington, DC area each summer. This program matches residents of the District of Columbia with employers so that the students may gain exposure to new career opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

Our research is the first to test how short-term and long-term nutrient additions to a natural ecosystem affect a food web and how dynamics among these species are altered.&nbsp; We worked in a relatively simple ecosystem, salt marshes that are dominated primarily by a single plant species, so that we could tease apart effects of the nutrient additions on plants versus how these nutrients affected the animal food web independent of changes in the plants.&nbsp; We studied the arthropod food web, which consists of about 100 animal species (spiders, amphipods, isopods and insects).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We found that short-term nutrient additions cannot be used to predict consequences of long-term nutrient subsidies. This finding is important because most studies that test nutrient addition do so by conducting a study over just a single year, season, or month, and these studies are thus unable to predict long-term outcomes.&nbsp; We found that a single-year nutrient addition does not mimic a multi-year addition of nutrients for any of the response variables that we measured.&nbsp; While we might expect that if one year of fertilization leads to a positive effect, then a second year of fertilization leads to a stronger response, this was not the case.&nbsp; Indeed, long-term nutrient additions often demonstrated weaker responses to fertilization in subsequent years due to the high variability associated with these treatments.&nbsp; We also found that predators (animals that eat other animals) consistently demonstrated a stronger, positive response to nutrient addition relative to herbivores (animals that eat plants) and detritivores (animals that eat dead animal or plant material).&nbsp; Additionally, Hurricane Sandy occurred in the middle of our experiment, and we found that this disturbance altered foodweb structure across all plots, but the ecological system recovered more quickly in fertilized plots.&nbsp; Lastly, we also found that the thatch (dead plant material) produced by plants that were fertilized in the previous year decomposes at a faster rate, and fertilized plots also increase decomposition rate by altering microclimate.&nbsp; Our results suggest that nutrient inputs to salt marshes could decrease the carbon storage capacity of these important wetlands by increasing decomposition rates. &nbsp;Our results are therefore transforming what we as ecologists think about basic theories of how nutrient inputs affect ecological processes.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout our research award, 62 people worked on this project including 2 PIs, 1 postdoc, 6 graduate students, 45 undergraduate students, 4 high school students, and 4 K-12 teachers.&nbsp; Of these 62 people, 82% were women and 24% were underrepresented minorities in STEM. We presented our research at 9 international, national or regional conferences; one of these presentations was given by a K-12 teacher (RET) and two of these presentations were given by undergraduate students, one of whom won an award for best presentation by a student at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America. We have 8 manuscripts in review or in preparation for publication in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our results are very important to land management and conservation.&nbsp; Conservation of coastal wetlands is a major concern because they play a critical role in the ecology and geology of wave-protected shorelines and are the nursery grounds for commercial fish and shellfish. Land development and agriculture are currently jeopardizing these coastal wetlands at an alarming rate, with nitrogen runoff from neighboring human developments posing a major threat due to increased nitrogen pollution, enhanced plant-growth, and altered interactions among species. Salt marshes in the U.S. are lost at a rate of 80,000 acres/year, yet these marshes provide valuable ecosystem services (e.g. coastal protection, waste treatment, fisheries maintenance, carbon sequestration, recreation), more than any other ecosystem per unit area. However, these ecosystem services are threatened by human impacts, such as nutrient pollution, and our research helps us to understand how salt marshes respond to nutrient inputs and thus can inform future management and conservation strategies.&nbsp; Because marshes are nutrient-limited, it is often thought that they will respond positively to nutrient addition.&nbsp; However, our research shows that multi-year additions of nitrogen lead to highly variable responses, and can induce marsh dieback.&nbsp; When foundation plant species die this increases the vulnerability of these areas to sea level rise.&nbsp; Importantly, the input of nutrients into salt marshes may turn them from a global carbon sink to a global carbon source by increasing the above-ground decomposition rate before plant materials can be buried in anoxic conditions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/15/2017<br>      Modified by: Gina&nbsp;Wimp</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1026067/1026067_10020267_1489591591295_Gina,Shannon,andD-Vac2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1026067/1026067_10020267_1489591591295_Gina,Shannon,andD-Vac2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The PIs in the field"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1026067/1026067_10020267_1489591591295_Gina,Shannon,andD-Vac2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The PIs in the field"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The two PIs, Dr. Gina Wimp and Dr. Shannon Murphy, in the field collecting insects with a D-vac sampler.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Doug McCaskill</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gina&nbsp;Wimp</div> <div class="imageTitle">The PIs in the field</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1026067/1026067_10020267_1489591700842_IMG_0283--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1026067/1026067_10020267_1489591700842_IMG_0283--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Students in the field"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1026067/1026067_10020267_1489591700842_IMG_0283--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Students in the field"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Undergraduate students pose for a photo after a long day in the field.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Natural and human-caused inputs of nutrients, such as nitrogen, into natural ecosystems can change how plants grow.  These changes in plant growth can then affect all of the animals that feed on those plants (the food web) and alter which species are present in the ecosystem and who eats whom.  Historically it has been difficult to understand how nutrient inputs affect the animals in a food web because any nutrient inputs also affected the number of plant species present. Our research is the first to test how short-term and long-term nutrient additions to a natural ecosystem affect a food web and how dynamics among these species are altered.  We worked in a relatively simple ecosystem, salt marshes that are dominated primarily by a single plant species, so that we could tease apart effects of the nutrient additions on plants versus how these nutrients affected the animal food web independent of changes in the plants.  We studied the arthropod food web, which consists of about 100 animal species (spiders, amphipods, isopods and insects).     We found that short-term nutrient additions cannot be used to predict consequences of long-term nutrient subsidies. This finding is important because most studies that test nutrient addition do so by conducting a study over just a single year, season, or month, and these studies are thus unable to predict long-term outcomes.  We found that a single-year nutrient addition does not mimic a multi-year addition of nutrients for any of the response variables that we measured.  While we might expect that if one year of fertilization leads to a positive effect, then a second year of fertilization leads to a stronger response, this was not the case.  Indeed, long-term nutrient additions often demonstrated weaker responses to fertilization in subsequent years due to the high variability associated with these treatments.  We also found that predators (animals that eat other animals) consistently demonstrated a stronger, positive response to nutrient addition relative to herbivores (animals that eat plants) and detritivores (animals that eat dead animal or plant material).  Additionally, Hurricane Sandy occurred in the middle of our experiment, and we found that this disturbance altered foodweb structure across all plots, but the ecological system recovered more quickly in fertilized plots.  Lastly, we also found that the thatch (dead plant material) produced by plants that were fertilized in the previous year decomposes at a faster rate, and fertilized plots also increase decomposition rate by altering microclimate.  Our results suggest that nutrient inputs to salt marshes could decrease the carbon storage capacity of these important wetlands by increasing decomposition rates.  Our results are therefore transforming what we as ecologists think about basic theories of how nutrient inputs affect ecological processes.      Throughout our research award, 62 people worked on this project including 2 PIs, 1 postdoc, 6 graduate students, 45 undergraduate students, 4 high school students, and 4 K-12 teachers.  Of these 62 people, 82% were women and 24% were underrepresented minorities in STEM. We presented our research at 9 international, national or regional conferences; one of these presentations was given by a K-12 teacher (RET) and two of these presentations were given by undergraduate students, one of whom won an award for best presentation by a student at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America. We have 8 manuscripts in review or in preparation for publication in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals.     Our results are very important to land management and conservation.  Conservation of coastal wetlands is a major concern because they play a critical role in the ecology and geology of wave-protected shorelines and are the nursery grounds for commercial fish and shellfish. Land development and agriculture are currently jeopardizing these coastal wetlands at an alarming rate, with nitrogen runoff from neighboring human developments posing a major threat due to increased nitrogen pollution, enhanced plant-growth, and altered interactions among species. Salt marshes in the U.S. are lost at a rate of 80,000 acres/year, yet these marshes provide valuable ecosystem services (e.g. coastal protection, waste treatment, fisheries maintenance, carbon sequestration, recreation), more than any other ecosystem per unit area. However, these ecosystem services are threatened by human impacts, such as nutrient pollution, and our research helps us to understand how salt marshes respond to nutrient inputs and thus can inform future management and conservation strategies.  Because marshes are nutrient-limited, it is often thought that they will respond positively to nutrient addition.  However, our research shows that multi-year additions of nitrogen lead to highly variable responses, and can induce marsh dieback.  When foundation plant species die this increases the vulnerability of these areas to sea level rise.  Importantly, the input of nutrients into salt marshes may turn them from a global carbon sink to a global carbon source by increasing the above-ground decomposition rate before plant materials can be buried in anoxic conditions.
