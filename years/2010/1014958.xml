<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to create a strong technological base that will enable bio-inspired sensors and actuators to improve the safety, reliability, longevity, and functionality of civil and mechanical infrastructures; and to make a contribution to the process of intelligent renewal through the support of research and education focusing on interdisciplinary collaboration.  The approach will focus on using bio-inspiration from both biomaterials and biological organisms to develop novel actuator systems - especially passive actuator systems with tunable parameters - to mitigate the damage from natural disasters such as earthquakes and wind.  Novel actuator systems in an experimental shear beam model structure will be used to compare experimental results to theoretical results.  This comparison will inform the development of reliable computational tools for modeling and optimizing the performance of passive actuator systems with tunable parameters as well as informing the design of optimized passive actuators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research has the potential to revitalize the field of structural protection with passive actuators.  It will combine fundamental scientific and engineering principles with state-of-the-art technology, new paradigms and new prototypes inspired by nature's technology. This research will enhance interdisciplinary education with a commitment to outreach, recruitment, and retention of underrepresented minority and woman students. The PI and Co-PIs will provide outreach the High Schools and summer participation programs to get high school students involved in laboratory research.  The project will support two graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment that will broaden their experience beyond what they would gain in a single discipline.  The PI and Co-PIs will make every effort to recruit minority and woman students to work on the project both as graduate research assistants and as undergraduate researchers.  The project will emphasize strong ties to California's MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement) Program, which presents great opportunities for involving educationally disadvantaged students in research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merits       Inspired and challenged by the simplicity and enormous capability of actuators present in bio-organisms, novel control systems and methods were developed based on bio-inspiration during the period of NSF support.  A fundamental method of designing and optimizing bio-inspired passive actuators for structural control was developed.  The force&ndash;displacement&ndash;velocity plots based on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control and the statistic approach based on linear regression are adopted in this research.  This research has opened a new intellectual area of designing and optimizing actuators for protection of civil and mechanical systems such as buildings, bridges, and aircraft.  As a result, a series of bio-inspired passive actuators were developed during NSF support period.  The first actuator, Actuator 1, is also known as the bio-inspired negative spring passive actuator.  This actuator was designed to mimic the force-displacement-velocity relationship of the optimized control obtained from the linear quadratic regulator.  The numerical simulation with experimental validation suggested that the bio-inspired passive actuator may be comparable in performance to state-of-the-art semi active actuators.  Equipped with high force capacity and compactness, the bio-inspired negative spring passive actuator became implementable for a wide spectrum of applications ranging from building small proof-of-concept dynamic systems to vehicle suspension, civil structures including buildings and highway bridges, and even aeronautical vehicles, in a practical manner.  A hybrid structural health monitoring and control system using a 3-story aluminum frame structure with an active control system has been numerically investigated and experimentally validated.  An adaptive controller and an adaptation mechanism are designed using the Lyapunov theory to calculate the real-time adaptive control force.  An active electromagnetic feedback controller (Actuator 2) actuates the substructures to track the desired response signals.  The asymptotical tracking of the state of the substructure and convergence of the time-varying parameters in the adaptive controller are found to be in agreement with the experimental data obtained for this example.  An interstory drift-based acceleration feedback method for structural health monitoring was developed.  It is demonstrated numerically and experimentally with examples showing that the interstory drift&ndash;based acceleration feedback algorithm performs well on the tracking of stiffness change.  The tracking performance in terms of small and sudden stiffness changes are improved over the previous displacement method and similar to the previous acceleration method.   Broader Impacts     The completed research has a potential long-term impact on the next generation of civil infrastructure systems.  The research introduced new methods of structural control based on bio-inspiration in order to develop novel actuators, both passive and active, as well as an interstory drift-based acceleration feedback method for health monitoring that can be implemented in civil infrastructure systems.  Through this research, a new field of bio-inspired control for civil infrastructure was developed by integrating a multidisciplinary team with backgrounds in mechanical engineering and biology.  The resulting research led to novel control systems that can be utilized on the next generation of civil infrastructure in order to prevent natural hazards from becoming disasters. The research has also led to the filing of a patent for the bio-inspired negative spring passive actuator (UC CASE 2015-582 Provisional Patent).
