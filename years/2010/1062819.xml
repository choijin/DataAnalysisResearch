<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and the Research Experience for Teachers (RET) site at the University of Notre Dame.  Projects are available in the areas of Astronomy, Astrophysics, Biophysics, Cosmology, Condensed Matter Physics, High-Energy Particle Physics, Nuclear Physics, and Physics Education Research. The goal of the site is to provide realistic research experiences to undergraduate students and high school physics teachers. The participants will work with a faculty mentor on a specific research project and will be exposed to physics research in other areas via weekly seminars, workshops, interactions with other participants, and field trips to nearby national laboratories. They will prepare a research report at the end of the program and make oral presentations at the REU-RET Symposium. They will also maintain a research logbook and will have opportunity to attend courses in computer programming, machine shop, and radiation safety. A workshop will be held on Applying to Graduate Schools and Preparing for GRE's. A series of workshops will also be held as part of the Ethics component.   This award is funded by the Division of Physics and co-funded by the Science, Technology, and Society Program.</AbstractNarration>
