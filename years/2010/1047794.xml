<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds for research and development to advance the search for the direct detection of dark matter Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) with liquid xenon (LXe) as target and detector medium in next generation, large volume, two-phase time-projection chambers (TPC). These types of detectors have been most successfully exploited by the XENON collaboration, with the XENON10 prototype and the XENON100 detector. The latter is currently the most sensitive dark matter experiment in operation underground with a target at the 100 kg mass scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group will develop and test a two-phase Xe TPC prototype to validate the design of the next generation XENON1T experiment. A key requirement for the realization of multi-ton LXe detectors is the demonstration of electron drift over a meter length, under a field of at least 1 kV/cm. At the same time, one has to demonstrate the liquid xenon purity required to allow ionization electrons to drift across such large detectors. The Collaboration has designed a detector system which will be able to address these and other questions relevant to XENON1T. The goal is to get results within one year, and most of the equipment items could also be used in the actual XENON1T development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this award comes about since the XENON science addresses questions about fundamental properties of the Universe, with all the ingredients to captivate the interest and imagination of students and the general public alike. The research and development work will advance the application of LXe detectors and related technologies in fields beyond particle astrophysics, including national security and medical imaging research.</AbstractNarration>

The nature  of this so-called Dark Matter is one of the greatest outstanding questions of  contemporary physics. As we fly with the Solar System through the Milky  Way, we constantly plow through a halo of this Dark Matter. Thus there  is a constant head-wind of Dark Matter particles that penetrate everything  and everybody on Earth, much as it is the case for better known particles  such as, for example, neutrinos and cosmic rays. One way to try to unravel  what Dark Matter is made of is then to try to detect some of these particles  as they pass through a detector.  Led by the Columbia University PI, and with continuing support from  the National Science Foundation, the XENON collaboration has installed  and operated in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, in central Italy,  the XENON100 detector, which is at present the most sensitive apparatus  looking for dark matter. After a two years search, the detector has found  no evidence of the presence of dark matter, but has set the most stringent  constraints on its properties.

This R&amp;D proposal provided  the funds to build the XENON1T Demonstrator, a facility capable to test  some of the key technologies necessary for the construction of XENON1T.  The Demonstrator consists of a cryogenics system and a liquid xenon  detector with a total height of 1 meter similar to what is planned for XENON1T.  It uses novel technologies which enable the application of very high voltages  (up to 100 kilovolts), the fast purifcation of the xenon gas and its efficient  cooling to turn it into liquid.  With this Demonstrator Facility we have achieved the drifting of electrons  over one meter, with an electric field of 1 kV/cm and a liquid xenon  recirculation rate close to 100 liters per minute. The successful operation  of the detector within this R&amp;D project has allowed us to identify effective  solutions to some of the most critical challenges identified during the design of  XENON1T.
