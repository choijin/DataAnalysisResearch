<AbstractNarration>NanoExcitonics: Implementing Basic Circuit Elements&lt;br/&gt;on 2-D Carbon System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives: &lt;br/&gt;We explore exciton-based information transmission and manipulation by demonstrating two types of basic functionalities, waveguide and gate-controlled switch, using highly adaptive 2-D single-crystalline biased bilayer graphene (BBG) system that exhibits unique tunable band-gap and exciton binding energy under perpendicular electric field. The goal is to understand fundamental excitonic characteristics such as field-dependent effects, relaxation lifetime manipulation &amp; engineering, and drift mobility which are vital to the implementation of ?excitonic circuits?. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: &lt;br/&gt;The research is based on innovations at several levels: (1) new concepts of excitonic  waveguide and switch, (2) 2-D bilayer graphene as the material platform, (3) excitonic lifetime manipulation via a coupled quantum well structure to create indirect excitons, (4) a strategy to drive excitons with energy gradient made by local band-gap modulation, (5) acquisition and exploration of undiscovered excitonic features of band-gap opened BBG system, and (6) a method to in-situ measure the exciton mobility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;This work aims at developing fast, highly-scalable, and energy-efficient information transmission using non-charge-based carrier. The research may also find broader applications such as highly efficient, adaptive solar photovoltaics and nanophotonics. The research opens opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to gain multi-disciplinary experience in physics, optics, nano-devices, integrated circuits, and nanofabrication. An outreach program comprises on-site demonstration of nanoscale scientific and engineering techniques for K-12 students. The dissemination of research results by journal and conference publications and its inclusion in new curriculum developed will ensure broad scientific and educational impacts to general public community.</AbstractNarration>
