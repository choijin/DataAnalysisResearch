<AbstractNarration>A US-China materials research grantees meeting and collaboration workshop is held on April 28-29, 2011, in San Francisco.  The workshop is jointly sponsored by NSF and the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (NNSFC). The dual objective of the event is to: (1) Bring together NSF-NNSFC joint grantees and leaders of the NSF International Materials Institutes to share experiences, best practices and lessons learned in various aspects of collaborative research and education; and (2) Bring together young scientists from the US and China to identify and discuss new opportunities for collaboration in diverse areas of materials research. Day 1 will focus on grantee interactions and Day 2 will highlight the efforts of young scientists and give them opportunities to interact with one another and with the senior researchers who have successfully obtained funding for joint US-China materials research projects. The workshop is organized in cooperation with Prof. Duan Weng of Tsinghua University in Beijing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The event fosters important working relationships between the US and Chinese research communities for years to come. Building joint initiatives in materials research and education can strengthen the growing relationship between both countries, which will contribute to mutual understanding, prosperity and security. The workshop will contribute to understanding the effectiveness of existing joint funding programs with China as well as with other countries, and increase international cooperation in other areas of research and other parts of the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The US-China Grantees Meeting and Young Researchers Workshop was held in San Francisco, CA April 28-29, 2011 in conjunction with the Fourth US-China Workshop on Nanostructured Materials for Global Challenges in Energy, Environment, and Health &ndash; the fourth in a series of bilateral workshops to foster US-China cooperation to address shared global challenges.  This dual event was co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF Award Number 1065906) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and organized by U.S. and Chinese members of the NSF International Materials Institute for Solar Energy and Conversion (IMI-SEE) NSF Award Number 0843962)  The two-day workshop was attended by 46 participants from the U.S. and China, including (1) joint grantees under the NSF Materials World Network joint funding initiative; (2) young researchers from the academic and government sectors; (3) leaders and members of the NSF-funded International Materials Institutes, and (4) representatives from the NSF and the NSFC.  The goals of the Workshop were to:  1.    Allow U.S.-China joint grantees to share experience and best practices with one another and with young researchers;  2.    Highlight the work of young researchers working in the U.S. and China and give them opportunities for face-to-face discussion and collaborative research planning;  3.    Help to launch new jointly funded projects among collaborators in the U.S. and China in various areas of materials research and education;  4.    Create lasting working relationships among materials researchers and their respective institutions in the U.S and China.  Delegates discussed various aspects of Materials Science and Engineering, shared best practices in US-China collaboration, and developed a series of joint project ideas for possible future implementation. Research themes included:  1.    Electronic/ photonic/ and magnetic materials  2.    Materials theory  3.    Energy related materials; and  4.    Biomaterials.  Outcomes and Broader Impact of the Workshop  1.    The workshop generated plans for ten collaborative research projects among U.S. and Chinese partners.  2.    The workshop identified Barriers to and Best Practices in US-China Collaboration.  3.    Young researchers had the opportunity to learn successful collaboration techniques from experienced researchers.  4.    Joint researchers from the U.S. and China were able to discuss their work face-to-face.  5.    The NSF-funded IMI-SEE was able to further expand its research network. Most of the participants came from institutions outside the IMI-SEE network and several of these have expressed the desire to join the network.       Last Modified: 10/07/2011       Submitted by: R.
