<AbstractNarration>This proposal addresses central problems in low dimensional topology and geometry. The PI plans to investigate the topology of ending laminations space as well as problems related to Dehn surgery on links and taut foliations.  In addition to study the topology of low volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds as well as those which are ultra large.  The latter have large volume, Cheeger constant bounded below and have strongly irreducible minimal genus Heegaard splittings.  The PI also plans to study smooth Schoenflies 4-balls. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three-manifold topology is the study of objects that locally look like the standard three-dimensional space in which we live.  Two-manifold topology is the study of surfaces such as the sphere, torus and the surface of higher genus.  While objects such as surfaces and standard 3-space are very simple, the class of objects that exist in them is incredibly rich and fascinating.  For example, there is knot theory in 3-space and the theory of curves and laminations in surfaces.  These theories in turn are fundamentally connected with many other mathematical structures such as non Euclidean geometry.  This proposal addresses basic mathematical questions in these areas.  A classical fundamental theorem in topology is that any smooth closed curve in the plane, such as the circle, bounds a smooth disc.  In fact such a theorem is true in dimension three and unknown in dimension four.  The PI plans to investigate this very mysterious question at the heart of smooth 4-dimensional topology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI continued his work on the geometry and topology of low dimensional manifolds an extremely active and exciting area of contemporary mathematical research.  In addition to its immense beauty and richness in structure, this is because combinatorial topology, hyperbolic geometry, geometric analysis, dynamical systems, gauge theory, foliations, group theory, number theory and other fields supply important techniques and motivations.  The PI (with Maria Trnkova) resolved a long-standing problem about the geometry of thin tubed closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  Using methods of geometric analysis and minimal surfaces the PI (with Colding and Ketover) solved a long-standing problem about the classification of irreducible Heegaard splittings of certain hyperbolic 3-manifods.  The PI found new insights about the classical Whitehead manifold and made progress on understanding the topology of ending lamination spaces, a structure associated to a 2-dimensional surface.  In addition the PI and his collaborators wrote two expository papers on volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds that contained many open problems at the frontier of the subject.  Earlier NSF supported work solved the long-standing problem of finding the unique lowest volume closed hyperbolic 3-manifold, which is a non-Euclidean analogue of the problem of how to most efficiently pack items in space.  There are many related open problems in the field.  The PI gave many research lectures at national and international conferences and university seminars.  The grant supported a number of the PI?s graduate students including five that finished during the period of the grant.
