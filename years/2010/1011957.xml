<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Prof. Shaorong Liu and his group at the University of Oklahoma are seeking better understanding of how a narrow bore capillary can be used to effectively separate DNA fragments (from 75 to 106,000 base pairs) and proteins with efficiencies comparable to those achieved with capillary zone electrophoresis. The work entails systematic investigation to elucidate the separation mechanisms and their relative contributions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of separation techniques using narrow capillaries will extend the limits of separation science - critical to research in biological, biotechnological, chemical, pharmaceutical, environmental, geochemical, and agricultural disciplines. The inherently interdisciplinary nature of this research requires new modes of student training and new curricula incorporating aspects of theory, computation, nanofluidics, and separations. Substantial education and recruitment activities in nanoscience and technology are particularly aimed at groups underrepresented in science and engineering, including recruitment through a regional network of primarily undergraduate institutions, many of which have large populations strong in underrepresented talent.  Results will be incorporated into general-public and high-school level nanoscience seminar series being developed by the PI in conjunction with activists at the Norman library.</AbstractNarration>
