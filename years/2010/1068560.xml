<AbstractNarration>This project will develop the theory of a new and technologically important type of light source that promises to generate the purest color ever produced, surpassing the most stable lasers built to date by orders of magnitude. Such a light source would operate in a completely novel regime, utilizing special atoms that have extraordinarily narrow transitions. The specific goal is to unify the theory of this new device with that of the laser and to correctly describe the intermediate regime. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project could have important technological implications beyond the intellectual interest. Lasers have had substantial impact on society in the past fifty years since their discovery. The plan here is to expand the basic understanding of the laser to encompass a much broader reach, and it could eventually lead to important applications, technological developments, and devices, especially in the field of atomic clocks and precision measurements. The program will involve the education and training of undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral researchers.</AbstractNarration>
