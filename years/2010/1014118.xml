<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a system for magnetic separation from growth media and cell disruption of algae to improve the efficiency of harvesting algae for bio-fuels production.  The use of magnetic technologies has the potential to improve the energy efficiency of removing algae from growth media.  The use of a magnetic separation technology introduces an energy efficient means by which algae can be dewatered and converted into bio-fuels in an integrated bio-refinery. Using algal strains modified to overproduce ferritin (a magnetically susceptible bio-particle) enables the removal of algae from contaminating biomass as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project will be magnetic harvesting and dewatering of algal product which could lead to higher efficiencies of oil production.  This will enable the use of low cost open pond culturing systems for the production of biofuels using microalgae. The development of technologies using magnetically responsive algae (either&lt;br/&gt;direct, or through association with magnetically responsive particles) to either separate them from growth media and contaminants or to induce cell lysis and aide in oil extraction. The project targets the two highest cost factors in algal oil production, namely dewatering and extraction. As such, advances in these two areas can drive algal based biofuels technology to be&lt;br/&gt;cost competitive with petroleum sources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Phycal Inc. 1.                   Project Outcomes  Phycal demonstrated that genetically engineered strains of algae can exhibit two key phenotypes important to making algal biofuels more cost effective through advanced culturing and harvesting conditions.  Phycal genetically engineered strains of algae that are more tolerant to low iron growth conditions in open ponds.  Under these low iron conditions which normally restrict algal growth, contaminating microorganism growth was significantly reduced while the engineered strains grew quite well. This reduction in background contamination can have a significant and positive impact on downstream processes, especially if a biological component (e.g., an enzymatic step or growth on sugar) is involved downstream.  In an alternate growth condition, these same strains are capable of storing excess iron in a form that imparts the property of magnetic susceptibility. Magnetically susceptible strains can be selectively dewatered through magnetic separation. Dewatering is one of the most expensive costs associated with algal biofuels production (up to 30% depending on the operation). Any reduction in the expense associated with dewatering or product extraction can significantly reduce the price of algal oil on a per gallon basis.  Biofuels including biodiesel, diesel, bio-jet, and green gasoline derived from algal lipid (triacyl-glycerides) provide an excellent alternative to petroleum based fuels.  Algae based fuels are particularly promising as they can recycle CO2 from natural gas or coal burning power plants through low cost and low energy photosynthetic assimilation.  CO2 is a key greenhouse gas contributing to global warming.  Utilization of algal derived biofuels for transportation by ground, aerial, or marine based vehicles can reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, reduce the need to drill for oil in risky locations (e.g., Deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico or Prudhoe Bay on the North slope of Alaska), reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and introduce thousands of jobs in a new market across the United States. 2.                   Products  Portions of the data generated during Phase I of this project were presented as a poster at the 1st International Conference on Algal Biomass, Biofuels and Bioproducts July 17-20, 2011 in St. Louis, MO. 3.                   Additional Information  Phycal is an early stage biofuels company developing biofuels and derivative co-products from the production of biofuels. Engineering and scientific advances are being applied to the production of algae and extraction of algal lipids in order to deliver cost-effective biofuels.
