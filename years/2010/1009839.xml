<AbstractNarration>Our current understanding of continental rifting is largely based on studies of evolved and relict rift systems. Observations from these studies have motivated and constrained numerical models that describe rift evolution from initiation to rupture. However, there are very few field observations that constrain processes occurring at the earliest stages of rifting and the structural controls on these processes. This project involves a project to investigate the question of what happens in the early stages of continental rifting.  The East African Rift System (EARS), because of its proximity to the pole of rotation, exhibits a strong gradient in rift evolution along its length.  This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the processes that drive rift initiation and control early rift localization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will undertake a multidisciplinary investigation of the southwest branch of the EARS, which includes the very early stage Okavango Rift Zone, where classic geomorphic rift features are just beginning to emerge, and the Mweru, Luangwa (Zambia) and Malawi Rifts, where geomorphic features are fully developed but magma (if present) has yet to breach the surface.  The PIs will apply a combination of geophysical, geological, geochemical and geodynamic techniques across the southwest branch of the EARS to test the predictions of those hypotheses.  Passive seismic data will constrain lithospheric-scale structure and upper-mantle flow patterns.  Wide angle seismic profiling, along with gravity data, will constrain variations in crustal and uppermost mantle structure.  Magnetotelluric  measurements will provide system-scale constraints on lithospheric thin spots and the presence of melt, while remote sensing and field mapping will be used to map surface deformation. Geochemical analysis of hot spring fluids will identify the presence of mantle-derived melts. Geodynamic modeling will synthesize the new geophysical observations and geochemical results to develop the next generation of continental rifting models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   A major debate about Earth processes concerns what drives continental breakup.  There is increasing evidence that magma, generated by active upwelling of hot material of the mantle, plays a central role in the initiating of rifting.  The East African Rift (EAR) is the largest active rift system and it formed during a period of extrusion of several million cubic kilometers of lava, that built the Ethiopian Plateau, supporting the magma initiation view.  The Okavango rift is a ~100 km long segment at the southwestern end of the EAR system.  The basin subsidence associated with this extension has resulted in the formation of an inland delta hosting one of the richest collections of wildlife in Africa.  The results of seismic experiments carried out across the Okavango Rift as part of this project indicates that the extension of this segment was not formed along with detectable magma intrusion, in contrast to segments closer to the center of the rift system.      This project also supported theoretical model studies of the role of magma in rifting, but the new seismic results will motivate work on how the far ends of rifts may deform even without magma.  Given that the seismic results have only been analyzed at the very end of this project much of the theoretical work was focused on general questions of faulting and magma intrusion during rifting.        As happens with many studies this work on the seismic structure of the Okavango Rift raises new questions requiring further study.  For faults to slip, they have to be weaker than the surrounding crust, but we have few constraints on how weak faults are.  We have published several papers trying to use constraints on the structure of extensional faults, called normal faults, to determine how weak those faults have to be to slip.  A major finding of that work is that the thickness of the strong, brittle layer of rock (called the lithosphere) that is cut by a normal fault has a strong effect on how far that fault can slip before it is replaced by a cross-cutting fault.  The new seismic results indicate that the lithosphere in the region of the Okavango Rift is very thick and so we might expect very small normal fault offset before a new fault forms.  Because sediment fills the Okavango rift we cannot directly see how much fault slip formed the rift.  This is spurring interest in new geophysical measurements of the thickness of the rift filling sediments in the Okavango.        Last Modified: 07/29/2016       Submitted by: W.
