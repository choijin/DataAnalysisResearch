<AbstractNarration>1034566&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research can have a major impact on the area of biomimetic materials associated with regenerative medicine and disease therapy, and in this regard it shows great transformative potential. The approach described allows for the creation of a multitude of collagen-like proteins by interchanging DNA modules, and holds promise for overcoming limitations associated with use of native collagen-based materials, most notably the inability to independently control mechanical properties and the concentration of biologically active sites.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[        The most abundant protein in the extracellular matrix, collagen, has a dynamic relationship with the cells which reside within the matrix.  Therefore, the ability to manipulate this biomaterial at the molecular level can lead to the ability to direct cellular processes, thus enabling and expanding the possibilities in cell-based applications.  Using our novel "modular" bottom-up synthesis strategy, we created full-length biopolymers that incorporate engineered regions of unique cell adhesion and differentiation domains, and cross-linking sites. We examined the potential of modifying these sites to promote and alter cellular behaviors via these new materials.  Multiple, independent functionalities were tuned within these biomimetic materials including those with non-native chemical functional/cross-linking sites (cysteine variants), integrin binding sites (GFOGER variants), degradation sites (MMP-1 variants), and neural stem cell differentiation sites (IKVAV variants).  We fabricated polymers which contained both a single type of non-native sites, as well as combinations of these sites.  These collagen variants have been examined for correct structure, sufficient stability (e.g., melting temperature), and cell interaction potential.         Our studies showed that the synthetic collagen variants were structurally intact, correctly assembled as triple-helices, and interacted with mammalian cells.  The cysteine-collagen variants could form hydrogels, and we examined their gelation behavior and the encapsulation of neural cells and epithelial cells in these matrices.  Conjugation of growth factors to these engineered sites induced cellular differentiation.  Introduction of GFOGER sequences at specified locations and densities influenced the degree of cellular attachment and the recruitment of focal adhesion complexes. The results support the importance of local context in collagen-cell interactions. Collagens designed with varying numbers of MMP domains were also intact, but showed corresponding degrees of degradation when incubated with MMP enzymes.  Although introduction of an IKVAV sequence disrupts the Gly-X-Y repeat structure, stable triple-helical collagen was obtained and cell adhesion was observed to these protein polymers. These demonstrate the feasibility to design and fabricate full-length human collagen polymers with prescribed specialty domains that can tune material properties and cellular response.  The results of this work have been published in several peer-reviewed papers.  Future applications of the research include biomaterial development for therapeutic areas such as tissue regeneration, wound-healing, and stem-cell based technologies, as well as enabling important fundamental studies in matrix-cell interactions.         This project has also contributed to the education and training of several postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates.  Members of the research team have benefitted from the interdisciplinary nature of the project, since the research has required the integration of traditionally diverse scientific disciplines such as protein engineering, materials science, rheology, and mammalian cell culture.  Students and postdocs have also gained communication and team-based experience, including opportunities to work within a multi-disciplinary team, to present their work at conferences, and to write peer-reviewed manuscripts.
