<AbstractNarration>The Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) plays a key role in global climate and ocean biogeochemistry. Using a recently collected series of cores from the Peruvian margin, this collaborative research generates an integrated paleoceanographic data set from this region, including alkenones, trace elements, stable isotopes, and sediment composition. These data are used to document lateral and vertical gradients in key aspects of physical, biological, and geochemical properties of the cold tongue region of the EEP. The approach is structured around three time streams of increasingly high resolution: last glacial maximum (LGM) through Termination I, the Holocene, and the last 2 millennia.  The research team tests the hypothesis that the paleoceanography of the EEP has been dictated by two distinct drivers: the remote influence of the high latitude southern ocean, which dominated surface and subsurface properties from the LGM to the middle Holocene, and tropical dynamics which drove the modern El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system over the past ~5 ky. Broader impacts include graduate and post-doctoral training, internships for disadvantaged high school students, and collaborations with South American scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A multi-proxy approach carried out by ourselves and our collaborators from Brown U. and Rutgers U. was used to reconstruct spatial and temporal trends in surface and subsurface temperatures, gradients in biological productivity, and the nutrient and oxygen properties of key subsurface waters which carry key biogeochemical and climatic signals to the EEP as well as adjacent oxygen minimum zones (OMZÆs) off Mexico to the north and Peru to the south.  These OMZÆs have disproportionate impact on the global oceanÆs nitrogen cycle and have been shown to be highly climate sensitive.  It is expected that they will expand as a response to future global warming.  In addition to advanced analytical techniques, this project has made use of unique, long sediment cores  (up to 26 m) raised from the northern Peru margin (just north of the OMZ) with high deposition rates to produce exquisitely detailed records for the last 25,000 years.  Our primary contribution to this project was to measure downcore the N stable composition of bulk sediment in these two cores. These data are used to reconstruct the isotopic composition of upwelling NO3-, an important plant nutrient.  N isotope composition can reflect a number of important biogeochemical properties, but in this region, denitrification stimulated by low O2 conditions is the primary driver.  By comparing these new N isotope records (d15N) from the N. Peru margin with prior ones from further south within the core of the OMZ we can distinguish remote vs local climatological and biogeochemical forcing over the time period examined.  In cores CDH-23 and CDH-26 from the N. Peru margin (4&deg;S), d15N stays relatively low (see Figure) and similar to the d15N of NO3- in subsurface source waters entering the region. It follows that there has been little influence from denitrification despite proximity to the OMZ to the south. Especially in comparison to a record from within the OMZ (see Figure), the deglacial rise in d15N is very modest (1.5 vs 5 &permil;) with a delayed maximum (14 ka vs. 16 to 17 ka). All exhibit decreasing d15N through the early Holocene. A major conclusion is that most of the rapid deglacial increase in d15N in records south of 10&deg;S indeed reflects a regional intensification of low O2 and N-loss. However, the relatively delayed and more modest deglacial d15N peak in CDH-23 and CDH-26 most likely reflects a minor degree of remote forcing of water mass characteristics and perhaps a global signal forced with a ~ 3 thousand year delay by OMZ denitrification.
