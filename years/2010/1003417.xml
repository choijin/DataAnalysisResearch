<AbstractNarration>The research team, in this collaborative proposal, aims to compare speleothem records, instrumental observations of the last ~100 years, and climate models to study Caribbean climate spanning the last millennium.  The research team will address two foundational questions with their project, as follows: (1) What do the high-resolution Caribbean speleothem delta oxygen-18 isotope records, together with Cariaco Basin sediments, indicate about the low-frequency, Caribbean-wide hydroclimate variations during the Late Holocene? and (2) What can be learned about the large scale Atlantic-Pacific climate interactions during the late Holocene by comparing the detailed regional Caribbean hydroclimate history with other proxy records outside the region?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students, most notable at the University of Puerto Rico.  The research results on tropical hydrology could have widespread utility in the study of climate and water resources.</AbstractNarration>
