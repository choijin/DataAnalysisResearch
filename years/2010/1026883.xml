<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes to further investigate use of a body-mounted, inertial sensor motion analysis system as a field-ready, objective evaluation technique to detect and evaluate locomotion disturbances in the horse. Research objectives involve incorporating the Hilbert-Huang transform into analysis algorithms, test another common gait, the canter, test unique gaits of popular breeds in the United States, expand application to detect and evaluate ataxia in horses and lameness in dogs, further investigate the ability of the system to differentiate impact from pushoff lameness, further investigate if specific, naturally-occurring lameness conditions can be differentiated by analysis, investigate the impact on analysis of adjusting for torso rotation, and investigate developing an additional data acquisition device for veterinarians to prescribe to clients as a monitoring tool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are improving veterinary service provided to horses and dogs and generally enhancing animal health and well-being. Education of veterinary students will be improved by basing teaching on objective measurement rather than subjective opinion. Accurate detection and evaluation of lameness in horses and dogs and ataxia in horses early in the course of disease may save money and improve therapeutic outcomes if treatment is initiated when it may be most effective and provide the practicing veterinarian with more objective evidence on when and what diagnostic modalities have the greatest potential to achieve accurate and specific diagnosis. Successful commercial development of this technology will stimulate the economy, providing a value-added service previously unavailable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lameness is the single most common and expensive medical condition affecting horses, with an estimated cost of $678 million to $1 billion annual loss to horse owners. Until now, lameness detection by veterinarians was dependent solely on subjective evaluation and assessment using palpation and the naked eye to localize lameness.  Research is conclusive that professional agreement, even amongst expert veterinarians, on the location and severity of lameness using subjective methods alone is poor. The arrival of an "objective" tool - one that is accurate and precise - for lameness evaluation is long overdue.  Body mounted inertial sensors sample movement some 20X faster than the naked eye.  Small asymmetry in motion due to lameness can be detected with high sensitivity and accuracy.     Lameness Locator&reg; is a patented lameness detection and quantification system manufactured by Equinosis, LLC, that utilizes three small, wireless inertial sensors placed on the head, pelvis, and right forelimb of the horse.  Proprietary software algorithms analyze the motion data collected and provide the following information to the equine veterinarian:  (1) the lame limb, or limbs, (2) the severity of the lameness; and (3) the phase during the stride when the pain of lameness is highest (impact, midstance, push-off of a limb), reporting an average of all strides collected over ground, during simultaneous veterinary subjective evaluation. Animal instrumentation is rapid (less than 3 minutes) and non-invasive; data collection is live, with near instantaneous data analysis (less than 5 seconds on an average data collection).    Through the NSF Small Business Technology Transfer  (STTR) Phase II, TECP, and IIB program grants, Equinosis, LLC  and researchers at the University of Missouri investigated whether gaits other than the trot in the horse, including the natural 3 beat canter gait, and breed specific gaits such as the Saddlebred rack, Standardbred pace, and Missouri Foxtrotter fox trot could also be evaluated for lameness. Adjustments were made to the analysis and sensor hardware to be able to accommodate evaluation of gaits similar to the trot, namely the pace and fox trot for incorporation into the commercial product. It was concluded that the trot, the gait that is most commonly used in veterinary evaluation, and the gait that Lameness Locator algorithms are based on, is the best gait to evaluate lameness in the horse.  Methods to differentiate the trot from the canter with inertial sensors were developed; however, the canter was concluded to be a poor gait at which to evaluate lameness.  Inertial sensors were also attached to the rider and rider activity was found to influence lameness results.  This is particularly useful in evaluating horses where no lameness is measured when the horse is not ridden, yet a complaint is presented to the veterinarian by the horse owner or trainer.  Research  efforts led to the following product enhancements including automated interpretation and advanced data analysis of lunging (moving a horse in a circle) on hard versus soft ground; and, as previously mentioned, the ridden evaluation.  Additionally, a model was investigated and developed for evaluating another common medical symptom in horses, neurologic ataxia (lack of movement coordination) utilizing a different set of body mounted inertial sensors. Also investigated was whether the evaluation method  used to evaluate lameness in horses could be successfully applied to dogs. Use of smaller inertial sensor devices and modifications in the current equine algorithms allow for successful detection of lameness in dogs.   The Equinosis Lameness Locator&reg; technology has two primary broader societal impacts. The first is on the education of equine veterinarians around the globe. Lameness Locator is currently in 75% of North American veterinary medical teaching colleges, and over 40 veterinary medical schools world-wide.  The importance of evidence based...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
