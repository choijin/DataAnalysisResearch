<AbstractNarration>The need for more accurate and detailed regional climate predictions is widely recognized; industry, local government and society increasingly require sufficient understanding and warning to enable proper planning and adaptation to mitigate future costs and disruptions arising from climate variability and change. This project is addressing critical research and model development issues aimed at improving such regional predictions in a three-phase approach. The Nested Regional Climate Model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research is being further developed with the inclusion of ocean and land coupling, atmospheric chemistry, and decision support tools for societal and industry users. This model also forms a test bed for the next generation Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), a next-generation regional weather-climate-ocean prediction system with sophisticated atmospheric chemistry components.  A number of statistical and related downscaling techniques will also be developed to enable improved assessment of extreme weather systems and their impacts.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. A feature of the program is the wide, cross-disciplinary community approach and novel collaboration amongst experts in regional climate, severe weather, numerical modeling, data assimilation, atmospheric chemistry, industry, and societal applications. Coordinating the development of the new prediction systems and downscaling approaches directly with societal applications and development of decision tools will enable each to influence the other to their mutual benefit. Thus, the program entails both substantial intellectual merit and societal and scientific benefit. For example, it will enable earlier societal and industry use of the developing predictive capacity and lead to an improved, tightly-coupled predictive and decision system. This will feature novel societal approaches, such as the role that long-term contracts like multi-year insurance policies coupled with long-term loans can play in encouraging investments in cost-effective adaptation measures in the presence of climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Major Outcomes:  All objectives of the original proposal were met, and the course of the research extended beyond modeling and into modeling-based approaches to reducing community risk and increasing resilience to weather and climate extremes.   The research was based around three major themes, each of which is summarised below.  Theme 1: Regional Climate Modeling Capability  A comprehensive set of current and future climate simulations were conducted and used in conjunction with new statistical techniques to explore our capacity to predict regional climate changes over North America. The focus of the prediction was on high-impact weather statistics. The findings have been shared widely with the community through publications, direct briefings and the establishment of a series of regional climate tutorials. The latter are being continued to provide training and lessons-learnt and to help community groups make better use of dynamical and statistical approaches to regional climate prediction.   All data and tutorial materials are archived and made freely available for community use.  Theme 2: Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS)  The MPAS is now well tested and being utilized for a range of applications. It forms one of the cores in the Community Earth System Model, and has been adapted for oceanic use.  Simulations under this project explored the North Atlantic and western North Pacific tropical cyclone activity and found that variable-resolution meshes reduce many of the problems with nested domains and are valuable tools for regional climate modeling within a global framework.  Theme 3: Community Collaboration  Our EASM project was established in conjunction with industry and societal groups and this interaction has now matured into a major new program: the Capacity Center for Climate and Weather Extremes (C3WE). This multi-institutional center coordinated and facilitated by NCAR has taken over future responsibility for the regional climate tutorials and contains three major programs.  The Engineering for Climate Extremes Partnership (ECEPTM www.ecep.ucar.edu) is a collaboration between academia, governments, businesses and local communities, aimed at reducing impacts from extreme events through sharing and building upon available best practices to support community-led decision-making.  The Global Risk, Resilience and Impacts Toolbox (GRRITTM www.ecep.ucar.edu/GRRIT) is a sustainable and fully supported community toolbox to aid society in reducing weather and climate impacts, building economic resilience, and improving disaster recovery.  The Rising Voices Collaborative Science for Climate Solutions collaboration (www.risingvoices.ucar.edu) brings together scientists and indigenous peoples in North America and the Pacific facilitated by NCAR. The aim is to enhance cross-cultural approaches for adaptation solutions to extreme weather and climate events, climate variability and climate change.
