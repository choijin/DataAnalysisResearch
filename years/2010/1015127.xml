IMFC systems are a subcategory of Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells which utilize a fuel reforming process in order to produce H2 from methanol fuel. The hydrogen then reacts with air inside the fuel cell to produce electrical power for a variety of applications. Methanol is an optimal fuel because it is naturally occurring, biodegradable, hydrogen dense, and can be steam-reformed into H2 and CO2 at low temperatures compared to other hydrocarbon fuels. Methanol also has the potential to be a carbon-neutral fuel source.     An essential component of the IMFC methanol reformation process is the evaporator. Before methanol fuels can produce hydrogen for the fuel cell, they must be completely vaporized. It is proposed that a microchannel evaporator can provide an efficient and effective means of vaporizing a binary mixture of methanol and water.     Electronic cooling is of increasing importance as microprocessor circuitry continues to diminish in size. These smaller and denser chips produce larger amounts of waste heat which must be removed from the chipset to maintain optimal operating temperatures. One-phase and two-phase conductive flow of Methanol/Water mixtures are one potential working fluid for the removal of microchip waste heat.     The National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in Hsinchu, Taiwan has significant resources dedicated to the investigation of the two-phase flow properties of working fluids through a microchannel test apparatus. The experience and equipment of the National Tsing Hua University, and the experience of the researchers there, was utilized to investigate two-phase flow properties of a binary mixture of methanol and water through microchannels. The investigation, when data processing is complete, is intended to validate the results of an investigator researching two-phase flows in a single microchannel.     The results of the aformationed resarch, funded by the NSF, will be of great value in the design of certain types of fuel cells as well as cooling systems for electronic devices.     Furthermore, the collaborative relationship established between US and taiwanese researchers has yielded and continues to yield enormous benefits in terms of exchange of technical knowledge and unique approaches to solving difficult engineering problems.
