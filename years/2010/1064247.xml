<AbstractNarration>Clemson University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) jointly propose transformative computer science in the area of file systems in High-End Computing (HEC). The project is unique to the mission of NSF's EAGER program because, in a novel way, the outcomes of this work will replace current parallel file systems with a substantially more scalable Peer-to-Peer (P2P)-based storage system that will enable forthcoming exascale computing systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of P2P-based file sharing concepts and HEC requirements and concerns is a novel approach to large-scale computing with performance requirements. The study of exascale storage from first principles is an important class of research to be undertaken, as opposed to refactoring existing approaches to file systems that are deployed on Terascale and Petascale systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the investigators seek to validate alternative designs of high scalability, availability, integrity and robustness than those offered by the logical evolution of existing HEC file systems and their instantiations on Petascale architectures, this EAGER project will seek to produce a preliminary/research prototype for a radically different file system. This project will jointly study, design, and create a preliminary/research prototype for a distributed software infrastructure and related techniques that support scalable and reliable file storage and retrieval for HEC relying on a structured P2P network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this project is successful, the design/architecture/strategy for exascale-based storage systems will change greatly over the logical evolutionary extensions of existing file systems and key opportunities and barriers will be more clearly understood in regards to the creation of practical exascale storage systems. Exascale co-design approaches will be considered and compared to the outcomes of this work, thereby informing other researchers of the relative merits of co-design approaches for exascale when file systems are studied based on a first-principles approach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this grant include the following  * A new and better understanding of how to work with non-deterministic networks in which storage will be distributed.   The problem is that the storage has to be safely available, and it has to be able to be located.  * We have confirmed that the kind of Distributed Hash Trees (DHTs) used in peer services like Napster, and that are proposed to be used in high performance computing and for storage distribution are insufficient.  DHTs can be used in part of a large scale solution, within localities, but they can't be used globally to achieve both the scales we need, and the free data placement necessary for reliability.  * Two graduate students have made significant strides toward their PhD work as a result of this effort, which also involved collaboration with Clemson University.  -- The first student has developed two journal papers about storage network strategy concerning free data placement.  His work highlights that for massive scale or "exascale," we can freely place the data, and find it later.  While this may sound like an obvious concept, it isn't in the context of massive scale with many errors and constantly evolving network structures.  -- The second student has designed and prototyped a new kind of storage message passing system that will eventually incorporate the logic of "how to search smartly" from the first student's work.  In addition, seeral other students got their start in high performance computing through this effort.  Overall, from the Principal Investigator's perspective, he was able to refocus his research in HIgh Performance Computing to address storage-based high performance computing.   The work here nicely complements that of our collaborators at Clemson University.  The EAGER funding provided here provided early results and outcomes that allowed Clemson and UAB (the PI's University) to obtain significant follow-on funding from DOD and DOE/NNSA respectively to continue to design, prototype, architect and realize an exascale storage system in collaboration with researchers in DOE/NNSA.
