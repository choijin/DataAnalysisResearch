<AbstractNarration>The proposal is focused on applications of embedded meshes to simulations involving interfaces in volumes, primarily fluids, but also fracture simulations. Embedded meshes are detailed polygonal meshes contained within a finite volume where a scalar field quantized at a much coarser level is also defined. As the scalar field changes over time as a result of the simulation, the polygon mesh vertices move within the volume, driven by the flow created by the scalar field time changes. This is a hybrid implicit-parametric model which can be used to efficiently solve a number of problems of interest, since some computations can only be performed more efficiently using parametric models, and others using implicit models.  The propsal presents a detailed plan for extending the idea of combining a separate Lagrangian discretization of the interface (embedded mesh) with Eulerian discretizations for fluids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A mesh is a collection of polygons (usually triangles) that forms a computer representation of a 3D shape.  Our work uses meshes for performing computer simulations of various moving objects, including water, deforming objects, swimming animals, and clothing.  All of our animations are guided by the laws of physics, and are not created by a human animator.  Because of this, the motions are more likely to look realistic than human-guided animation.  In addition, the accuracy of the simulated motion allows for our results to be used for scientific research in other fields that require calculating realistic motions.  One aspect of our work is using meshes to produce more realistic looking water surfaces.  We use meshes to represent the waterÃ†s surface, and our approach allows us to create more detailed water surfaces than prior methods.  The mesh-based approaches that we developed can be used with either grid-based or particle-based methods of simulating water.  One broader impact of this work is to create more realistic water animations for feature film special effects.  We also used meshes to represent clothing, and produced animations of a person putting on their clothes.  We found that the most difficult aspect of controlling animation of dressing is the alignment of the hand or foot with the opening of the clothes (a sleeve or a pant leg).  We essentially color-code the surface of the clothing mesh, and guide the hand or foot towards the part of the cloth that is closest to the opening.  To our knowledge, ours is the first system to produce animation of a person putting on a shirt, jacket or pants.  In addition to use in animated films, future broader impact may include helping people with limited motion (elderly or disabled persons) put on their clothes.  We studied the motion of swimming animals (eels, frogs, turtles) in water.  We can specify the shape of a given animal, and the computer finds efficient swimming strokes.  After we verified that this method produces the familiar swimming motions of existing animals, we used it to find the most plausible swimming motion for the extinct marine reptile called the plesiosaur.  Plesiosaurs have an unusual body plan, with four large flippers, two in front and two in the back.  There is no present-day animal that has the same four-flipper body plan, and so scientists cannot look to other animals for answers as to how it swam.  Paleontologists have debated how the plesiosaur may have swam for close to 200 years.  Our work showed that these aquatic reptile must have primarily used its front flippers for forward propulsion, and swam much like a penguin.  This implies that their back flippers are most likely to have been used for balance and maneuverability.          Last Modified: 12/30/2015       Submitted by: Greg Turk]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
