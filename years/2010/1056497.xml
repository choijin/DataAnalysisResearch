<AbstractNarration>West Greenlandic, the national language of Greenland, is an Inuit language closely related to other Inuit languages spoken in Alaska and Canada today. Like many other North American languages, it is characterized by extreme polysynthesis: its words are not fixed in form or content, but are productively constructed out of roots and suffixes.  Concepts which are encoded as separate words in English tend to be combined into one very long word in polysynthetic languages. This raises very fundamental theoretical questions as to what status the notion of a word has in grammatical theory, what are the limits of word-formation processes in polysynthetic languages, and how we understand concepts like clause and sentence in such a language. The different  Inuit languages lexicalize these forms to varying degrees; Greenlandic  exhibits relatively little lexicalization of such forms, leading to the  issue of which should be included in a dictionary and which can be  understood by understanding their individual parts (much as sentences  are not included in an English dictionary but certain set phrases are).  This project addresses these fundamental issues through the development of a Greenlandic-English digital lexicon and aims to make significant progress in our understanding of how such forms are created, including the underlying processes of word formation and lexicalization and how these interact with grammar. The digital format of the lexicon will enable us to include texts which show the linkage of such sentence-like words into larger discourse units and how they are anchored to the context in which they are produced. This line of inquiry will produce major insights into our understanding of the range of human linguistic diversity and the capacity of linguistic production and processing. This research project will benefit from collaborative contributions from Greenlandic researchers who, in the context of this international collaboration, will also contribute to the valuable graduate training opportunities that this project will provide in fieldwork and linguistic analysis.</AbstractNarration>

The processes deriving ever larger bases can continue without limit, at least in principle, resulting in very long words that often translate into sentences in English. How can this information be captured in a dictionary, and how to we understand the concept of a "word" in Kalaallisut?              As an example, here is a word from a recent popular magazine article, broken up into its components in the second line, which are glossed in the third line, with the whole word translated into English on the fourth line.              ilaasortaajunnaarsinneqartoq              ila-u-sor-taq-u-junnaar-tit-neqar-toq              part-be-which.is-part.of-be-cease.to-cause.to-passive-that.he.has              'that he has had his membership revoked'  The first element, ila ?companion? or ?a part of?, is required for this to be a word. In other words, nothing that comes after it can stand alone without ila.  But every sequence starting with the first element is the base of a possible word. Ilaasortaajunnar- means ?he/she stopped being a member?.  Which of these possible words should lexicographers include it in a dictionary?  In producing a useful and trustworthy bilingual dictionary of Kalaallisut it has been repeatedly necessary to face questions like this. One part of the solution clearly involves the meaning, the use, and the grammar of the suffixes of Kalaallisut, of the derivational morphology that is used to create new words. Therefore an appendix that lists, in addition to an English gloss, all of the grammatical peculiarities of all of the productive suffixes is required.  In addition to the dictionary of 20,000 head words, we have done targeted research on two core areas of the vocabulary: spatial language, including place names and landscape terminology, and plant names and their uses.   Greenland is currently undergoing rapid political and social change, alongside accelerated climate change. We have worked to understand how Inuit living a more traditional lifestyle use anguage, and to understand the impact of changes in both lifestyle and the physical environment on the language.
