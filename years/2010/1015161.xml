<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An organismÆs ability to live and develop is dependent upon cell-cell communication, a process that underlies many of the most basic of functions to the most complex. Calcium, an essential second messenger, is vital for regulating neuron-to-neuron interaction in the nervous system, and for mediating processes ranging from the development of the nervous system to the formation of synaptic connections. Additionally, modifying neuronal intracellular calcium levels can modulate the amount and type of neurotransmitter released to adjacent neurons. Likewise, calcium plays a role in the activation of several key enzymes that are involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).  Previous work has established that chromogranin B (CGB), a protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in secretory vesicles, amplifies calcium release via the inositol 1,4,5, trisphosphate receptor (IP3R). Further studies have also implicated specific regions of CGB that may mediate calcium release from the IP3R . However, the mechanism by which CGB regulates processes such as neuronal development and synaptic formation remains unknown.  My research tested the hypothesis that CGB, at both the cellular and neuronal network level, is crucial for moderating processes such as neuronal development, neurotransmitter release, and synapse formation.
