<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this collaborative award is to elucidate the properties of natural fibers grown in a controlled environment and retted to form structural fibers through environmentally benign methods. The research is focused on examing the effect of cross sectional architectures in fibers and their impact on fiber properties. Modeling of the fiber properties and their introduction into compostable thermoplastic biopolymers will be conducted. We will conduct mechanical testing and micromechanics modeling to enable a comprehensive basis for design of natural fiber composites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the baseline developed through this investigation will form a blueprint for a new class of fibers. The natural high resilience that plants show will be brought to bear new composites. The impact of the effort is both immediate in the increased understanding of what improves the properties of natural fiber based compostable structures but in long term development of fiber composites. The project will bring collaborative partnerships between University of Texas at Dallas and University of North Texas in Denton and enhanced interdisciplinary experiences for students in plant biology, materials characterization, and mechanics. Outreach partnerships between the two institutions and Society of Women Engineer chapters will be conducted.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We proposed to systematically vary the cellular cross-sectional morphology of natural fibers and correlate the microstructures and viscoelastic properties at microscale to the mechanical behaviors of the individual natural fibers and their composites.   Our hypothesis was based on our data indicating that growth conditions, growth hormones and harvesting times (maturity) provide means of generating fibers of varying chemical composition, cell microstructures, cell size and density. Two representative fiber architectures will be investigated: cotton fibers which are single-celled fibers with a central lumen surrounded by thick walls of cellulose chains, and bast fibers which are typically multi-celled fiber bundles with thick walls of predominantly cellulose and lignin reinforced by hemicelluloses, pectins, and cross-linking proteins.  Intellectual merits:  A new paradigm for the intersection of chemical compositional effects on the mechanical and energy absorption characteristics of natural fibers was developed. Composites formed from fibers were found to have varying responses depending on surface chemistry and cross-sectional architecture. The intersection between synthetic and natural fibers was determined. It is clear that nature provides a template to harvest unique properties.  Broader impacts:  The information was disseminated in 6 journal publications, 6 conference proceedings, 1 book chapter, 3 MS thesis and 1 doctoral thesis. Undergraduate students developed new processing methodologies to replicate natural structures and a biomimicry was introduced into 2 formal courses.
