<AbstractNarration>An Integrated Lab-on-a-Chip for Nanoelectronic Materials&lt;br/&gt;M. A. Haque, the Pennsylvania State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop an integrated lab-on-a-chip type device for multi-domain characterization of nanoscale thin films of electronic materials. The approach is to nanofabricate a 3 mm x 3mm x 0.5 mm size device with multi-functional capabilities, such as force and displacement sensors and actuator for mechanical properties and micro-electrodes for electrical and thermal conductivity characterization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The lab-on-a-chip tool will transform the current paradigm (single-domain characterization) to truly simultaneous multi-domain transport studies on nanoelectronic materials. The PI proposes that at the nanoscale, mechanical strain breaks down the conventional rules for scattering of electrons and phonons, giving rise to unprecedented coupling among physical domains. The PI will explore the role of extremely small length-scales on such coupling. The concept of extreme dimension-induced coupling will transform the current understanding in materials physics by removing the pre-requisite that special arrangement of atoms are required to exhibit any coupling  (such as only centro-symmetric atoms lead to piezo-electricity) and thereby open a new area of multi-physics of materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: By enabling challenging cross-cutting experimental studies, the research will bridge the existing wide gap between theoretical and experimental studies on nanostructures. The scientific findings of this research will open the area of dimension and strain tunable electron and phonon transport in next generation nanoelectronic devices. The research will be integrated to education by developing education modules at the graduate level, hiring under-represented undergraduate research assistants and performing outreach activities in the State College area school District K-12 classes.</AbstractNarration>
