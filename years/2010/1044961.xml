<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks NSF support for OSDI'10 student travel scholarships. The PIs are requesting $20,000 to support between 20 and 40 students to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;The ninth international USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI'10) will be held in Vancouver, BC, Canada, October 4-6, 2010. The ninth OSDI seeks to present innovative, exciting research in computer systems. OSDI brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in what has become a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implications of systems software. &lt;br/&gt;This award is to make travel scholarships available to students and universities not typically represented at OSDI in order to improve the conferences impact and outreach.</AbstractNarration>
