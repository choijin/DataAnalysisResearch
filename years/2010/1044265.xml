<AbstractNarration>This project provides a series of for-credit, applied learning modules that are given in parallel to the freshman and sophomore calculus courses. The modules are developed and led by faculty members from the Departments of Mathematical Science and Bioengineering. An important component of the project is that advanced undergraduate students serve as peer mentors to the STEM students who are taking the modules. This project recruits participants from all STEM majors with special efforts to recruiting from underrepresented groups such as women, minorities, first-generation college students, and community college transfers. Students have the opportunity to enroll in one applied learning module per semester for up to four semesters. The proposed modules emphasizes mathematics and statistics relevant to four biomedical research areas 1) orthopaedics, 2) infectious diseases, 3) heat propagation in the human body, 4) mammography and radiology. Students participate in field trips to visit facilities and labs related to their module. Each semester students have access to online faculty-developed audio-video materials via the project website.</AbstractNarration>

The project value to STEM goals are found in 1) convincing students through applied learning experiences that mathematics is an important component of any research plan and indispensable to their career success, and (2) ensuring that these students do not falter in calculus and abandon their STEM goals.  Furthermore, we are developing two educational apps (i) EPI-CALC app based on infectious disease module and (ii) another app based on mammography and radiology to reach broader audience including K-12 students and teachers.  We have also presented our work in half a dozen conferences and published half a dozen papers in journals and proceedings disseminating our activities and findings in the project to the greater STEM community.
