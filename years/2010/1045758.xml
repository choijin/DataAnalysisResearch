<AbstractNarration>The United States of America has a history of violence directed towards persons of color.  This project will investigate the ways that grassroots community organizations have tried to address long-standing impacts of racial violence in their communities through a focus on the Greensboro (North Carolina) Truth and Reconciliation Commission (GTRC).  The GTRC was formed in 2000 in response to the shooting of labor activists by individuals associated with the Ku Klux Klan in November 1979.  Those shootings occurred when labor organizers were holding a rally and conference at a local public housing project to protest Ku Klux Klan activities in the area.  As the rally progressed, some members of the local Klan arrived, and during the ensuing violence, five labor activists were killed and several more were wounded.  Despite the efforts of local prosecutors and extensive video evidence of the events, no one was ever held criminally liable for the deaths.  In 1999, local community organizers began advocating formation of a truth and reconciliation process modeled after commissions in South Africa and Peru.  The GTRC was assembled through a grassroots democratic process that sought to integrate a diverse community perspective.  In 2006, the GTRC released its report to the citizens of Greensboro.  Through a broadly conceived qualitative approach that will use open-ended interviews, archival research, and discourse analysis, this research project will explore the results of the GTRC, focusing on the ways that community members addressed the legacy and memory of violence and how violence continues to undergird racial exploitation and frame an understanding of difference in North America.  The majority of relevant research projects focusing on truth processes have examined them outside of a North American context.  The U.S. South is home to a nascent but growing movement to address inequality and legacies of violence through truth and reconciliation commissions, and the Greensboro example may serve as a model for other communities to follow in North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore the connections between the legacy of violence, race, and the construction of space to wider academic scrutiny.  It will assist in more fully examining the legacies of violence and race in North America.  The results of this project will contribute to larger discussions surrounding the impact that violence and race have in North American communities.  For example, the GTRC process may serve other communities who are grappling with the legacies of violence and who wish to create the geographic conditions necessary to accomplish racial reconciliation.  This project therefore will address the issue of racial violence at local, regional, national, and international scales and will contribute broadly to scholarship on race, violence, and space.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project engaged with the first funded and seated truth and reconcilation commissionin the United State in Greensboro, North Carolina.  Research from this project has contirbuted to our understandings of transitional justice, peace work and the continued significance of race and racism for understanding Twenty-first Century US communiites.  The Greensboro Truth Commission centered their project around community building and grassroots democracy and in increasing the participation of Greensboro citizens in local democractic practices.  By integrating restorative justice into a political process that is an attempt to address long-standing tensions in Greensboro,  the Greensboro Truth Commission was able to draw attention to political divisions in the community and attempted to confront legacies of racism and inequality in the city in an effort to heal clevages in the community.    This proejct looked at the successes and failures of the Greensboro Truth Commission.  Thus this project has contributed to understandings of community, democracy, and ways to engage a diverse population in a process foucsed on and around truth processes.  Specifically, as political geographers continue to refine and engage with the geographies of peace, this proejctr makes the case that it is necessary to begin with democratic groups who are working to remake their communities through actually existing justice movements.  As illustrated in Greensboro, the efforts of United States TRCs are examples of diverse communities crafting grassroots responses to unpeaceful conditions and, in the process, expanding our definitions of what peaceful societies might actually look like.   This expands a largely academic debate about the theoretical definition of peace, to one that is grounded in the hard fought realities of struggle and argues that the reality of struggle must become central to our understanding of peace and justice and should serve as our basis for our definitions of peaceful societes.  This creates an understanding of peace that is practical and concrete and will open up myriad more contradictions that academics can use to understand what makes peaceful communities.   In other words, it is necessary to put academic work on peace into a broader and more specific conversation with those structures and systems that lead to differentiated life outcomes and unpeaceful conditions in the first place. Results of this work have been published in several academic journals and this research.  In addition, the PI has given several research presentations to community groups and other groups not usually associated with universities.  This research also funded graduate education and training.         Last Modified: 03/01/2016       Submitted by: Joshua Inwood]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
