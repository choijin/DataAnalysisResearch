<AbstractNarration>This project is developing a Fundamentals of Environmental Engineering Concept Inventory (FEECI) and doing the first round of testing at ten US university campuses with required undergraduate FEE courses.   Project goals also include further refinement of the FEECI and its dissemination. The expected outcome of this work is a validated, reliable instrument for assessing conceptual understanding in a core curriculum course for Civil and/or Environmental engineering. Such an instrument will play an important role in assessment for programmatic accreditation under the ABET standards, and provide a needed technique for formative assessment of instructional methods and pedagogical frameworks in the FEE curriculum. Another important outcome will be the formation of the Development Team, a strong community of faculty, trained in the use of the FEECI and dedicated to improving FEE instruction.&lt;br/&gt;Specific activities and milestones of this project include:&lt;br/&gt;1. On online Delphi study of 14 members of the FEECI Development Team - a group of faculty members from ten universities who have taught FEE courses for many years. The development team is determining the concepts in FEE that are critical but prone to misconception among students;&lt;br/&gt;2. Student interviews and brainstorming sessions to generate a list of critical concepts from the students' perspectives (similar to the guidelines for the faculty generated list); &lt;br/&gt;3. A reconciled list of concepts based on the first two milestones and a draft set of multiple-choice questions for the FEECI;&lt;br/&gt;4. A finalized beta version of the FEECI completed during a face-to-face meeting of the Development Team members at the Association of Environmental Engineering &amp; Science Professors (AEESP) summer meeting;&lt;br/&gt;5. A trial use of the FEECI to students at ten campuses in fall 2011 and spring 2012;&lt;br/&gt;6. A statistical analysis of validity and reliability of the FEECI using data from the ten participating universities;&lt;br/&gt;The draft FEECI questions are being refined based on analysis of test data, student interviews, and expert peer review; Documentation is also being prepared for using the FEECI and guiding the interpretation of the results of its application.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project seeks to develop and validate a Fundamentals of Environmental Engineering Concept Inventory (FEECI) that will be used as an assessment instrument. Fundamentals of Environmental Engineering (FEE) is a core course in programs offering a BS in Civil and/or Environmental Engineering. The FEECI is being developed as a multiple-choice test that emphasizes conceptual understanding of environmental engineering fundamentals as opposed to rote problem solving. Incorrect answers, or distractors, will be used to capture common student misconceptions. The FEECI is being modeled after the Force Concept Inventory developed by Hestenes et al. for Newtonian mechanics, which has been emulated for similar CIs in statics, dynamics, strength of materials, thermodynamics, signals &amp; systems, etc.     The creation of a new instrument requires the gathering of significant amounts of student data and expert opinion in order to identify and then ultimately create items that are representative of the concepts to be measured.  This is where this subaward provided assistance.  This Delphi feature of the ciHUB enables the creation of a blueprint of the targeted conceptual domain and then enables the formation of questions and distractors using an online gathering and vetting system.      The site and virtual community of ciHUB.org grew exponentially and assisted in the assessment of student learning through access of faculty and researchers from all around the world.  At the end of the grant, almost 15,000 users had either used the site as an instructor or a student of a course.  Research has resulted in guidelines on how to develop and implement a better concept inventory in a shorter amount of time.  Educating users as to the benefits and improvements that can occur when critically considering foundational concepts has been an outcome of this funding.  Finally, the site continues to work with others who are interested in using the distribution mechanism for new assessments.
