<AbstractNarration>Solar energetic particle (SEP) events result from solar flares or from shock waves associated with Coronal Mass Ejections.  The particles consist of both ions and electrons that have relativistic energies and reach Earth within minutes to a few hours of the event that initially generated the particles.  Because of their very high energies and the speed with which they reach the Earth, these events represent significant space weather hazards.  Within Earth's magnetosphere there is often a large difference between the eastward and westward fluxes of the energetic particles.  This project will generate a physics-based, quantitative model of the particle fluxes within the magnetosphere at locations where direct observations are unavailable.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The project will utilize global test particle simulations within an empirical magnetosphere mdoel that is driven by the solar wind parameters. The simulations will investigate the electric current systems within the magnetosphere that lead to variations in the geomagnetic cutoffs of the particles.  Data from the GOES geosynchronous satellites will be used to determine the magnitude of the east-west asymmetry.  It will establish statistical relationships between the state of the solar wind and the  relative magnitudes of the eastward and westward particle fluxes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Sporadically, the Sun ejects clouds of charged particles (including electrons, protons and ions of heavier elements such as iron) that pose a radiation hazard to spacecraft and humans in space as well as passengers and crew on commercial flights over the polar caps.  It takes several days for such a cloud (referred to as a solar energetic particle (SEP) event) to pass the EarthÆs location.  The number of SEP events per year depends on the phase (minimum, rising, maximum, and declining) of the eleven-year solar cycle. Although most SEP events occur around solar maximum, some of the largest and most hazardous events have occurred during the declining phase of the solar cycle.  Because of the hazards they pose, SEPs have been monitored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from geostationary weather satellites since the 1970Æs.  Except on rare occasions, geostationary orbit (GEO) lies within the EarthÆs magnetosphere, the volume in space where the motions of charged particles are controlled by the EarthÆs field rather than the interplanetary magnetic field carried by the solar wind.  In this orbit, satellites are partly shielded by the EarthÆs magnetic field from solar protons of less than 100 million electron volts (MeV).  The amount by which they are shielded depends on the proton energy, the observation direction and the local time of the satellite, as well as changes in the magnetosphere.  The overall goal of this research has been to improve our understanding of the shielding of GEO from incoming solar protons, in order eventually to be better able to mitigate the hazards they pose.  One of the specific goals of this research has been to understand better how changing magnetospheric current systems affect the access of SEPs to the magnetosphere.  Several large current systems within the magnetosphere are driven by the solar windÆs interaction with the EarthÆs magnetic field.  Charged particles spiral around the direction of a magnetic field and at some point are turned around if the field is too strong.  Since currents generate magnetic fields, changing magnetospheric currents alter the trajectories of solar ions in the EarthÆs magnetosphere.  If a magnetospheric current causes a decrease in the total field in a local region, solar particles can penetrate further into the magnetosphere through this region.  This tends to happen on the night side, where the processes take place that trigger brilliant auroral displays in the polar regions.  By analyzing data from the NOAA geostationary weather satellites, we have discovered that the access of solar particles increases as the current builds up prior to the rapid release of energy that causes the aurora, then decreases &ndash; not abruptly, but gradually, which itself raises questions about where this release takes place &ndash; possibly at multiple locations in succession.  Using a global magnetospheric magnetic field model that is driven by solar wind observations, we have modeled the access of solar protons to GEO during the large SEP event of 6-11 December 2006.  We used the Tsyganenko-Sitnov 2005 (TS05) model, named after its creators.  While such global models cannot (yet) reproduce the rapid and localized magnetic field changes related to auroral displays, they are constructed from observations of such changes and therefore can be used to simulate the averaged effect of such field changes on solar proton access. A key innovation in the analysis involved averaging the model predictions over the broad energy range and field of view of the observing instrument using measurements from the laboratory calibrations of the instrument.  The model results reproduced the observed solar proton flux time variations well, confirming that models can help us better understand solar proton access to GEO.   One practical byproduct of this research stems from the observation that shielding is decreased when the pressure that the solar wind exerts on the magnetospher...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
