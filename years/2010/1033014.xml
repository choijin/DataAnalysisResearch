<AbstractNarration>This Ethics Education in Science and Engineering project proposes to educate the next generation of product designers and product engineers on the ethical production of products. This proposal focuses on three particular aspects:&lt;br/&gt;1) manufacturing life cycle issues (recycling, packaging, environmental impact) 2) impact on developing countries and emerging markets including humanitarian and environmental concerns 3) advancing technology in products such as privacy concerns or robots in the workplace. Students who have knowledge in all of these disciplines will be uniquely poised to understand the complex ethical issues for products that are often deeply coupled with business and engineering design concerns. This proposal will address this need by using a novel experiential learning approach to educate students in the three focus areas above. Students will experience developing products that impact life in developing countries and emerging market (Ghana, Bangladesh or South Africa) by going there and working with NGO?s and design firms. Students will experience both the creation side and the abuse side of advancing&lt;br/&gt;technology. The impact of this program will extend beyond Penn?s graduate program in three ways. First, other universities have committed to follow successful practices as we discover them. Second, we have six committed local and international industry partners as well as another six NGO?s in process that will both supply context for our students as well as take the results of their work. Third, we will publish multimedia content of the projects and&lt;br/&gt;coursework on the internet. As society begins to grapple with how to evaluate the impact of advancing technology in products and how to respond to them at the level of policy, we will need citizens who are expert in the engineering and well- versed in its ethical and social implications. The proposed program will establish a growing cohort of young product designers who will be familiar with the ethical frameworks and perspectives&lt;br/&gt;that can be brought to bear on the analysis of problems, and be able to apply a methodology to solve problems. Broader impact. At the broadest level, the program will influence the development of manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;techniques and ethics education, bringing awareness of the human impacts of existing manufacturing processes to the design table of the next generation of production processes. It will do so by seeding the next generation&lt;br/&gt;of product designers with individuals who have thought deeply about the societal implications of their work and have learned the basics of ethical manufacturing and high technology product design in the increasingly&lt;br/&gt;global context.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Ongoing educational initiatives   One of our goals is to embed ethics education in a variety of courses offered by the Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics Department at the university. To that end, new course modules were developed for three classes: Design for Manufacturability, Needfinding, and Advanced Mechatronics in Reactive Spaces. These modules explore ethics in product design through a variety of perspectives. In Advanced Mechatronics we explore the development of unethical products and the negative impacts of technology on society. In Design for Manufacturability, we focus on a productÆs impact on the environment. In Needfinding and Advanced Mechatronics, we focus on a productÆs impact on the people it is designed for. Students and faculty explore these issues through experiential activities, assignments and discussions. The ongoing impact of these modules is that ethical implications are on the minds of students as they develop their projects.     In addition, through a series of international research projects, students from the University of Pennsylvania were able to collaborate with students, university faculty and profession practitioners in three different international locations. These experiences provided students with a better understanding of how design manifests in dramatically different locations. Over four years students worked in urban Cape Town in South Africa, canal side slums in Bangkok, Thailand, rural Yonso in Ghana, and health care settings in both rural and urban Ghanaian locations. After each trip the students presented their findings to a broader audience within the university and wrote public blogs to describe their experiences.         Specific Impacts       Examples of impacts include the following: In Cape Town, topics of study included craft-entrepreneurship, water supply, HIV/Aids in informal settlements. Our students collaborated with design practitioners at the local design firm XYZ Ltd. to explore these topics.   In 2012, in Bangkok, our students worked with students from the University of Maryland School of Architecture, Chulalongkorn University (Thailand), Thammasat University (Thailand),, Gensler, Di Design (Thailand), and GDiD (Thailand). The Penn students traveled to Bangkok, Thailand where they conducted research in canal-side slums to develop housing and community concepts aimed at improving quality of life and helping communitiesÆ reach their potential. Ultimately, the solutions focused on supporting income generation, growth and adaptability, improving the urban environment and increasing communication and connectivity within the communities and with the outside world using the local materials and products that were culturally natural. Together, students from the four universities designed a housing concept, a community center and products that community members could produce and sell.  In 2013, Penn students partnered with Bresslergroup, Yonso Project (Ghana), in collaboration with Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST Ghana). Our students traveled to Ghana to work with Yonso Project, with a rural development organization whose mission is to break the cycle of poverty by improving educational and economic opportunities for individuals and families in rural Ghana. One of their programs involves training youth to manufacture bamboo bikes, which  they sell in the United States, Europe and Asia. Our goal in working together was to design new products that would expand the reach of Yonso Project and build their capacity to develop sustainable industries in rural Ghana. During our visit, we learned that products must be produced using local materials and manufacturing capabilities and identified those materials and capacities. We determined that bike accessories would be the best way to expand the Yonso ProjectÆs product family. We also realized that the Yonso ProjectÆs products and its website could do a better job of telling the story of the organi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
