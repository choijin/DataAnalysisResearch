<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposers (QEM) are requesting support to provide technical assistance for three annual meetings of the BRIDGE program's PI '. The group is very experienced at providing technical assistance and holding workshops. They will handle all of the logistics needed for a successful PI meeting. A draft of the proposed agenda is included in the proposal as well as evaluation information and its implementation. The proposal well done, very cost-effective and will benefit young investigators and faculty from minority serving institutions (MSI).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for NSF #1026052  Award Period: 6/1/10 &ndash; 5/31/14  Title: Technical Assistance in the Conduct of the Annual Meetings of BRIGE Principal  Investigators  Principal Investigator: McBay, Shirley M.  Organization: Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network  From 2010 to 2014, with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Award #1026052, the Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network provided technical assistance for three annual meetings of Principal Investigators (PIs) in the Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering (BRIGE) Program. The meetings supported NSF BRIGE Program goals to: (1) promote scientific exchange and understanding of strategies to broaden participation in engineering; and (2) provide networking opportunities to help advance participantsÃ† research, teaching, and mentoring efforts as well as facilitate their building new collaborations.  Over the course of the four-year period, 128 PIs attended the meetings. The meetings were designed to provide BRIGE PIs with opportunities to share their research success and/or challenges in broadening participation activities as well as to network with their program officers and with each other. Plenary sessions included presentations by various NSF Program Directors/NSF Staff on: broadening participation portfolio; assessment and evaluation of BRIGE projects; funding mechanisms at NSF; and the science of broadening participation.  BRIGE meeting participants received information on effective strategies to enhance their research and to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering. The meetings also provided a platform for the PIs with similar interests in engineering to discuss their efforts and potential collaborations with their peers.  QEM utilized both qualitative and quantitative data to assess how well the BRIGE project was meeting its objectives. Prior to each meeting, participants responded to a questionnaire on the impact of the BRIGE funding on their careers, research direction, professional development, and efforts to broaden participation in engineering. Additionally, at the end of each meeting, participants received evaluation questionnaires to solicit feedback regarding their overall rating of the meeting. Of the 115 questionnaire respondents, at least 82 percent gave the meetings an overall rating of excellent or very good.  Participants were encouraged to share information and materials with colleagues at their institutions. Meeting participants also received a resource CD and a meeting packet that they could share with colleagues. Resource CD topics included information on broadening participation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), project evaluation, engineering education, and mentoring students.  Under the leadership of President Shirley McBay, the QEM Network was established in 1990 as a non-profit organization in Washington, DC, dedicated to improving education for minorities throughout the nation. QEM works with minority and non-minority individuals, organizations, and institutions to help coordinate and energize efforts to improve the education of minorities, particularly in STEM.
