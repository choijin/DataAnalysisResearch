<AbstractNarration>Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are ones that integrate computation, communication and storage capabilities with the monitoring and/or control of the physical and engineering systems. Such systems must be operated safely, dependably, securely, efficiently and in real-time. CPS research is expected to have significant technical, economic and societal &lt;br/&gt;impacts in the near future in multiple sectors including transportation systems, smart grids, energy-aware buildings, agriculture, water/sewage treatment, environmental management and manufacturing systems.  A core aspect of CPS is its multidisciplinary nature requiring the teamwork, cooperation and collaboration of experts including computer scientists, hardware engineers, control experts, software engineers, network specialists, computer architects, sensor experts, electrical engineers, material engineers, and structural engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is for support for student travel to CPS Week 2010 and the First International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS) to be held April 12-16, 2010 in Stockholm, SWEDEN and some start-up activities for the inaugural ICCPS.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the goals are three-fold: &lt;br/&gt;1. Encourage attendance at CPS Week 2010 by students based in the US to listen to and learn from the keynote speeches, presentations, posters and demos on cutting-edge topics on cyber-physical systems. &lt;br/&gt;2. Promote the robust growth of a research community in the nascent area of cyber-physical systems. &lt;br/&gt;3. Support activities of the inaugural ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems, whose aim is to become a main forum for hosting original research which targets the inter-disciplinary nature of cyber-physical systems.  The specific areas of interactions across embedded systems, hybrid systems, real-time systems and sensor networks are of interest in this forum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS) is a new conference that is jointly sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the two premium international professional organizations for electrical/electronics engineers and computer scientists respectively.   Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are systems that have a tight integration between the cyber aspects of computing/communications and the physical aspects of the real world which are governed by the laws of physics, chemistry and biology. Cyber-physical systems are expected to have a major impact in many key economic domains including aerospace, transportation (including automobiles, public transit and marine transit), manufacturing, process control, healthcare and smart power grids.  CPS research is a major research initiative launched by the National Science Foundation and it has now garnered an international research community that is avidly pursuing research activities to make sure that deployed CPS are not only built cost-effectively but also operate in a safe, reliable and secure fashion.  This funding from the National Science Foundation was used to seed the growth of the ICCPS Community by encouraging CPS researchers and their students based in the US to attend an international event named CPS Week.   CPS Week is a co-location of five major CPS-related conferences, among which ICCPS is the youngest and the only one focusing on all aspects of CPS with a particular emphasis on multi-disciplinary integration, that is at the heart of CPS.
