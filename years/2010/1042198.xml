<AbstractNarration>This project is to utilize a combination of space- and ground-based data to characterize the relationship between lightning current and transient luminous events (TLEs), which are the visual manifestation of upward energy coupling between the troposphere and upper atmosphere.   Specifically, this project will conduct detailed, event-level analysis of TLE observations using high time resolution optical and electromagnetic measurements in order to assess the effects of internal TLE structure and dynamics on mesospheric state parameters.  In addition, satellite optical data will be used in conjunction with a network of ground-based electromagnetic measurements to obtain a global mapping of tropospheric sources of TLEs and associated responses in the mesosphere.  The goal of this effort is to provide a foundation for evaluating possible local, regional, and global effects of TLEs in the upper atmosphere and to provide better specification of the background electromagnetic environment where they initiate and propagate.  This work will support the education and research training of a graduate student as well as involve research participation by undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project was to use measurements of the radio emissions from lightning to answer some specific open scientific questions about the mechanisms and impact of lightning on the upper atmosphere.  This impact is observed visually through a number of different phenomena, including sprites and gigantic jets.  Our basic understanding of how these high altitude processes are created and what they do to the upper atmosphere is far from complete.  By improving our understanding of the basic phenomena, we improve our understanding of the impact of lightning on the atmosphere and also better understand the potential hazards posed by these processes.  This research effort produced a number of scientific firsts.  Our combined optical and radio measurements, including those from collaborators, were the first to show how the detailed structure of lightning channels in the cloud influence the high altitude structure of sprites and thus their impact on the upper atmosphere.  These measurements have significantly improved our understanding of the thunderstorm conditions that produce these events.  We also performed the first direct testing of theoretical models of these phenomena by using measurements to drive the simulations, and then comparing the model output with the observations.  This project continuously supported one PhD student, one undergraduate student, and one postdoctoral researcher, and thus served as a successful opportunity to provide further training to these participants in STEM-related fields.  We worked hard to disseminate our results and findings as widely as possible in both scientific publications and in the popular media.  Over the lifetime of this grant our research was highlighted in many on-line articles and several print articles including Science News and Scientific American.
