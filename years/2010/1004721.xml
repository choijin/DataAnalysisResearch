<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This fellowship occured from 2010 until 2014 and supported a variety of publications.  The work "On the Riemann Surface Type of Random Planar Maps" with S. Rohde described the almost sure parabolicity of a variety of random planar maps including the Uniform Infinite Planar Triangulation of O. Angel and O. Schramm.  The work "A note on quasiconformal maps with Holder-continuous dilatation" with S. Rohde provided a different proof for and an extension of the work of J. Mateu, J. Orobitg, and J.

Bjorn, J. Bjorn, and N. Shanmugalingam discusses the interplay of different function spaces on trees and their visual boundaries: Cantor sets.  The work "Discrete approximations of metric measure spaces of controlled geometry" focuses on the persistence of Poincare inequalities in discretized versions of metric spaces.  This work was with M. Lopez and was a significant proportion of his Ph.D. thesis.  The work "Doubling metric spaces are characterized by a lemma of Benjamini and Schramm" shows that a key property of Euclidean space useful for describing several random surfaces is actually equivalent to the concept of doubling metric spaces.  In addition to these publications, the funding of this award supported the PI at various conferences and research visits, including a month long visit to IPAM in Los Angeles.
