<AbstractNarration>The Gattini network consists of three cameras located at the high-altitude Antarctic sites Dome C, Dome A, and South Pole. These star transit cameras monitor wide areas of the Southern sky, taking an image every 5-15 minutes throughout the entire Antarctic winter season. The network has been in operation since the Antarctic 2006 winter season. The award is for the data reduction and subsequent publication of results obtained from more than 3 TB (terabytes) data sets collected by this network to date. The data reduction program will focus on two distinct areas: (1) obtaining photometric light curves of the brightest and most interesting long-period variable stars in the Southern sky, which have known parallaxes and other parameters, and are unique stars with no counterparts in the Kepler spacecraft field; and (2) producing astronomical site testing results that are critical for validating high-altitude Antarctic sites to allow planning of future large astronomical facilities. The broader impacts of this project are in its involvement of an undergraduate student in the project data processing and analyses, as well as the Gattini camera network unique science results could be critical for the validation of future major projects in Antarctic astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

Our results support the growing experimental evidence that high Antarctic sites such as Dome A offer a unique ground-based observing location. Such locations are far superior to temperate sites for visible observations needing continual coverage and high levels of calibration. The sky brightness values measured during the dark time are as good as any temperate location. The percentage of images that are "photometric", that are images taken in excellent conditions, is significantly larger than even the best temperate sites such as Mauna Kea.  Sixty-six light curves with pronounced variability were identified from the data. The light curves are unique because of the continuous time span offered by the Antarctic location.  The accuracy of the light curves is superb (30 millionths of a magnitude per image) and greatly exceeds our expectation given the specifications of the instrument. It is now possible to consider searching for exo-planets in the data. The discovery of an exo-planet in this bright star data set would be spectacular due to the potential for substantial follow-up imaging and spectroscopy using larger telescopes.  A graduate student wrote the data reduction pipeline for this project.
