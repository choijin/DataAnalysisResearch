<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award allowed me to study the dynamics of dust particles near asteroids in Japan. I chose to conduct this research in Japan because the Japanese Hayabusa spacecraft brought samples of asteroid dust back to Earth in June 2010 (immediately prior to my arrival in Japan). Asteroids, like the Moon, are covered with a fine layer of dust. It has been hypothesized that this dust may move in response to electrostatic forces, basically levitating above the surface of the asteroid or the Moon. There were three major research questions that I addressed while in Japan: 1. Can micrometeoroid bombardment explain some of our observations of dust near the Moon&rsquo;s surface? 2.

It was thought that this glow was due to very small (about 1/10 the width of a hair) dust particles floating above the Moon&rsquo;s surface.

However, our research shows that it is unlikely that the electrostatic forces are strong enough for this to occur. Thus, there had to be another method of getting dust off the surface of the Moon in order to produce the Surveyor observations. The Moon and asteroids are constantly hit by micrometeoroids, which are very small rocks. When a micrometeoroid hits an airless body, some dust particles are released (like when you drop a rock into a bucket of sand). We wanted to test if dust particles released through micrometeoroid bombardment could release enough dust to produce the Surveyor observations.

Whether or not dust levitation occurs is an important question because it could explain some observations of the Moon and asteroids.
