<AbstractNarration>Professor Donald Perry of the University of Central Arkansas is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the layer by layer growth of films of small organic molecules on silver and gold nanostructures.  The metal will be evaporated on salt plates and films will be grown with the substrate at different incident angles to the metal evaporation source.  The polar properties of the deposition solvents and other growth conditions will be judiciously varied to control the orientations, intermolecular interactions, and degree of ionization of the organic molecules within the molecular layers on the metal nanostructures.  The resulting metal nanostructures will be characterized with surface analytical microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, and will be investigated for their enhancement of the spectra in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will contribute to the knowledge base in metal nanoparticle interactions with organic matter, organisms and the environment, and will impact the fabrication of organic and biochemical layers of specific architectures on nanoscale silver and gold surfaces with applications in areas such as catalysis, drug delivery, and tissue engineering.  The research will also impact the career of undergraduate students by introducing them to many aspects of nanomaterials that are not typically discussed within traditional class rooms.  Furthermore, the involvement of undergraduates in research will motivate students to choose careers in scientific fields in Arkansas where only 18% of the population has a four-year college degree.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project explored how small metal particles (nanoparticles) interact and alter the growth and chemistry of thin films of important chemical compounds.  New ways of creating metal nanoparticles were developed.  These included different types of silver, copper, gold, and nickel nanoparticles.  The project also investigated how the presence of metal nanoparticles alter the attractive forces between individual molecules of the compound in thin layers.  A long-term goal of this project and other similar projects in nanoscience was to learn how to use metal nanoparticles to develop and control new types of chemistry for possibilities that benefit society.  Organic and biological chemicals we have studied are important in practical areas such as pesticides, herbicides, analgesics, antibiotics, preservatives, lubricants, explosives, dyes, cosmetics, toxicity studies, and various processes that occur in soil, plants,  or the human body.  Merging the properties of metal nanoparticles with the existing attributes of the chemical compounds has the chance to not only improve the use of the substance in question, but such merging is leading to new applications.  For example, combining the antimicrobial properties of an existing antibiotic with the antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles has the potential to overcome bacterial resistance to the antibiotic.  The project had an enormous educational component for the eleven undergraduate students involved in the research including: Reece Borchers, TsungYen Chen, Jon Golden, Will Henry, Elyhab Kwizera, Aaron Owen, Ryan Parker, Adam Price, Katie Primm, Taylor Razor, and Jenna Shamburger.  All of these students have either continued on to medical school, dental school, pharmacy school, graduate school in chemistry, or have taken on positions in industry or government.
