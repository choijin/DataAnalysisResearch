<AbstractNarration>Alenka Luzar of Virginia Commonwealth University is supported by an award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in CHE,  the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory program and the Polymer Program in DMR and the Interfacial Processes and Thermodynamics Program in CBET for activities related to  a graduate student seminar entitled "Inaugural Faraday Discussion Graduate Research Seminar (FD-GRS) on Wetting of Structured Surfaces".  This workshop will take place on the weekend prior to   Faraday discussion 146: Wetting Dynamics of Hydrophobic and Structured Surfaces. This is the first Faraday discussion to be held in the U. S.  The purpose of the student seminar is to prepare the students to participate more fully in the Faraday Discussion so as to create a more inclusive meeting and provide a more positive experience for the young scientists who attend.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary research field of the meeting covers chemical, physical, materials and engineering aspects of interface science. The goal of the FD- GRS is to encourage social and intellectual interaction among the youngest scientists representing the many facets of research in the field. This is an exciting opportunity for students at all levels and with diverse background and research experience to be able to share the practical experiences behind their achievements, as well as discuss the frontiers of their science. The international character of the meeting is a key to providing participants with a broader perspective on international research than would otherwise be possible at this early stage in their career.</AbstractNarration>
