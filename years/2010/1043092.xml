<AbstractNarration>Steig/1043092&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to contribute one of the cornerstone analyses, stable isotopes of ice (Delta-D, Delta-O18) to the ongoing West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide (WAIS) deep ice core. The WAIS Divide drilling project, a multi-institution project to obtain a continuous high resolution ice core record from central West Antarctica, reached a depth of 2560 m in early 2010; it is expected to take one or two more field seasons to reach the ice sheet bed (~3300 m), plus an additional four seasons for borehole logging and other activities including proposed replicate coring.  The current proposal requests support to complete analyses on the WAIS Divide core to the base, where the age will be ~100,000 years or more. These analyses will form the basis for the investigation of a number of outstanding questions in climate and glaciology during the last glacial period, focused on the dynamics of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the relationship of West Antarctic climate to that of the Northern polar regions, the tropical Pacific, and the rest of the globe, on time scales ranging from years to tens of thousands of years. One new aspect of this work is the growing expertise at the University of Washington in climate modeling with isotope-tracer-enabled general circulation models, which will aid in the interpretation of the data. Another major new aspect is the completion and use of a high-resolution, semi-automated sampling system at the University of Colorado, which will permit the continuous analysis of isotope ratios via laser spectroscopy, at an effective resolution of ~2 cm or less, providing inter-annual time resolution for most of the core. Because continuous flow analyses of stable ice isotopes is a relatively new measurement, we will complement them with parallel measurements, every ~10-20 m, using traditional discrete sampling and analysis by mass spectrometry at the University of Washington.  The intellectual merit and the overarching goal of the work are to see Inland WAIS become the reference ice isotope record for West Antarctica.  The broader impacts of the work are that the data generated in this project pertain directly to policy-relevant and immediate questions of the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and thus past and future changes in sea level, as well as the nature of climate change in the high southern latitudes. The project will also contribute to the development of modern isotope analysis techniques using laser spectroscopy, with applications well beyond ice cores. The project will involve a graduate student and postdoc who will work with both P.I.s, and spend time at both institutions. Data will be made available rapidly through the Antarctic Glaciological Data Center, for use by other researchers and the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved analysis of the isotopes of water on an ice core from Antartica.  The ice core was drilled near the highest point of the West Antarctic ice sheet, to a depth of 3300 meters.  The isotopes of water refer to the ratio of heavy and light oxygen and hydrogen, referred to as the "deltaD" and "delta18O" values.  The delta18O and deltaD measurements provide information on the temperature in the past.  The delta18O and deltaD  from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide (WAIS Divide) are the highest resolution records of past temperature ever obtained in Antarctica, other than short records that go back in time a few thousand years.  The WAIS Divide data records 68,000 years.  The project has significantly advanced our understanding of the relationship between global and polar climate, and between polar climate and Antarctic ice sheet change.  Some of the important results include the following:  Precise characterization of the phase relationship of millennial-scale climate variations between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres &ndash; the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) and Antarctic Isotope Maximum (AIM) events -- (WAIS Divide Project Members, 2015; Markle et al., 2017).  The results show that there is an approximatey too hundred year lag beetwen rapid temperature change in the Northern Hemisphere and the slower temperature change in the Southern Hemisphere that follows.   This lag is because of the time it takes for the signal of Northern Hemisphere change to propagate through the ocean.  The results also demonstrate that there is a much faster link between the hemisheres that affects the wind over the Southern Ocean in a few decades or less, but does not appear to significantly affect Antarctic temperature.  Precise temperature measurements based on the combinaton of water isotopes and borehole thermometry (Orsi et al., 2012; Steig and Orsi, 2013) confirming the earlier controversial discovery of rapid warming in West Antarctica and providing the most precise measurement of the glacial-interglacial temperature change to date.  This project also involved the development, testing, and refinement of a state-of-the art continuous-flow system for water isotope measurements. The result of that work is the first complete continuous high-resolution water-isotope record from a deep ice core, with an effective sampling resolution of less than 5 mm.  These high-resolution data have broadened the use of ice-core water isotopes in new ways, including the ability to characterize the variabilit of climate on annual timescales, thousands of years in the past.  Among the findings from that work is that the magnitude of climate variability in Antartica was about twice as large during the last glacial period as it is today.
