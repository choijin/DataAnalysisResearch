We were interested in studying interlimb transfer &ndash; the ability of what is learned with one arm to influence movement of the other arm &ndash; of adaptation to position- and velocity-dependent force fields. While there has been much work on investigating adaptation to force fields based on the velocity of the subject's hand, fewer studies have implemented force fields based on position. A better understanding of how humans learn and adapt their movements will improve our fundamental knowledge of human motor control and can potentially aid in the rehabilitation of people with motor control disorders.  In our studies, a bimanual robotic device (Figure 1) applied position- and velocity-dependent forces to a userÃ†s arm during reaching movements. Each subject was first trained in the force field with either their dominant or nondominant arm. The opposite arm was then tested in a force field equivalent in either Cartesian space or joint space. If performance is improved after having trained with the opposite arm in the force field, interlimb transfer is considered to have occurred.  One major finding of our work was how our experimental results differed from previously reported findings. Previous work has shown that if one adapts to a velocity-dependent curl force field with the dominant arm, subsequent performance in the same force field in Cartesian space is improved for the non-dominant arm.
