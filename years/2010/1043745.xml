<AbstractNarration>The research will explore the genetics, diversity, and biogeography of Antarctic marine benthic invertebrates, seeking to overturn the widely accepted suggestion that benthic fauna do not constitute a large, panmictic population.  The investigators will sample adults and larvae from undersampled regions of West Antarctica that, combined with existing samples, will provide significant coverage of the western hemisphere of the Southern Ocean.  The objectives are: 1) To assess the degree of genetic connectivity (or isolation) of benthic invertebrate species in the Western Antarctic using high-resolution genetic markers. 2) To begin exploring planktonic larvae spatial and bathymetric distributions for benthic shelf invertebrates in the Bellinghausen, Amundsen and Ross Seas. 3) To continue to develop a Marine Antarctic Genetic Inventory (MAGI) that relates larval and adult forms via DNA barcoding.  Broader impacts include traditional forms of training (postdocs, graduate studentships, undergraduate research experiences) and lectures to K-12 groups.</AbstractNarration>

However, knowledge of distribution and biodiversity patterns of benthic marine invertebrates in the continental waters of Antarctica is limited. Over the course this grant we have been exploring hypotheses about the biodiversity of Antarctic marine invertebrates.  Two major, long held biogeographic assumptions about Antarctic marine invertebrates is that oceanographic features restricts species to the waters around Antarctica and that, within the waters of the Antarctic, species are circumpolar (meaning a species are distributed completely around the Antarctic continent).
