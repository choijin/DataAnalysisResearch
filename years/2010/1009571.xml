<AbstractNarration>This project will explore the mechanisms responsible for supernova explosions of the Type II-P ("plateau") type.  These arise from isolated red supergiant stars with initial masses ranging from 8 to 16 times the mass of the Sun.  Current data on a limited number of these events suggest that the mechanism produces strongly non-spherical explosions.  Dr. Leonard will conduct new observations of polarized light from type II-P supernovae and will re-analyze data from earlier events. He and collaborators will also compare the data against theoretical models developed specifically for this type of supernova, with the goal of determining whether the explosion geometry of red supergiants is the same for all Type II-P events and to discover what that geometry is. The result will form a key discriminant for stellar explosion models at the lower end of the high-mass star sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve training graduate and undergraduate students in the acquisition, analysis, and publication of scientific data. To provide light curve information critical to the success of the spectropolarimetry program, the PI will exploit the research capabilities of his department's newly upgraded Mount Laguna Observatory facility by initiating a student-led program of optical and near-infrared photometric studies of supernovae.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Roughly once per second in the observable universe, a massive star's inner core implodes under its own weight and then explodes as a supernova, announcing its demise with an optical display that for weeks rivals the combined brilliance of all of the billions of other stars in its parent galaxy.  These explosions synthesize and expel heavy elements, heat the interstellar medium, trigger vigorous bursts of star formation, create neutron stars and sometimes black holes, and produce energetic cosmic rays.  As Carl Sagan famously said, "We are made of star stuff", and it is not an exaggeration to say that without supernovae to litter the universe with the raw materials out of which Earth-like planets and, ultimately, people have formed, we would not be here at all.   And yet we must acknowledge basic ignorance: We do not know how these stars explode.  Conventional wisdom posits a spherical "shock wave" that expels the stellar envelope, but how this shock pummels its way out of, and ultimately ejects, the massive stellar envelope, is the flashpoint of controversy --- in computer simulations, spherical shocks inevitably lose too much energy and stall in the envelope, unable to successfully explode the star.  On the other hand, recent computer simulations in which strongly directed jets of material are postulated to be formed during the collapse process have proven very capable of producing robust stellar explosions.  Unlike the conventional model, such an explosion mechanism clearly predicts severe distortions from spherical symmetry.  A basic test to decide between such models thus exists.  Namely, is the explosion spherical?  While simple to pose, this question belies a menacing observational challenge, since all distant supernovae remain point-like in the night sky throughout the critical, early phases of their evolution, so that their geometry can not be discerned by simply imaging the explosion.  Fortunately, there is a measurable property of the light coming from an exploded star that can reveal the fundamental nature of its geometry: Its "polarization".  Essentially, the degree of polarization of the light tells us whether the explosion is spherical (i.e., measuring 0% polarization) or not (i.e., measuring some number greater than 0% for the polarization).  In general, larger degrees of polarization represent greater departures from spherical symmetry.  This project sought to systematically measure the polarization levels for the most common class of stellar explosions -- those arising from "red supergiant" stars (like the star Betelgeuse in the shoulder of the constellation Orion) -- in an effort to better understand the nature of the explosion mechanism itself. This type of supernovae is referred to as "Type II-Plateau" (II-P), and we were thus essentially seeking the answer to the question: "Are Type II-P Supernovae Round"?  Under this project, the PI and his students embarked on a several-year effort to obtain new polarization data on the closest (and, hence, brightest) Type II-P supernovae, in addition to uniformly analyzing data taken earlier.  The result? Nearly all Type II-P supernovae, if examined in sufficient detail and for sufficiently long periods of time, revealed fundamental evidence for asymmetry in the explosion.  While the degree and timing of the polarization indicated stronger asymmetries further out in the explosion for some events than for others, the detailed polarization characteristics were remarkably similar, one event to the next.  In tandem with our observations, detailed computer modeling was also carried out, and the results suggest a generic, and asymmetric, explosion mechanism -- i.e., one that is the same for all events. What this precise mechanism is is the subject of intense investigation going forward, but all such models are now subject to the constraint that the mechanism must break spherical symmetry.  Most of the polarimetric observations carried out under this project were obtained usi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
