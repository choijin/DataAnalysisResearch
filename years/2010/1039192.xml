<AbstractNarration>Oregon State University (OSU), the University of Oregon (UO), and Portland State University (PSU) are collaborating on a comprehensive, highly integrated examination of hydrological, ecological, and socio-economic factors in the Willamette River Basin.  The team is applying  Envision, a theoretical framework developed at OSU, to evaluate how climate change, population growth, and economic growth will alter the availability and the use of water in the Willamette River Basin. Envision provides a computing environment in which state-of-the-art hydrological, ecological, and socio-economic models can interact synergistically. Envision also contains a multi-agent-based modeling component that enables it to represent the impact of human decision-making on landscape change. The team is addressing the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Identify and quantify the linkages and feedbacks among hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic dimensions of the water system.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Determine where and when climate change and human activities will create water scarcities.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Evaluate a broad range of strategies that could enable this region to prevent, mitigate, or adapt to water scarcities.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Create a transferable method of predicting where climate change will create water scarcities in other regions and where those scarcities would exert the strongest impact on human society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team is collaborating with public officials, resource managers, and other stakeholders with strong interest in protecting ecosystems and water resources. Commissioners from the thirteen counties that make up the Willamette River Basin, as well as representatives of the Governor's Office, the Oregon Water Resources Department, the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, are involved to help to understand their needs and perspectives, to identify scenarios, and to interpret results. Working with these public officials, the team will help them translate the results of the research into planning and decision making processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team is preparing to disseminate Envision through some UNESCO HELP basins. In the outyears, the team will work with the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, to transfer Envision to researchers in UNESCO HELP basins, possibly including the Blue Nile in Ethiopia and the Olifants River in South Africa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[INTRODUCTION Like many places in the American West, the Willamette River Basin (WRB) faces issues such as declining snowpacks, stressed forests, increasing wildfires, urban growth, increased agricultural demands, warming rivers, and endangered fish. Unlike many places in the West, our unique Willamette Envision model, our engaged stakeholder community, and the fact that water is not currently a crisis here, have made it possible for us to better understand how future supplies of, and demands for, water are likely to influence water scarcity. The model allowed us to explore alternative scenarios of land and water use and policy in future decades with a wide range of options available to manage scarcity. We modeled both the key biophysical processes and the most important socio-economic processes, for a range of assumptions about trends and responses incorporated into 20 scenarios under a range of alternative assumptions and future conditions. The model operates on a daily basis and spans nine decades from 2010 to 2099. KEY FINDINGS  Finding 1: In the mountains that are the source area for water supply,  climate change is the primary driver of water scarcity. Warmer  conditions caused by climate change will reduce winter snowpack, stress  forests, and increase wildfires by as much as ninefold. Low snowpack and hotter, drier summers lead to a two- to nine-times increase in land area burned by forest wildfires. The fires open up lands to transition to new forest types better suited to the changing climate. Total evapotranspiration from the upland forests may decrease rather than increase. Finding 2: In the Willamette valley where water is needed for farms,  cities, and ecosystems, future scarcity depends predominantly on human  factors such as population growth, land use practices, and water law. With a doubling of population, urban water demand could rise by 88% over the century. Farmers can irrigate only if they have or can obtain an irrigation water right, and they will only choose to irrigate where it is profitable to do so. In our simulations that introduced new water rights tied to stored water, the increase in irrigated acreage was very limited due to the high cost of conveyance. Two factors could reduce water use from agriculture and urban sectors: (1) the warmer spring climate allows earlier planting and harvest, reducing late summer irrigation demands; (2) expanding cities will displace some irrigated agriculture, and will likely offset some increase in urban water demand.  Finding 3: The 13 federal dams on the Willamette River provide the biggest  single mechanism to mitigate water scarcity over the next 90 years;  however, with a growing population the importance of the reservoirs for  winter flood risk reduction will also rise. Reservoir management will  likely need to adapt to changes in seasonal flows and competing  downstream water needs.      Over the 21st century, our simulations show increases in  winter and spring runoff into reservoirs and decreases in early summer  with climate warming. This is due to a shift in precipitation from snow  to rain, earlier snowmelt, and reduced upland forest ET in spring due to  forest loss from wildfires. Concurrently, the simulations show increasing shortfalls from full reservoir storage during the summer. Lower summer reservoir water levels led to a  loss of economic benefits from reservoir recreation. However, that loss  was far exceeded by the value of flood mitigation that the dams provide in the Willamette Valley. We estimate current  flood mitigation benefits at more than a billion dollars annually and  expect these benefits to triple by 2100 with economic growth and urban  expansion. Our data suggest that the  likelihood of occurrence of native cold-water species, such as juvenile Chinook salmon, would decrease substantially if future river temperature increases by 2&deg; C (3.6&deg; F) or more.      Finding 4: Water scarcity will not occur uniformly across the basin. The  tributary basins may respond to climate change, population, and income  growth differently depending on local differences in both human and  natural dynamics.  Our model results highlight how water availability varies with geography. Tributaries that drain the Coast Range have a more muted response to climate change than those that are fed by spring snowmelt or abundant groundwater,  most of which are located in the High Cascades. Sub-basins with built  reservoirs and/or significant groundwater can maintain higher summer  flows than those without such water storage. Water scarcity in upland  basins is mainly driven by climate change while changes in water  scarcity in the valley are affected not only by climate change but also  by economic decisions about land use and water use. Finding 5: By providing a forum for learning and fostering relationships  between water managers, the project helped build capacity in the basin  to address future water scarcity. An important factor related to the continued participation of  stakeholders during the project was the experience or perception of  being heard and valued as contributors.
