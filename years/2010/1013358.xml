<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop and establish a straightforward algal bio-fuels platform that will produce both hydrogen and bio-fuel in the form of biodiesel from domestically grown biomass. The produced hydrogen can be used for industrial applications while the produced biodiesel can be used to satisfy transportation needs, thus enabling greater energy self sufficiency in an environmentally responsible manner. Production of these bio-fuels in this manner represents a major departure from current technology of producing them from fossil fuels, thereby reducing the Nation?s dependence on imported fuels. Ultimately, the team will develop pilot scale data (1-1.5 liters) and use the empirical data to define economic rationale for scale up.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to establish baseline values for the hydrogen and bio-fuel production from pilot scale facilities, potentially reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from fertilizer production.</AbstractNarration>
