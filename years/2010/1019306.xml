<AbstractNarration>This synthesis project is a systematic review of experimental research evaluating programs and practices in elementary science. The systematic review addresses all areas of science in the elementary grades. Different versions of the synthesis are written for audiences of researchers, policy makers, principals, and teachers. The review uses an adaptation of best-evidence synthesis previously applied to elementary and secondary mathematics and reading, and includes experimental and quasi-experimental research on the outcomes of alternative approaches to elementary science. The review is a part of a series of reviews that are part of the Best Evidence Encyclopedia (BEE), an on-line resource that disseminates systematic reviews of research on achievement outcomes of programs at all subject areas and grade levels (see www.bestevidence.org), and is led by Robert Slavin of Johns Hopkins University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The review is carried out by a US-UK partnership of science educators and experts on systematic reviews of research. An advisory group of scientists, science educators, and experts on research review oversees the design of the review, monitors review procedures, and comments on drafts. This review takes a broad approach to searching the literature in order to locate every study that meets inclusion requirements for valid research. It includes electronic searches of educational databases (JSTOR, ERIC, EBSCO, Psych INFO, Dissertation Abstracts) using different combinations of key words (for example, "elementary students" and "science achievement"), covering the years 1970-2010. Results are narrowed by subject area (for example, "educational software", "science achievement", "instructional strategies"). Web-based repositories and education publishers' websites are included. The review also discusses each study that meets the inclusion requirements for a valid research design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strength of this work is that it takes on the synthesis of what is known about best practice for elementary science education, relying only on studies that meet the criteria for inclusion as having credible research designs. This is a review that is sorely needed in the field of science education. The lengthy and detailed review will be available on the BEE network, along with educator-friendly summaries. The work is also vetted via publication in a top, peer-reviewed journal. The study will include a set of tables showing ratings of programs according to consistent criteria in terms of the strength of the evidence base for each, with brief descriptions of the methods and findings. This educators' summary, patterned on Consumer Reports, is intended primarily for superintendents, principals, and teachers who are making choices among programs for implementation with their children.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Effective Programs in Elementary Science: A Best-Evidence Synthesis*  *NSF has neither reviewed nor endorsed the enclosed content  This study systematically reviewed research on the achievement outcomes of all types of approaches to teaching science in elementary schools. Study inclusion criteria included use of randomized or matched control groups, a study duration of at least 4 weeks, and use of achievement measures independent of the experimental treatment.   Inquiry-oriented programs without science kits. Eight qualifying studies found significant positive effects of inquiry-oriented professional development on conventional measures of science achievement, with a sample size-weighted mean effect size of +0.30. These studies provided extensive professional development in effective science teaching, emphasizing conceptual challenge, cooperative learning, science-reading integration, teaching scientific vocabulary, and use of an inquiry learning cycle.  Inquiry-oriented programs with science kits. A surprising finding from the largest and best-designed of the studies is the limited achievement impact of programs that provide teachers with kits to help them make regular use of hands-on, inquiry-oriented activities. The weighted overall mean effect size across four qualifying studies of science kit programs was only +0.02.  Technology programs. Five qualifying studies of technology applications all show significant promise (ES=+0.37). These approaches were characterized by the use of video or computer graphics to illustrate scientific processes; active inquiry using technology tools; integration of technology, teaching, and group work among students; and efforts to make science content motivating and relevant to students.  A major finding of this review is the fact that there are very few rigorous experimental evaluations of elementary science programs. After an exhaustive search involving examination of 327 published and unpublished articles, only 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. In light of the small number of qualifying studies, it must be acknowledged that any conclusions about the findings of these studies can only be tentative.  The evidence from studies that met the inclusion criteria supports a view that improving outcomes in elementary science depends on improving teachersÆ skills in presenting lessons, engaging and motivating students, and integrating science and reading. Technology applications that help teachers teach more compelling lessons and that use video to reinforce lessons also have promise.              Far more research and development are needed to identify effective and replicable approaches to improving science achievement for elementary students.
