<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to create a postdoctoral research program at the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) focused on problems and issues directly supportive of the mission of the Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is a novel approach of engaging two post-docs housed at NISS to improve the statistical methodologies used in SRS and other Federal statistical surveys while simultaneously being developed as survey practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

It also exposed three early career researchers, as postdoctoral fellows, to the excitement and challenges of working with NCSES data (and official statistics data more generally).
