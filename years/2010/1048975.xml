<AbstractNarration>The objective of the workshop is to establish the fundamental research challenges for trustworthy biometric systems in identity management.  The link between biological identity as we know it today and our digital persona is rapidly changing where transactions in the cyberspace rely on establishment of trust.  The intersection between personal identity, biometrics (measured identity), and identity in cyberspace is the topic of this workshop.  In cyberspace, there is opportunity to create multiple digital identities (or pseudonyms) to one human identity, where guarded anonymity and privacy preserving tools are needed which provide levels of trust and scale in the information content linked to true identity.  Biometrics, based on physiologic or behavioral measurements, is a technology that fundamentally ties an individual to a transaction/location and may be a tool to establish trust enabling identity management for a wide array of applications, including border control, information technology, e-commerce, and war-time environments. There is a need to develop methodologies that address privacy, acceptability, usability, and security of stored and transmitted biometric information.  The proposed workshop will bring a team of interested individuals from academia, government, and industry to discuss fundamentals and future directions in identity science related to privacy, trust, and security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded a workshop entitled "Fundamental Research Challenges for Trustworthy Biometrics" , held November 8 and 9, 2010 at the American Trucking Association in Arlington, VA.    Over fifty people attended from across academics, government, and industry.  The objective was to establish the fundamental research challenges for trustworthy biometric systems in identity management.   The link between biological identity as we know it today and our digital persona is rapidly changing where transactions in the cyberspace rely on establishment of trust.    The intersection between personal identity, biometrics (measured identity), and identity in cyberspace is the topic of this workshop.  In cyberspace, there is opportunity to create multiple digital identities to one human identity (Figure 1).  Anonymity and privacy preserving tools are needed to protect information content linked to true identity.  Biometrics, based on physiologic or behavioral measurements, is a technology that fundamentally ties an individual to a transaction/location.  Biometrics is one factor in multi-factor authentication based on combinations of something you have, something you know, and something you are.  There is a need to develop approaches that address privacy, acceptability, usability, and security of stored and transmitted biometric information.  Leveraging research across the government, there is a need to establish scientific fundamentals of biometrics, as well as research at the intersection of identity management and cyberspace.  Following the workshop, a website was prepared which provides the slides from the workshop and summary slides provided by each of the panels (http://www.clarkson.edu/nsfbiometrics2010).  The results of the workshop were presented at a workshop for preparation of The National Biometrics Challenge 2011 from The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Biometrics and Identity Management as well as mentioned in the The National Biometrics Challenge 2011 (available at:  http://www.biometrics.gov/Documents/BiometricsChallenge2011_protected.pdf).  Additionally, the results were presented Biometric Consortium Conference 2011 (http://www.biometrics.org/bc2011/ ).
