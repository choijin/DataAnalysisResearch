<AbstractNarration>This proposal will support participants from the US to a workshop in Autrans, France, during the period March 20-25, 2011.  The workshop is part of an ongoing effort to advance the understanding of representation varieties from the analytic, topological and dynamical viewpoints, and to  probe more deeply their relationship to other branches of mathematics and mathematical physics. The central themes of the conference are  moduli of representations and higher Teichmueller theory, but other topics include problems in quantization, probability, hyperbolic geometry, and geometric analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will bring together leading researchers from around the world. The workshop will provide a combination of introductory talks on important subjects related to the main themes, as well as more specialized research talks on the latest developments. Graduate students and postdocs especially will benefit from the introductory lecture series and the opportunity to interact with mathematicians in the field. The subject area of the conference, the geometry and topology of moduli spaces, is an extremely active field that continues to play a central role in current mathematics research. It has also attracted many new Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers. The workshop is an opportunity for this diverse group of mathematicians working in related fields to interact, share ideas, begin new collaborations, and advance the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This grant was used to support two international conferences that took place in March 2011 and January 2012 in Autrans, France.  The meetings gathered mathematicians  from dozens of countries with a common interest in the geometrical and algebraic aspects of surfaces and their deformations.  The 2011 meeting was primarily directed at current advances in research. It consisted of 19 seminars by researchers from the US and Europe. The second meeting was an introductory school for participants in the trimester program at the Institute Henri Poincare in Paris from January to March 2012.  This week long event consisted of four lecture series designed to introduce graduate students and young researchers to the field.  The topics discussed at both of these meetings have broad ramifications not only in pure mathematics but also in theoretical physics, properties of materials, dynamics and combinatorics.  The second meeting was especially designed with a  format conducive to training young mathematicians working in this area.  Most of these participants were graduate students at US institutions who are currently or will soon finish their Ph.D. programs and enter the workforce.  In addition to funding from the National Science Foundation, support was also provided by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche in France and by the European Research Council.  This  was a fruitful combination of resources that greatly enhanced international participation in this event.
