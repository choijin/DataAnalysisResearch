<AbstractNarration>The University of Kansas has been awarded a grant to populate a specimen-level database of the world's bee species present in their research collection, one of the largest and most comprehensive in the world.  The project will capture data from 201,668 specimens of bees representing all regions of the world, bringing the database's total coverage to 379,071 individual records for about 9725 species, or nearly 50% of the world's known diversity.  Each specimen will be georeferenced with precise latitude and longitude coordinates for each collecting event.  Once completed, the data will be freely accessible over the internet.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bees are the most critical pollinators of both natural and agricultural ecosystems, underpinning the integrity of biodiversity, global food webs, and human health and security.  These data will become readily available for research in ecology, conservation biology, biogeography, biodiversity informatics, and resource management.  In addition, these data will be available for policy makers and educating the public about biodiversity and conservation issues, as well as the fundamentals of native pollinator distributions.  This project will also help train the next generation of biodiversity scientists in the latest bioinformatic tools and research collection curatorial methods and standards.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the preeminent pollinators of natural and agricultural ecosystems throughout the world, native bees are vital toward building sustainable practices, encouraging economic development, supporting human health, and providing for security over natural resources.  Despite the paramount importance of bees to nature and society, there are limited data accessible for understanding individual bee species as the vast stores of such data are resident in museum specimens.  To remedy the availability of data on bees, the University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute's Division of Entomology has built a specimen-level, georeferenced database of its worldwide biological research collection of bees, and made these data fully accessible via the internet (http://collections.biodiversity.ku.edu/SEMC/).  Of the worldÆs approximately 20,000 known species, the database encompasses 12,873 (ca. 65%) of those species and represents the single most comprehensive source of biodiversity data for bees globally.  Presently comprising 423,385 individual records (about 50,000 specimens more than initially projected), 40,039 globally-distributed localities, and 64,699 unique collecting events, these data are now available for use in studies of pollination biology, conservation, ecological and evolutionary processes, changing species distributions, plant-insect interactions, human-bee cultural associations, and agricultural development, among many other endeavors relating to the broader interaction of bees with society and the environment.  Already these data have been used in studies of ecological niche modeling for bees to understand their potential distributions, as well as for supporting systematic and taxonomic research on bees.  These data are now also available for policy makers and general educational efforts relating to native pollinators, biodiversity conservation, the impacts of climate change, and plant-insect interactions &ndash; particularly critical topics as many of our bee pollinators are in decline, threatening human agriculture and health.  In total 5 graduate students and 20 undergraduate students participated in the project and learned about biological resource management, curation, bioinformatics, fundamentals of bee biology and pollination, and biodiversity research.
