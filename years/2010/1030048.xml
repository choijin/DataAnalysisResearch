<AbstractNarration>This research objectives of this award are (1) to develop environmentally benign strategies for the fabrication of coherent nanocomposite film electrodes consisting of pseudocrystalline transition metal oxides or transition metal phosphates uniformly coated with nano carbon, (2) to study film electrodes with electroactive materials away from thermodynamic equilibrium for much higher energy storage capacity with high power density, and (3) to achieve a better fundamental understanding of the dependence of crystallinity, nanostructures, and energy storage performance on the fabrication methods and parameters. Specific approaches include the deposition of homogeneous organic-inorganic nanocomposite films through water electrolysis induced co-precipitation or electrophoretic deposition, and the formation of coherent nanocomposite films consisting of pseudocrystalline electroactive materials uniformly coated with nano carbon through controlled pyrolysis and partial crystallization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will lead to the development of large-scale fabrication methods for coherent porous nanocomposite films readily available for thin film lithium-ion battery manufacturing, and the synthesis of film electrodes with greatly enhanced energy storage density and specific power as well as cyclic stability. This research will have impacts beyond the electrical energy storage materials, as the manufacturing methods can be directly applied in the fabrication of various organic-inorganic nanocomposite or hybrid films for other applications including, but not limited to, corrosion protection or wear resistant coatings, porous films for sensors, and catalysis. This research will greatly benefit both graduate and undergraduate students through introducing and attracting them to the field of sustainable clean energy materials and novel manufacturing strategies, and through fostering a positive culture among them that accepts, respects, and tolerates differences of others.</AbstractNarration>
