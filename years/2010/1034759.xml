<AbstractNarration>1034759 &lt;br/&gt;Aneja &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a U.S.-India workshop on air quality entitled Collaborative Science, Research, and Education in Air Quality Measurements, Modeling and Analysis.  The co-organizers are Professors Viney Aneja, North Carolina State University (NCSU) and M.P. Singh, Chairman of Ansal Institute of Technology, Gurgaon, India.  The overarching goal is to bring together experts from the U.S. and India to identify and promote collaborative research with specific emphasis on improving the science of the current regional/global air quality modeling system being developed in the U.S.  It is anticipated that the workshop will result in major research initiatives in the U.S. that will enhance the state of science in air quality measurement and modeling.  It will also raise the awareness of open-source modeling tools among the large pool of Indian scientists.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific objectives of the workshop are to bring together US and Indian participants from academia, industry, and government to: identify the scientific challenges stemming from variability in both meteorological and emission conditions in multi-scale atmospheric photochemical models, plan for future collaborative research involving US and Indian scientists, and develop research proposals for submission to NSF and other agencies in the U.S. and India.  EPA and NOAA have offered in-kind support for this activity and the Government of India's Ministry of Earth Sciences has committed to providing financial support for senior and young scientist participants from India.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  The rapid industrialization of developing countries such as India has led to substantial increase in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Not only has this led to environmental problems within the region, potential impacts extend to a global scale. The objective of this project was to bring together experts from the U.S., India and Europe with a common vision for identifying priority areas of research and development in the air quality-climate arena, and a commitment to sustaining long-term Indo-U.S. collaboration.      Major accomplishments  1. The "U.S.-India International Workshop on Air Quality: Collaborative Science, Research, and Education in Air Quality Measurements, Modeling and Analysis" was organized by a team of atmospheric scientists from North Carolina State University (NCSU), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The workshop, which was Phase I of a two-phase collaboration, was convened at the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), in Hyderabad, India, during March 14-24, 2011. The workshop included invited lectures and presentations by Indian, American, European, and other overseas scientific experts in the field, and provided an opportunity to share information and discuss the key scientific issues and challenges to addressing IndiaÆs air quality needs. About 250 participants from six countries attended the workshop.      2. Hands-on operational training on the use of a publicly available air quality modeling system (Figure 1) consisting of the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) processing system (Houyoux et al., 2000), the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (Skamarock et al., 2008), and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model (Byun and Schere, 2006), preceded by a detailed overview of the atmospheric chemistry and physics involved in their formulations.     3. The workshop provided an improved understanding of the air quality science underlying the regional- to global-scale air quality and climate issues of relevance to public health and the environment in Southeast Asia. The discussions and presentations provided insights into the prevailing meteorological patterns and chemical regimes, and the model formulations required to capture their characteristics to reliably assess air quality in the region. Emission source information as well as insights on regional circulations provided by Indian participants greatly contributed to the knowledge gained and disseminated through the workshop.      4. A prioritized list of research areas and a concrete road map for collaborative research endeavors was created.      5. The details of the worshop and priority areas are presented in the following paper:  Aneja, V.P., A. Aiyyer, A. Hanna, U. Shankar, Z. Adelman, S. Arunachalam, S. T. Rao, R. Mathur, J. D. Mobley, R. Artz, D. Byun, V. Ramaswamy, V. Murali Krishna, Valli Manickam, M.P. Singh, J. Biswas and E. Upadhyay. 2012. "U.S. &ndash; India Collaboration on Air Quality and Climate Research and Education", EM: Air and Waste Management Association's Magazine for Environmental Managers&thinsp;2012(MARCH):30-36.     Continuing Collaborative Effort  One of the major objectives of this project was to establish close collaboration among US and Indian scientists to create new research and development programs. To that end, the NCSU and UNC scientists have developed a comprehensive research proposal that was submitted to NSF.    A parallel effort (resulting from the NSF funded workshop) has also been undertaken wherein nine leading institutions in India have come together with a common goal of exploring Air Quality-Climate research. The US scientists have assisted the Indian counterparts in developing this comprehensive proposal. The proposal is ready for submission (mid November 2012) for funding to the India Ministry of Earth Sciences.
