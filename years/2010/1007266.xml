<AbstractNarration>This research program focuses on several interconnected geometric themes of complex and real low-dimensional dynamics. It includes polynomial dynamics on the Riemann sphere and the interval, dynamics in the real and complex Henon family, dynamics in some special families of rational endomorphisms of projective space coming from statistical physics, and the geometry of associated Riemann surfaces and hyperbolic laminations. Most of these themes are unified by the idea of renormalization as a powerful tool for penetrating into the small-scale structure of dynamical objects, aimed towards a complete classification of these objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in deeper insights into small-scale structure of dynamical systems, a subject that furnishes a key to the understanding of many of the most basic processes in nature, the fundamental objects of study in science and engineering. It will include the training of highly qualified graduate students and postdocs, who will apply their skills in diverse ways and venues: in academia and industry, in the creation broader interactions between experts in various branches of real and complex dynamics and statistical physics, and in promoting efficient communication within the field of dynamical systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Theory of Dynamical systems (with discrete time) studies the long-term behavior  of trajectories described by a certain iteration procedure,  and the way this phase  portrait depends on the parameters of the system.  Very interesting fractal objects   (like Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set) may appear as phase and parameter  diagrams for such systems.In the project, we have focused on complex  low-dimensional dynamical systems described by simple quadratic equations.   Despite simplicity of the description, these systems are known to display  complicated chaotic behavior serving as a good model for various phenomena that  appear in celestial mechanics, fluid dynamics, biology, and other branches of  natural science.   An important outcome of our research is a construction of a substantial set of  parameters for which a complex one-dimensional quadratic map has the Julia set  of positive area,  which makes a chaotic phenomenon observable. The construction  is based upon several Renormalization Theories that allow us to control a  small scale structure of fractal objects.     We have also given a complete description of the dynamics on periodic Fatou  components for dissipative complex Henon maps.  Such a description was  classically known in complex dimension one, but it is the first occasion when  it became available in dimension two.   In the parameter plane, we have demonstrated that instability of dissipative complex Henon maps is always  caused by the homoclinic phenomenon, when the stable and unstable behavior are mixed up.  It is the first advance in a complex version of a well-known  Palis Conjecture formulated 20 years ago.            Last Modified: 08/14/2015       Submitted by: Mikhail Lyubich]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
