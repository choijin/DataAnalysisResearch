<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the 30th meeting in the series of Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conferences on Differential Equations (SEARCDE), held 1-2 October 2010 at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students and recent Ph.D. recipients. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting includes plenary lectures on topics of current research interest and also especially encourages lectures by students and recent Ph.D. recipients. The conference brings together workers in a variety of different areas of research in differential equations, with emphasis on providing opportunities for new researchers to present their work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://www.icam.vt.edu/SEARCDE 2010/</AbstractNarration>

It was initiated by members of the Department of Mathematics at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and has since then rotated among the research institutions in the southeast. The thirtieth SEARCDE conference was held at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, on October 1-2, 2010.  The conference was very well  attended with 140 registrants. There were 90 regular 20 minute talks as well as three 50 minute plenary presentations.  Due to generous financial support from the  National Science  Foundation 43  graduate and undergraduate students and young researchers  received travel support.  A wide range of topics, including ordinary and partial differential equations, dynamical systems, integral and functional equations, numerical methods, inverse  problems, differential geometry, control theory, and applications to biology, finance, engineering and the sciences in general were covered.    The conference was  advertised  to departments and interested  parties in the wider South Eastern region and we received interest from a  large group of young researchers, including undergraduates. We were  able to support all the young researchers that requested funding.  In  awarding support, preference was  given to beginning researchers who was  presenting their research at the conference and women and minority  participants were especially encouraged to apply for support.  Plenary speakers   Susanne C.  Brenner (Louisiana State University)   Finite Element Methods for the Monge-Ampere Equation:      In this talk we will discuss new finite element methods for the fully nonlinear Monge-Ampere equation. These methods are derived by a novel approach that provides a natural fixed-point analysis for the discrete problems. This is joint work with Thirupathi Gudi, Michael Neilan and Li-yeng Sung.    Alun Lloyd (North Carolina State University)    Demographic Stochasticity: Quantifying Variability Using Moment Equations:  Many biological systems are subject to demographic stochasticity: random effects that arise because a population is made up of a finite number of individuals (people, animals, molecules, etc). Deterministic models describe the average behavior of the system, but individual trajectories fluctuate around the average. In many contexts, these fluctuations have an important impact on dynamics, so we often need to quantify their magnitude.
