<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is provide critical experimental data and assessment tools essential for evaluating the integrity of common steel gravity load resisting systems.  A combination of system testing and component testing will be used to assess the behavior of these systems as designed today.  These experimental results will then be used to advance models for the analysis of such systems under large deformations and to identify critical details that have a major impact on system performance.  Cost-effective details that transform performance will be developed and tested at the component level and then incorporated in system tests. At the component level, steel connections will be tested under combined rotation and tension loading, and important details of the slab on deck system, such as lap splices, beam anchorage, and the tensile behavior of the slabs on metal decks in orthogonal directions will be tested. System tests will involve large-scale push-down tests of gravity frame systems using current practice details and new concepts developed in this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will directly impact the safety of almost all steel buildings by assessing the integrity of ubiquitous structural components and developing models for engineers to employ.  It will also develop transformative solutions for improving the robustness of common gravity frame components and systems.  Through close collaboration with the American Institute of Steel Construction, expedient dissemination and rapid implementation will be facilitated.  Graduate students will be directly trained through this research as they address the challenges associated with unanticipated structural loadings. Interest and diversity in engineering will be enhanced through partnerships with the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program at Purdue, the Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP) at Illinois and the Seattle Mathematics Engineering Science and Achievement Program (Seattle MESA) at Washington. These programs will provide for undergraduate (SURF and SROP) and high school (MESA) research internships.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Composite floor systems are used extensively in steel-framed buildings for transferring gravity loads to the columns, and they are an integral part of the entire building.  A typical steel gravity framing system comprises a composite concrete slab and steel deck on steel beams and girders with simple shear connections.  Although steel gravity framing systems are efficient and their behavior is well understood under typical loading conditions, their response to extreme loading conditions requires further study.  In particular, there is a need for more detailed understanding of how steel gravity framing systems contribute to structural integrity and the development of alternate load paths after severe localized structural damage, such as a column loss.  Typical design assumptions lead to the conclusion that steel gravity framing systems have little capacity for bridging over localized damage, but empirical evidence and recent research indicate that they may actually play a larger role in redistributing loads and preventing collapse after an extreme event.  This collaborative research project &ndash; involving the University of Illinois, the University of Washington and Purdue University &ndash; fills critical knowledge gaps regarding the structural integrity of steel gravity framing systems through an integrated experimental program on both component and system behavior.  At the University of Illinois, the research focused on design, fabrication, construction and testing of a large-scale multi-bay steel gravity framing system.  The testing program evaluated four column loss scenarios, which represent idealized extreme events that would cause severe localized structural damage and require alternative load paths to develop for collapse to be arrested.  These tests demonstrated that although typical steel gravity framing systems are not specifically designed to prevent collapse under extreme loading scenarios, they possess integrity and reserve capacity that can contribute to collapse prevention.  The composite slab in particular was found to be a critical part of the load transfer mechanisms that were observed.  However, the experimental results developed through this research indicate that design enhancements may be necessary to increase the integrity and reserve capacity of steel gravity framing systems so that they will not collapse under the extreme event load combination currently used in design.  The intellectual merit of this research is evident in two key areas: 1) the new experimental results provide direct insight into behavior of a large-scale composite floor system and are a resource for engineers seeking to design for progressive collapse resistance, and 2) the experimental results provide valuable data for use in future research, since numerical models can be validated against these results and then the models can be used to perform extensive parametric studies that explore a much broader range of variables, which could not be feasibly considered in the experimental program.  The broader impacts of this research are: 1) the contribution to collapse prevention and safety in steel buildings subjected to extreme loads, and 2) education of student researchers.  The project positively impacted two graduate student researchers who are now employed at leading structural engineering consulting firms doing work in forensic engineering and design for resisting blast loads and progressive collapse.  In addition, undergraduate student researchers who participated in the project are now in graduate school for structural engineering.
