<AbstractNarration>This grant supports travel by doctoral students to the Doctoral Symposium at the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE). ICSE is the flagship conference for the area of Software Engineering, providing a forum for researchers, practitioners, and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, experiences, and concerns in the field of Software Engineering. The Doctoral Symposium at ICSE provides a venue for young researchers to access worldwide expertise in Software Engineering.  The Symposium provides a forum for Ph.D. students to present and discuss their research goals, methods, and results at an early stage in their research. The Symposium aims to provide useful guidance to the students from a panel of experts, for completion of the dissertation research and initiation of a research career.  The opportunity to attend one of the premier conferences in Software Engineering is intended to provide experiences that may encourage students to pursue higher degrees in computer science research.</AbstractNarration>
