<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bulk metallic glass (BMG) composites composed of Cu-Zr-Al with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have become the subject of recent interest due to their potential high ductility and low YoungÃ†s modulus.  A limiting factor for widespread use of CNTs is their inherent high Van der Waals forces typically causing agglomeration of CNTs into bundles.  Using a wet process of various surfactants in aqueous solutions has been shown to individually disperse CNTs, thereby functionalizing the CNTs to be able to bond to the metal powder surface.  An understanding of the mechanisms and underlying microstructural interactions associated with various BMG-surfactant-CNT combinations is vital to the processing and development of BMG-CNT composites via Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) with enhanced mechanical behavior.  SPS is an ideal tool for studying the fabrication of BMG-CNT composites due to its ability to quickly consolidate powders using uniaxial pressure along with a DC current.  The use of electric current has been found to allow for lower temperature consolidation and densification and has been rationalized to occur through the break up surface oxides on powders by generating a spark and/or plasma  Apparent improvements in mechanical behavior was also achieved with an average increase in Vickers hardness values with an of ~4% and ~8% with composites containing 0.1 wt% and 0.5 wt%, respectively. The relatively small improvements in Vickers hardness is mostly due to low density, with the highest being ~93% theoretical. Further processing such as warm extrusion is expected to improve these values dramatically.  I have been granted a fellowship by the International Collaboration Center at the Institute for Materials Research at Tohoku University to return in order to complete this research topic with the hope of producing a manuscript in the very near future.
